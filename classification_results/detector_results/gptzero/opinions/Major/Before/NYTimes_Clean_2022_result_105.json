            "inputText": "A 22-year-old woman fears losing control over her body, and an 80-year-old recalls her illegal abortion. Also: Russian oligarchs’ property; Pelosi in Kyiv.To the Editor:Re “Draft Abortion Ruling Signals Seismic Political Shift” (front page, May 4):I’m 22 years old and I’m starting to get used to the seismic shifts in American politics and society. I knew that the Supreme Court would gut or overturn Roe, but even so, reading Justice Samuel Alito’s draft opinion provoked a deep fear that I had not anticipated.The leaked opinion is not the final draft, but it clearly signals that this 50-year era of imperfect reproductive freedom has ended. There will be nothing to stop a state from enacting an all-out ban.As I watch the world around me change and convulse in the face of climate change, Trumpism, a global pandemic and everything else that seems to be going downhill, I need to be able to control my body. I can’t imagine choosing to bring a child into this world, and am appalled by the idea of being forced to carry and raise a child that I didn’t plan for and that I have no idea how to raise.I am scared.Maggie ShieldsFlagstaff, Ariz.To the Editor:An “egregious breach” of trust.Chief Justice John Roberts was referring to the leak of the draft ruling on the right to abortion. The irony of his remark, though, is that it so aptly describes the deceptions of conservative members of the current Supreme Court who, during theirnomination hearings,either obfuscated their intentions to rule against abortion or asserted that they viewed Roe v. Wade as precedent or established law. And yet, at least five of them will likely join this ruling.They lied to the U.S. Senate and the American people. That is an egregious breach of trust.Mary HendersonRiverside, Conn.To the Editor:I am a proud pro-life Democrat who has long supported overturning Roe v. Wade. Since the Roe decision, over63 million abortionshave been performed in our nation, a deeply troubling statistic that is tantamount to infanticide.The “my body, my choice” mantra is a selfish one. A child is a blessing and life is precious. Ours is a civilized society, and we should be protecting life, not wantonly stamping it out on demand.Michael MayoSt. Petersburg, Fla.To the Editor:While the Supreme Court’s repeal of abortion rights isn’t official, it is likely, so it’s time to plan and act. That means that progressive foundations, nonprofits, corporations, individuals and others should be prepared to cover the travel, lodging and procedure costs of women going to other states for abortions if their own state bans them. It means that we should actively protect such women’s identities and privacy.When elections take place this year, support only those candidates who are in favor of abortion rights, and campaign hard against those who aren’t.Bill DingfelderPhiladelphiaTo the Editor:They can make any law they want to make, but they can’t make any woman have a baby she doesn’t want to have. My husband and I got married in 1962. I was 20. In 1963 our birth control failed.We had a friend who was a veterinarian. I climbed on the dog table, my husband held my hand, and the vet stuck something in me that caused bleeding that turned to hemorrhaging. So we went to the E.R.I was lucky. I survived. Today I’m 80 years old, a mother and a grandmother. We can’t go back.Barbara RussakovAnaheim Hills, Calif.To the Editor:If Roe v. Wade is overturned and approximately half the states ban abortion, I assume these same states also plan to raise taxes substantially so that they can provide proper support to all the children they have fought hard to bring into the world. Presumably they will begin offering universal child care and preschool and free community college.These states are also, doubtless, taking steps to ensure that every man who fathers a child is held financially responsible for it. Get ready to be billed, fellas.Phoebe MillerwhiteClaremont, Calif.To the Editor:Conservatives often say that no right to an abortion, contraception or gay marriage exists in the Constitution. But the Ninth Amendment says: “The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.”Mark WestonSarasota, Fla.Seizing Russian Oligarchs’ PropertyTo the Editor:President Biden’sexpressed intent to seize and sell the private property of Russian oligarchsto help Ukraine would be a mistake. Although those assets may have been acquired illegally or be on loan from Vladimir Putin, Mr. Biden’s plan ignores the legal principle that private property must not be taken without due process.This goes against international practices and our own, and our nation should be a defender of that principle. It also avoids encouraging other governments’ future seizures of American and other foreign properties within their grasp.The Biden presidency has many accomplishments, and its goal of further helping Ukraine defend itself deserves our praise and strong support. We are reluctant to see that record tarnished by a well-intended misstep.Judith PachtH. Kenneth FisherLos AngelesPelosi’s Visit to KyivTo the Editor:Re “Pelosi Visits Kyiv, Echoing U.S. Vow of Wide ‘Victory’” (front page, May 2): Can someone give me one good reason why the speaker of the House traveled to Kyiv to meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky?Couldn’t the money that was used to fly her and her delegation over to this war-torn country be used for better purposes, such as humanitarian relief? What good or what difference will come about because Nancy Pelosi visited Ukraine?Lisa ScullyGlen Cove, N.Y.PHOTO: Demonstrators outside the Supreme Court early Tuesday after a draft of the majority opinion overruling Roe v.
