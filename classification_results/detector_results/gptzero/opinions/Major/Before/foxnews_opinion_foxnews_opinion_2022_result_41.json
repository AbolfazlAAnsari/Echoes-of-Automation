Anton Kolumbet of Ukraineâs army told the Washington Post on Thursday.Â \"The only language that Russia understands is the language of force.\"WITHOUT RONALD REAGAN, THERE WOULD BE NO VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYYAdding to that resolve, on the ground the military forecast for Ukraine is not bad.Â NATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Tod Wolters said March 29 that Ukraineâs forces learn fast and can \"inflict more stalling\" on Russia.Â He and Gen, Jacqueline von Ovost, head of U.S. Transportation Command, told Congress the Ukraine supply routes have not been hit so far, Russia hasnât disrupted Ukraineâs command and control of its forces, and even Russiaâs best tanks have \"chinks in their armor\" when Ukraine employs the right tactics.Itâs a shame Biden and NATO still have no clear strategy to help Ukraine win. On Thursday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. wants Ukraine to win. Biden has yet to declare that policy.Face it, the White House has been in reaction mode all along.Â Advisers like Gen. Mark Milley said in February that Kyiv could fall in five days. Thatâs why Team Biden evacuated the U.S. embassy and infamously offered Zelenskyy a ride out of his own country.Sadly, White House fear of Russian escalation is stifling development of a new strategy for the next phase of the war.Team Bidenâs plan was to stick with sanctions and the campaign of canny, anti-Russia intelligence leaks on false flags, the plan to catch Zelenskyy, protest letters to Putin, and this weekâs entries, the claims that Russian soldiers are sabotaging their own weapons while defense officials arenât telling Putin heâs losing the war.All thatâs fine, but itâs kept Team Biden from intensifying military assistance to help Ukraine win the war.Â That means improved air defenses, faster munitions delivery, and probably some tactical coaching and surveillance help, too.Sadly, White House fear of Russian escalation is stifling development of a new strategy for the next phase of the war.Â Remember Biden is all emotions and no statesmanship.Then there is Putin.Â His plan to topple Zelenskyy and break up Ukraine into puppet \"Peopleâs Republics\" failed.Â Unfortunately, Putin still has over 150,000 forces in Ukraine and several vicious options to continue the war.Russia can bomb Ukraineâs cities for a long time to pressure Zelenskyy. The Pentagon says they have the \"vast majority\" of their bomb and missile inventory still intact.Â Already Russia is flying 300 sorties per day against Ukraine, up 50% from two weeks ago.Of course, Putin could escalate with terror weapons. But I think that from a military perspective, the risks of Russian escalation are going down, not up. NATO has more forces ready to react if Russia strikes west.Â As Russia moves the fight east, Putin canât easily use nuclear weapons there; the radiation will blow back into Russia.Â Crude chemical weapons, such as the barrel-bomb attacks seen in Syria, wonât yield tactical results.Watch for Russia to ramp up the ground war.Â Russian spokesmen said they will focus on the Donbas.Â Russia may still be hampered by the stodgy command and control that slowed its Kyiv advance but fighting near its own borders could reduce logistics problems.Â Mercenaries from the Wagner Group will join other Russian reinforcements. Donât forget there are actual trenches in parts of the Donbass.The best way to bring peace is through Ukraineâs defeat of Russia on the battlefield.Â It canât be done without more of Americaâs help.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REBECCA GRANTDr. Rebecca Grant is vice president of the Lexington Institute."
