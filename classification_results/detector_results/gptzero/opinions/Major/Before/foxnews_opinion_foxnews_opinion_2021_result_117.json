It’s always concerned me that we give are giving the same vaccine dose and short interval between doses to a thin 12-year old girl that we give to an overweight 50-year old man.In addition, If a child had COVID illness and recovered, I do not recommend vaccinating the child because of natural immunity. The exception is children who are immunosuppressed or have a special circumstance.Vaccines do reduce hospitalizations among children by approximately 90 percent.  That’s why Irecommendvaccination of children without natural immunity. But not with the current regimen.The complication of heart inflammation after vaccination has been associated with the second dose in particular. These complications have not been adequately studied in my opinion.For adolescents, I recommend they get a single mRNA vaccine dose for now until the heart complications are better understood.  They may be avoidable.One dose was 100 percent effective in an Israeli study of children 12-15 years of age, suggesting a strategy that can protect children from both COVID and the heart complications associated with the second dose.Let’s come togetherVaccinate requirements that are flexible and consider natural immunity are reasonable for essential workers, such as health care workers and teachers. But we should allow people to tailor these recommendations with their physicians.President Biden has rallied around the term ‘a pandemic of the unvaccinated’ but the more precise term is ‘a pandemic of the non-immune.’It’s those without any immunity who are the ones dying in U.S. hospitals right now and it’s that group where we should all come together to strongly encourage vaccination.Author's note: Comments above represent opinions and do not constitute medical advice.
