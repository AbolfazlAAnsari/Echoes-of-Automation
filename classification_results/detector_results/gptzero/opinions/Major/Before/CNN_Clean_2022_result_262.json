A few weeks ago, a bipartisan coalition reached anagreementon reforming the Electoral Count Act of 1887 and is working on text for legislation.The reforms would clarify and restrict the role that the vice president plays in theprocess of counting the Electoral College votesand make it more difficult for there to be a challenge of a state's slate of electors. Of all the reforms, this one stands the best chance of passing, and the January 6 committee's work might provide the public support for doing so.Reforming the Electoral Count Act must be only a first step, however. The crisis of the 2020 presidential election also reveals thebroader riskstovoting rights,since many state legislatures have used the lie that there was widespread fraud to introduce more voting restrictions.Even though claims of massive voting fraud have been debunked on numerous occasions -- with high-level Trump officials, such as former US Attorney General William Barr,making the point on video-- this has remained a centerpiece of efforts in red states to undermine the legacy of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.The push to enact the For the People Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act failed due to a combination of Republican resistance and the refusal of Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema'srefusal to carve the legislation out of the filibuster rules. Legislation to strengthen voting rights protection is essential as many red states ramp up their efforts to make it more difficult to vote.Finally, other reforms merit discussion. During the earlier phases of the January 6 committee meetings, there was some talk about reforming the Insurrection Act of 1807to raise the bar for presidents to deploy troops at home and clarify the circumstances in which it could be invoked.As Americans gather to celebrate July 4, they should take a break from the beer and hot dogs to think about the state of our democracy. Being patriotic requires every citizen to devote attention and energy to making certain that our cherished institutions are working.The January 6 hearings are revealing once again that they are not. It was too easy for the former administration to do what it did, and it's clear how the events of January 6 could have ended in a different way.If it wasn't already apparent, the risks to our democracy have been laid bare by the January 6 committee.
