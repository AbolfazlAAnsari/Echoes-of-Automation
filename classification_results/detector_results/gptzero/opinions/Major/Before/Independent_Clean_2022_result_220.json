A man who has visibly aged decades in a few short months. The lines etched into his face show the strain he has been under as he shows the commitment to and passion for his country. He has shouldered the responsibility for the defence of his people.Then I turn and look at the wasters running this country and despair.Bernard CuddMorpethA successful country needs to be part of the bigger pictureI read Sadiq Khan’s column (We must recapture the spirit of the London 2012 Olympics, 1 August) with interest and agreement and of course with the stupendous win at Wembley by the Lionesses, this spirit has been set alight again and that feeling of unity and innate positivity, which unites us all. But I know where he is coming from, Danny Boyle’s opening ceremony was indeed a work of genius, because it celebrated diversity and history with such brio and empathy of our own unique spirit. It was indeed emblematic of a modern facing country, safe in its identity but willing and able to be a significant player in the outside world.This dream though has now been corrupted by this government into a pseudo, populist nightmare with its strident, strutting on the world’s stage and picking fights with all and sundry. We do all need to come together, wherever we live and be rightfully proud of our unique diversity and individuality. Of course we want every city and town in Britain to succeed and succeed well and as he states London with its own multi-culturalism should be the capital, we are all proud of.The emphasis needs to change and the government with its two putative leadership candidates and its rhetoric on telling Europe where to get off, is counter productive and inevitably self-defeating. A successful country doesn’t need to gratuitously big itself up at every opportunity but show some humility and willingness to be part of the bigger picture, with grace and tolerance.Judith A.
