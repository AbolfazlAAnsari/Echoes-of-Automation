            "inputText": "In this expensive holiday season, many families are finding their budgets stretched thin. With industrial prices up almost a whopping 15 per cent so far this year and wages rising because of labour shortages, businesses will be pressed to raise consumer prices further to make up for shrinking margins.There is only one sector of the economy that gets a holiday gift from inflation. You guessed it, the government. As shown in last week's federal economic and fiscal update, a one percentage point increase in the inflation rate pushes up federal revenues by $3.9 billion annually. With the GDP deflator rising 7.6 per cent in fiscal year 2021/22, that means the federal government is pocketing an extra $30 billion in revenue from taxpayers. Call that an \"inflation dividend\" - for the government, not for us.Overall, federal revenues are expected to rise $54 billion by next March 31, reflecting both inflation and increased employment and industrial activity. Personal income tax brackets and credits are indexed for inflation but not capital gains or net investment income (i.e., dividends, rents, royalties, etc., less debt interest expense). So, when savers get a bit more money from their investments to make up for the loss in the purchasing power of their money, the government gladly taxes it!Corporate profits aren't indexed for inflation, either. Book profits get exaggerated since companies report depreciation, inventory costs and net interest income based on historical costs rather than current values. (By contrast, if net interest is negative, which is the normal situation with corporate leverage, then inflation benefits companies: borrowers usually gain from inflation. On balance, however, book profits are overstated when there is inflation.) The profits of federal crown corporations have also swung upwards - by $19 billion, accounting for over a third of the increase in Ottawa's revenues this year. Part of that increase is due to inflation, as well.As for the government's expenses, some automatically rise with inflation, but others don't. Many payments are indexed, such as for elder and child benefits. Others are indexed to nominal GDP, like the Canada Health Transfer and the aggregate of equalization payments paid to the provinces.Otherwise, however, the government's expenses may not rise as much as inflation. Most public employee salaries are not indexed for inflation. While cost-of-living adjustments in contracts were common four decades ago, they cover less than a tenth of employees today. Some payments to provincial governments,such as the Canada Social Transfer, are indexed at a fixed rate (e.g., three per cent) that is now below inflation. Infrastructure costs are ballooning, which will reduce real spending unless the budgets for them are boosted.Despite most social benefits being indexed, inflation hurts those Canadians who lose benefits that are clawed back when their nominal incomes rise above a threshold level (even if the threshold itself is indexed). For example, low-income seniors might receive indexed CPP benefits. But a senior will lose 50 cents in Guaranteed Income Supplement with each dollar increase in their CPP benefits once their income exceeds $15,672. Talk about giving with one hand and taking away with the other!Jack M. Mintz: Five reasons why inflation will persist(https://financialpost.com/opinion/jack-m-mintz-five-reasons-why-inflation-will-persist)Jack M. Mintz: 'Tax the rich' won't work(https://financialpost.com/opinion/jack-m-mintz-tax-the-rich-wont-work)Jack M. Mintz: Who is Fed chair does matter(https://financialpost.com/opinion/jack-m-mintz-who-is-fed-chair-does-matter)Old Age Security payments are also clawed back at 15 cents on the dollar above $81,761 so any inflated income will be taxed by the government. If average investors squeeze out a bit more capital gains, dividends and interest income to make up for inflation, they could end up being taxed at rates close to 50 per cent, taking into account both personal taxes and OAS clawbacks. That hurts.Same with child benefits. They are clawed back seven cents on the dollar above $32,028 in family income. So, if a worker with a salary of $60,000 gets a $1,000 end-of-year bonus that helps make up for higher living costs, 37 per cent is lost to personal taxes and the child benefit clawback.Putting this all together, Finance Canada estimates that a one-point increase in the GDP deflator increases federal spending by $2.2 billion annually, which is $1.7 billion less than the revenue bump-up. This year's GDP deflator of 7.6 per cent therefore gives the federal government an additional $13 billion in budgetary wiggle room.But by far the biggest part of Ottawa's inflation dividend is the reduction in the real cost of its debt. Unlike households and businesses, which generally have more assets than debt, government is a big net debtor. So, inflation results in a huge transfer of wealth from households and businesses to the public sector. With net federal debt at $1.2 trillion dollars and consumer price inflation running at 4.7 per cent, that transfer is equal to a whopping $56 billion. If instead interest rates were raised to compensate investors' losses to inflation, next year's federal deficit would not be the $144 billion predicted in the fiscal update but $200 billion.Add it up: $56 billion in real debt relief and $13 billion in budget gains from inflation. The total federal inflation dividend is $69 billion in 2021. The budget doesn't do inflation accounting. But it should. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved."
