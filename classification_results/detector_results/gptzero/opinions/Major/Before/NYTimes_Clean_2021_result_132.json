People still flocked to America’s singular places: Yosemite, Glacier, Grand Canyon, Yellowstone.The National Park Service’s core mission is balancing preservation and access. For its first century, the agency swung hard toward access, successfully promoting the national parks as central to American identity.Between the agency’s spectacularly successful#FindYourPark2016 centennial campaign and travel limitations imposed by Covid-19, it’s no surprise that visits have again skyrocketed.What’s needed is a multipronged approach, one that balances limiting access with adding more desirable sites, fully funding existing parks, and publicizing places that may not carry the national park label but are equally spectacular and unique. It’s a monumental task.Lauren DannerOlympia, Wash.The writer is the author of “Crown Jewel Wilderness: Creating North Cascades National Park.”Biden’s Vaccination MandatesTo the Editor:Re “Biden Issues Sweeping Mandates for Shots” (front page, Sept. 10):I am no fan of government encroachment upon the private sector. However, President Biden’s announcement about authorizing vaccine mandates across business and government institutions was spot on. Enough is enough.Despite being vaccinated as well as living in a state where Covid cases are low, my wife, 2-year-old son and I all recently contracted the virus. My son, who cannot be vaccinated, experienced severe diarrhea and frequent vomiting.Since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020, we have been as careful as one could be — wiping down groceries, masking, no indoor venues, etc. With all that, we still got sick. Fortunately, my family members have completely recovered. Unfortunately, even after three weeks, I continue to have a severe cough.The virus is real. It is lethal. It is dangerous. Mr. Biden is arguing that the 80 million who are eligible but remain unvaccinated have no right to endanger the health of the majority, or for that matter their children.He is 100 percent right.Laurence JurdemDarien, Conn.Letting Our Children GoTo the Editor:Re “My Daughter Is Not Mine to Own” (Opinion guest essay, Sept. 6):Reading Kelly Corrigan’s article, I was transported back 20 years in an instant to when I sent my second and last child off to college. Brokenhearted (for myself; not my son, he was thrilled), I was sitting on the floor of his empty room and crying when my husband came in.“They don’t come from us, you know,” he said. “They come through us, and it’s his time to go.” I’ve thought a lot about that over the next 20 years as I have watched my daughter and son tackle the world with brilliance, humor and humility.We don’t own them, it is true. Ms. Corrigan is right. And they don’t come from us. My husband is right (this time). As parents we can only hope that as they come through and move on they take the important lessons with them.Susan SteinbergBellerose, QueensPHOTO:    (PHOTOGRAPH BY Yann Kebbi FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
