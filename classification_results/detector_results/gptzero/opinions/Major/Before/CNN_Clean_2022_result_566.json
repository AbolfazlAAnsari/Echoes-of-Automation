And Jewish leadershave continuallypushed backwhen we see antisemitism in the public sphere.We learn from the great sage Hillel, \"If I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I'm only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?\" The power and relevance of this often-quoted teaching provides focus for all of us in these moments.We have to stand up for ourselves -- and we also must understand that the Jewish community is not alone in our fears and concerns.After we escaped from the hostage situation, I learned that American Muslimswere terrifiedthey would be associated with the hostage taker. I was thanked over and over again by Muslim friends and strangers for sharing the truth -- stressing that the gunman represented himself alone, in addition to describing all the love and support that we had received from the Muslim community throughout the years and especially in our moment of need.Jews don't have a monopoly on suffering. America's past is filled with horrors against innocent people -- from thegenocide of indigenous peoplesto chattel slavery, frominternment campstoforced sterilizations, and the list goes on. Even today, we're still struggling with the denial of rights, the denial of protections and the denial of dignity, all while hate-filled rhetoric and actions persist.I keep wondering what it will take for more of us to understand how much we need each other. \"If not now, when?\"This past year I've had an opportunity to meet many people who have experienced violence and hatred firsthand. I've shared love and hugs with people from all different backgrounds who have lost family or narrowly survived an attack. Jewish, Black, Asian, LGBTQ, Sikh, Muslim -- it doesn't matter which identity, it can, and it has happened, to all of us.In that spirit, I'm offering gratitude to everyone who has spoken out against antisemitism, including powerful statements fromPresident Joe Biden,second gentleman Doug Emhoffand so many others. It's been a particularly rough year for the Jewish community, and we need all the help we can get right now -- and into the future.In that spirit, we in the Jewish community strive to say, with honesty and integrity, we've got the backs of all who face discrimination. You matter to us. And if you're tired of being the only one to stand up for yourselves, we hear you and you can count on us.We have to care for our own, but we cannot only care for our own. If we hope to live in a world with less injustice and more understanding, less violence and more security, we all have to do better.Opinion by Charlie Cytron-WalkerTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
