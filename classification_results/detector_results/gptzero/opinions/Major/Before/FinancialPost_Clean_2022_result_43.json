A 2020 Ryerson University study revealed that, while racialized people made up 28 per cent of the population across eight major Canadian cities examined, they occupy only 10 per cent of board positions. The research exposes an even more devastating reality for Black Canadians, who account for 5.6 per cent of the population across the eight cities examined but occupy only two per cent of the board positions across the five sectors analyzed (municipal, education, hospital, voluntary and provincial).

The study cited multiple factors for the lack of inclusive participants, such as a historical lack of exposure to executive corporate culture due to bias and discrimination, the inadequacy of social networks, and the artificial barriers to entry.The current reality in senior executive positions is equally disheartening.
