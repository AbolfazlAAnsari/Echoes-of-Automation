Programs like the child tax credit, which hands out thousands of dollars per child every year and contains no work requirement, are penciled in to last only a year, but really are expected to go on forever. The difference? Roughly onetrilliondollars over the next decade.Biden’s BBB is a spending eruption akin to what might transpire if you give a teenager a credit card with no limits.Ditto the tripled Earned Income Tax Credit, which Democrats pretend will only prevail for one year, though of course they expect otherwise.The child care entitlement, sweetened ObamaCare subsidies, the pre-K plan – the price tag for all these new programs will be much higher than the figure stated in BBB.Another falsehood is that the spending will be strung out over a decade; in reality, the $5 trillion blast is front-end loaded. Americans will feel this bill’s impact right away, as prices skyrocket.All told, Biden’s BBB is a spending eruption akin to what might transpire if you give a teenager a credit card with no limits – a total lack of discipline and divorcement from reality.  Only the teenager in this picture is Bernie Sanders.Why are Democrats risking not only their political futures but also the nation’s economy for a bill conjured up by a self-styled democratic socialist? Because they owe Sanders and his followers. Without them Biden would not have won in 2020.Will BBB earn their ongoing loyalty? Doubtful. Bernie will never be satisfied.No sooner than BBB passed the House than Sanders made it clear: the bill, which he has called the most significant legislation ever, is not bold or big enough. He wants it \"strengthened,\" with higher taxes, expanded Medicare, lower prescription drug prices and more climate measures.If you give a mouse a cookie…As BBB now goes to the Senate, the more outlandish falsehoods about the bill’s true costs will be publicly aired. After all, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., wanted a CBO score that did away with what he rightly called the bill’s \"gimmicks.\" He didn’t get that.Hopefully other moderate Democrats will join the West Virgina senator and Arizona’s Kyrsten Sinema in questioning the bill’s damaging tax-and-spend provisions and whether now is the time to further dig our country into a fiscal ditch.As they cheered and clapped each other on the back for passing BBB last week, House Democrats ignored the pile-up of spending over the past two years that has driven our debt and spending to unprecedented levels. The CBO has warned that our country’s deficits will top $1 trillion every year through 2030; that ominous total does not include the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, or this current monstrosity.The Pelosi team also ignored the fact that consumers are flush, and jobs are plentiful.There will come a time when, for reasons we cannot anticipate now, the economy will need stimulus. What will we do then?But the real reason that Democrats need to hit the pause button is that we have entered an inflationary cycle which will be made worse by a bill that not only injects hundreds of billions of dollars more into the economy but also encourages more people to sit on the sidelines. Continued upward pressure on wages, evident in recent labor settlements, will feed into a worsening wage-price spiral.Historically the only way the U.S. or any other country has escaped from runaway prices is through a harsh recession. That is how the 1970s inflation surge was bought to heel; that is what we may have to endure down the road.All because Bernie Sanders allowed Joe Biden to become president. What a price to pay.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK"
