In her remarks Wednesday night she encouraged us all to vote — whether in person or via mail-in-ballots. She reminded us of that day after the election in November 2016, when hundreds of thousands of Americans took to the streets angry that Donald Trump had won, many of them who never voted because they thought Clinton had it in the bag.Clinton said: “For four years, people have said to me, ‘I didn’t realize how dangerous he was.

Vote like our lives and livelihoods are on the line, because they are.”And Clinton reminded us to fight — like the suffragists fought to give women the vote; like the recently deceased Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, who “marched and bled in Selma because that work was unfinished” as he fought against racism.Clinton gave us hope amidst our despair as a people who feel broken. Broken from the deadly coronavirus; broken from high unemployment; broken from racial injustice; and broken from division and lack of unity in our nation.Trump has turned us from the United States of America into the Divided States of America, betraying the office of president.“There’s a lot of heartbreak in America right now — and the truth is, many things were broken before the pandemic,” Clinton said. “But, as the saying goes, the world breaks everyone, and afterward, many are strong at the broken places. Joe Biden knows how to heal, unify, and lead, because he’s done all of that for his family and his country.”And Clinton reminded us of how Democratic division in 2016 cost her the White House, and more importantly deprived our country of a president so much more capable than Trump.“Joe and Kamala can win by over 3 million votes and still lose,” Clinton said. “Take it from me.”The bottom line is that Hillary Clinton is a strong, wise and capable Democrat who broke barriers and made many cracks in glass and marble ceilings. She came as close as anyone could get to becoming president without crossing the finish line.Clinton knows what it’s like to be on the ticket, to be polling well against an opponent and to lose the race for the White House. And while she will likely never become Madame President, the American people should take her advice and vote in record numbers to give us President Biden and Vice President Harris, because our nation can’t afford four more years of the disastrous leadership of the dysfunctional duo of Donald Trump and Mike Pence.
