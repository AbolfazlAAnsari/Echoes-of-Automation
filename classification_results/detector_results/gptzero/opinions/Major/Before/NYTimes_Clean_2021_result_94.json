My parents, as expected; my first husband when I was 51; my second husband seven months ago; and my sister and closest friend five years ago.I recently downsized and got rid of most of my family heirlooms and other less memorable items. The memories of the people I loved after losing so many who were so close to me are in my heart and head, not in the possessions.I shudder to think that I will compel my son and his family, who live in a small New York apartment, to go through the pain of sorting my “treasures.”So that’s my minimalist perspective in response to the idea that we should save so much.Amy GerowitzCincinnatiTo the Editor:Why not donate the items to people in need? That way, your parents’ things can live on and do some good in the world rather than exist as guilt-inducing clutter or, worse, draining your bank account with items locked in a storage unit.Audrey FineRedondo Beach, Calif.The writer is the founder of Clutter Girl L.A.How We Pay for Amazon in Quality of LifeTo the Editor:Re “The Bezos Paradox” (Sunday Review, July 4):Brad Stone writes that Amazon has generally “been good for customers, who enjoy low prices and fast delivery,” but that’s true only if people could split their customer selves from the rest of their identity.If we think of ourselves as a whole, we can see the many ways that Amazon has diminished our quality of life — starting in our neighborhoods, where its delivery vans and trucks speed down our streets (or park in the middle), leaving behind excessive packaging, and driving by stores it was causing to shutter even before the pandemic. Then there’s its failure to treat employees humanely, its relentless greed and data collection, its disdain forpaying a fair share of taxes.Far more people buy from Amazon than need to, but everyone pays for it. All driven by Jeff Bezos’s need to avoid becoming a more conventional “Day 2” company with its “stasis, followed by irrelevance, followed by excruciating, painful decline, followed by death”? Sorry, but that’s too high a price for us to pay for one man’s fear.Christina AlbersNew OrleansPHOTO:    (PHOTOGRAPH BY O.O.P.S. FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
