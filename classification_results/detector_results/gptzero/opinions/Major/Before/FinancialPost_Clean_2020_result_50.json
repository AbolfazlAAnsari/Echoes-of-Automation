            "inputText": "By Leila RafiFor me, the pandemic started just over a week before the New Year.It was on March 11, 2020, that the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. And yes, my New Year - the Persian New Year, called Nowruz - started eight days later, with the arrival of spring.Nowruz is heralded by the first moment of spring, which occurred on March 19 at 11:49 p.m. this year. (It usually occurs between the 19th and the 21st of March.) In addition to marking the beginning of spring in the Northern Hemisphere, this moment also marks the first day of the first month of Iranian calendars.Nowruz, a secular holiday, is celebrated annually by a large array of people living both inside and outside of Iran. It is a joyous occasion when people gather together, and young people call and visit their elders. My parents and I celebrate it each year and on occasion have travelled to the U.S. to spend it with extended family.I always laugh on Nowruz because every year, without fail and irrespective of me explaining the holiday to friends who do not share the same culture, most people send a \"Happy New Year\" text or email at midnight, though the time of Nowruz changes each year as it mirrors the first moment of spring. It is a challenge to wrap your head around New Year not being at the stroke of midnight!Those who observe Nowruz engage in certain traditions including setting up a table with seven things that begin with the letter \"S\" in Farsi (the Persian language) and include vinegar, apple, garlic, sumac and sabze (which is wheat, barley, mung bean or lentil sprouts grown in a dish). The table on which such items are placed may also include a mirror, painted eggs, goldfish and other items that typically signify the future, light and life. It is a beautiful sight to take in, and each Haft-sin (which is the word for the arrangement on the table) is lovely and unique in its own way. More importantly, each Haft-sin carries the memories and traditions of the family whose home it sits in.A table is laid with a Haft-sin arrangement to celebrate the Persian New Year, Nowruz.My parents and I usually eat fish on the eve of Nowruz and discuss the happenings of the year that is coming to an end. A few days before Nowruz, some people light fires and jump over them, leaving the difficulties of the year that is ending behind them in quite a literal sense. Although I've always been intrigued by this, I have never actually done it myself. On the eve of Nowruz, my parents and I always share hope for the future (which we need a lot of this year). During the year before this one officially started in March, my father's sister died of a freak accident and my cousin's wife (who has three children under five) was diagnosed with breast cancer. These unexpected and very unwelcome events jarred my parents and I and our extended families. Each of us had to face how fleeting life can be (some us for the second or third time based on our histories).Earlier in 2020, in what it claimed was a mistake, Iran shot down a civilian plane on its way from Tehran to the Ukraine amid political conflict following the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani by the U.S. government. A total of 176 victims perished in the crash, including 57 Canadians, many of whom were graduate students in various parts of this country. This represented another unexpected devastation, and though we had no personal ties to anyone on the flight, the severity of the tragedy and the political wrangling, and the loss of potential, was very deeply felt by my family, as it was by all Persians around the world - many of whom were displaced by the Iranian Revolution. Add to the foregoing the insanity of the COVID-19 pandemic in the past few months and we arrive at an unprecedented time.Leila Rafi sleeps in the arms of her mother aboard a plane as her parents, Ali and Farah, flee the Iranian Revolution in a snapshot from April 1979.On Nowruz earlier this year, and many times since Nowruz, I talked with my parents about their vivid memories of fleeing Iran during the beginning of the revolution, when I was five months old. Never did they think they would witness another crisis on such a grand scale, where there seemed to be a loss of normal life as we have come to know it. The COVID-19 pandemic lacks the violence and political instability they witnessed in Iran, but the sense of impending doom, misery and lives being lost is familiar to them, and was unknown to me until very recently.Through these trying times we see the best and the worst of the human spirit and we also witness firsthand the importance of social connection (as we sit in various stages of physical isolation). As a result of COVID-19, I have been able to connect with my parents on an entirely new level and gain a better grasp of my own beginnings and heritage. Before Nowruz, I had never engaged in detailed discussions with my parents about the Iranian Revolution, nor did I fully grasp their feelings about having fled their homeland (and everything they built) with an infant and no final destination at the time. They've recently told me about a bank being torched beside the hospital the day I was born (all types of buildings were torched during the unrest at that time), and desperate searches for formula and diapers before they were able to flee the country. These stories of essential products disappearing off store racks sounded eerily similar to the hoarding of toilet paper and yeast that has occurred during the pandemic, notwithstanding that grocery stores and other food service providers have generally kept up with the excessive demands. People panic when there is uncertainty.A family snapshot shows Leila Rafi as a young girl with her parents, Ali and Farah Rafi, in Hawaii in 1984.There are some silver linings to the pandemic. In recent months I've been cooking all kinds of Persian dishes. My mom has an old recipe book in Farsi and I have a new one called Bottom of the Pot (I've mastered Tahdig) and we have been working our way through them with me making English notes in mine as I can't read Farsi. The time I have been spending with my parents is time I will relish forever, as we are truly a team. I feel ever so grateful that I know, based on the difficulties of our past, that we can get through anything together. I am also grateful that Canada represents a land of opportunity with incredible leaders who have blossomed during COVID-19, and I'm proud to call it my home. I have been able to learn and retain pieces of my heritage while celebrating my freedom each and every day.When my family (including my extended family) and I celebrate Nowruz next year, our even stronger bond and (now) shared understanding of the precariousness of life will cause us to pause and be grateful for the very basic things in life, because we must cherish each and every moment, as what comes next is never guaranteed, regardless of where we live.Flying safely during COVID-19: Tips from a public health researcher(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/flying-safely-during-covid-19-tips-from-a-public-health-researcher/wcm/edcd6c86-3dfc-487b-a161-f8c4cd5e76fb/)Opinion: We're infectious disease experts, and 'eliminating' COVID won't happen any time soon(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-were-infectious-disease-experts-and-eliminating-covid-wont-happen-any-time-soon/wcm/63354c73-6f89-4aa3-894d-22db06cf3e56/) !@COPYRIGHT=© 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.
