Democrats, meanwhile, packed up and flocked on private jets to Washington, D.C., to deny them quorum.Across America, \"voting rights\" have become the top political issue after the contested 2020 election. After courts dismissed their claims, states where results were challenged - Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin - have passed measures for election security, requiring photo ID to ensure that only eligible citizens vote. Eighty per cent of Americans, in a recent Monmouth University Poll, support these measures(https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_062121/), with 69 per cent of Black voters endorsing the same(https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/lifestyle/general_lifestyle/march_2021/75_support_voter_id_laws). Though the U.S. Supreme Court recently upheld these laws, 6-3, in Arizona, Democrats are undeterred to \"stop the steal.\" Their 'For the People Act,' pending in Congress, would override state election security and end all ID requirements. So far, the Senate filibuster has prevented it from becoming law.While the U.S. bickers over \"election security,\" however, it may be worthwhile to look northward to the Canadian example. In 2007, with the Harper government's Bill C-31 amendments to the Elections Act, Canada made government-issued voter ID compulsory for federal elections (with provinces having similar measures). Voters, per Section 143, are required to prove their identity and residence, with strict requirements for the kinds of ID acceptable. Photo ID is the main type. Alternatively, voters require double ID - both proving their address - or must (along with another known voter) attest to their eligibility, which is confirmed later. To these rules, there are no exceptions - regardless of race, income or gender.These measures have long been supported by Canadians and have been in place without issue. In 2019, during our most recent federal election, I was hired by Elections Canada to serve as Deputy Returning Officer for an inner-city Toronto riding. From dawn to dusk, my job was to verify voters' ID, monitor the ballot box, ensure ballot security and count the votes after the polls closed. The downtown riding spanned all socio-economic groups - from tony homes to homeless shelters and encampments - with many ethnic minorities. Regardless of their background or identity, every one of the voters I serviced presented valid voter ID to cast their ballot. Virtually all had government-issued photo ID showing their address - whether a driver's licence or another card - with the rest coming prepared with two documents to prove their eligibility. Young and old, poor or wealthy, these voters instinctively thought to bring ID with them to the ballot box. Just like driving a car or buying alcohol, they knew that voting must be safe and secure.Since these laws were made, and four federal elections later, there have never been accusations of \"widespread voter fraud\" or \"stolen elections\" on a national scale in Canada. Even in single contested cases, such as former Conservative MP Ted Opitz's six-vote victory in Etobicoke-Centre in 2011, nobody questioned voters' identification - though then-Liberal leader Bob Rae's conspiratorial claims that \"democracy was undermined(https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/toronto-riding-s-election-result-tossed-by-judge-1.1222980)\" would mirror Donald Trump today. When these voter ID laws were challenged on appeal in 2014 at the B.C. Supreme Court, in Henry v. Canada (Attorney General), they were upheld unanimously. In her concurrence, Justice Daphne Smith found \"the objectives of preventing voter fraud and maintaining confidence in the electoral system to be pressing and substantial(https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2014/2014bcca30/2014bcca30.html).\"Tasha Kheiriddin: Calling an election in August would give Trudeau Liberals best shot at a majority(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/tasha-kheiriddin-calling-an-election-in-august-would-give-trudeau-liberals-best-shot-at-a-majority)Rex Murphy: You thought lockdown was bad? Just wait until the next federal election(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/rex-murphy-you-thought-lockdown-was-bad-just-wait-until-the-next-federal-election)In short, for over a decade, Canada has run its democracy smoothly with voter ID laws that keep our elections secure. Our insistence on using paper ballots for federal elections and allowing partisan election observers has helped bring in transparency and accountability, ensuring our elections are not compromised. Following Ronald Reagan, we Canadians \"trust, but verify.\"As an economically, socially and culturally similar state, it thus beggars belief that Democrats in the United States won't adopt voter ID laws for election security. The idea that low-income ethnic minorities can't obtain proper ID - required for all the other business of life is, frankly \"fake news\" spewed by progressives and the mainstream media to alarm voters, and amounts to the soft bigotry of low expectations. Worse, amidst massive illegal immigration and election interference by Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, risks to voter integrity are greater than ever. Even the U.K. recognizes this, and has introduced new voter ID rules for protection(https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-government-introduce-criticised-voter-id-law-this-year-2021-05-11/). In these times, trying to loosen such laws is at odds with reality. If Joe Biden truly cares about \"facts,\" then the next time he speaks on voting rights, he'd do well to remember these.Arjun Singh is a recent graduate of the University of Toronto, and was a Deputy Returning Officer for Elections Canada in 2019. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
