Most would, if given the non-political choice, choose the latter. So should we, the governments of democratic states and companies like Facebook and Twitter (and those running to take their business). Please, no Petainism to mark 80 years since Charles de Gaulle spoke of freedom for France from his base in London.Jeff Kaye                                          Address suppliedTeaching the truth about colonialismThedebate in recent daysabout whether the statue of Cecil Rhodes at Oriel College should be removed highlights the importance of a thorough and well-rounded education. Why not teach local history and the basics of colonialism in schools, so young people know more about British history and the context behind these significant cultural figures? It was only at university that I learned about some of the unsavoury aspects of the British empire and discovered my town's local history by reading independently.Following the Second World War, statues relating to Nazi Germany were taken down, but the past was not forgotten. By prioritising teaching about the past, rather than warped memorabilia in the form of statues, we can learn from history without having to commemorate these figuresJack Crockford                                          Address suppliedProtesters call for removal of Cecil Rhodes statue in OxfordBoris Johnson is a clever manYour correspondents Peter Jackson and Derek Reynolds see Boris Johnson as talentless and a charlatan. There is much in his record to support such views. However, Johnson has been clever enough to write two books - one more serious and well-received, on Churchill, and the other even he might care not to remember, with a title mentioning 72 virgins; a thriller with its final scene in Westminster Hall. This second book might lead readers to question his political judgement, but Johnson is clearly a clever man.JM Wober                                          Address supplied"
