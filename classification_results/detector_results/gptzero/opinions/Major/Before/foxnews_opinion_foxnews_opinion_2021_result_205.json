The former Soviet Union and today China and North Korea are two chilling examples. In such countries those who believe in God become a direct threat to the governmentâs power.Christians and Jews were especially brutally persecuted in the former Soviet Union. If your atheist worldview holds that these human beings are not sacred and created in Godâs image, whatâs to stop you for torturing and murdering them for the \"greater good\" of the state? Uyghur Muslims in todayâs China are enslaved and often murdered for their organs, which fetch a very high price on the international market.When Hitler and the Nazis forced their socialist atheist views on Germans,Â the Lutheran Pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer knew that the church alone had the cultural and moral power to stand against it; but because his pleas to speak out and fight were largely met with indifference by a complacent church, 12 million human beings were murdered in death camps. Will the American church follow the German church and Germany in this, or will we learn from Bonhoefferâs story?This, of course, is the great paradox of freedom. A free nation cannot force anyone to believe, or to be virtuous and self-governing. But if the people in a free nation abandon faith â and virtuous behavior â or even let it erode away slowly, the government will inevitably step into that vacuum and will grow to enforce its views with increasing brutality.And while a free nation cannot and should not try to coerce atheists toward belief, people of faith, while we still have a voice, have an urgent duty to alert our fellow citizens that, although religious freedom protects atheists, atheism itself nonetheless has an inherent and â alas â well-established tendency to work not only against religious freedom, but against all freedoms.
