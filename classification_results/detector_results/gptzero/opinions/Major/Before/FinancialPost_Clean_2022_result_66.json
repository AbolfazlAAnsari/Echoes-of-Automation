It's that Amnesty ends up doing the very thing it condemns in the report: endangering civilian lives.Amnesty researchers purportedly found evidence that Ukrainian forces launched military strikes \"from within populated residential areas\"; that Ukraine used hospitals as military bases; and that Ukrainian troops set up bases in old school facilities. Putting aside deeply troubling reports(https://twitter.com/StratcomCentre/status/1556639186257874944) that these findings may have been tainted by interviews conducted at Russian filtration camps, where interviewees may have been coerced to give certain answers, each section is short on facts and even shorter on law.International humanitarian law (IHL) is a vast body of law, much of which is designed to protect civilians.
