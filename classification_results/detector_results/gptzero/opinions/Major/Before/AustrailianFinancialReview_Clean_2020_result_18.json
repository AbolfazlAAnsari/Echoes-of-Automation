            "inputText": "Tight election The President-elect will have to take a moderate line. That's good for the US after the hyper-partisanship of the Trump years.Well, at least I'm satisfied my prediction that Joe Biden would win the presidential election has come to pass! I had a slight preference for Donald Trump on policy grounds and in spite of his personality, and in the end it was the Trump personality and behaviour that defeated him, not his policies.Overall, if the Republicans retain control of the Senate, and we won't know the answer to that until late January, these results offer Americans their best chance to govern in a less partisan and erratic way. But the US government will also be somewhat weaker than it could be if one party controlled all three of the elected institutions - the presidency, the Senate and the House of Representatives.For me, I'd like to see a less partisan, less divided America. I sit on boards with Americans and I am struck by the intensity of the party political feelings. Many of them have strayed beyond rationality. They are not prepared even to examine the opinions of people who support the other party. It's madness really. Unless this partisanship is toned down, it will eventually lead to somewhere very bad for America.Let's try to imagine how the Biden presidency is going to work. First, there is the President-elect himself. He is folksy and pleasant, there's no doubt about that. And as former US president Barack Obama said during the election campaign, with Biden you won't have the president on television every night arousing controversy. He will be a quieter president than his predecessor, that's for sure.Biden will be more of a ceremonial president than an executive one. Let's be frank. He is old to hold an office like the presidency and he is nothing like as sharp as he used to be.The people who will run the US government will be his chief of staff, the Secretary of State, the Treasury Secretary and the National Security Adviser - and perhaps one or two others.It'll all work well if they agree with each other. It won't be pretty if they don't. An active president would resolve such differences but it seems unlikely Biden will be sufficiently engaged to do that. Once the Biden honeymoon is over, I would expect the Biden administration to become plagued with rivalries and internal dissent.In general however, it will be a moderate administration. But that depends on the Republicans maintaining their control of the Senate. Let's assume that.First, there are the president's appointments to senior positions. Cabinet members and other senior office holders within government departments will have to be confirmed by the Senate.It is clear that a Republican-controlled Senate will veto the appointments of any hard left members of the Democratic Party. Those elements of the party who want to continue not just to advocate but implement the hard left, woke agenda simply won't get confirmed.That means advocates of postmodern deconstructionism, critical race theory and divisive, salami-slicing, identity politics will be excluded from the administration. The extremes of the party which want to defund the police and accuse all white people regardless of their socio-economic status of being \"privileged\" will be excluded from this administration. That's a great thing. To include them would be deeply divisive and generate a vicious backlash.So expect Biden's appointments of cabinet members to be well-known, experienced and moderate Democrats. All that will be reassuring. When I was the Australian foreign minister during the Clinton administration, I found moderate Democrats easy to work with and excellent colleagues. To this very day I still keep in touch with Madeleine Albright. Likewise, I expect Scott Morrison and his team will be able to form friendships with their counterparts in the new administration.Secondly, policies will be moderate. The divided governance of America between a Republican Senate and a Democratic President will guarantee that. Until it was hit by the COVID-19 crisis, America's economy was booming under President Trump, driven by very substantial cuts to personal and corporate taxation and a regime of deregulation.Biden has promised to increase corporate taxation and impose an envy tax on high-income earners. As America tries to rebuild its economy out of the coronavirus crisis, these are the last policies any sensible government should be introducing. This is not a time for tax hikes. Well, I'm reassured that a Republican-controlled Senate will not pass those tax hikes into law. Many of the reforms introduced by the Trump administration will remain in place. The administration may not like that, but won't be able to do anything about it though it will, of course, be able to reregulate some industries by presidential fiat.I also doubt the Senate will agree to spending $2 trillion on renewable energy as promised by Biden. In this environment, that would be economically reckless.When it comes to foreign policy, the moderate Democratic administration will avoid doing anything radical or concerning to the Australian government. After all, the secretary of state - that is, the foreign minister - will be a moderate.Biden's first act will be to rejoin the Paris agreement on climate change. Australia is already in that agreement and America's readmission will be widely welcomed in this country and around the world.A Biden administration will continue to see China as a strategic competitor and while it may start to wind back tariffs on Chinese exports to the US, that is not likely to happen quickly without some quid pro quo from Beijing. I very much doubt a Biden administration will be softer on China than the Trump one and, given Australia's travails with Beijing at the moment, expect a Biden administration to be just as supportive of Australia as the Trump administration.So there we have it. A moderate Democratic administration constrained by the US Senate. That will be a comfortable combination for the Australian government to work with. What the Biden administration won't be is a strong, reformist government. With a leader who will be more of a ceremonial president than an activist one, and a Senate controlled by the opposition, significant reforms will be out of the question, whether needed or not.And here is a lesson for the left outside America from this recent round of elections. The hard left, woke agenda and obsession with culture wars and the cancel culture will repeatedly be rejected by the electorate. The public in America may have been sick and tired of Trump and his antics - and I can understand that - but remember, the Republicans increased their seats in the House of Representatives and will probably maintain control of the Senate.Alexander Downer was foreign minister from 1996 to 2007 and is a former high commissioner to the UK."
