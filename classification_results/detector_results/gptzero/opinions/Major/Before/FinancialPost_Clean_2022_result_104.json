More money for the UN black hole(https://financialpost.com/opinion/william-watson-un-climate-change-cop27)Matthew Lau: Trudeau knows even less about entrepreneurship than monetary policy(https://financialpost.com/opinion/matthew-lau-trudeau-entrepreneurship-monetary-policy)Opinion: WTO COVID-19 discussion could chill Canadian innovation(https://financialpost.com/opinion/wto-covid-19-canada-innovation-ip)Let that sink in. Not only would the UN's new climate regime disallow new investments in fossil fuels and end production of oil and gas, it would also compel an uncritical allegiance to the green transition by the very companies it proposes to put out of business. This is despite the fact that, as the Parliamentary Budget Office recently wrote(https://distribution-a617274656661637473.pbo-dpb.ca/bbc2846795c541eddc656e484a15e7ecd91bd0aff45196f231523d8c5c9aafe4), \"Canada's own emissions are not large enough to materially impact climate change(https://financialpost.com/tag/climate-change/).\"Canadians need to think carefully before agreeing to adoption of the McKenna group's report. It ignores important unintended consequences that would inevitably affect our economy and energy security. This attempt to redefine the \"net\" out of \"net-zero\" undermines Canada's established \"transitional\" net-zero policies and would require elimination of all hydrocarbon production and use by 2050 - while apparently foreclosing consideration of managing offsets with carbon credits or carbon capture, utilization and storage.Such a redefinition of net-zero places the high-level expert group at odds, not just with a global community that increasingly recognizes the strategic and economic importance of hydrocarbon use, but also with current Canadian climate policy. Significantly, the COP27 final agreement did not contain language that called for the phase-out of all fossil fuels, including oil and gas. To quote(https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63677466) Alok Sharma, the British MP who served as president of COP26 in Glasgow: \"A clear commitment to phase-out all fossil fuels? Not in this text.\"A report that is at odds not just with Canada and the international community but also with the COP27 final agreement itself should be sent back to the UN with a failing grade.Tammy Nemeth is a U.K.-based strategic energy analyst.
