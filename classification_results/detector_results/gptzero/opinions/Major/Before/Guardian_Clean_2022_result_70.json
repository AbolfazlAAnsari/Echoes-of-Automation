It is certainly true that the late queen was incredibly popular – thelast pollbefore her death found 81% of people held her in positive regard, a rate that had remained consistent for more than a decade.But Her Majesty’s personal reputation outstripped that of the institution she led. YouGovpolling showsthat 68% have a positive opinion of the monarchy at present. In contrast to his mother, King Charles III’s reputation simply matches that of the crown, with 70% viewing him positively. That figure jumped up overnight on his ascension to the throne, with his favourability ratings more typicallyfluctuatingbetween 50% and 60% over the past 11 years.In the case of both the institution and the present occupant, it is likely that at least some of this perceived increase in popularity is a temporary boost spurred by the emotion of the moment. Some Britons may also be answering the question differently now that it relates to King – rather than Prince – Charles.Nevertheless, these numbers appear very healthy. Certainly, any politician would kill to be thought of so favourably by so many. But the long-term prospects for the monarchy may not be as stable as they appear. Bubbling away beneath the surface is growing dissatisfaction among younger people.Currently, only 47% of 18- to 24-year-olds say Britain should continue to have a monarchy, compared with 86% of Britons aged 65 and over. Even this level of support among young people may be temporarily inflated:just 33%had voiced their desire to keep the crown in May, at the time of the platinum jubilee.Such disillusionment is a relatively new development. As recently as 2015, 69% of 18- to 24-year-olds said that Britain shouldremain a monarchy.  By 2018 this had fallen to 47%, and in polls from 2020 onwards, prior to the Queen’s death, it has averaged at just 35%.The present level of support for an elected head of state among under-25s (33%) is largely in line with the average since 2020 (37%).
