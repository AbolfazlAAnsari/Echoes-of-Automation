Somewhere.We now also have a breakdown in communications about what the policy might be.Like Joyce this week, the Prime Minister seems to have been unable not only to articulate a policy, but even to articulate what's wrong with the one we don't have.The priority list of who gets vaccinated first, for example, seems to have long ago hit the wall. Remember all those 1A and 1B groups, such as aged care and disability residents and workers? And good luck if you are able to keep up with who is now supposed to be in a priority group, let alone the advice about whether you should, or can, get access to Pfizer or AstraZeneca, or even whether you can get two shots of either.By Friday, it felt like a free-for-all, with NSW authorities pleading with people to get a shot, any shot, while the state is still awash with unwanted supplies of AstraZeneca.Apparently it is all the fault of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. Scott Morrison said it would have all been better if ATAGI's advice hadn't made people more hesitant about AstraZeneca. He kept urging the group to change its advice, he said. \"I've just simply said: the balance of risk is changing, guys, so how is that impacting on your advice, and is it time to think about that?\"But ATAGI has consistently given advice on vaccines in a range of risk scenarios. And it is not its job to balance vaccine risk against issues such as economic impact.As Victoria's Health Minister Martin Foley pointedly observed in response on Thursday, \"if government has an issue with [the ATAGI advice], constructively engage with them. Seek a solution. Don't seek to blame people for doing their job. If we all did our job, we may not be in this position we are today with very low vaccine rates.\"The ultimate authority for our Prime Minister, unfortunately, has too often been the opinion polls. And the published polls have all been pointing in the same direction this week. The same goes for what the focus groups are telling the political parties.Despite the fact that it is premiers who are more regularly in the public's face day in and day out, with the PM being less visible, it is Morrison whom voters hold responsible for the breakdown in the COVID-19 response. The simple measure of his failure in voters' minds is that we are lagging the entire developed world on vaccination rates. And the PM is perceived to be perpetually trying to shift the blame to others.Which is why Morrison's sudden acknowledgment that he is ultimately \"responsible\" for the vaccination program was perhaps more important than saying he was \"sorry\" the vaccination program hadn't met its targets.You can be sure this was a statement made in response to focus group findings, to address perceptions that he was dodging the issue, even if he continues to blame others for the problems.Pollster Tony Mitchelmore has long said that the only two things that have really mattered to swinging voters during this long period of crisis have been management of the pandemic and the economy.On the pandemic, the PM repeatedly says we must focus on what's ahead, not what has happened in the past (which is understandable given the current dim view of what has happened in the past). Except what is ahead is as clear as mud right now.Mitchelmore says focus groups aren't really focused on economic concerns just yet.But in the same way the COVID-19 messages have become splintered and confused, there is a real risk to both the real economy and the political messages that the splintering of assistance measures - with the federal government increasingly expecting the states to provide business assistance, while less certain personal income assistance is available from the federal government - will also hit business and consumer confidence just as hard as lockdowns are doing.Treasurer Josh Frydenberg says we can't look backwards to JobKeeper and all the other support the government handed out last year. Those were policies for the times, he says. And the times have moved on.It's just unfortunate that, as with the pandemic response, most voters would like some more reassuring signals from the government on the economic outlook.Laura Tingle is chief political correspondent of the ABC's 7.30 program."
