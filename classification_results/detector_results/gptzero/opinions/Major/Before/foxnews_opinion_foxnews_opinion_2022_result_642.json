THESE FAITHFUL DEVOTIONS MAY HELP BLESS OUR CHILDRENWhat was the nature of the Wise Men’s journey?Matthew’s Gospelin a mere twelve lines describes what was very likely a royal diplomatic mission to the dangerous Herod, mingled with a personal spiritual quest.FILE – DECEMBER 10, 2020: Volunteers portray the manger scene outside the Church of Jesus Christ in Fountain Valley, California, as part of the church's living creche.(Getty Images)Old Testament scholar and Cambridge-educated linguist, Margaret Barker offers a truly tantalizing possibility. Barker believes that the Wise Men may have been descendants of the First Temple royal Jewish priesthood—the Order of Melkhizedek- expelled from the Temple 700 years before Christ.Far from the Magi \"gift drop\" that has become a cultural fixture, the items they carried suggest a far more serious religious mission. Barker points to Philo of Alexandria, who reports that gold was used in the vestments of the Royal priests of the first temple.Frankincense was burned in the first temple and myrrh oil was kept in the holy of holies. Why? It was used to anoint kings and members of the royal high priesthood.Shattering the later day accounts of the emperors bearing gifts to a messiah, it makes far more sense that a group ofexiled Jewish high priestscame, not only to worship this Messiah, but to anoint him into their priesthood and restore the first temple.There is so much we don’t know about these famous Magi that is it important to nail down what we do. The historicity of the Wise Men points to the historicity of the light they sought—theChrist Child in the cradleof Bethlehem who is still venerated all these centuries later.The Wise Men also furnish us with an important lesson: despite all the risks, all the dangers in their path, they kept their eyes and minds fixed on the things above, not the things of earth. Their daring journey would not only gift them with immortality, but with a perpetual light that has continued to burn brighter than even their star.Fox Nationprograms are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but only for Fox Nation subscribers.Go to Fox Nationto start a free trial and watch the extensive library from your favorite Fox News personalities.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM RAYMOND ARROYORaymond Arroyo is a broadcaster, Fox News contributor and Fox Nation co-host.
