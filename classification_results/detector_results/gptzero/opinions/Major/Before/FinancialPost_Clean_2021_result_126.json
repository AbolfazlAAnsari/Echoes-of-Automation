To avoid further stress on their patients, many doctors have been forced to use the phone and?other platforms like Zoom or Skype. But this threatens their ability to continue to treat patients in the future.Why? When GP-psychotherapists use non-OTN platforms, they are obliged to bill OHIP with a new pandemic code, known as K082, which does not count toward their GP-psychotherapist designation.?As a result, a large number of these doctors may lose their titles.?If that happens, family physicians will have fewer doctors to refer patients - and face financial penalty for referrals to doctors who no longer hold their designation. The result is that surging numbers of patients will have unnecessarily limited access to mental health care.The crisis is real. A 2020 survey of 216 GP-psychotherapists in Ontario showed?half?of them?do not use OTN and only 8.1 per cent use it at least 90 per cent of the time. A vast majority cited grievances with OTN, such as poor quality, unreliability and challenges with patient accessibility, as the main reasons for using alternate platforms.Complicating matters further, the Ministry of Health proposed an arbitrary limit on the number of OHIP-funded, physician delivered psychotherapy sessions that a patient could receive to 24 a year. Introduced in 2019, the proposal is still under consideration, but in a recent article, doctors Renata Villela and Susan Lazar argue such limits ignore clinical need and could have devastating consequences for patients, especially those suffering from multiple medical/psychiatric co-morbidities.Most troubling is that these issues are unfolding during the?pandemic, with its lockdowns and economic pain. Demand for so-called disaster psychotherapy has skyrocketed - just as it did after the Spanish Flu, when demand for mental health support increased sevenfold. Future psychotherapy demand is expected to increase?given the findings of a?recent?Oxford University study of 230,000 people,?which found that?one in three?COVID-19?survivors received a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis within six months of infection.In Ontario, GP-psychotherapists?play a pivotal role in the mental health ecosystem, especially for patients suffering from moderate or severe mental health issues, whose needs cannot be adequately addressed through the short-term cognitive behaviour therapy advocated by the Ontario government's Roadmap to Wellness Program. OHIP-funded physician-psychotherapy is a cost-effective treatment that prevents mental health hospitalizations.Furthermore, as physicians we often serve our society's most vulnerable and underprivileged populations and provide publicly funded care to those who do not have the financial means or insurance to afford private psychotherapy.Let's not punish mental health patients when they need assistance the most. We strongly urge the Ontario government to consider two simple fixes: no annual limits on the number of OHIP-funded physician-psychotherapy sessions and allow GP-psychotherapists using non-OTN platforms to keep their designations. Taking these steps will prioritize the needs of mental health patients and ensure that crucial physician-psychotherapy remains accessible.Dr. Conrad Sichler is a GP-psychotherapist practising in Burlington, Ont., whose practice focuses on treating addiction and trauma; Dr. Chase McMurren is a GP-psychotherapist practising in Toronto; and Dr. Arieg Badawi is a family physician practising in Milton, Ont. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
