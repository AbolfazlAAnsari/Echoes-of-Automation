Indeed, along with his sometime colleague at the University of Chicago, the late Milton Friedman, Mundell is widely acknowledged as the greatest macroeconomist of the second half of the last century, in the generation that followed John Maynard Keynes.While Friedman repudiated the Keynesian legacy, Bob built upon it.

It's worth recalling that Mundell became intimately acquainted with Keynes' ideas during a stint at the London School of Economics in the late 1950s, studying with James Meade, an acolyte of the great Cambridge master. Later, after completing a doctorate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he imbibed the ideas of the \"other Cambridge\" (i.e., Cambridge, Mass.), Bob became a professor at Chicago in the late 1960s, where, with Friedman, he was primus inter pares amongst a bevy of great economists and future Nobel laureates, including George Stigler and many others.After a return to Canada in the early 1970s to head the Economics Department at the University of Waterloo, in 1974 Mundell joined the faculty of Columbia University in New York, where he remained for the rest of his career.
