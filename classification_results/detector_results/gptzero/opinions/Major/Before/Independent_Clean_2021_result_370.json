If you left or they left the country of birth/residence for the opportunities the world has to offer, then accept the downsides as well as the upsides.Be a contributor, not a burden is my suggestion. If you can afford the luxury of a holiday, then donate to a worthy UK cause instead. That I would applaud.Michael MannShrewsburyDon't tell me how to voteI am writing to you from Oswestry in North Shropshire, a town unheard of by many beforeOwen Paterson's resignation and the current political frenzy.Over the last few days I have read many letters and opinion pieces telling me that I, as a Labour voter, \"should\" put my personal views aside and vote Liberal Democrat.The bookies have decided the Lib Dems are best placed to beat the Conservatives, despite the fact that Labour have got at least double the votes of the Liberal Democrats in general elections since the coalition.The constituency is portrayed as a strange, out-of-touch sort of place, mainly agricultural, almost feudal in its conservative leanings. But it's also a place of food banks, extremely long waits for ambulances, and chronically poor public transport - all matters which have arisen under the Conservatives and which, based on their years in government, a Liberal Democrat MP would do little to address.In North Shropshire, as elsewhere, we need stronger public services and an MP who will properly represent the area. Please stop telling me who I \"ought\" to vote for.Fiona WoodOswestry, ShropshireAre 'scroungers' always the poor?One of the enduring mantras of the Tory Party hard right is the need to come down hard on what they usually describe as \"benefit scroungers\" -that appears to include anyone in the unfortunate position of having to rely on state benefits simply to get by.Consider the cruel decision by Boris Johnson's government to withdraw the Â£20 universal credit uplift following the end of the initial pandemic assistance roll out. Remember also the decision to end free school meals for needy children over the school holidays last year; a decision thankfully reversed following his shaming by Marcus Rashford.However, I see nothing coming from the same Tory hard right about applying this epithet to the habits of Boris Johnson himself. He getsothers to pay for his and his family's fairly exotic holidaysand he taps rich party donors to pay for the horrendously expensiveredecoration of his flat in Downing Street, the funding of which he was forced to repay. This is a man who has earned high salaries throughout his career yet appears to believe that he is entitled to be funded by others for all aspects of his public life.Why then does the epithet \"scrounger\" only apply to the poor? Presumably, privilege and an sense of entitlement saves Boris Johnson from the same insult.Kate HallLeedsRead MoreCovid omicron news: Booster vaccine queues reach six hoursOmicron symptoms: What to look out for from new Covid variantWill there be a new UK lockdown before Christmas as part of Plan B?PM's 'address to the nation' was the worst moment of a terrible week | Tom PeckOpinion: It's time to get real, stop being selfish and have the booster - now'Revenge shoppers' are just what retailers need this week | Hamish McRae"
