Performance appraisals will have to be conducted with greater honesty and clarity. Managers will have to communicate criteria for rungs on the pay ladder for the jobs their employees do and what aspects of performance are used to determine pay. Already reluctant to give low ratings or differentiate among the people who report to them, managers may feel pressure to treat everyone in their area the same, or explain why they're not. That might end up depressing everyone's pay, as it will be easier for managers to avoid potentially awkward discussions altogether.A 2021 reportby Harvard Business School professor Zoe Cullen found that at companies with employees in states or cities that have pay transparency laws, workers received 2% to 3% less pay. She speculated that the laws encouraged employers to set lower salaries and refuse to negotiate on initial offers.Favoritism won't disappear at jobs in cities with these laws, but it will have to be based on contribution, not bias. It's likely that more companies will use bonuses to motivate and reward performance. In talent-dependent companies, such as rapidly growing technology ventures, managers who can't get around posted pay range limits will look for other ways to put cash into high performers' pockets, through bonuses or special perks. While annual bonuses can get taken for granted and counted on as part of compensation package, spot bonuses will be sought out as a way for managers to differentially reward performance on particular projects as they occur, outside of annual reviews. This helps managers get around the limits forced on them by pay disclosure.Lawyers and HR professionals will focus on the details of the New York City law and find some possible kinks. What if pay scales are conveyed verbally instead of in writing? What if postings can't be revised as quickly as changing market conditions? How should remote work be calibrated for location? Can companies adjust inequities at the speed of lawsuits?That's not the point. The significance of pay transparency laws is their role in moving American workplaces away from bias and closer to equal opportunity.Opinion by Rosabeth Moss KanterTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
