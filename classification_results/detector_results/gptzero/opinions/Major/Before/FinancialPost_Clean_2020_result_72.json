            "inputText": "By Shakir ChambersIn his final remarks as leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, Andrew Scheer declared, \"Millions of Canadians share our Conservative values, they just don't know it yet.\" There may be truth to that statement; but if the CPC can't tackle its perception problem, these eligible voters may never know. Many Canadians share such hallmark conservative values as smaller government, respect for individual freedoms, and responsibly spent tax dollars. Despite their alignment with the broader conservative philosophy, many have long written off the party as a viable option come election day.Rightly or wrongly, a significant group of Canadians see the CPC as an institutionalization of the proverbial old white man. Continuing to base their view of the party on such well-known stereotypes as intolerance and the prioritization of corporations over social programs, they see a party generally out of step with the majority of Canadians when it comes to social issues. This dated perception is one that our party has earned over the years. Now, more than ever, the modern CPC must work to change this if they ever hope to return their leader to 24 Sussex Dr.Enter, Erin O'Toole. New leadership offers an opportunity to recast out-dated messages and perceptions. O'Toole wants to present a positive conservative vision - one that challenges the ideas of those currently subscribed to the party's \"old white man\" narrative. So far, he has taken several steps in the right direction: emphasizing words of inclusivity in his victory speech, offering unequivocal public statements on \"hot button\" social issues, and making an attempt to diversify his shadow cabinet. Ensuring the party reflects the diversity of Canada will also increase the number of those willing to consider his pitch. However, attracting a diverse slate of candidates - and ultimately getting them elected - remains a challenge.O'Toole is still a question mark for many Canadians, and the Liberals and NDP will do all they can to paint his public portrait for him before the CPC can define their new leader. O'Toole must leave no room for misinterpretations. It will be critical that he continues to match his words with his actions if he is to persuade both moderate and progressive Canadians to give the CPC a chance.In the Official Opposition, Canadians want fighters who will hold the government to account. But, if the conservatives are going to position themselves as a \"government-in-waiting,\" Canadians will also expect them to have a vision for how they would do things differently. Simply saying \"no\" to Liberal government initiatives while championing a mantra of fiscal responsibility will not satisfy the very Canadians the CPC hopes to win over. O'Toole will need to do more than repeat clichÃ©s about a \"corrupt Liberal government\" and finger point around economic mismanagement.Key to being a \"government in-waiting\" is acting like one. If O'Toole truly believes the Liberals are corrupt and mismanaging the economy, these claims must be followed by conservative solutions. How would the CPC do things differently? How would they do it better? O'Toole is off to a good start with his initial policy positions, but the real test will come if his party opposes the Liberal government's upcoming speech from the throne. Should Canada spiral into a general election, it would be wise for O'Toole to remember elections are not about the past, but about the future. Naturally, the new Conservative leader has much to criticize about the Liberals' five-year record. But in a period of post-COVID recovery, he must also clearly illustrate a compelling, conservative vision to get Canada back on track and address simmering social tensions, along with the myriad of issues that Canadians care about today.Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole waves as he stands at a traffic light with campaign manager Fred DeLorey and chief of Staff Tausha Michaud in Ottawa on Sept. 9, 2020.Whenever Canada heads into the next election, political commentators will once again point to electoral maps to speculate on strategies to frame the ballot question, win more seats in Quebec, and generate support in Ontario's 905 region. These are important conversations. However, the key to the CPC's sustained electoral success, and an O'Toole victory, is expanding the number of people who are excited about the party and view it as a viable option.O'Toole should celebrate what we are as modern conservatives - our values, our principles, our ideas. But in some very important ways, our country and our electorate are changing, and these changes must be reflected in the CPC. O'Toole must find and communicate conservative solutions to the contemporary problems Canadians care about. The CPC has an opportunity in Erin O'Toole to inspire millions of Canadians. Many of them may share our positive conservative vision, even if they don't know it yet.Shakir Chambers is a Senior Consultant at Navigator Ltd. in Toronto.
