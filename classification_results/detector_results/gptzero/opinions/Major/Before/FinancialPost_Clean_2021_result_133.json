But in this anti-colonialists at home are allied - inadvertently, no doubt - with illiberal regimes abroad.If Henry Kissinger is to be believed, ever since Sun Tzu's \"Art of War,\" Chinese realpolitik has placed a premium on gaining a psychological advantage. So, in 2011 a British diplomat in China was told: \"What you have to remember is that you come from a weak and declining nation.\" And when, in July 2020, Britain criticized the Chinese regime for trampling over the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 on Hong Kong, Beijing's ambassador was quick to dismiss the criticism as outdated colonial interference.America now seems to accept this narrative. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, argued that she had seen for herself \"how the original sin of slavery weaved white supremacy into our founding documents and principles.\" The U.S. had to \"acknowledge that we are an imperfect union,\" she continued, \"and have been since the beginning.\"Whether in the case of China and Russia today, or possibly some future Islamic state, a prerequisite for their rise is a degree of confidence and civilizational purpose. What does the West have to offer to counter these highly illiberal states and social forces? What is the glue that holds free countries together with a common purpose to defend their shared institutional order, upon which their rights and freedoms - all highly fragile and historically contingent - now rest?The desire among so-called progressives to undermine the West, deconstruct its morally justifying narrative and overthrow its institutional order is an impulse that, ironically, takes for granted a more assured Western hegemony. The West's post-1945 boom, which helped fund the welfare state and universities throughout western Europe, provided the post-1968 generation of left-wing intellectuals - the ideological architects of today's social justice movements - with a false sense of security.They could call for revolution in the expectation that, if their dreams ever materialized, the West could become a benign force of global change. However, in the present context of rising illiberal \"civilizational states\" and the weakening U.S. and U.K. - in large part because of the raging culture wars - anti-Western Westerners risk sawing off the very branch on which they so comfortably sit.With the increasingly top-down enforcement of faddish \"decolonization\" across universities, and the censure of \"heterodox\" ideas across British institutional life, Adonis and Blair could not be more misguided. The outcome of these struggles over history and identity will determine whether the British remain willing to identify with \"Global Britain\" in playing a role that builds on, rather than repudiates, the liberal order it has helped to build. In turn, that outcome will be determined by the defence of the freedom to challenge the new \"woke\" secular theology sweeping across the Anglophone world.The Daily TelegraphNigel Biggar is the Regius professor of moral and pastoral theology at the University of Oxford.
