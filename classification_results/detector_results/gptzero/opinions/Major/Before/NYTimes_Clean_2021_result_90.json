            "inputText": "A clash among justices over what constitutes the right to vote mirrors the partisan divide on the question.The Voting Rights Act decision that concluded the Supreme Court term this month offered two mutually exclusive visions of what the right to vote means today.Justice Samuel Alito’s opinion for the six-justice majority insisted that the law should pay little mind to the occasional “inconvenience” of casting a ballot. Justice Elena Kagan’s dissenting opinion, joined by two other justices, accused the majority of taking the “grand and obvious” right to an “equal opportunity to vote” and reducing it to nothing more than “equality-lite.”The competing visions in theBrnovich v. Democratic National Committeedecision reflected profoundly different understandings of what law needs to do to keep the basic mechanics of democracy functioning. In that, it offered an almost perfect mirror of the partisan divide over the seemingly simple concept of the right to vote.All nine justices were working from the same text, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits any voting practice or procedure “which results in a denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color” and instructs courts to consider “the totality of circumstances” in deciding whether a challenged practice has such an effect.Even so, Justice Alito called Justice Kagan’s interpretation of that language “radical”; Justice Kagan called his “tragic.” What could lead the two wings of the court to diverge so completely in interpreting that language?The case concerned two Arizona voting regulations, which the court upheld. But that wasn’t what the dispute among the justices was really about or why the decision matters so much. The basic question was the meaning of the Voting Rights Act itself: what purpose it serves, what interests it protects.That this question could even arise 56 years after the law’s enactment and 39 years after Section 2 was significantly amended reflects the fact that for most of its existence, Section 2 was almost exclusively used in cases about the racial impact of redistricting, often referred to as “vote dilution” cases. A different part of the law, Section 5, was used for “vote denial” cases challenging regulations governing access to the polls.But the Supreme Court’sShelby County decisioneight years ago rendered Section 5 inoperative, leaving lower courts to fit vote-denial cases into the Section 2 framework without guidance from the Supreme Court. So in the Arizona case, the justices were writing on a surprisingly clean slate, with almost limitless discretion to set the course of voting rights for the foreseeable future, unless and until Congress legislates a new direction.It therefore mattered when Justice Alito wrote that “mere inconvenience cannot be enough to demonstrate a violation of Section 2.” This was an essential part of his narrative. Voting doesn’t have to be easy because, after all, what in life is easy? It just has to be available.Justice Alito didn’t leave us to guess what he meant by “inconvenience.” Noting that the Voting Rights Act requires political processes to be equally “open” and to provide equal “opportunity” to all, he offered an example that he said illustrated the difference between “openness and opportunity, on the one hand, and the absence of inconvenience, on the other.”Suppose, he wrote, “that an exhibit at a museum in a particular city is open to everyone free of charge every day of the week for several months. Some residents of the city who have the opportunity to view the exhibit may find it inconvenient to do so for many reasons — the problem of finding parking, dislike of public transportation, anticipation that the exhibit will be crowded, a plethora of weekend chores and obligations, etc.”Analogies can be useful in legal analysis, but what was the purpose of that one? If some people miss a great museum exhibition because they are too lazy to go to see it, too bad for them. And if some miss the opportunity to vote because of some obstacle that Samuel Alito regards as inconsequential? An obstacle that happens to affect voters of color more than others?The only reason for this analogy, it seems to me, is to trivialize the stakes in ensuring equal access to the polls, free of obstacles that impose greater burdens on voters of color. The museum was open. So were the polls. What was the problem?History plays a role — or should — in any discussion of voting rights. The majority opinion acknowledged history, but in a profoundly distorted way. Justice Alito’s history began and ended in 1982. That was the year Congress amended Section 2 to make clear that — contrary to a 1980 Supreme Court decision — the law did not require proof of intentional discrimination. A voting practice with a racially disparate impact, regardless of the purpose for which it was adopted, could be sufficient to demonstrate a violation of Section 2. In the intervening decades, “disparate impact” has become a hotly contested concept for conservative judges, and the majority’s discomfort with the law as written was apparent.“Differences in employment, wealth, and education may make it virtually impossible for a state to devise rules that do not have some disparate impact,” Justice Alito wrote.According to Justice Alito, because 1982 was when Congress amended Section 2, voting rules that were in effect in 1982 are presumed to satisfy the test that Congress set then. For example, he said “it is relevant that in 1982 states typically required nearly all voters to cast their ballots in person on Election Day.”The obvious implication was that current Republican efforts to cut back on mail-in voting are presumptively entitled to a free pass because widespread use of mail-in ballots is a post-1982 development. The invocation of 1982 may prove to be one of the most important parts of the opinion, raising the bar for challenging some of the measures now being fought over in state capitals.Freezing the Voting Rights Act in time is also a richly ironic move. In the Shelby County decision, which Justice Alito joined, the majority’s complaint about Section 5 of the law was that Congress had failed for decades to update the formula that dictated which states were subject to federal oversight of their voting procedures. The problem with Section 5 was that it was frozen in time.Where did Justice Alito’s 1982 baseline come from? It seems to have come from his own head. That’s my reading of a colloquy he conducted during the oral argument in March. Michael Carvin, the lawyer representing Arizona, had cited “the usual burdens of voting” as a measure of a regulation that would pass Section 2 scrutiny.“What does that mean?” Justice Alito asked. “What are the ‘usual burdens of voting’? Are they the burdens as they existed in 1982? Do they change? How do we determine what they are?”Mr. Carvin, highly experienced before the Supreme Court, recognized a helping hand when he saw one. “You make a very good point about 1982,” he replied. “We know that needs to be the benchmark for the usual burdens because, otherwise, that meant Congress in 1982 was invalidating virtually every time, place, and manner restriction. So that needs to be, if you will, the safe harbor.”In her dissenting opinion, Justice Kagan homed in on the 1982 question. “The 1982 state of the world is no part of the Section 2 test,” she said. “Section 2 was meant to disrupt the status quo, not to preserve it — to eradicate then-current discriminatory practices, not to set them in amber.”To Justice Kagan, the question of whether a voting rule imposes a minor burden or a substantial one can’t be answered in the abstract. The reference in Section 2 to the “totality of circumstances” meant, she said, “that equal voting opportunity is a function of both law and background conditions — in other words, that a voting rule’s validity depends on how the rule operates in conjunction with facts on the ground.” So a regulation that appears neutral can have a discriminatory effect, such as Arizona’s prohibition against third-party ballot collection, one of the provisions that the court upheld.In Justice Alito’s view, that prohibition’s burden was inconsequential. “Arizonans who receive early ballots can submit them by going to a mailbox, a post office, an early ballot drop box, or an authorized election official’s office within the 27-day early voting period,” he wrote. “They can also drop off their ballots at any polling place or voting center on Election Day, and in order to do so, they can skip the line of voters waiting to vote in person.” And besides, he added, the prohibition of ballot collection served the state’s strong interest in preventing fraud.In response, Justice Kagan pointed out that most residents of Arizona’s vast Native American territory do not get mail delivery at home, that many do not have cars and that post offices are often an hour away. “Given those facts,” she wrote, “the law prevents many Native Americans from making effective use of one of the principal means of voting in Arizona.” She added, “What is an inconsequential burden for others is for these citizens a severe hardship.”“No fraud involving ballot collection has ever come to light in the state,” Justice Kagan noted. In the three dissenters’ view, a voting regulation with a racially disparate impact is invalid if the plaintiff can show that the state’s interest can be met by a less discriminatory policy. This was the “radical” interpretation of Section 2 that so alarmed Justice Alito.These are lengthy opinions — 37 pages for the majority and 41 for the dissent. I’ve read them many times over the past two weeks, and it strikes me that in addition to telling different narratives, Justice Alito and Justice Kagan were engaged in different projects. What Justice Alito was doing was writing a road map for like-minded judges on the lower courts who will soon be getting the Section 2 cases generated by current Republican efforts. Here is how you do it, the majority opinion says to them. Here is how you uphold the new laws.Justice Kagan, along with Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, who signed onto her opinion, had a different project.
