In this enterprise, it may have been necessary for Starmer to express his feelings about his familyto Piers Morgan- my jury's out - but it is not sufficient. He won't coalesce as a politician until he says something that costs him: something a Conservative couldn't say, something that will win him enemies as well as friends.He will never be able to mimic the buffoonery of his opponent, but he shouldn't just accept the other side of the binary - the mirthless technocrat - as his lot. The best single answer to the conundrum of conveying both authenticity and humour would be to come clean: to walk, undefended, straight into the territory he's been avoiding. He seems to fear the shadow of his Mr Remain reputation in a post-Brexit landscape, along with his human rights hinterland in a morally debased discourse. But everybody knows that's who he is. This would be a powerful moment to admit it.The pandemic has masked some important political realignments. Nationally, there is increasing revulsion against the realities of life after a decade of Conservatism - the racism, the aggressive ethno-nationalism, the child food poverty, which is really just a modern way of saying \"hardship\". This is currently finding all its expression through football, whether that's players taking the knee, Gareth Southgate'spowerful argumentfor progressive patriotism or Marcus Rashford'sschool meals campaigning.  Meanwhile, internationally, Joe Biden's unexpected courage and clarity - on climate change, super wealth, tax avoidance, vaccine hoarding - is invigorating progressives in the US and beyond. A radical programme from the Labour party would be nothing like as novel and discombobulating in this context as it was in 2015.There's a view that if Labour loses thebyelectionnext month in Batley and Spen, the party will be drained of whatever mojo it had left. In a curious echo of footballers taking on the work of politicians, political analysis has adopted the rubric of football: Labour has got to win this match or else its manager will be sacked. But for whoever is leading the party, the challenge remains: when politics resumes, they need to be ready.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"
