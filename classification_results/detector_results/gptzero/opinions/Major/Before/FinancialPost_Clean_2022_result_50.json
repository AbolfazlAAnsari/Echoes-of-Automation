Russia positions itself at the gates of Ukraine. U.S.-EU hardens its tone and announces the military reinforcement of NATO at the gates of Russia. Russia invades Ukraine, escalates, and increases its attacks on the Ukrainian people. U.S.-EU imposes economic and diplomatic sanctions on Russia, its leaders and their oligarch friends. Russia steps up its bombardment of Ukrainian cities. U.S.-EU ratchets up its sanctions against Russian institutions, athletes, artists, and ordinary citizens. Finland and Sweden ask to join NATO. And so on and so on.Predictably, the current scenario of a bad Nash equilibrium that worsens almost daily becomes increasingly entrenched. We risk being trapped in it indefinitely, witnessing a horrible and tragic daily spectacle on the backs of vulnerable populations - not just in Ukraine but throughout the world, given the direct effects of food, energy and fertilizer shortages as well as the inflation they help cause.And there are less obvious but no less serious longer-term effects, including the damage, in a time of international polarization, to democratic movements in both totalitarian states such as Russia and China and semi-totalitarian ones, like Turkey and many others. At the same time, the civilization-building force of free trade is eroded by the ill-advised push for national autonomy and self-sufficiency in energy, food, telecoms, pharmaceuticals, and other industries, and the similarly ill-advised willingness of governments to divert and squander their citizens' human capital and natural resources in support of so-called national champions, a bottomless pit of crony capitalism.The real long-term challenge to Germany, Europe, and the West is, not to undo energy contracts and other trade deals with Russia or to banish Russian goods and services from international value chains, but rather to make international contracts and deals more resilient by strengthening free-trade rules and the institutions of a capitalism for the people. Less trade means more wars, including potential nuclear wars. Resilient trade is part of the solution.For no good reason, civilization is suffering a setback likely to be measured in decades. And the danger of escalation is real and acute - to the detriment of people everywhere.Marcel Boyer: If young people forget and fail us, my generation will never forgive them!(https://financialpost.com/opinion/marcel-boyer-if-young-people-forget-and-fail-us-my-generation-will-never-forgive-them)Marcel Boyer: Consumption inequality is way down.

But it is not impossible and there is an alternative win-win equilibrium, a lesser of two evils: a Russia-U.S.-EU cooperative treaty to get out of the current bad Nash dynamics. For the sake of the Ukrainian people and the protection and furtherance of democracy and civilization, diplomats from all sides must step up and become the architects of a solution, not only to stop the war itself but to design the conditions for a lasting peace and to rebuild the foundations of international cooperation and trade so as to foster economic development and growth.To reaffirm and consolidate the post-Cold War peace, Russia's fear of encirclement by NATO countries, whether real or illusory, has to be addressed. This implies the effective neutrality of the states bordering Russia - which means outside NATO and the EU and free of military activities - as well as an independent Crimea and relative autonomy within Ukraine of the Donbas region.To guarantee the freedom of these buffer states to make their own social, political and economic choices - excluding membership in NATO or the EU - a U.S.-EU-Russia treaty would articulate formal commitments to intervene militarily in these states to counter any military interventions by the other side. In effect, a treaty would create a dual NATO-Russia \"defensive alliance\" in which each party had the ability and mandate to intervene effectively. Such a treaty would provide a simple framework for responsible freedom, as well as an operational and credible balance of terror.Under the auspices of a strengthened World Trade Organization, the treaty would allow and indeed promote trade agreements between those bordering countries and Western Europe, as well as with other parts of the globe, including Russia, China, Africa, and America. Their leaders and governments would be encouraged to concentrate their energies on social and economic development. Nothing would or should prevent them from doing so, while remaining members - with Russia - of the Council of Europe.Any takers?Marcel Boyer is professor emeritus of economics at the University of Montreal. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
