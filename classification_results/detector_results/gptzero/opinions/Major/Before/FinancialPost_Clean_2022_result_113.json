            "inputText": "By Jesse Hartery and Geoffrey SigaletMuch has been said since Alberta Premier Danielle Smith released her proposed Alberta Sovereignty Within a United Canada Act. In a piece(https://thehub.ca/2022-12-01/opinion-the-alberta-sovereignty-act-appears-to-be-constitutional/) published last week, we noted that the bill appeared to be constitutionally compliant based on existing law. We stand by that position. We acknowledged that \"[i]t was not always clear what shape this bill would take, and much remains open to debate.\" Since then, the debate has continued, and some points merit a response.At the outset, it must be remembered that the bill creates a framework for Alberta's legislature to pass resolutions that enable the provincial executive to refuse to enforce targeted federal laws. This outlines a process for future actions. As a result, any analysis at this stage is inherently limited to the framework as drafted and can only be tentative. If the Alberta government applies the framework in an unconstitutional manner, it should and will be struck down by the courts.This leads us to emphasize a few points.First, as a matter of constitutional law, we reiterate that a province cannot(https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/october-2022/is-the-alberta-sovereignty-act-constitutional/) relieve someone of an obligation to comply with federal laws or ignore court rulings declaring provincial action unconstitutional. In other words, we agree with others(https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/alberta-sovereign-act-constitutional-experts-1.6669936) who have also expressed the view that a province cannot nullify federal laws.This rule applies to every person within a province. As our courts(https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/ukjcpc/doc/1924/1924canlii461/1924canlii461.html?autocompleteStr=r%20v%20caron%201924&;autocompletePos=1) and courts in other federal systems have explained, provincial officials can be required to comply with laws of general application. In the United States, for instance, this has been explained as permitting Congress to \"evenhandedly regulat[e] an activity(https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-476_dbfi.pdf)\" in which both officials and a private actor engage. Constitutional concerns only arise in this context when one government targets the officials of another for differential treatment.However, the provincial executive branch is not required to co-operate in the administration of federal laws or programs. Similarly, the federal government cannot be compelled to administer provincial laws or programs. In principle, each government has its own executive branch for the purpose of administering its own laws. This is the current state(https://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/sclr/vol94/iss1/4/) of Canadian constitutional law, unless the Supreme Court of Canada decides to change course. And as one of us explained previously(https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/october-2022/is-the-alberta-sovereignty-act-constitutional/), this is consistent with the approach adopted in other federal systems. Given the various ways(https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/toothless-alberta-sovereignty-act) in which the provincial power of non-enforcement has been exercised throughout Canadian history, we suggest that it is shortsighted to dismiss this power categorically.In our view, the bill as written did not seek to nullify federal laws but was instead limited to declining to administer federal laws or programs. This was informed by the background context surrounding the bill. The language used(https://twitter.com/ABDanielleSmith/status/1598033487352958976?s=20&;t=l5MqxlxspX16uSe_LtlmuA) by the premier and her team suggested their proposal was limited to the \"refusal to enforce\" federal laws. In addition, the Information Sheet(https://www.alberta.ca/assets/documents/alberta-sovereignty-within-a-united-canada-act-info-sheet.pdf) accompanying the bill indicated that it was meant to permit the province to direct provincial entities \"to not enforce specific federal laws or policies.\" We would note that this wording(https://globalnews.ca/news/9322539/alberta-premier-danielle-smith-sovereignty-bill/) continues to be used by the premier in public statements and in the legislature.We deduced the government's intention from the structure of the bill itself, while acknowledging that, on its face, the text of the proposed law was potentially susceptible to a different interpretation with respect to provincial officials. If an amendment is needed to clarify the scope of the bill, it should be considered by the legislative assembly. But one thing is clear: if the Alberta government meant to go beyond declining to administer federal laws or if they choose to do so in the future, it is undeniable that they would face a constitutional hurdle.Second, we respectfully disagree with those who argue that the bill is inconsistent with the separation of powers because it permits the Legislative Assembly of Alberta to express a view on the constitutionality of federal laws. Instead, we share the view(https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/alberta-sovereign-act-constitutional-experts-1.6669936) advanced by former Supreme Court justice Jack Major. As we have explained, the provinces are already invested with the power to decline enforcement of federal laws. While the mechanism deployed here may be novel, it merely provides Alberta with an opportunity to offer reasons for declining to enforce federal laws, which is consistent with the scholarship(https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/lawpub/290/) on co-ordinate constitutional interpretation.Rahim Mohamed: Danielle Smith's Alberta Sovereignty Act pretty awkward for the RCMP(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/alberta-sovereignty-act-awkward-for-rcmp)Carson Jerema: Surprise, Danielle Smith's sovereignty act is very likely constitutional(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/carson-jerema-surprise-danielle-smiths-sovereignty-act-is-very-likely-constitutional)Finally, we share the concern expressed by others with respect to Henry VIII clauses that enable the executive to modify legislation. Our arguments were directed to the question of legal validity and, on that score, the Supreme Court's most recent pronouncement on the issue holds(https://canlii.ca/t/jdwnw#par87) that they are constitutionally valid. However, we observed that these clauses can be controversial(https://thehub.ca/2022-12-01/opinion-the-alberta-sovereignty-act-appears-to-be-constitutional/) and \"problematic for many reasons,(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/carson-jerema-surprise-danielle-smiths-sovereignty-act-is-very-likely-constitutional)\" and that those criticizing them on democratic grounds were \"raising important points.(https://thehub.ca/2022-12-01/opinion-the-alberta-sovereignty-act-appears-to-be-constitutional/)\" The Alberta government has responded(https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/changes-coming-to-alberta-s-proposed-sovereignty-act-after-concerns-over-powers-given-to-cabinet-1.6673623) to that criticism and is suggesting that it will bring forward amendments on this issue. We would encourage such amendments.In sum, the bill can only be constitutional if it permits the province to exercise existing powers under our federal system. If it offends these principles in its application, then the courts will be justified in intervening. But we would reiterate that the fact that provincial non-enforcement is constitutional does not necessarily mean that it is advisable. There are arguments both for and against making this decision in individual cases. That decision is rightly reserved for the democratically elected representatives of Alberta.Special to National PostJesse Hartery is a lawyer and an incoming PhD candidate at Melbourne Law School in Australia.Geoffrey Sigalet is the Director of the UBC Centre for Constitutional Law and Legal Studies and an Assistant Professor of Political Science at UBC Okanagan. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
