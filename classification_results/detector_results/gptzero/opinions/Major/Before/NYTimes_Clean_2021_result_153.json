But in his several examples, he demonstrates that language evolves to become clearer and more precise, not to confuse and obscure.The problem with using “they” to refer to a single person is that it makes the sentence incomprehensible. Each time it pops up I find myself backtracking to find out who these other people are in the sentence. Inserting unclarity into writing for political purposes is not watching a language evolve naturally; it is sacrificing communication to someone’s worldview.Sheryl ReichNew YorkTo the Editor:When I saw this article, I tensed up, ready for a fight. My sibling and I are both transgender. Then I kept reading. John McWhorter’s article felt like home. I wanted to grab my sibling and all of the wonderful queer people I love and say, Maybe we are OK. Maybe we can be OK.We went through years of school being taught that queerness does not belong in public education. I have never read anything like Mr. McWhorter’s article. The idea that conversations around pronouns can be more than whether or not gender-neutral pronouns are legitimate feels thrilling. Thank you, Mr. McWhorter. Thank you so much.Adam Denenfeld KellyNorthampton, Mass.The writer is 14 years old.To the Editor:John McWhorter assures us we’ll easily get used to the singular “they.” Curiously, he doesn’t mention its actual linguistic downside. It’s not that it breaks rules; it’s that it often reduces clarity.Anyway, platitudes about natural language drift won’t sway doubters any more than now-ubiquitous jibes at the “grammar police” will, because the issue is not really grammar. It’s gender. The “pronoun-hesitant” fear not a drift but a movement. They’re implicitly being asked to kick their habit of seeing people, including themselves, as fundamentally male or female, and they’re aware that this has larger cultural and political implications.Rather than dismissing their uneasiness, over language or gender, let’s admit that it’s hard to change how we talk. We should do it anyway. We’ve jumped through hoops for the gender police for millennia. We can jump through a few more when some pathbreaking soul asks us to see them simply as themselves.Chris NelsonAnn Arbor, Mich.The writer is a freelance copy editor.To the Editor:John McWhorter, as authoritative a language maven as one could find, is perplexingly deferential to the brand-new “they,” despite the fact that the word combines open misappropriation, guaranteed confusion and sufficient braking power to stop thought and speech in their tracks. His citation of historical precedents for shifts in meaning and lexical innovations may be relevant to a defense of the new usage, but it hardly provides decisive grounds for acquittal. “They” for “s/he,” to put it plainly, is a linguistic calamity.This judgment is in no way a denial of the need for a “nonbinary” pronoun. English as we know it is patently ill prepared for a third or fourth gender, and those who find themselves disregarded by the standard breakdown are fully entitled to suitable remedies. But why have they not built new pronouns from scratch? They are, after all, a population for whom creativity has been a governing way of life.The most natural coinages would be those that form a set with “she” and “he” such as “que” (“kwee”), “re” and “xe.” Could anything be closer to the heart of the L.G.B.T.Q. community than the first of those? And this is just a starter in the brainstorming exercise. The nonbinary community may pick it up from here.Simon MarcusOakland, Calif.To the Editor:I agree with John McWhorter that languages are “meant to evolve”; indeed, that is one of the sources of their endless fascination. But the introduction of “they” and “them” to replace gender-specific pronouns in English is both clumsy and unnecessarily disruptive. It also reveals a lack of imagination.The replacement of Miss and Mrs. by Ms., which Mr. McWhorter notes, was elegant and efficient; using “they” and “them” as both singular and plural is simply obfuscatory. Verb-subject agreement is not a form of gender entrapment — it’s a thing of beauty. Let us hope that those who wish to neutralize gender will come up with something that simultaneously enriches our language.Sonya MichelSilver Spring, Md.The writer is professor emerita of history, American studies and women’s studies at the University of Maryland, College Park.To the Editor:To John McWhorter’s call for acceptance of evolving, gender-neutral language, I offer these neologisms: s/he (she-he), which works in print but pronounced “shy,” herm (her-him), and herm’s (possessive). They are not a great departure from what is.Richard RosenthalNew YorkTo the Editor:Kudos to John McWhorter, whose cogent “lesson” on linguistic evolution, while condensed, is accessible and clear.Even the most socially liberal can find it exhausting to keep abreast of changing standards in appropriate and/or acceptable words and behaviors. Mr. McWhorter’s explanation of the singular use of “they,” which at first blush seems incomprehensible, provides welcome relief for those who, as he concedes, are weary.As one who tries to remain open-minded in the face of often befuddling changes in popular thought, I’m glad to be reminded that sometimes merely adjusting one’s perspective can make all the difference.Cathy N. GoldsteinNew YorkTo the Editor:I’m someone who often uses “they” as a singular pronoun out of respect for those who prefer it, but, admittedly, I struggle with it. An important component of language is its precision. If we’re really going to celebrate changes in language, as the writer advocates, why not do away with all pronouns that specify our gender and opt for those that clarify our number?I love the Swedish introduction of the gender-neutral“hen”and would embrace a new English language gender-neutral pronoun, in both its singular and plural forms.Terry KleinbergNew YorkTo the Editor:Thanks to Prof. John McWhorter for reminding us that life goes on as the English language evolves to reflect changes in social perspectives. But as I read his essay, I kept waiting for him to suggest what seems to me the obvious compromise in the standoff between those who want gender neutrality in pronouns (replacing “they” for “he” or “she”) and us English majors (and other self-appointed Keepers of Proper Grammar) who wish to preserve singular/plural distinctions so as to avoid confusion. (For example, if it’s “their” dessert, do they automatically get two pieces?)Why not use the perfectly good, time-tested pronoun one to describe individuals in a nonbinary way? The British do it all the time.With this simple solution, he or she can have one’s cake and we can all eat it together.Susan R. FriedesMamaroneck, N.Y.To the Editor:Yes, language is meant to evolve. On the matter of personal pronouns, best to let it evolve naturally rather than forcing the change with conscious effort based on an idea. As Prof. John McWhorter correctly states, “It isn’t whether but how things will change over time.” Let language follow its own course. Don’t force it.Gunther TheurerNew YorkTo the Editor:It would seem that the advocates of “they” in the singular are unconsciously channeling Walt Whitman, who said, “I am large, I contain multitudes.”S.T.
