A year ago, we had no COVID-19 vaccinations, Halloween was cancelled in many parts of the country, and we were entering a winter of fear. This October we should take stock of how far we have come heading into Halloween 2021:1. Outdoor activities are OKFrom the beginning, even before vaccination, it has been obvious that interactions outdoors are very unlikely to transmit COVID(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32656368/ ). We almost never identify super-spreader events that have resulted from an outdoor event or gathering. This winter, go out and enjoy skiing, snowshoeing or a nice walk in the park - for your mental and physical health.2. Population immunity has defanged the virusVaccines reduce severe outcomes by 96 per cent and Canada has vaccinated almost 90 per cent(https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a3) of those who are eligible; 91 per cent of Canadians over 70 are fully vaccinated. If you are somebody with a normal immune system(https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/6/7/ofz225/5510081), and you are either vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19, your chances of getting sick enough to need the hospital are very, very small - no higher than other common respiratory virus such as the flu. The notable exception is those who have weakened immune systems. Providing more vaccine doses and using novel therapies may help those people fight off disease. If you are at risk and don't have immunity, there is still the opportunity to protect yourself by getting vaccinated. Even a single shot reduces your risk of getting very sick; two are even better.3. The Delta variant shouldn't spook us any longerDelta is now causing most COVID-19 infections in Canada. Some people were concerned that the Delta variant would be more deadly, but it hasn't proven to be so since hospitalizations and deaths are lower and dropping in most places. Even in low-risk populations that aren't yet vaccinated, such as younger children, Delta variant(https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.06.21264467v1) is proving to be no more likely to result in hospitalization or death than previous variants.4. For most kids, COVID-19 is the snifflesParents worry about their children, but every piece of data provides reassurance(https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html#a). In Canada we have had almost 350 000 cases of COVID-19 cases in people under the age of 20 with only 0.5 per cent needing hospitalization. Of those, almost two-thirds were admitted for reasons other than COVID. In short, 99.9 per cent of kids who contract COVID-19 are fine. Even before vaccines were available, the risk of death by accident was seven times higher than from COVID (based on a mean from Statistics Canada of 128 accidental deaths per annum for one to 14 year olds). Data from schools around the world have also proven that transmission is rare in schools and even in areas of high community spread, Delta variant or not, the risk of hospitalization is low and deaths are very rare for children and teachers alike. Likewise, we need not fear \"long COVID.\"(https://journals.lww.com/pidj/Abstract/9000/How_Common_Is_Long_COVID_in_Children_and.95677.aspx) Multiple well-performed studies put the risk of prolonged symptoms after COVID infection in children at between zero and one per cent, with resolution to normal within 12 weeks.5. Much of the world is giving up restrictions, and we will have to followWhile some places such as Saskatchewan, B.C. and Alberta have seen recent surges, we are seeing that places that were hardest hit at the beginning of the pandemic, like Ontario and Quebec, have been having much smaller fourth waves. There are many factors that may explain why some places are doing well and others aren't, including previous population exposure and vaccination rates. Places like the U.K., Denmark, Norway and many U.S. states have lifted restrictions, and disease rates have dropped or stabilized, not increased. Likewise, deaths have remained low in most places, especially those with high levels of immunity.COVID-19 is becoming a part of life where caution is needed by a few, but the rest of us need to move on. We need to learn from these experiences as we move to an endemic (\"we need to live with it\") mindset. We do the same when we drive, play sports, or cross the street. This is especially true for children who need to catch up after 18 months of severe restrictions. This Halloween cherish the little goblins, fairies and witches; their costumes may be scary, but we shouldn't be afraid.National PostDr. Jennifer Grant is an infectious diseases specialist in Vancouver.
