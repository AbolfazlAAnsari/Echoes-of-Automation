His statement that the race debate is boring demonstrates an old right-wing tactic to shut the topic altogether.Ali Abbas                                          London NW10Nandy's handy reparteeI read John Rentoul's column (Lisa Nandy's ferocious attack on New Labour gives her a final stab at victory, 22 January) with interest and now sense this woman has a lot to offer this Labour leadership contest.But I must admit I still feel that Keir Starmer, with his legal, forensic brain might fare better with hoisting Boris Johnson with his own petard when the occasion arises, as it undoubtedly will.However, Nandy is now ticking many boxes. She appears to be a thoughtful woman with many incisive views. There is more to her that admittedly I realised and if she floored Piers Morgan, there is much more to be celebrated. He is an interviewer who tries to ride roughshod over his interviewees, so to stand firm and composed is \"gold star\" territory. This will be an interesting contest and hopefully the start of the long-awaited renaissance of this party, which is much needed as a valid and trenchant opposition in these parlous heavy-weighted Conservative government times we are forced to live in.Judith A Daniels                                          Great YarmouthLaurence Fox responds after criticising use of Sikh soldier in the film '1917'The 51st stateSo the Brexit button has finally been pushed. The next question is whether the country will soar like a bird as the Leave campaign has told everybody, or if this could be the start of a rollercoaster ride with more downs than ups.However, the real reason for Brexit, is becoming clearer. Leave campaigners seem to want a very close trade relationship with the US, but leaving the EU to join forces with Trump would not have been as easy to sell to the general public as getting sovereignty back.Fifty years ago in the school playground, we would joke that Britain would one day be the US's 51st state. Many a true word is said in jest.Alan Hutchinson                                          Address supplied"
