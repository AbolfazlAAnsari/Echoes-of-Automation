Last year. At the same time NYPD officers have been making significantly fewer arrests. Collars were down 62% in the 28 days leading up to July 12,” the Queens Daily Eagle reported.In addition to the disbanding of at least two crime units, new city regulations limit what NYPD officers are allowed to do during an arrest, compelling many to observe it has become almost impossible for an officer to do his or her job without committing a crime.No wonder Democrats and the left never take responsibility for their policies that continue to destroy cities and lives. One would be inclined to call these “failures,” but it is becoming more urgent to recognize that this downward trajectory of civil order and quality of life is perhaps exactly what the American left really wants.All these “blue cities” have things in common, including gun control, sanctuary city policies and hostility toward law enforcement. If any of these mayors and governors were serious about wanting to stop the death and destruction, they could do it, but it would require repudiating everything they stand for. Instead, lying and misleading becomes the standard of the day.FROM TAMMY BRUCETammy Bruce is a Fox News contributor and New York Times best-selling author.
