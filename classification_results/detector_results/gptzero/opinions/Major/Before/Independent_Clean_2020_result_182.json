We must be guided by the humanity and resolve of courageous women who have suffered greatly from the conflict and yet refuse to be blinded by hate. Their words envision the future the region needs and deserves. Our actions must help this vision prevail.Signed,Micheline Calmy-Rey, former president, Switzerland; Tarja Halonen, former president, Finland; Roza Otunbayeva, former president, Kyrgyzstan; Mary Robinson, former UN commissioner for Human Rights and former president, Ireland; Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Nobel Peace Laureate, former president, Liberia; and 38 othe                       rsDon't make friends with a bullyBy passing the Hong Kong security law, China has shown contempt for international agreements. In fact, it has nothing but contempt for anything that is outside of its narrow ideology - just look at what they are doing to the Uighurs. It is a bully, a tyrant and everyone knows how to deal with a bully - stand up to them.Surely it is past time for us to show some international leadership and impose economic sanctions - yes, look for an international consensus, but if it can't be found then we must act unilaterally. Every dollar of trade is a dollar in the hands of an oppressive regime.When you find yourself in bed with an abuser, the sooner you get out the better.Angela Lee                                          CambridgeExcellent workNot for the first time I must write to praise Dave Brown for his latest cartoon. It is absolutely brilliant. And utterly vicious. The details are wonderful, from the Union Jack underpants to the peanuts on the loser's side of the table and his handful of jokers as against his opponent, brilliantly portrayed, with all the cards in his hand and his winnings - so far - stacked up in front of him. Promise you will never let Dave Brown go.Rosemary Mathew                                           CambridgeHypocrisy?Vince Cable talks aboutLabour and the Lib Dems working togetherin a future government. It's a pity that the affinity he feels now wasn't demonstrated when the Lib Dems went into coalition with David Cameron, thus alienating voters who voted Lib Dem strategically with the intention of keeping the Tories out of power. It will take a long time for such voters to trust the Lib Dems with their votes in the future.Patrick Cleary                                          GloucestershireLitter bugsI have just watched an item about the gross, damaging littering that has taken place over the weekend and which has been building up since the pandemic began. A simple message: the antics of this inept, corrupt government - Johnson, Cummings, Jenrick, Hancock et al - and the toxic manipulations of the facts do not give you permission to behave like them. My local park at Kirkstall Abbey looks like a rubbish tip. It's an utter disgrace. Don't lower yourselves to their toxic level.T Maunder                                          LeedsGet closeIs it true or is it just rumour that there's a plan to reduce social distancing on Love Island to 1mm?Anthony Bron                                          Oxford"
