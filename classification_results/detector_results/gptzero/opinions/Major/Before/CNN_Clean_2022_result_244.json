Those legislative efforts followlast month's horrific shootingthat claimed the lives of 19 schoolchildren and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas.The platform, set to be approved,called for repealing or nullifying gun lawsalready in place, such as theGun Control Act of 1968, which prevents felons and other dangerous people from being able to purchase a gun legally. Apparently, the Texas GOP believes that even dangerous people should have a constitutionally protected right to buy a gun.TheTexas GOP platformalso embraced ramping up anti-abortion rhetoric in public schools. For example, the platform states that \"Texas students should learn about the Humanity of the Preborn Child, including ... that life begins at fertilization.\" It even seeks to force students to watch \"a live ultrasound\" and for high-schoolers to read an anti-abortion booklet thatcritics say\"includes scientifically unsupported claims and shames women seeking abortion care,\" according to The Texas Tribune.It sounds like the curriculum that you might find in a theocratic government such as the Taliban -- not one in the United States funded by taxpayer dollars. But the GOP in large swaths of this country is no longer hesitant to support laws to impose its religious beliefs -- as we see with measures some Republicans champion thatwould totally ban abortion. The GOP convention's document additionally urges officials \"not to infringe on Texas school students' and staffs' rightsto pray and engage in religious speech.\"The Texas GOP platform also does its best to demonize those in the transgender community. It describestransgender peopleas suffering from \"a genuine and extremely rare mental health condition.\" And it sees sexual reassignment surgery as a form of medical malpractice.The platform takes aim at gay Americans as well with the statement that homosexuality is \"an abnormal lifestyle choice.\" Instructively, the Texas GOP platform did not includesuch language in 2018 and 2020.This platform gives us a glimpse into the views of the Republican base on key issues that in turn will pressure GOP elected officials in Texas -- and possibly beyond the state -- to adopt similarly extreme positions or run the risk of a primary challenge from an even more extreme Republican.What caused this move to the far right? Brandon Rottinghaus, a political scientist at the University of Houston, told The Texas Tribune about the state GOP's new extreme platform, \"Donald Trump radicalized the party and accelerated the demands from the base.\" He added alarmingly, \"There simply aren't limits now on what the base might ask for.\"I agree -- in part. I don't think Trump radicalized the base -- rather he simply gave people permission to be who they always wanted to be.But I agree with Rottinghaus that there are now no limits for what the GOP base might seek -- be it rejecting election results it doesn't agree with to enacting more laws based on extreme religious beliefs. And that should deeply alarm every American who wants to live in a democratic republic.Correction: An earlier version of this piece mistakenly stated the Texas Republican Party platform had been approved already. The platform is set to be approved once the votes from the weekend's convention have been fully tallied.Opinion by Dean ObeidallahTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
