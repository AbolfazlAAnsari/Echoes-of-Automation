But once the first blood rush of protest subsides, the people who are still on the streets are mocked by their erstwhile allies, impatient to find fault with the movement and get back to their lives without any further disruption. What was universally celebrated a few weeks ago is now faintly embarrassing: too radical, too combative, almost comically unrealistic. You might think of the trajectory of the Black Lives Matter protests so far as like that famous quotemisattributed to Gandhi, but this time in reverse: first you win, then they fight you, then they laugh at you, then they ignore you.We have a great knack for supporting victims once the injustices are out in the open - when David and Goliath have been clearly identified, and a particularly British sensibility of fair play has been assailed. In theWindrush scandal, popular anger and support for the victims of the Home Office is what put a stop to their deportations and led to the resignation of Amber Rudd. National fury, at the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, managed to pressure an obstinate, bunkered government into scrapping the outrageousNHS surcharge for NHS staff, and extendingresidency rightsto all the bereaved families of NHS victims of coronavirus. If it hadn't been for Boris Johnson's terror of losing him, the country's disgust atDominic Cummingswould have turfed him out too, so mortally had he wounded the nation's sense of justice.But when it comes to the underlying injustice - to making the links between thedeportation and death of a Windrush citizen,the NHS worker impoverished by Home Office fees and unsettled by cruel hostile environment policies, the unelected special adviser breaking lockdown rules, and the political party we keep voting in - we're not so good.The same is now happening with the Black Lives Matter movement. Everyone is on board with the principle, but when it comes to the change that is required, the idealistic passengers the movement picked up along the way suddenly come down with a case of extreme pragmatism.Part of the reason for their belated reluctance is that the course of actual change is unflashy. After the first moment passes, the supportive ally has nothing to show for their continued backing for the cause: there are no public high-fives for your continuing solidarity. You can't post it, you can't hashtag it; most of the time you can't even do it without jeopardising something, whether that's your income, status, job prospects or even friendships.But the main reason for the ebbing support is that change is just hard. If it wasn't, the long arc of history that allegedly bends towards justice would be a very short one. And change is supposed to be hard. It is supposed to be political.Movements such as Black Lives Matter aren't hobbies or social clubs or edgy pop culture moments to be accessorised with. Change is supposed to have an agenda, otherwise it's just a trend. When we hear thatliberal politicians think the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement are nonsense, or that wearing a badge is political, or that support needs to be scaled back because it looks like there might be other,more nefarious forces at play, what we are really being told is: this is hard - and we are retreating to our comfort zones.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist"
