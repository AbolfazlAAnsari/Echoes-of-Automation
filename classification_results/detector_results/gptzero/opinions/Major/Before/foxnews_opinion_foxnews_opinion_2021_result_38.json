Usually, they are nightmares. He was in it this time, as if nothing was wrong and life was just as it was. Boring. Perfectly boring. They were laughing about something, watching TV together just as they used to. For a split second she is still in the dream as she reaches her hand across the bed to touch him.But he isnâ€™t there.She remembers now. And with that realization comes the gut-wrenching wave of grief that she is all too familiar with. Tears well up. She squeezes her eyes shut and clutches her fists tightly in front of her face. She wants to scream but she knows from experience it doesnâ€™t really help, and it scares her son, who is still too young to understand whatâ€™s going on. His dad waskilled in actiona year ago, when he was just 2 years old. He misses him, she can tell, but itâ€™s obvious he doesnâ€™t know how to process death yet.By now, the calls and friendly check-ins have mostly stopped. It was amazing at first, when the community pulled together in the most incredible of ways. She was grateful. She truly didnâ€™t have to worry about anything, whether it was groceries or work or even money. What themilitarydidnâ€™t provide was made up for by his fellow SEALs and their wives.NEWT GINGRICH: THE WOKE LEFT AND MEDIA ALLIES ARE ON THE ATTACK BUT AMERICANS OF ALL RACES REMAIN PATRIOTICBut eventually people move on. They donâ€™t forget, per se, but they go back to their routines. They come over and try to make conversation. She isnâ€™t good at conversation anymore, so she tells them that sheâ€™s doing fine, even though she isnâ€™t. They figure they should come by less and less. Only a couple still check in occasionally. She used to be close with his family, but grief does strange things to people, and they donâ€™t talk much anymore except to arrange visits with her son.To miss someone profoundly is to wonder what life would be like if they were still there. To know that every moment would be better if they were back in your arms. Every morning would be normal, instead of a crushing blow to the soul. Every evening would be full of laughter, instead of just â€¦ empty. Even some marital bickering would be welcome. What she would give, even for a fight over the obnoxious way he loaded the dishwasher.For those of us who have lost our brothers to war, we grieve. We miss them. We never forget. But we are not broken by it. We know this is the life we chose, to be on the front lines, to serve in the most dangerous of ways. Crazy, maybe, but true nonetheless.But for the Gold Star widow, she never pursued war. She was asked by her husband and her country to remain behind and remain strong, often not knowing whether or not her soulmate was even in danger. She learned to get through the nights while he was on deployment by imagining what he was doing, picturing him bored and playing Call of Duty instead of prepping for a mission. She had practice, given they had been through four deployments together.This is the real Memorial Day. It is the day that never goes away, with no real beginning and no end.But now, his brothers in arms have moved on to the next deployment, and she is the only one that wakes up alone each morning. She gets no reprieve, no rest from the grief. She is the one who must endure.Another year goes by. She begins to function better and starts a foundation in her husbandâ€™s name. He was passionate about horses, growing up on a ranch, so she raises money to get disabled vets and special needs kids trained to ride. It helps a little, and it keeps her busy. It keeps him alive, in a small way. Being around the horses reminds her of him in a pleasant kind of way. She finds herself searching the horseâ€™s gaze for some kind of sign from him, as if he might speak through them somehow. She still hasnâ€™t cleaned out his closet. The smell of his clothes is all she has left.A couple more years go by, and she goes on a few dates. Nice guys, but no sparks fly. Not like the first time she met her husband. At first, she thinks she should date outside the military completely. Seems to make sense. But itâ€™s impossible. These guys donâ€™t get it, on any level. They are intimidated by her, never knowing what to say. Losing hope, she reconnects with an old teammate of her husbandâ€™s for drinks, and for the first time in a while she remembers what a connection feels like. It turns into more, and a year later theyâ€™re talking about marriage.She will always be her late husbandâ€™s wife, a reality that only her late husbandâ€™s teammate can understand. They marry, and sheâ€™s beginning to remember what joy feels like again. The pain is finally dulled, but it never really goes away.This is the real Memorial Day. It is the day that never goes away, with no real beginning and no end. It isnâ€™t one day a year, but a constant ache deep down in the soul of those who understand what real sacrifice is. For everyone else it is only once a year, a time to recall that these sacrifices happened at all and that we should remember them.
