In this special feature, Times Opinion writers rank the evening on a scale of 1 to 10: 1 means the night was a disaster for Republicans; 10 means it could lead to a big polling bump for the Trump-Pence ticket. Here’s what our columnists and contributors thought of the event, which highlighted Eric Trump, Tiffany Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Melania Trump.Best MomentsWajahat Ali I can’t pretend what we witnessed was in any way normal, routine or healthy for this nation. I refuse to judge it by a lower standard and rank a best moment, or to choose a least-horrible moment, from a night of gaslighting, falsehoods and fearmongering. I think this only normalizes vulgarity and dysfunction and harms this country. But, because I’m charitable, at least I didn’t laugh out loud this time.Jamelle Bouie I am not the target audience for this event, so I’m trying to approach it as a neutral observer. From that perspective, the testimonials from ordinary people — emceed by Vice President Mike Pence — were the best produced and most effective moments of the night. The people in question felt genuine, and Pence is a talented performer of political empathy. That segment was also something of a paean to Abraham Lincoln, and I can’t help but appreciate that.Linda Chavez The most appealing face of the evening: Jon Ponder, the convicted bank robber who turned his life around and founded Hope for Prisoners, a re-entry program. He managed to humanize Trump in a way not even his children could. Trump’s issuing a pardon for Ponder during the convention was an attention-getting stunt, but Ponder certainly deserved it, which is more than can be said for other recipients of Trump’s mercy like Roger Stone and Joe Arpaio.Gail Collins Ryan Holets: You can’t beat the cop who adopted an addict’s baby.Michelle Cottle Trump’s pardoning of Jon Ponder. Was this a cheap political stunt? Yep. But it was still an act of decency. Ponder looked weepy. His wife was beaming. And it put the spotlight on criminal justice reform, Trump’s rare bipartisan policy achievement.Michelle Goldberg What does “best” mean in the context of a pageant full of lies meant to entrench fascism? In another context, the naturalization ceremony might have been inspiring; in this one it was disgustingly cynical. Perhaps the best thing about the night was the speaker who wasn’t there. Mary Ann Mendoza, who was scheduled to speak, tweeted aQAnon threadearlier that day about a Jewish conspiracy to rob and oppress the goyim. She’s a perfect representative of the Trumpist movement, and the producers were smart enough to pull her.Nicole Hemmer Melania Trump opened her speech not only by acknowledging the pandemic, but also by sympathizing with the millions of Americans whose lives have been undone by it. Yes, I’m praising her for doing the bare minimum. But so far she’s the only headliner to do even that.Nicholas Kristof Melania Trump’s expressing sympathy for those who have lost loved ones to Covid-19, at a convention where the dead have been largely erased, and highlighting issues of race and opioid addiction.Matt Labash Whenever in Sin City, I’m typically too liquored-up, or down at blackjack, to visit the International Church of Las Vegas. But after hearing the opening prayer by its pastor, Norma Urrabazo, I might change my itinerary. She prayed for our police officers and those they’ve been in conflict with. She extolled unity, asking for reconciliation with God and each other. She prayed for all Americans, not just Republican ones. These are notes not often sounded nowadays. Here’s hoping Trump wasn’t too busy tweeting insults at “Sleepy Joe” or “MSDNC” to listen.Liz Mair Daniel Cameron, the attorney general of Kentucky, gave a good speech, but the standout bit was a truthful zinger: “Let’s be honest, no one is excited about Joe Biden.” Harsh? Maybe, but also accurate. Lots of people like Biden, but he doesn’t fire his base up like Obama or Trump. That might turn out to be a good thing.Daniel McCarthy Abby Johnson testified powerfully to the horrific realities of abortion and the ugly eugenicist history of Planned Parenthood, including the toll it takes on Black lives to this day.Melanye Price Melania Trump. Her introduction video, though largely fictional, was the first time the convention planners seemed to understand that this is happening in a digital medium that requires some production. Also, her speech was the only one that seemed hopeful and above the fray.Bret Stephens Nick Sandmann, the recent Covington Catholic High School grad, explained, with eloquence beyond his years, why so many Americans loathe so much of the news media. In his own way he’s the G.O.P.’s best answer to A.O.C.Mimi Swartz Melania has a fabulous runway walk. That’s the best I can do.Héctor Tobar Cris Peterson, the Wisconsin dairy farmer who told a story about families pulling together in the wake of a crisis. It didn’t really have anything to do with Donald Trump, though she tried to give him credit for keeping the milk flowing. But the attempts to humanize the president, his party and its policies were canceled by the many speeches with an ideological edge.Peter Wehner Daniel Cameron, from Kentucky. His speech was elegant, historically literate and masterfully delivered. He was calm, hopeful and spoke about healing America’s wounds. He prosecuted an effective case against Biden while mostly avoiding Donald Trump. Cameron was like a figure from another era; he’s out of sync with the Trump G.O.P. Maybe one day he can help make the Republican Party great again.Will Wilkinson The night’s best moments were wrapped inside the night’s worst moment: Trump’s using the office of the president for cynical campaign stunts. I was genuinely glad that Jon Ponder got a clean slate with a pardon. And there’s no greater civic joy than a naturalization ceremony. I couldn’t be happier for my freshly minted compatriots, but they deserved better than to be used as campaign props by a virulently anti-immigrant president who reportedly thinks people like them hail from “shithole countries.”Worst MomentsWajahat Ali The utter hypocrisy of the messaging. Republicans are against nepotism but many speakers are Trump’s family members. Pence says Republicans are the party of Lincoln, but they are supporting a president who defends Confederate flags and statues. The worst moment was trotting out immigrants of color in front of Trump for a citizenship ceremony. Republicans expect us to believe that the man who caged immigrant kids, promoted the Muslim ban and reportedlyasked, “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” actually cares about people of color. I admire the shamelessness.Jamelle Bouie The naturalization ceremony. Chad Wolf, even though he appears to be performing the duties of the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security outside the bounds of the law, performed a naturalization ceremony at the White House as part of a partisan event. (On Tuesday, Trump tweeted that he would, finally, officially nominate Wolf for the position. Perhaps now we know why.) The five immigrants onstage for that segment were put through what was possibly a sham event for the sake of a political infomercial. It’s disgraceful, and I’m sorry that it happened to them.Linda Chavez Pam Bondi, the former Florida attorney general, unleashed a torrent of dishonest attacks on Biden’s integrity, suggesting, with no evidence, that he used his office to line his family’s pockets. That’s pretty rich, given the string of ethical lapses by the president, his children and his appointees. From Ivanka’s expedited Chinese patents to the Kushner family’s hawking of entrepreneur visas to Chinese investors to the president’s raking in dough from government and lobbyists staying at his hotels and golf courses, the Trump administration has amassed the most corrupt record in American history.Gail Collins This has to be a Trump. Tiffany’s “some cynical politicians do not seem to believe in the miracle of America” was deep high-school-rhetoric competition.Or Eric? Was he looking worried because of the Biden campaign or that new investigation into the Trump Organization’s business practices in New York?Melania wins for boredom. Definitely not worth tearing up the White House garden for.Michelle Cottle Pam Bondi, a member of Trump’s impeachment defense team, had the dirty duty of smearing the Biden family. She rehashed the president’s specious claims that, Biden, as vice president, acted corruptly and aided his son Hunter’s business fortunes. She also floated vague charges against another, unnamed “close family member.” So icky.Michelle Goldberg It’s a tough competition, but Mike Pompeo’s possibly illegal speech from Jerusalem was both a gross politicization of American diplomacy and a sneering statement about how this administration views the laws that bound their predecessors.Nicole Hemmer The naturalization ceremony. A piece of propaganda for the most anti-immigration and anti-immigrant president in decades, it wasn’t just hypocritical, it made a mockery of a normally powerful ritual. And since this is the metric Trump cares about most: It was also incredibly boring.Nicholas Kristof The use of the White House and secretary of state for naked political purposes, in breach of historical norms and probably the Hatch Act. Hmm. Maybe it’s fitting: Trump’s legacy will be his assault on norms and institutions, and that’s what he highlighted.Matt Labash I used to respect Rand Paul as a man of conscience, back when he still had one. But it’s been some years since he called Donald Trump “a delusional narcissist and an orange-faced windbag.” With his speech tonight, Paul seemed to trip off an arms race to become Trump’s most reliable golf buddy/lap dog/apologist. He’d better be careful. It’s a coveted slot, at least for two more months. Lindsey Graham is probably outside the Mellon Auditorium tonight, cutting the brakes on Paul’s car.Liz Mair Mike Pompeo really phoned it in tonight. If that was the best he could do, he should dispense with any 2024 presidential plans immediately, for everyone’s sake.Daniel McCarthy Too many schmaltzy videos, like the one starring Mike Pence. The night as a whole seemed like a flashback to the Democratic convention or a pre-Trump Republican convention — feel-good emoting in consultant-crafted packaging.Melanye Price Trump’s America is very dark and frightening, and if his supporters also see themselves as fighting off barbarians at the gate, it is no wonder that some wave guns against unarmed citizens, protesting on a street. If I bought into this narrative, I would be in full fight-or-flight mode all the time.Bret Stephens Mike Pompeo’s speech from Jerusalem was, in its way, everything that’s wrong with the Trump administration: It violated protocols and probably rules, and put Pompeo’s political interests ahead of the national interest. Nauseating.Mimi Swartz Tough choice, with the recently subpoenaed Eric Trump’s breathlessly praising his tough, incorruptible dad and the former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi’s smearing Biden family members. Runner-up: Mike Pompeo plays politics for Trump on a taxpayer-funded trip to Israel.Héctor Tobar Trump’s signing a pardon and staging a naturalization ceremony, with grateful people of color. These prime-time acts of White House theater were a cynical attempt to erase years of race-baiting and anti-immigrant rhetoric. We haven’t forgotten, Mr. President: You’re still the same man who questioned Barack Obama’s citizenship, praised white supremacists and caged thousands of immigrant children.Peter Wehner Mike Pompeo’s speech. It wasn’t the worst speech of the evening, but it was the most cynical. The speech shouldn’t have been delivered; a secretary of state delivering a convention speech from foreign soil was certainly inappropriate. His politicization of the State Department is injurious, the transgression of yet another norm during the Trump era. And his portrayal of Trump’s foreign policy record was deeply misleading. Pompeo is a bright man who knows better. But character matters more than intelligence. Pompeo is a political hack with a prestigious title.Will Wilkinson Trump’s use of official powers inside the White House as part of his re-election campaign is dangerously authoritarian. He is actively personalizing the powers of the office. He wants us to know that they’re his powers. It’s up to him whether you live as a felon for the rest of your life, whether you get to be a dues-paying member of the national club. The White House is his house, so he’s naturally using it to campaign. But, as Trump sees it, he shouldn’t need to campaign. Because these awesome powers inhere in him, not a temporary constitutional role. That’s the point he’s making.What Else MatteredWajahat Ali The United States is enduring a pandemic that has killed nearly 180,000 people. We are mired in a terrible recession. There are demonstrations against police brutality and racism. Climate change is burning California. People are in pain and suffering. There were no policies, no solutions, no platform. Nothing was offered except slogans and propaganda and Trump catnip.Jamelle Bouie To the extent that there was a focus on Night 2, it was on the president’s pre-Covid-19 economic record, as well as his efforts on criminal justice reform. His campaign, to its credit, understands that if Trump cannot make inroads among the majority of Americans who disapprove of his administration, he’ll lose. The problem, as with the first night, is that the parts that worked — testimony in praise of Trump from business owners, workers and a former felon, for example — were weighed down by the culture war bombast of speakers like Nick Sandmann and Eric Trump.Linda Chavez Trump’s relentless assault on legal as well as illegal immigration flies in the face of his glitzy White House naturalization ceremony. Unmentioned was his proposal to hike naturalization fees by 61 percent or the backlog of some 700,000 applicants awaiting the privilege Trump awarded to just five immigrants on prime time TV. He’s fooling no one with his phony embrace of a few new Americans.Gail Collins The good news is that the Trump family is never going to be a dynasty.Michelle Cottle Trump showed he’ll exploit every tool of high office to serve his political ambition. He signed a pardon; he oversaw a naturalization ceremony, at which the acting Homeland Security chief participated; the secretary of state spoke from Jerusalem; the first lady spoke from the Rose Garden. The president clearly feels confident that he’ll suffer no real fallout for such norm-busting shenanigans.Michelle Goldberg This isn’t an original observation, but because of Trump and his circle’s penchant for projection, all their accusations are veiled confessions. Hence one theme of the evening was that Joe Biden is a nepotist who wields his power for the corrupt enrichment of his family. I have no idea if this attack will work, but it was Orwellian.Nicole Hemmer Convention planners scrambled to remove Mary Ann Mendoza from the program after she shared anti-Semitic conspiracy theories on Twitter. The incident is a reminder that while the convention depicts Trump’s G.O.P. as a big tent, conspiracism and racism are its tent poles.Nicholas Kristof More outreach to the undecided, but marred by lies and by possibly illegal use of the White House as a political prop. Plenty of outreach to women voters, led by Tiffany and Melania Trump, and good mention of the opioid crisis. But little mention of nearly 180,000 Americans dead from Covid-19 and the economic crisis that afflicts so many families.Matt Labash Kudos to “The Apprentice” production team Trump brought in to frame the convention. Melania’s was the best-produced hostage video I’ve ever seen. ISIS should take notes. I didn’t believe a word she said about her husband. But in fairness to her, I doubt she did either.Liz Mair The pardon was norm-violating, but the biggest problem was that Jon Ponder should have been pardoned a long time ago. I’m glad Trump did it, but the timing does not reflect well on him. The pardon might not turn out to be as clever as it appeared at first glance.Daniel McCarthy Both First Lady Melania Trump and Ryan Holets reminded us of the continuing suffering inflicted by the epidemic of opioid addiction. Holets, in particular, showed that local action and personal compassion are necessary to fight this scourge.Melanye Price Many of Trump’s grievances are really with decision makers who are either white people or predominantly white institutions — Biden, Congress, big banks. But Trump and his supporters cannot stop themselves from making claims that people of color — especially inner-city criminals, Black Lives Matter advocates and undocumented immigrants — are to blame for this country’s problems. People of color and other marginalized groups are fodder for a fight that’s really not even about us. It is about white experiences of class stagnation, loss of industry, rising education costs and other challenges that were put in place by other white people.Bret Stephens Melania Trump’s speech dragged a bit, but it was a nice antidote to the relentless partisanship of the rest of the evening. Also, she claimed to like her husband. Who knew?Mimi Swartz The level of hypocrisy regarding religion among this cynical crowd. Mike Pompeo touts Trump from Jerusalem, while speaker Mary Ann Mendoza is disappeared from the schedule for posting an anti-Semitic tweet courtesy of QAnon. Who wants four more years of government as game show?Héctor Tobar This second night of the Republican infomercial sounded more like a religious gathering than the first night. We listened to a parade of conservative activists martyred by supposed liberal excesses, as well as to free-market prophets and Trump family members who told us that the economy is doing fine, thanks to the great protector of “the miracle of America,” as Tiffany Trump put it. This night was for the true believers.Peter Wehner Night 2 better than Night 1. The speakers were generally less agitated and certainly less loud. Still, hardly any one landed a blow against Biden; that’s a problem since Trump is trailing. Trump didn’t win many, if any, votes he didn’t already have. Oh, and the effort by speakers to humanize Trump won’t work because he’s fundamentally indecent and will prove so again within a matter of days (or hours).Will Wilkinson Lies. So many lies. Lies, lies, lies. Lies about Democrats. Lies about Joe Biden. Lies about cities. Lies about the coronavirus epidemic. Lies about the economy. If Trump’s Republican Party has a platform, it’s contempt for the truth in the service of undeserved power. This is basically what Tiffany Trump said about Democrats. It’s funny to speak the truth about yourself in the guise of an accusation aimed at rivals.About the authorsGail Collins, Jamelle Bouie, Michelle Goldberg, Nicholas Kristof and Bret Stephens are Times columnists.Wajahat Ali (@WajahatAli) is a playwright, lawyer and contributing opinion writer.Linda Chavez, a former Reagan White House director of public liaison, is a political commentator.Michelle Cottle (@mcottle) is a member of the Times editorial board.Nicole Hemmer (@pastpunditry) is an associate research scholar at Columbia University and the author of “Messengers of the Right: Conservative Media and the Transformation of American Politics.”Matt Labash, a former national correspondent at The Weekly Standard, is the author of “Fly Fishing With Darth Vader.”Liz Mair (@LizMair), a strategist for campaigns by Scott Walker, Roy Blunt, Rand Paul, Carly Fiorina and Rick Perry, is the founder and president of Mair Strategies.Daniel McCarthy (@ToryAnarchist) is the editor ofModern Age: A Conservative Quarterly.Melanye Price (@ProfMTP), a professor of political science at Prairie View A&amp;M University in Texas, is the author, most recently, of “The Race Whisperer: Barack Obama and the Political Uses of Race.”Mimi Swartz (@mimiswartz), an executive editor at Texas Monthly, is a contributing opinion writer.Héctor Tobar (@TobarWriter), an associate professor at the University of California, Irvine, is the author of “Deep Down Dark: The Untold Stories of 33 Men Buried in a Chilean Mine, and the Miracle That Set Them Free” and a contributing opinion writer.Peter Wehner (@Peter_Wehner), a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center who served in the previous three Republican administrations, is a contributing opinion writer and the author of “The Death of Politics: How to Heal Our Frayed Republic After Trump.”Will Wilkinson (@willwilkinson), the vice president for research at the Niskanen Center, is a contributing opinion writer.We’d (@NYTopinion)andInstagram.PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Illustration by The New York Times; Photographs by Evan Vucci/Associated Press; Republican National Convention, via Associated Press FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
