Yet no elite college seems willing to risk surrendering even an inch in their competition for status.In 2001,then-Yale president Richard Levinsaid that early admissions discriminated against less affluent students, but Yale couldn't end them on their own lest they \"be seriously disadvantaged relative to other schools.\" In 2006, then-Harvard president Derek Bokannouncedthat Harvard would stop letting students in early. Just five years later,the college reversed course,ironically citing diversity as the motivating force.Faculty dean Michael Smith said at that time, \"Many highly talented students, including some of the best-prepared low-income and underrepresented minority students, were choosing programs with an early-action option, and therefore were missing out on the opportunity to consider Harvard.\" But 10 years after that reversal, Harvard's socioeconomic diversity numbers havebarely budged.It's long past time to end the noxious early admission system. Elite colleges can certainly afford to change on their own -- Harvard's endowment exceeds$50 billion.Indeed, a number of law schools havedropped out of the U.S. News rankingsentirely, and elite colleges should do the same.The federal government can facilitate collective action bysuspending antitrust law enforcementfor colleges that want out. There's precedent for this. Congress granted the medical-residency match program anantitrust exemption in 2004.President Joe Biden could also simply direct the Department of Justice to refrain from prosecuting any violation for a discrete period of time.If colleges won't act voluntarily, then the federal government can and should condition non-profit tax status -- which benefits elite colleges to the tune of $20 billion per year -- on colleges ending early decision and other admissions policies that discriminate against students of ordinary means. Biden can do this unilaterally as well by having the Treasury Departmenttweak the regulatory definition of a public charity.Less radical would be to dial up or down the size of the GOP's 2017 excise tax on super-wealthy colleges based on their elimination of unfair admission policies and enrollment of low-income students. In this effort, Biden may find an unlikely ally in Senator Mitch McConnell who, in 2018, spearheaded an endowment tax exemption forBerea College in Eastern Kentucky,which generally accepts applications only from those whose family falls within the bottom two income quintiles of US households and which provides all admitted students with full-tuition scholarships.And if the federal government won't act, then states should ban early decision at public colleges and do the same at private colleges that do not guarantee to meet full financial need with grant aid (and not by burdening students with loan debt). New York State haspending legislationthat can serve as a model.It's long past time for elite colleges to make sure that they're drawing their students from all parts of the socioeconomic spectrum. Early decision programs should be relegated to history.Opinion by Evan Mandery and Michael DannenbergTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
