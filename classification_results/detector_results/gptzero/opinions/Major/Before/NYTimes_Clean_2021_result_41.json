            "inputText": "Acting as if it mattered is actually a problem.On July 8, 1815, Louis XVIII returned to Paris less than four months after Napoleon’s daring escape from exile drove the French king from the city. In that astonishingly brief time, Napoleon reclaimed his power, led French troops into the field against the united powers of Europe and was defeated, finally, at Waterloo. The French call this frantic interval Les Cent Jours,the 100 days.The monarchical origins of the phrase should be a warning against its use to measure the success of American presidents. But last week, news organizations, including this one, marked President Biden’s 100th day in office with everything from videos to scorecards to opinion polls. Mr. Biden commemorated it too, deliveringan address to Congresslaced with references to what had happened in the “100 days since I took the oath of office.”Having gotten that ritual out of the way, could we please retire the first-100-days standard? Judging presidents on that clock distorts politics by encouraging occupants of the White House to change as much as possible as quickly as possible.The 100-days benchmark entered American politics when Franklin Roosevelt used it ina fireside chatto characterize the special session of Congress he called to pass the New Deal. Since then, the 100th day of a term has become an arbitrary moment for gauging the success of a new president.But Mr. Roosevelt confronted a profound political and economic crisis. There are reasonable arguments to be had over whether Mr. Biden confronts a comparable emergency. The Covid-19 pandemic certainly required urgent action, and the first 100 days provided a useful rhetorical benchmark for goals like vaccine administration.But confronting problems, even urgent and large ones, is different from what the 100-days standard implies: that a significant crisis, or need for social or economic transformation, recurs every four years beginning on Inauguration Day.Like all presidents, Mr. Biden should be judged by whether his leadership accords with his time: bold when circumstances justify it, more modest when that is all that is required. If he is a transformational figure as consequential as Mr. Roosevelt, it should not be because all presidents rise or fall according to the scale and pace of change that occurs under their leadership. It should be because Mr. Biden persuades the nation that this moment demands change of that magnitude.Instead, the 100-days standard encourages change for change’s sake, and hasty change at that. But prudence, theparamount political virtue, is about calibrating action to the needs of the time. Judging every president by how much or what he or she changes in the first 100 days punishes prudence.One reason for the benchmark is that the first 100 days represent a honeymoon period in which, flush with victory, presidents can harness the enthusiasm of the people. That is true. It is also true that presidents tend to accomplish more early in their terms than they do later. But that simply establishes that presidents who are justified in making significant changes may be better off doing so early. It does not establish the need for change in every case.Sometimes there is a better reason to dampen popular enthusiasm rather than to exploit it. Alexander Hamilton thought that was an essential responsibility of presidents: “When occasions present themselves, in which the interests of the people are at variance with their inclinations,”he wrote in Federalist 71, “it is the duty of the persons whom they have appointed to be the guardians of those interests, to withstand the temporary delusion, in order to give them time and opportunity for more cool and sedate reflection.”Instead of Hamiltonian sobriety, change has become an intrinsic good that requires no explanation. We value it so much that we even apply the first-100-days standard tothe second termsof presidents who were re-elected because the country preferred the status quo. But change should require justification. There are times that require transformation and action, and others that call for preservation and restraint. Making change a permanent good assumes the past is always inferior. Yet constitutional government can be sustained only with some appreciation of accumulated custom. That was exactly the problem with Donald Trump’s detonation of constitutional norms.When change is justified, it should occur at a deliberate pace that encourages reflection and rewards humility. The 100-days standard demands speed, as though political needs were inherently defined in multiples of 10. Mr. Biden’s coronavirus relief bill, which passed in his first 100 days, would have been no more or less important after them. He has proposedmore than $4 trillionin infrastructure and social spending that will be no less consequential — and may be more so — for having occurred after his 100th day in office.The 100 days are in many ways a contrivance of pundits. They create opportunities for commentary and reporting. That is harmless as far as it goes. The dash to the 100-day finish line becomes more problematic when politicians act as if it actually mattered, as they now universally do.The benchmark is similar to our obsessive fixation on presidential legacies. We have no way of rewarding or remembering presidents for what they did not do, even though that is often as important as the change for which they are responsible. Mr. Biden’s most important contribution to American politics may be the restoration of normalcy: He has not invaded our social media feeds, dominated our television screens or obsessed the nation with his presidency.But neither the 100-days standard nor the criteria for legacies register normalcy. We remember the presidents who promote change, and do so rapidly, yet not those who do the equal service of governing quietly and conserving the past when their times call for it. Staying the course when the course is working or being normal after a period of political mania does not earn a president a place on Mount Rushmore.Perhaps it should. Several years ago, after noticing that even my conservative students were using the word “change” as an intrinsic political good, I began an exercise: Imagine three candidates for the White House. One wants to be the education president. The second pledges to be the national security president. The third shrugs his shoulders and says he will execute the law, dealing with problems as they arise. I ask them to choose a candidate. Candidate No. 3 has yet to win a straw poll.But there can be a profound greatness in restraint when restraint is called for. That entails suppressing personal ambition in favor of constitutional preservation. By contrast, a standard according to which the best president is the one who changes the most in the least time inflates the importance of the presidency. It assumes the president, rather than Congress, is the prime mover in American government.American politics would be healthier if we gave presidents room to govern rather than a command to transform. Instead, Americans are fascinated by motion, regardless of its direction, and frustrated by stasis, regardless of circumstances. Mr. Biden’s moment may well demand transformation. But it is worth recalling that his predecessor thought his did too. Mr. Trump was so eager to cross the 100-days threshold that he madethe fabulist declarationthat “no administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days.”Any president can make a case that he or she confronts a challenge on the scale of Mr. Roosevelt’s. But not all do. Especially in ordinary times, there is nothing magical about a president’s 100th day in office. Given the danger of encouraging gratuitous and frenzied change, perhaps the nation would be better off if presidents could enter office on their 101st day instead.Greg Weiner (@GregWeiner1) is a political scientist at Assumption University, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and the author of “The Political Constitution: The Case Against Judicial Supremacy.”The Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.
