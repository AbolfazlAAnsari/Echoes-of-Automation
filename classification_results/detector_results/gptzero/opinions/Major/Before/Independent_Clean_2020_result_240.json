Removing these words will cause fierce indignation from some, including the prime minister, quoted in your article\"Boris Johnson says time to stop 'cringing embarrassment' about British history after BBC Proms drops Rule Britannia lyrics\". It would have been preferable if the prime minister had shown the same degree of passion with regard to A-level results.I wondered about an alternative line in \"Rule, Britannia!\" reading: \"People never, never, never should be slaves.\" But silly, unthinking words from the past do open themselves to other suggestions. How about this sung version for the 2020 Proms? \"Rule Britannia, Dom Cummings waives the rules; Brits are not at all impressed, for they're not fools.\"Chich Hewitt                                          BoltonAbbott the fall guy?Even for this woeful government, who appear to value cronyism over competence, I was incredulous to learn thatTony Abbott, former Australian prime minister, has been appointed as our post-Brexit trade advisor.One must remember that with only a few exceptions, Australians and non-Australians alike consider him to be the worst antipodean prime minister since the war! Then it suddenly dawned on me: When it all goes wrong, our very own \"worst administration since the war\", can blame it all on a foreigner!Obvious really.Robert Boston                                          KingshillPrison deathIt has been said that if you want to gauge the moral health of a nation you should look inside its prisons. Concerns, therefore, arise about at least one such establishment -Bronzefield Prisonin Surrey.We are now approaching the first anniversary of the tragicdeath of a newborn babythere. As expected, there is deep anxiety that as yet we have heard nothing from any of the11 investigations set up to probe the incident. Enquiries to the local MP and the prison authorities themselves have failed to produce any satisfactory reason for the delay. One would also like to know exactly what provisions have been made for thehalf of women leaving Bronzefieldwho we have recently been told they have no home to go to.On the basis of this evidence, I would say the moral state of the UK is seriously in question.The Rev Andrew McLuskey                                          Address suppliedTory MP Huw Merriman blasts U-turn on face masks in schoolsMedical school placesAdditional medical school places is welcome news. The shortage in student healthcare professionals has long been a problem for the NHS, resulting in costly agency fees and an overstretched service.Closing the Gap, a joint report published by the Health Foundation, The King's Fund and Nuffield Trust in 2019 identified the reasons for the shortages, which include historical lack of investment in training, underestimating staffing requirements and a lack of a joined-up approach between education, clinical placements and health care providers. The additional medical school places is, therefore, good news, although I do hope a strategy is put in place to ensure there are enough clinical placements to match the increase in university offers and avoid the \"bottleneck\" in medical training the joint report highlights.Paul Kelly                                          Chesham"
