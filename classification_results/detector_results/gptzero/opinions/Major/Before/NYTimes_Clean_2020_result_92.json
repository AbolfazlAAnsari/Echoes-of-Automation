It is a continuation of centuries of white supremacist thought that has handicapped Black people and Black leadership.It is when Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer, writes:“As a rule, Trump expressed low opinions of all Black folks, from music to culture and politics.

I believe it was made by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever, and I am in favor of confining citizenship to white men, men of European birth and descent, instead of conferring it upon Negroes, Indians, and other inferior races.”Lincoln, defensive, responded:“I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the Black races. There is a physical difference between the two, which, in my judgment, will probably forever forbid their living together upon the footing of perfect equality, and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I belong having the superior position.”Many leaders in the United States would come to use Black struggle — in Africa and America — as proof of Black incompetence.As Adam Serwerhas written in The Atlantic, Robert E.

In the film, one of the screen cards would credit himwith this quote: “The policy of the congressional leaders wrought … a veritable overthrow of civilization in the South … in their determination to ‘put the white South under the heel of the Black South.’ ”All these views have tracked forward into the current era.

His relentless, yearslong attack on Chicago makes sense in this context: It has a large Black population and for the last year or so, a Black mayor.One thing that white supremacists have always twisted is this: They ravage lands and oppress people, then ascribe the inevitable disastrous result of the ravaging and oppression to the victim’s character and capacity, rather than to their own callousness and cruelty.They hurt people and then shame their expression of pain.They want to assert that Blackness is broken without acknowledging that they did the breaking. They want to look down on Africa without acknowledging that they drained that continent during the trans-Atlantic slave trade. They also don’t want to acknowledge that the European colonizing, mining and plundering of that continent had disastrous and retarding effects on it.They don’t want to acknowledge the effects of redlining, unfair lending, employment discrimination and concentrated poverty on many of America’s cities, even before white flight and massive disinvestment.In a sense, the fact that Black people in this country must struggle to live and to lead is one of white supremacy’s crowning achievements.We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.
