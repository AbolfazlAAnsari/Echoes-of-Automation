I watched the press suppress news they didn’t like and deceive people by airing false stories.Newsrooms overwhelmingly consist of like-minded, cut-from-the-same-cloth, tweet-the-same-thing people who have alienated most gun owners, people who go to church regularly, live in rural areas or think life begins at conception.Remember when the press told you the Steele dossier might be true? Or that President Trump removed blue mail boxes from street corners so he could steal the 2020 election? Or that Russia paid bounties to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan? Or that COVID could not possibly have originated in a Chinese lab? Or thatMelania Trumpturned the Rose Garden into a neofascist parade ground?  Or that Nicholas Sandmann was a thug and Kyle Rittenhouse a White supremacist? Each of these is wrong.  Each was reported by the mainstream media.First lady Melania Trump after speaking during the Governors' Spouses' luncheon at the White House, Feb. 10, 2020. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)I try to call the balls and strikes as I see them. I supportedPresident Trumpon many if not most of his policies, while I objected to the way he sometimes behaved. But too many reporters decided their job was to undo the will of the people who elected Trump in 2016, and their reporting was brutally unfair and biased. These reporters thought they were saving the Republic. Instead, they sacrificed their credibility.I don’t think the press is the enemy of the people, but I do think they are their own worst enemy.ARI FLEISCHER BLASTS MEDIA FOR 'OFF THE CHARTS' BIASMy book blows the whistle on the mainstream media. It names names and cites example after example of wrong, get-Trump-at-any-cost, \"reporting,\" especially at CNN and by The New York Times,each of which gets a chapter in my book.The problem today is way beyond the issue of liberal bias. It’s cultural. According to a 2018 study by the Pew Research Center, the only group of Americans who say the press understands them arecollege-educated Democrats. The majority of Democrats with a high school degree say the press doesn’t understand them. Nearly three-quarters of Republicans say the press doesn’t understand them. Independents are similarly minded.Journalism has an original sin. It lacks diversity. Newsrooms don’t think like, act like or register to vote like America. Newsrooms overwhelmingly consist of like-minded, cut-from-the-same-cloth, tweet-the-same-thing people who have alienated most gun owners, people who go to church regularly, live in rural areas or think life begins at conception.It’s as if too many reporters think if onlythosepeople watched CNN or read the New York Times they would know better than to support Donald Trump, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, or Govs. Ron DeSantis orKristi Noem. Or whoever the GOP nominates for president in 2024.Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando, Florida, Feb. 24, 2022.(Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images)Take the White House press corps. I hired a research company to look through public voter registration records of the 49 reporters who sat in the briefing room. They found the ratio of Democrats to Republicans was 12:1!Imagine how different – and fairer – the news would be if the ratio was even.  Imagine how different the news would be if the ratio was 12:1,Republicanto Democrat.The lack of balance in newsrooms helps explain why CNN bookedMichael Avenattialmost twice as many times as it booked theentireTrump administration to talk about COVID.In CNN’s eyes, Avenatti was more newsworthy thaneveryonefrom the secretary of Health and Human Services to the surgeon general toDr. Anthony Fauciand Dr. Deborah Birx,combined.Was there no one inside CNN who thought maybe they were booking Avenatti too much? Apparently not.I want the press to do better and my book concludes with a recommendation for how they can improve. Our nation will benefit when all of us can read one source of news and accept it as the truth. But so long as the mainstream media act as activists for a cause, that day will be a long way off.The press is a major reason the American people are so polarized. Isn’t it time we asked if the real problem in America is the \"news\" coming from the MSM?CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ARI FLEISCHERAri Fleischer serves as a contributor for both FOX News Channel (FNC) and FOX Business Network (FBN.)
