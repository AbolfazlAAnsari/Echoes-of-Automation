The advent and distribution of vaccines to every corner of the Earth has allowed for us to mitigate some of our most potent pathogens, such as smallpox and measles. Prior to COVID-19, we made the decision to get vaccinated, and accepted protection against the pathogen of concern without any question for brands or mechanisms. As an infectious diseases physician under the age of 65, I cannot recall what brand of influenza vaccine I have received over the past five years.Fast forward through COVID-19, and the development of highly effective vaccines. The incredible public nature of these vaccines has led to intense scrutiny of their use, safety profiles, rare side effects, efficacy, stability and other characteristics. Individuals are digesting vaccinations and comparing brands as if shopping for a used car. While this behaviour is encouraged to increase confidence in the vaccine, the reality is that all the approved vaccinations in Canada reduce hospitalization, death and disability from COVID-19, and protect against symptomatic disease, including to the variants of concern.MRNA vaccines work by tricking our bodies into making the spike protein, and then tricking our immune system into responding as if we've been infected with COVID-19. The only difference between these vaccines and protein-based vaccines (i.e. hepatitis B vaccine), is that our body makes the protein rather than the protein being injected. The fundamental immune response is relatively similar across most vaccines, our effector cells learn how to deal with COVID-19, and a booster shot essentially reinforces that response.Confused about vaccine safety and efficacy?
