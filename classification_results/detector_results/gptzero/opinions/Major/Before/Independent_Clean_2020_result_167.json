Boris Johnson referred in his column to \"a sense of injustice\" that Bame people feel. That word \"sense\" sums it up: the racism isn't real, just sensed. He has uttered and written racist statements in the past as have many other Tory MPs.This Racism Commission nonsense is just bandwagon-jumping to regain his lost popularity. Look at the late U-turn on free school vouchers and the NHS surcharge for the real Tory attitudes about inequality.T Maunder                                          LeedsAt least one person gets itA big thank you to Graham Powell of Cirencester for hiseloquent letter. He says so much of what I am sure many of your readers feel deeply and increasingly despairingly about today's political leaders and their marionette-masters in No 10. Things are so bad that one wonders whether any of them would understand what Mr Powell is saying.I fear the truth is that they are sufficiently intelligent to recognise the point but also gave up all that stuff about morality and standards many moons ago in pursuit of personal survival.Bernard Theobald                                           Nottingham"
