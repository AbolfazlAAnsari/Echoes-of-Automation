The widest gap between the two countries was in 2018, when U.S. natural gas sold for US$3.13 per million BTU, fully 179 per cent higher than the US$1.12 average fire-sale price that obtained in Canada that year. Even then, however, the price difference between Canada and the U.S. was just two bucks.Philip Cross: Not enough Canadians know how important the oilsands are(https://financialpost.com/opinion/philip-cross-not-enough-canadians-know-how-important-the-oilsands-are)Patricia Adams: China's energy actions speak louder than its climate pledges(https://financialpost.com/opinion/patricia-adams-chinas-energy-actions-speak-louder-than-its-climate-pledges)William Watson: Tories on gas - If it's not a tax it has no effect(https://financialpost.com/opinion/william-watson-tories-on-gas-if-its-not-a-tax-it-has-no-effect)Now consider Asia. Tracking comparable data as far back as it goes, between 2000 and 2019 average natural gas prices in Asia have been significantly higher than in Canada in most years.For example, in 2012 natural gas sold for US$2.27 per million BTU in Canada, but for US$18.15 in Asia. Asia's price was thus $15.88 more, fully 699 percent higher. In 2018, when Canada's natural gas prices were at rock-bottom, the percentage gap between Canada and Asia reached its widest: Canadian gas sold for just US$1.12 per million BTU versus US$9.80 in Asia. That was a US$8.68 difference - 775 per cent.To be sure, prices aren't always that far apart. In 2003 Asian spot prices were only three per cent higher than here, while in 2005 they were actually three per cent lower. But for more than a decade the price gap between Canada and Asia has been obvious and substantial.Looking at individual markets, in Japan, where price data for LNG goes back to 1990, prices were higher than in Canada in all but two years (again, 2003 and 2005). In every other year, prices were higher by as much as 797 per cent (which occurred in 2018). The widest gap in dollar terms was in 2012, when natural gas sold for US$2.27 per million BTU in Canada but US$16.75 in Japan, a difference of $14.48 or 638 per cent.In South Korea, where data are available only from 2009 on, prices for natural gas have always been above those in Canada, with the gap varying between US$1.90 (in 2009) and US$13.63 (in 2013) per million BTU. In percentage terms, natural gas prices in South Korea have ranged from 56 per cent more than in Canada (in 2009) to 771 per cent more (in 2018).Western Canada currently has several cost advantages over other LNG exporting countries such as the U.S., Qatar and Australia. For example, shipping costs to Japan from Canada are estimated at between 99 cents and $1.09 per million BTU. That compares to between $1.50 and $1.54 per million BTU from Qatar, and between $2.40 and $2.45 per million BTU from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. This is partly explained by distances. For example, the port of Kitimat in B.C. is between 4,076 and 4,734 kilometres closer to Japan, depending which Japanese port is used, than Qatar is.If you hear an anti-oil and gas advocate claim that Canadian energy companies should avoid Asian markets, know this: They haven't run the (honest) numbers.Mark Milke and Ven Venkatachalam are with the Canadian Energy Centre, an Alberta government corporation funded in part by carbon taxes. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
