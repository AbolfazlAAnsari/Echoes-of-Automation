We can't expect a 15-year-old girl to necessarily be able to pick up on cues that someone she's communicating with online isn't who he claims to be.What's more, even highly educated, worldly women who I've interviewed have told me they initially believed catfishers when they lied about their identities. Some only wised up to these scammers after the first time they realized the person they were communicating with was lying about his identity - after he asked for money or they talked on the phone and she realized his accent wasn't from the country he was claiming to be from, for example.So it's not just parents who should be scared. Of course, this is a chilling reminder that we need to educate our kids about the risk of these scams. We need to teach our children how to protect themselves online, monitor their online activities closely and help them navigate potentially dangerous situations. Children are also better off meeting new people offline -- at school or through extracurricular activities. But, as adults, we also need to be hyper-vigilant that people may not be who they say they are online.If you meet someone online, insist on talking with video so you can see whether they look like who they purport to be. If you decide to meet up in person, do so in a public place, tell people where you're going in advance and keep your guard up for a long time -- until you've met the person's family, friends and/or colleagues, can confirm their identity with certainty and have reliable evidence they can be trusted.This is also a stark reminder that,as I've said before, online dating sites and other social networks that match people up with the intention of real-world encounters should be verifying the identities of their users and conducting background checks on them.The benefit of online dating and other social media sites is that they expand the number of so-called fish in the sea, widening our pool of potential friends and mates. But those who use these sites should also know that \"catfishing\" has become an astonishingly widespread practice. Our lives can depend on not falling victim to these scams.Opinion by Kara AlaimoTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
