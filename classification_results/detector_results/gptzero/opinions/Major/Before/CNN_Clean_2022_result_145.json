Cordova's family, too, is left out by RECA as it stands.The legislation Sen. Crapo and I put forward will help these families. Though the federal government cannot fully decontaminate Tsosie's community or undo the suffering endured by Cordova's loved ones or Henry Herrera, it can take steps to make amends. As I see it, an expanded and extended RECA would be a down payment of compensation for the irreparable harm done to these communities. In short, it's an act of long-overdue justice.I will keep up the fight for this legislation and build further bipartisan support for its passage -- not just to help the countless New Mexico families burdened by loss and disease, but to affirm that the US government is in the business of making things right.Opinion by Ben Ray LujanTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
