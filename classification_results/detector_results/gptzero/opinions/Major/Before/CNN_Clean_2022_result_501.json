Trump has \"followed the authoritarian playbook with propaganda, with corruption, with incitements to violence,\" she said. This makes Trump's bond with his supporters unlike anything we are accustomed to seeing in American politics.And in an article she penned last year forThe Economist, Ben-Ghiat said that Trump's \"influence will not dissipate until the institutions of democracy formally confirm misconduct, for example with a court conviction.\" That is why in her view \"it is so important to hold Mr. Trump accountable.\"But who knows if Trump will ever be \"held accountable\" and what the impact would be on his supporters if he ever were to be? Doing so may make his followers cling to him even more tightly - despite what millions of Americans,includingeven someRepublican officeholders, may want.Givenreportsthat Trump is expected to announce his 2024 presidential run this week, I'd predict that he won't be going away any time soon, even without having delivered the \"red wave\" his supporters had so fervently hoped for.Opinion by Dean ObeidallahTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
