Many GOP nominees tripped over themselves to secure Trumpâ€™s endorsement -- clearly a wise strategy for primary elections.Â However, you can bet Democrats will effectively tie those challengers to the unpopular former president.2022 was supposed to be the year the GOP would easily win back control from a 50-50 senate but, with just two months to go, Republican prospects are dimming for the Party shaped in Donald Trumpâ€™s image.Many forget that Republicans lost two Senate seats in the 2016 election even thoughDonald Trumpswept surprisingly into office. Â In 2018, Republicans netted two seats, but lost seats in the key swing states of Arizona and Nevada (winning back seats in solid-red Montana, Indiana, Missouri and trending-red Florida). And with Trump on the ballot in 2020, Democrats won the presidency and took back the Senate, winning Arizona, Colorado, and two seats in Georgia. The only upper-chamber seat to flip to Republicans that year: ruby-red Alabama.WHAT'S AT STAKE FOR REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS IN MIDTERMS NOW THAT PRIMARY ELECTION SEASON IS OVER2022 was supposed to be the year the GOP would easily win back control from a 50-50 Senate but, with just two months to go, Republican prospects are dimming for the party shaped in Donald Trumpâ€™s image.His primary-endorsed Senate candidates in Arizona, Ohio, and Pennsylvania are vastly underperforming their Democratic rivals in both polling and fundraising. In fact, many of these races would not even be competitive for my party had Trump not given his endorsement.That is not to say that all Trump-endorsed candidates will fail this November. The former president often makes it a habit of endorsing candidates who are already going to win in the fall, and then claims credit for their success. Candidates like state Rep. Russell Fry in South Carolina, who defeated incumbent Rep. Tom Rice in a Republican primary, and Harriett Hageman, who beatRep. Liz Cheneyin Wyoming, will certainly be joining the 118th Congress.Ultimately, even as history tells us that the party in the White House should lose seats this year, candidates matter. Democrats like Rep. Tim Ryan in Ohio andSens. Rafael Warnockand Mark Kelly are running much ahead of their Republican rivals because they are better candidates who know their states far better.Sen.

The latter has worked quite well for Republican Govs. Asa Hutchinson, Brian Kemp, Phil Scott, Larry Hogan andGlenn Youngkin. Itâ€™s also worked for Sens. Susan Collins and Mitt Romney.They say that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. 2022 will test the veracity of that theory.There is no question that former President Donald Trump is aGOP primary kingmakerbut come November when that supposed Red Wave hits a solid blue wall of Democrats and Independents, he may very well end up this electionâ€™s spoiler for the Republicans.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM KEVIN WALLINGKevin Walling is a Democratic campaign strategist, former Biden 2020 campaign surrogate, vice president at HGCreative.
