(This, by the way, was appended to a snarky tweet from one of his acolytes asking why the WFP hadn't solved world hunger already, seeing as it raised $8.4bn in 2020.) Musk added that he would only pony up the money if the WFP used \"open source accounting, so the public sees precisely how the money is spent\". The not-so-subtle subtext here was: I would obviously help end world hunger, but I can't trust the WFP.Musk's excuse for not handing over a tiny portion of his wealth to the WFP is hardly original. Billionaires love to sorrowfully declare that they are dying to pay more tax, but they can't bear to see their money used inefficiently, so, for everyone's sake, they had better hoard it instead. Last week, in response to a (very short-lived) plan by the Democrats to tax billionaires, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said he would happily part with more of his dosh if there wereassurances it would be spent well.  \"If we could find solutions where the money could be directed in a proper way, I have more to give.\" Fellow billionaireRay Dalioalso said he would willingly pay more tax if it accomplished \"greater productivity\" but sadly, he wasn't sure that it did. Musk, meanwhile, insinuated that he was doing us all a favour by not paying more tax. \"My plan is to use the money to get humanity to Mars and preserve the light of consciousness,\" hetweetedlast Thursday. A couple of days later he darkly warned that a billionaire taxwould trickle down.  \"Eventually they run out of other people's money, and then they come for you.\"The government, of course, has already come for the majority of us. The median American household paid about14% in federal taxesin recent years (that doesn't include state taxes). Billionaires pay only a tiny fraction of that. ProPublica has calculated that Musk's \"true tax rate\" is a minuscule3.27%.But that's OK; he is working overtime to \"preserve the light of consciousness\". Millions of people may be on the brink of starvation, but Musk has a plan. Let them eat space!Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist"
