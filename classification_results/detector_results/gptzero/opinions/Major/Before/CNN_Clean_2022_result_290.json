And these disruptions could persist for a decade.Based on data fromOliver Wyman's fleet forecastand our models for industry growth, we anticipate a shortage of almost 30,000pilotsin North America by 2032 if the industry fails to address its staffing problems. That's almost four times higher than this year's anticipated gap of 8,000pilots, which has already proven to be problematic, even withdemandstill below where it was before the Covid-19 pandemic.Behind thepilot shortageis a confluence of trends, including the retirement of aging Baby Boomers and significantly fewer job candidates coming from the military, as the use of unmanned drones steadily increased and there were fewer deployments. Covid-19 exacerbated the shortfall, with airlines offering pilotsearly retirementat the height of the pandemic. When travel demand surged in 2021, the pilot shortfall was so dramatic that it hampered the airlines' ability to ramp back up, leading to flight delays and cancellations.Besides inconvenience, passengers are already paying for the shortage with higher airfares and more tightly packed aircraft - and will continue to do so in the months and years ahead - as airlines consolidate traffic into as few flights as possible.

This will be especially true for those airlines not wholly owned by or affiliated with large airlines.

We expect the economic impact to be severe enough to prompt consolidations and even failures among US regional carriers - a further threat to service to smaller cities and sparsely traveled routes.The pilot shortfall and rising labor costs also could affect the standing of various low-cost carriers. On one hand, higher operating costs may undercut their ability to maintain lower fares than their global rivals, and the shortage is likely to prevent them from adding flights when demand is high.
