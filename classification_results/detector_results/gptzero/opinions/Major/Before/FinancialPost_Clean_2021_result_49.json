These platforms, directly and indirectly, earn what some estimate could be $10 billion annually from their access to this \"free\" content. Sorry, it isn't free. It is being stolen. It is long past time publishers were paid a fair and appropriate licence payment for access to their product.Google, Facebook and Twitter must acknowledge that their billions of daily users benefit from access to edited, fact-checked, and verified local information, writes John Chachas.The payment mechanism is not new. The Copyright Tribunal establishes mechanisms and licence payments for all types of copyright-protected intellectual property. Music publishers and artists are routinely compensated for the re-use and re-publication of their assets.The governments of Australia, France, and now Canada have taken steps to force such payments, with Google and Facebook threatening to withdraw all search and social media in reply.If Google, Facebook, and Twitter can't recognize and acknowledge it is both fair and a legal right for the creators of content to be paid, then Congress must act. It would be logical and preferable for the digital platforms to enter into consensual agreements to pay appropriate use fees to journalists and creators of other content as mandated under existing laws.If Congress fails to act, the economic cost will be nothing compared to the damage to the nation's electorate. It's time to acknowledge the essential role of fact-checked local journalism in our democratic society.If Jefferson were watching, he would be worried.John G.
