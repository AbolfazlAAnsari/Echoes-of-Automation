In 2013, Islanders exercised that right to self-determination when 99.8 per cent of them, on a turnout of 92 per cent, voted in favour of remaining a UK Overseas Territory.This remains the settled view of Islanders, many of whom can trace their roots in the Islands back through nine generations.According to your article, the clearly expressed wishes of Falkland Islanders should not be considered, and decisions about their future should be discussed at a bilateral level between the UK and Argentine governments and then imposed upon Islanders, whether they like them or not.Fortunately, successive UK governments have taken a different approach and placed Islanders right to self-determination at the very heart of their relationship with the Falkland Islands. As the foreign office recently stated: \"The future of the Falkland Islands is one that only the people of the Falkland Islands should decide.\" Falkland Islanders continue to be profoundly grateful for the strong support of the UK in acknowledging Islanders' right to self-determination and choice to remain a UK Overseas Territory, particularly the UK's military intervention to restore our freedom in 1982 and continued presence in the islands today.This year we mark the 40th anniversary of the liberation of the Falkland Islands. As well as commemorating the sacrifices of 1982, it is an opportunity to look to the future. We are calling this year \"Looking Forward at Forty\" - making it a time to reflect on the achievements that have been made with our hard-won freedom, and to look forward to the next 40 years. Today, the Falkland Islands is a forward-looking community of more than 3,200 people, with a growing and increasingly diverse population. Locally elected politicians are responsible for all matters, other than defence and foreign affairs, and the Falkland Islands government funds all its own activities without any recourse to the UK taxpayer. Far from being colonial, our relationship with the UK is a modern and mutually beneficial partnership based on the principle of self-determination and something we can all be proud of.Richard HyslopFalkland IslandsGovernment representative to the United Kingdom and Europe"
