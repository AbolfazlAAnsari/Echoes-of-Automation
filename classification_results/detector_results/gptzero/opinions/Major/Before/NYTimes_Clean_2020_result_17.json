On-time train performance is now over 80 percent, up from 58 percent in January 2018, when he arrived. By the fall of last year, major subway delays on weekdays were downnearly 40 percentcompared with a year earlier, according to  data from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway and bus system. Mr. Byford was taking common-sense steps like raising speed limits on the subways and increasing training for operators.What had become a crisis for New Yorkers — a source of daily frustration if not anger as children arrived late to school and adults to work — had eased substantially, and even begun to show hopeful signs of turnaround. Together with the authority’s chairman, Patrick Foye, Mr. Byford, as president of New York City Transit, was overseeing a long-overdue transformation of an aging subway system in dire need of investment.The City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, summed up the mood on Thursday when he began acampaign on Twitterto persuade Mr. Byford to stay. “Seriously, this is a crisis. If we lose Andy AND his team, all the gains we’ve made could be lost. Let’s get this going,” he said, adding the hashtag #BringAndyBack. Mr. Johnson, who is eyeing a run for mayor, has pushed for city control of the subways.It is indeed embarrassing that New York couldn’t find a way to keep one of its most vital public servants from walking out the door. As of Thursday evening, Mr. Byford had not been asked to stay.Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s role in Mr. Byford’s rise and fall has been complicated. Mr. Cuomo wisely hired Mr. Byford, but the governor alsoclashedwith him repeatedly, infringing on his independence in ways that sometimes made itdifficult to do his job.In a resignation letter, Mr. Byford seemed to suggest he was leaving in part because of a restructuring of the M.T.A. engineered by Mr. Cuomo that reduced Mr. Byford’s authority, removing major subway construction projects from his domain.At a news conference Thursday, Mr. Cuomo called Mr. Byford “a good man,” who had “done a lot of good over the past two years.” He described their relationship as “fine.”The governor defended the M.T.A. restructuring, but acknowledged that it had changed Mr. Byford’s job. Mr. Cuomo said the restructuring was needed to address a long history of cost overruns on subway capital projects.The men disagreed over the shutdown of the L train, which was ultimately avoided when Mr. Cuomo turned to outside experts who proposed a less disruptive repair plan. They also split over the roughly $40 billion price tag for Mr. Byford’s subway improvement plans, which Mr. Cuomo thought was too high. In the first several months of 2019, they didn’t speak.Especially grating for Mr. Byford, some people said, were Mr. Cuomo’s sometimes scathing public criticisms of M.T.A. employees. In one presentation last February, the governormockedthe M.T.A. for the way it cleaned subway platforms. Neither man is a shrinking violet, but ultimately the governor’s greater power won out.Last spring, several people close to Mr. Byford wereworried he was ready to quit. In October, he submitted, then rescinded, a letter of resignation.It didn’t help relations between him and the governor that Mr. Byford had become a popular figure among many New Yorkers. Straphangers had become so fond of him that they nicknamed him “Train Daddy.” The name appears to have derived from street art featuring Mr. Byford’s head attached to a train along with the words, “Train Daddy loves you very much.”Anyone who watched Mr. Byford at work could see why New Yorkers trusted him. Just this month, at a public meeting in Queens about new bus routes, Mr. Byfordstood in the middle of a room filled with angry riders, answering tough questions about the changes.“I have been touched by and humbled by how kind and receptive New Yorkers have been to me,” he said on Thursday, singling out the 50,000 M.T.A. employees. “The employees of transit are the unsung heroes. I call them my diamonds.”Now it’s up to Mr. Cuomo to maintain and build on the progress Mr. Byford made.That means pressing on with Mr. Byford’s decade-long turnaround plan, “Fast Forward,” anambitious proposalto modernize the subways and overhaul the signal system. Mr. Cuomo said he wants the changes done faster. That’s the kind of thing he likes to say. In fact, the governor has often left an impression that he believes he can manage New York’s subways better than anyone else. Now he’s got the chance, and obligation, to prove it.We’d (@NYTopinion)andInstagram.PHOTO (PHOTOGRAPH BY JOSHUA BRIGHT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
