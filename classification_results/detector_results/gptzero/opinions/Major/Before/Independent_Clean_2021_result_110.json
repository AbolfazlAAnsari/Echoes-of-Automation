Surely, in that event, the agreement would be a guarantor of the culture of Ulster Scots and a protector of their wish to present as British. Or am I being naive in thinking that the Cruthin will ever get an even break in Gaelic Ireland?Jim StanleyDunfermlineThe Good Friday Agreement, a delicate balance resolving the almost intractable differences between the communities in Northern Ireland, was achieved by sensible and able statesmen - people with a long view of history.Sadly, this Conservative administration is populated by far less able people, with a perspective limited to the next three word slogan or catchy headline, and no semblance of a statesmanlike approach. The essence of the Agreement has thus been trashed in pursuit of a populist anti European agenda. It is clear where the blame will lie for any bloodshed and death.First damage to the fishing industry, then to exports, now taking Northern Ireland back to the 1970s. We don't hear much about \"Project Fear\" now. Perhaps too close to the truth.Arthur StreatfieldBathAfter 100 days of Brexit, Johnson's great master plan is unraveling. This is just the start but one of the biggest with his personal signature all over it: the Northern Ireland protocol. Johnson will attempt in his usual manner to postpone any problems by appealing to the EU and Joe Biden to delay its implementation until 2022; but how long can he keep it up when so many Johnson-traps are waiting around the corner?Peter Smith-CullenDunston, NorfolkElectoral reformJohn Rentoul ('Electoral reform is never going to be a \"priority\" for the Labour Party', 8 April) asks whether proportional representation (PR) is really anybody's priority? He doesn't think so.I believe it is. It is not a political issue, it is an ethical issue in terms of fairness and allowing the electorate to have a meaningful voice.In the last election, it took 866,000 votes to elect one Green MP, 336,000 for a Lib Dem MP, 51,000 votes for a Labour MP, 38,000 votes for a Conservative MP, while the SNP needed 26,000 votes for each MP. Looking at these figures, and moving party loyalties to the side, I believe that the majority of people would question the fairness of the current voting system.Combined with boundary changes, likely to benefit the Conservatives, these statistics mean that Labour may have no option but to remove the blinkers and start a dialogue on electoral reform with other parties. This hopefully would help engage our young people and let them see that, with reform, their vote will matter.Paul DicksonPeeblesRead MoreHow can France enforce face coverings while banning the hijab?What's after flags?
