When, as Andrew Mitchell has pointed out, \"every single member of this house was elected just over a year ago on a promise to maintain the0.7 per cent\".G ForwardStirlingHotel quarantineWhat a lovely, positive articlefrom Maria Oliveira, regarding her enforced hotel lockdown. It appears to me that Maria was not lonely being alone, she had a husband and friends who actively kept her emotionally buoyant while the hotel provided her with essentials for life. Maria was made to feel special and used her time to enjoy the release from her usual routines of caring for her family. She was proactively using her \"free time\" to enjoy pleasures not normally visited. I congratulate you. Maria, you have shown remarkable spirit in your lockdown period which is a lesson, and hopefully, the support that other lockdown travellers will take to heart. Thank you for your uplifting story.Keith PooleBasingstokeRead MoreDr Seuss: Six books pulled from publication over 'hurtful and wrong' imageryDenmark to launch digital 'vaccination passport' to open up travelWe mustn't grumble about the cost of Carrie Symonds's exquisite tastes - no one likes to look cheap, after all"
