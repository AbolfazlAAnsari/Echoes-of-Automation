If it's gone, America's post-1945 system unravels. Japan's position would be untenable, and it might seek nuclear arms. Australia would be very exposed. America's biggest global asset - the credibility of its alliances - would evaporate.But Taiwan is more than a pawn in some great power game. It's a miracle economy in its own right, which in the 1980s carefully transitioned from dictatorship to democracy to become a global technology powerhouse. The chances of reaching a political settlement with China, which once seemed plausible, have faded along with the one country, two systems model in Hong Kong. China's one-party state has proved incapable in the former British colony of running this autonomous, liberal and law-based global city with a strong civil society. Why would 24 million Taiwanese freely choose that fate too? Yet Vladimir Putin's quagmire in Ukraine has shown Beijing the huge risks of attempting a quick military grab of Taiwan. Most likely is that pressure and coercion in Taiwan's sea and airspace continues below the level of actual conflict, bringing more flashpoints.Were war to break out, the consequences would be disastrous for Australia and the world. The US-China trade lanes, the world's biggest, would collapse and send the rest of the world economy into turmoil. Lowy Institute polling shows Australians narrowly backing an intervention by our ANZUS ally to help Taiwan. Yet remarkable archival research by Professor James Curran, a columnist for The Australian Financial Review, shows Australia has always kept a more eyes-open view of China than Americans. In 1980, prescient Australian officials warned that even as China gained most from joining the world trading system, it might eventually go its own way - rather than converging with the Western economic club as idealistic Americans once imagined.Washington's excessive hope has turned to alarm, helping to drive this unwanted test of wills over Ms Pelosi's visit. The counter is that China is still too locked into global trade to bring it all down upon itself, as Mr Putin has impetuously done by turning Russia's energy trade on his own customers."
