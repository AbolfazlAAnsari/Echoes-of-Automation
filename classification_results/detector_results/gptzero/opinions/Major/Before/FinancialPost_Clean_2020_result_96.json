Scenario analysis would have them produce a range of scenarios that reflect the level of uncertainty in the economy.This is a prudent approach in light of current circumstances. The risk of reliance on a single economic and fiscal outlook is that it gets overtaken by events and the budget is rendered, for all intents and purposes, useless from an accountability and public reporting perspective. The government's fiscal credibility would be seriously harmed in the eyes of bond markets, credit rating agencies and the general public.Scenario analysis, by contrast, would have the government produce different economic and fiscal scenarios - a base case, an upside case, and a downside case, most typically - that provide it with more fiscal flexibility in such a fluid environment. This protects the government's budget against significant changes in the public-health and economic environments and sets the stage for the government to propose different policy responses contingent on the different scenarios.Scenario analysis and contingency planning can contribute to greater public confidence that the government has a proactive plan rather than a series of reactive responses to the evolving pandemic. Sustaining such confidence will be crucial as any government continues to make difficult choices in order to manage the pandemic.Peer jurisdictions are using scenario analysis and contingency planning to mitigate uncertainty and shore up public confidence. The Eurozone, for instance, has experimented with this budgeting approach amid the pandemic.So much is outside of the Ontario government's control as it prepares to release its budget this week. But it can control how it takes into account today's unprecedented uncertainty.Sean Speer and Drew Fagan are the co-project directors of the Ontario 360(https://on360.ca/ ) project at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy.
