Surely Johnson has been salivating round the clock, waiting to get back on the air to play Trump talking about the FBI raid.I have never heard Michaels lament missing an event worthy of his show's inspired skewering. He recognizes that some events are so much in the news that the audience expects \"SNL\" to find a sketch that can reproduce them comedically. He told me once that the show is now so identified with parodies of presidential debates (think: \"strategery\" from 2013) that he feels compelled - sometimes against his better comedic judgement - to do a sketch even when the debate offers almost no easy comedy targets. The first Barack Obama-Mitt Romney debate in 2012 was a good example. The only joke idea the staff could come up with was to highlight howObamamust have been distracted because he gave a surprisingly flat performance. Try finding the hilarity in that.Surely there would be no such struggle with the Mar-a-Lago document-gate. Top secret documents all over a beach hotel? The image conjures immediate pictures of people in Hawaiian shirts and bikinis walking past coffee tables strewn with classified file folders and somebody bashing open a pinata filled with more top secrets.But maybe all isn't lost. \"SNL\" has had very little opportunity in the past to have fun with those bloated presidential political conventions, because they are almost always held mid-summer, and some great funny moments were missed. But sometimes the show figures out how to exploit those moments well after they have occurred. Recall the Republican National Convention in 2012 whenClint Eastwooddecided to speak to an empty chair next to the podium, pretending it was an \"invisible\" Obama.Even though it didn't air until a couple of weeks after the event, \"SNL\" offered up a hilariously creative take fromBill Hader, who counts Eastwood among his many impressions.\"SNL\" may not get a crack at reproducing the raid on Mar-a-Lago until more than a month after the action, but somebody on the staff may already be working on ways to play catch-up. The field is wide open: What's really in those docs? Are some still hidden poolside among the guest towels? How many new fanciful explanations will Trump be able to conjure up in another month?Of course, something new and even more bonkers may emerge in the news before the new season launches; but I'll take a shot: Even if it's late to the game, \"SNL\"'s cold open to the new season will somehow cover the FBI visit to Mar-a-Lago.Opinion by Bill Carter for CNN Business PerspectivesTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
