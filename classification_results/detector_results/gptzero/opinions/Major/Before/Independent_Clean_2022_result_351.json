It is the only second chamber larger than the first – about eight hundred – while being one of the least effective. The US Senate has 100 members.To be relevant, the House of Lords must be reformed by an elective process based on suitability for candidacy. Members should be the country’s most proven and capable people from every part of society and trade from academics and builders, through doctors and fishermen, to nurses, teachers and vets. Membership should be capped. Selection should be based on proven success, not political studies, and confirmed by local and national support.There should be a limited service, during which time members must relinquish all other business activities. Second chamber selection for candidacy can be a rolling process. To begin a transition a trial period can start now with a test model from each of the four territories of the UK; but start now it must.Matt MinshallBrittanyTo keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter byclicking hereRussia’s current status is tragic, but may have been unavoidableI am certain as one can be that Ukraine, the US, and the rest of Nato should have exercised more common sense over many years with regard to Russia. However, as the saying goes: commonsense butters no parsnips.Too many obvious factors are being omitted: first, Russia has been paranoid as far back as the Napoleonic wars – probably even earlier – and no one can change that. Five Nato countries already share borders with Russia, and I have heard no complaints about this in all my years.We are also talking about the country that supported Assad in slaughtering thousands of citizens in Syria. Poison gas and barrel bombs hardly endear one to the international community.Finally, we are also talking about Vladimir Putin, who is alleged to have had his fingers in pies as diverse as Brexit, Trump and all manner of “mysterious” occurrences, in order to help weaken any possible threat to his ambitions.No, there was precious little anyone could have done to avert this disaster.An accurate analogy would be to think about the far right in the UK: the more you pander to them, the more they want!And now the Russian president has achieved what? Larger Nato, pariah state status, the disaffection of innumerable Russian citizens, countless deaths of service personnel including undertrained demoralised conscripts, and possibly the shortening of his career (or even his life).Robert BostonKent"
