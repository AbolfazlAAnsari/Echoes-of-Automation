In 1939, as the Second World War began to close in on them, the government articulated an attitude to reflect both wariness and composure: \"Keep calm and carry on.\" This balancing act required ignoring, but not denying, the terrifying threat and the endless sleepless nights of dread and worry. Even the relentlessbombing of Londondid not prevent citizens from carrying on.A similar combination of wariness and composure about the current Covid-19 pandemic, however, is not widespread right now in the US. Rather, many appear to enjoy being uncalm and partying on, insisting that caution about the pandemic -- mask-wearing, vaccines, testing -- is for wimps, those tricked by Big Pharma and Big Government to believe an endless trail of lies, even submitting as evidence theinability of current vaccines to slow transmissionof the current dominant sub-variant.The struggle to control the pandemic now is no longer between the coronavirus and the human race. With social distancing, vaccines (with an emphasis on boosting) and monoclonal antibodies and other treatments, we can handle the situation, however imperfectly. Rather, the most dangerous struggle is between those who believe infacts as real and stubborn thingsthat can evolve as evidence accumulates versus those who believe inalternative factsto suit the mood and moment.Unfortunately, the latter struggle, being untethered from reality, has no ground rules or apparent path forward. In this way, it is every bit as slippery and shape-shifting as the coronavirus itself.Opinion by Kent SepkowitzTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
