These plants are thriving in early January after a very mild start to the winter. While these greens aren’t always guaranteed to survive this late into the winter in South Carolina, the mild start to winter has clearly extended our harvest season into January this year.

Is there a way to harvest Collards and Lettuce without ruining the plant? We wanted to experiment with two different harvesting techniques to see if we could get the collards and lettuce to produce more tasty greens for us into mid-winter. Our first method was gentle. We took off just the outer leaves of some collards and lettuce keeping the central growing point untouched. This ensures the plant will continue to grow, but it doesn’t guarantee that the lettuce will stay young enough to taste good (lettuce doesn’t taste good when it begins to mature into bloom). The second harvest method we used was faster, but a little more extreme. We decided to cut the entire stem of the collards and romaine lettuce so we could get a full harvest in hopes that the plants will create new offshoots and grow back. We have observed lettuce will return of cut all the way back in a few weeks. Many gardeners avoid this problem altogether by planting new lettuce seeds every 2 weeks and picking the oldest plants.
