Kevin Craven, enrolled agent and founder of Craven Financial Solutions says it’s his job to sort out misinformation from his clients about filing their return. The clients that make the most mistakes on their state and federal return Craven says are self employed people who don’t know what they can and can’t deduct as a business expense. Craven says people will often try to deduct work-related meals not realizing that there are very specific deduction rules that vary by state. Another mistake Craven says, are clients who don’t know if they’re eligible to claim or be claimed as a dependent. “There’s rules that go along with that and you have to check those boxes all the way through it to make sure. Whether they’re a qualifying child and qualifying relative so there’s different types of dependents as well,” said Craven. Cravens advice to taxpayers is to let tax professionals help you to get the right refund so that you can avoid an audit letter from the IRS down the line. Craven says the price for fixing your mistakes later on is much higher than to simply do it right the first time. © 2024 KOBI-TV NBC5. All rights reserved unless otherwise stated. © KOBI-TV NBC5.

""Housing case workers are seeing an overwhelming deluge of folks that are asking for assistance that are needing the help and that they are seeing rental assistance arrears that are very, very high,"" said Mike Savara, special initiatives director for OHCS. He told lawmakers on the Joint Committee on Ways and Means on Thursday that OHCS needs $35 million this year to keep rent assistance going and serve an estimated 5,000 households that will need the money. He told lawmakers the figure was based on a per month calculation of the program\'s ongoing cost. Savara said renters are only offered assistance when they are on the verge of eviction, but even with that limitation, funding for the program will run out by this summer unless lawmakers bridge those deficits. Savara said the agency\'s rent assistance programs served 8,000 households since funding was allocated in the spring of 2023. Rep. Mark Gamba, D-Milwaukie, questioned whether that money was actually keeping the individuals housed or whether they still ended up losing their homes after paying the landlord. Savara noted that the agency was not tracking that data but said even the ability to leave a home without having a debt would help the individual more easily find new housing. Gamba asked for that data to start being tracked. The $65 million OHCS and Kotek are asking for for shelter operations stems from a needs assessment that found that without continued shelter operations funding the state could lose thousands of shelter beds.'}]"

(KATU) — An Alaska Airlines flight from Portland to Ontario, California suffered a depressurization Friday afternoon. Alaska flight 1282 left Portland just after 5 p.m. and was able to make it back to PDX without further incident. Once the plane was back on the ground, KATU News has confirmed the missing part of the fuselage is actually an exit door. Robert Katz, a commercial pilot and flight instructor, tells KATU News that the door must have been ripped off violently according to the photos he has seen. “Portland approach, Alaska 1282 emergency! Aircraft is now leveling 12,000 in a left turn heading three four zero,” An Alaska pilot can be heard saying on recordings obtained from LIVEATC.net. Stephanie King was a passenger on the flight and shared this video of the plane touching down at PDX. Evan Smith was visiting Portland and was on the flight. ""You heard a big loud bang to the left rear. A whooshing sound and all the oxygen masks deployed instantly and everyone got those on."" According to the flight tracking website FlightRadar24.com, the aircraft reached an altitude of 16,000 feet before turning back to the airport. “We are emergency, we are depressurized, we do need to return back to, we have 177 passengers. Fuel is eighteen eight,"" the pilot says after air traffic control granted the plane clearance to a lower altitude. There was a boy and his mother sitting in that row and his shirt was sucked off him and out of the plane. His mother was holding on to him,"" Smith said. Alaska Airlines issued a statement saying, ""Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 from Portland, Oregon to Ontario, California, experienced an incident this evening soon after departure. The aircraft landed safely back at Portland International Airport with 174 guests and 6 crew members. We are investigating what happened and will share more information as it becomes available."" Passenger Elizabeth shot this video and posted it to her TikTok account. She tells KATU News that she is glad everyone is okay. According to FAA record posted online, the Boeing 737-9 MAX rolled off the assembly line just two months ago, receiving its certification in November 2023. At about 9:30 p.m. Friday, Boeing issued a statement: ""We are aware of the incident involving Alaska Airlines Flight #AS1282. We are working to gather more information and are in contact with our airline customer. A Boeing technical team stands ready to support the investigation."" At 11:40 p.m., Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci issued a statement: At Alaska Airlines, safety is our foundational value and the most important thing we focus on every day. Following tonight’s event on Flight 1282, we have decided to take the precautionary step of temporarily grounding our fleet of 65 Boeing 737-9 aircraft. Each aircraft will be returned to service only after completion of full maintenance and safety inspections. We anticipate all inspections will be completed in the next few days. I am personally committed to doing everything we can to conduct this review in a timely and transparent way. We are working with Boeing and regulators to understand what occurred tonight, and will share updates as more information is available. The NTSB is investigating this event and we will fully support their investigation. My heart goes out to those who were on this flight – I am so sorry for what you experienced. I am so grateful for the response of our pilots and flight attendants. We have teams on the ground in Portland assisting passengers and are working to support guests who are traveling in the days ahead. -Ben Information for impacted guests: Guests whose flights have been impacted by this grounding are being notified with guidance on next steps and are also encouraged to visit alaskaair.com for self-service options. We deeply apologize to our guests and are working to reaccommodate everyone as quickly as possible. This is a developing story, and we will update this as more information becomes available.'}]"

in some areas of the country after weeks of an apparent national decline. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data released Friday showed a continued national drop in flu hospitalizations, but other indicators were up — including the number of states with high or very high levels for respiratory illnesses. “Nationally, we can say we’ve peaked, but on a regional level it varies,” said the CDC’s Alicia Budd. “A couple of regions haven’t peaked yet.” Patient traffic has eased a bit in the Southeast and parts of the West Coast, but flu-like illnesses seem to be proliferating in the Midwest and have even rebounded a bit in some places. Last week, reports were at high levels in 23 states — up from 18 the week before, CDC officials said. Flu generally peaks in the U.S. between December and February. National data suggests this season’s peak came around late December, but a second surge is always possible. That’s happened in other flu seasons, with the second peak often — but not always — lower than the first, Budd said. So far, the season has been relatively typical, Budd said. According to CDC estimates, since the beginning of October, there have been at least 22 million illnesses, 250,000 hospitalizations, and 15,000 deaths from flu. The agency said 74 children have died of flu. COVID-19 illnesses seem to have peaked at around he same time as flu. CDC data indicates coronavirus-caused hospitalizations haven’t hit the same levels they did at the same point during the last three winters. COVID-19 is putting more people in the hospital than flu, CDC data shows. The national trends have played out in Chapel Hill, said Dr. David Weber, an infectious diseases expert at the University of North Carolina. Weber is also medical director of infection prevention at UNC Medical Center, where about a month ago more than 1O0 of the hospital’s 1,000 beds were filled with people with COVID-19, flu or the respiratory virus RSV. That’s not as bad as some previous winters — at one point during the pandemic, 250 beds were filled with COVID-19 patients. But it was bad enough that the hospital had to declare a capacity emergency so that it could temporarily bring some additional beds into use, Weber said. Now, about 35 beds are filled with patients suffering from one of those viruses, most of them COVID-19, he added. “I think in general it’s been a pretty typical year,” he said, adding that what’s normal has changed to include COVID-19, making everything a little busier than it was before the pandemic. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Communications Commission outlawed robocalls using voices that are generated using artificial intelligence as the rapidly evolving technology raises alarm bells during a presidential election year that has already seen it used for nefarious purposes to spread misinformation. The FCC’s decision comes after a robocall imitating President Joe Biden’s voice discouraged people from voting in last month’s New Hampshire primary election. Investigators have linked the fake Biden robocall to two companies in Texas that have been sent a cease-and-desist order demanding they immediately stop supporting illegal robocall traffic on its networks, though no charges have been filed yet. “Bad actors are using AI-generated voices in unsolicited robocalls to extort vulnerable family members, imitate celebrities, and misinform voters.

The FCC regulation is among the first steps the government has taken to address AI’s ability to trick voters.
