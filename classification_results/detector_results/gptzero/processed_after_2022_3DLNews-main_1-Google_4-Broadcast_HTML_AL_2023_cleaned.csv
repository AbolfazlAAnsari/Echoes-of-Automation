(WALA) - Breaking details are coming out regarding the Buddhist monk mystery. FOX10 News first reported on the puzzling story Monday night, after a monk was found burned and bloody last week. We’ve now learned what was said in the 911 call, the victim made after he was burned. After pressing for answers, Mobile police have also reopened their investigation into this case. “Engine 19, one down, at Altair Lane...between Regulus Drive and Highway 90 Drive.” That’s the call that went out to Mobile Fire-Rescue just after 10:30 on Thursday night. One man down, that triggered a response from both Mobile Police and Mobile Fire-Rescue. The victim’s temple is located off Government Boulevard. He’s currently in critical condition in USA’s burn unit with third-degree burns over most of his body. According to Mobile County 911, the man was calling for emergency help and needed a paramedic. Officials say operators were asking the monk if anyone had hurt him. According to the 911 call, he said no, and that he had an accident while smoking. Late Tuesday afternoon MPD released this statement, which reads in part, “The initial statements made on the night of the incident indicated that it was a medical emergency resulting from an accidental cause. However, the department has initiated an investigation to confirm that the matter was not of a criminal nature. This investigation is currently ongoing, and no further information is available at this time.” One of the monk’s students who doesn’t want to be identified says they found several cigarettes in his van before it was towed off by MPD. “There are cigarettes in his car but from my knowledge he had stopped smoking way back,” she said. “So I don’t really know where the cigarettes come from.” FOX10 News plans to get the full transcript of that 911 call sometime Wednesday.

(WBRC) - The Shelby County Coroner and the Shelby County Sheriff’s Department are investigating after a 3-month-old boy was killed Thursday afternoon by what is described as a wolf-hybrid and reportedly kept as a pet by the baby’s family. Authorities have identified the child as Leo Caddel. It happened in Chelsea on County Road 440 in Chelsea, according to the Shelby County Sheriff’s Department. The Shelby County Coroner says according to the parents, the baby was on the floor and the wolf-hybrid picked up the baby and started playing with him. They stated the parents tried to get the baby from the wolf-hybrid, but it was too late. Chelsea First Responders, Shelby County Deputies and Shelby County Animal Control Officers responded to the scene and took the baby to Grandview Medical Center. The baby died a short time later. The animal was euthanized at the scene by a veterinarian at the request of law enforcement. It was taken to the Alabama State Diagnostics Laboratory in Auburn for further examination and investigation. There is no threat to the public. Wayne Morris, a spokesman for the City of Chelsea, said other children were in the home and DHR is also investigating. Mayor Picklesimer released the following statement Friday morning: “It’s been confirmed that one of our children here in Chelsea was killed by an exotic family pet and succumbed to its injuries yesterday afternoon after being taken to the hospital by Chelsea Fire & Rescue. We are deeply saddened by this unfortunate and tragic event and lift up the family and all those affected with our deepest prayers and thoughts.” Mayor Picklesimer said this will be one of those days he will never forget. “Its just unthinkable that this could happen to this baby. If you choose to own an exotic pet, what comes with that is additional responsibility to be sure that not only your family is safe, but your neighbors are safe.” According to Mayor Picklesimer, it is not illegal to own a wolf-hybrid in the city of Chelsea or the State of Alabama. “Alabama is one of four states in the United States that does not have a code against exotic animals. Once they get a taste, nature takes over and it’s just very sad.” Mayor Picklesimer asked that the community be kind to the family on social media as they grieve this loss. Amy Byrd, a wolf-hybrid expert told WBRC the only way to truly know if you own a wolf-hybrid is through an extensive DNA test. Byrd said true wolf-hybrids are rare and she doesn’t believe there are that many here in Alabama. 80 to 90% of the wolf-hybrids Byrd sees in Alabama are actually multi-generation northern K-9 breeds. In many cases, these animals are sold to inexperienced homes that have not done the proper research on the animals. Regardless, Byrd said the public should be aware that any K-9 is capable of harming small animals and children. “And when you mix that with an ancient breed like a wolf dog, you have an animal with extreme intelligence, a lot of athletic ability and the tendency to want to escape,” said Byrd. Byrd receives in distress calls about mixed breeds frequently, but instead of banning these animals, she hopes the state will enforce breeding regulations and licensing requirements.

Church in Phenix City, Ala., on Nov. 5, 2023. Copeland, the pastor of the church and the mayor of Smiths Station died by suicide. Kim Chandler, AP Photo SMITHS STATION, Ala. (AP) — After the 2019 suicide of a local teenager, small-town mayor and pastor F.L. “Bubba” Copeland helped students place roadside signs in his Alabama community to try to reach others who might be hurting. “You are worthy of love.” “Don’t give up.” “You matter.” Those were the same messages friends said they tried get through to Copeland before he took his own life along one of those county roads two days after a conservative news site exposed social media posts where he appeared in women’s clothing, a wig and makeup. The disclosure bombarded Copeland, 49, with online ridicule and his death, experts said, underscores the dangers of outing people in an era that has seen the erosion of LGBTQ+ rights as states across the country introduce legislation based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Copeland’s friends said they hope it prompts a wave of self-examination about how we treat others. “I just want to ask you people who thought it humorous to publicly ridicule him. Are you happy now? What crime did he commit?” Larry DiChiara, a former school superintendent who knew Copeland from when he served on a county school board, wrote in a pointed Facebook post. Copeland, the mayor of Smiths Station, a city of 5,300 near the Georgia border, ran a small grocery store and was pastor at First Baptist Church in nearby Phenix City, where a sign proclaims to passersby, “Jesus Loves You. All Are Welcome.” His public social media presence detailed baptisms, family gatherings, homecoming parades and sales at his country store. State Rep. Jeremy Gray, a legislator from nearby Opelika, said Copeland had been a “steadfast presence” after a 2019 tornado devastated rural sections of the county, killing more than 20 people. Copeland was photographed with then-President Donald Trump when he toured the area. But Copeland’s private online life became public on Nov. 1 when a conservative news blog posted the first of several items describing posts he made using an alias on Instagram and Reddit as a “transgender curvy girl” with photos of wearing women’s clothing and makeup. After the disclosure, the state Baptist organization said it was aware of allegations of “unbiblical behavior” involving the pastor. And a nationally syndicated radio show said Copeland should be ashamed because the Bible teaches that it is an “abomination” for a man to dress in women’s clothing. An additional post on Nov. 3, the same day Copeland killed himself, accused him of using the names and photos of local residents, including a minor, without permission in posts, including the real name of a local businesswoman in a fictional story about a man who develops a deadly obsession with taking over her identity. Copeland told the news site that he donned women’s clothing as a way to release stress but was not transgender. He stood before his congregation on Nov. 1 to apologize and said that the photos taken in the privacy of his own home were an attempt at humor. “This will not cause my life to change. This will not waver my devotion to my family, to serving my city, to serving my church,” Copeland, a husband, father and stepfather, said in the livestreamed service. Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones said at the time of the suicide, deputies were attempting a welfare check on Copeland because of concerns he might harm himself. Friends said Copeland acknowledged he was struggling in the days before his death. DiChiara said he reached out to Copeland by text Thursday and the mayor responded that “it’s been some very dark days.” “When this story came out, it was already painful and hurtful just to see it and know that, that this is going to cause a lot of grief for Bubba and his family. But as I read what was out there, it just was getting progressively worse and I just saw some real ugliness in people and their comments,” DiChiara said. Jack Drescher, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University and the author of “Psychoanalytic Therapy and the Gay Man” said outing can be an act of violence and in this case it “precipitated a violent response.” Drescher said people can have reasons to keep sexual or gender identities and behaviors, such as cross-dressing, secret because they don’t feel like they would be accepted. “It was probably a great source of shame and embarrassment to be outed like that,” Drescher said. Chad Peacock, a former Auburn resident, said Copeland was one of the few elected officials to show support for a local Pride event he organized. He said he believed the anti-LGBTQ climate in the state bears some responsibility for Copeland’s suicide. “You have to fit the box. You can be who you are, but you should be ashamed of who you are if you’re different,” Peacock said of the atmosphere. Alabama lawmakers have imposed bans on transgender women playing on female sports teams in schools and colleges and approved a ban, now in litigation, on treating transgender minors with gender-affirming hormones or puberty blockers. The state in 2019 changed the process for obtaining a marriage license because several probate judges had refused to issue them after the U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing same-sex couples to marry. “The unrelenting anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric coming from state legislative houses and high-profile politicians has real life consequences in the form of online and in-person bullying, harassment and violence,” said Sam Lau, vice president of communications for LGBTQ+ advocacy group The Human Rights Campaign. Lau noted the long history of outing public figures in the U.S., which he said “consistently causes harm — forced outing is a direct attempt to endanger the person being outed.” On Sunday, flowers sat piled in a memorial against a wooden cross outside the church where Copeland’s funeral service will be held Thursday. The church, like Copeland, has been targeted with hateful comments on social media, church member Dr. David White said. “The anonymous nature of the internet seems to make a lot of people without sin. They’re people that cast stones from across the horizon that you can’t respond to and you can’t defend. So I hope it makes us all reflect,” White said. Friends and congregants shared stories about Copeland and said they hope he is remembered for other aspects of his life. “He was such a good person. They just don’t know the person that they just destroyed,” Peacock said. White, who recalled the pastor as kindhearted and hardworking, said he has been thinking about what he will say at Copeland’s funeral. “Your legacy is not what hits the media in the week before your death, but it is in the minds and hearts of the hundreds and thousands of people that you have touched and that love you,” White said.

(WKRG) — Disgraced Catholic priest Alex Crow has married a young woman he met at McGill-Toolen Catholic High School and flew to Italy with, according to a public record that WKRG News 5 has obtained. Alexander Matthew Carter Crow, 30, has married the 18-year-old Mobile woman, according to an Alabama Marriage Certificate from the Judge of Probate’s office. (WKRG News 5 has decided not to include his wife’s name in our reporting.) Crow and the woman signed the notarized marriage certificate on Nov. 17, 2023, and the probate court received it on Monday, according to the document. The marriage license seems to counter Crow’s own words about his intentions. When Crow and his then-girlfriend left the country, he wrote a letter to the Archdiocese of Mobile saying he would never return to America. In July, the Archdiocese of Mobile, the church’s regional administrative division, formally punished Crow for that action along with other accusations. “Fr. Alex Crow abandoned his assignment in the Archdiocese,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “His behavior is totally unbecoming of a priest. He has been informed by the archbishop that he may no longer exercise ministry as a priest, nor to tell people he is a priest, nor to dress as a priest.” The news of Crow’s marriage took the archdiocese by surprise. “Until today, we were not aware that they had become civilly married,” a spokesperson said. Crow was ordained a priest in 2021. He was assigned to Corpus Christi Parish. Crow was a spiritual leader at McGill-Toolen High School at the same time the girl was studying there, according to past WKRG News 5 reports. According to a Facebook post from McGill-Toolen, Crow visited Theology classes and heard confessions from September through December 2021. Initially, Crow was accused of grooming the 2023 McGill-Toolen graduate. Earlier this month, the Mobile County Sheriff’s Office announced that they closed the case on Crow. So did Mobile County District Attorney Keith Blackwood, who said his office interviewed 30 witnesses and reviewed thousands of pages of documents. Despite the case being closed, Sheriff Paul Burch maintained that he believes Crow groomed the teen at a young age leading up to the couple’s departure. “Once a predator, always a predator,” Burch said about Crow at the time. “Why else would you start something if you didn’t intend there would be a physical relationship in the end?” Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

Mary Scott Hodgin, WBHM The Gulf South’s prison population is on the rise, including a sharp uptick in the number of people in prison in Mississippi, according to a new report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The research shows the Magnolia State led the nation in growth by percentage in its prison population between 2021 and 2022. Mississippi added more than 2,400 to its counts of people in state and federal correctional centers — an increase of more than 14%. During that same period, Alabama’s prison rolls increased by more than 5% and Louisiana’s by more than 4%, the report said. The regional numbers matched a national trend of swelling prison headcounts. The country’s prison population grew for the first time since 2013, upending nearly a decade of declines in a troubling reversal. Vera Louisiana director Sarah Omojola said a possible contributor to the increase in her state includes a reversion to “tough on crime” policy, such as lawmakers pushing for ways to make sentences longer. “What we see is that that makes the prison population grow, and [then] incarceration destabilizes people and their families,” she said. “And that makes it worse because that aggravates root causes of violence.” Growth in prison populations wasn’t universal across the states. Eight states bucked the national trend, with Virginia’s tally of prisoners falling by more than 10% since 2021.

It includes people in jails in a few states where those institutions and prison systems are integrated, a footnote to the data shows. At the end of 2022, more than 25,000 additional people were in state and federal correctional centers than at the end of the previous year. Overall, about 1.2 million people were imprisoned at those sites. Mississippi and Louisiana also had the country’s two highest rates of imprisonment at the close of 2022. For every 100,000 people in Mississippi, 661 were in state and federal prisons, the researchers calculated. Researchers also marked growth in the number of women in prisons. That total was up by nearly 5% at the end of last year.
