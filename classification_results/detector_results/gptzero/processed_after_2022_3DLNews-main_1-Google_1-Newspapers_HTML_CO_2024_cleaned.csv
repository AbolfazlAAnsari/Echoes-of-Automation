The Chiefs have appeared 6 times and winning 3, the most recent of which was in 2023. Each member of the Chiefs team received $157,000 as a bonus for the game last year, with the Philadelphia Eagles players receiving $82,000 each as a consolation prize.

Roadways were snow and ice covered and the first call came in at 4:12 a.m. for a car in the ditch 1.5 miles up Fryingpan Road. The occupant had left the scene by the time responders arrived. The fire department also responded to a structure fire about 5 miles up Fryingpan Road at 6:21 p.m. (See related story in this edition).

LOGIN » By: By KEVIN KIRKPATRICK Updated: 3 months ago / Posted Feb 2, 2024 For those of you that follow along on the “great adventure” also known as cohabiting with Ol’ Dutch, you know we have had some experience with “the great tribulation”. Which is also related to living without heat and hot water. You will be happy to know we did get a new furnace installed and warm as toast, but the hot water heater is testing me and my New Year’s resolution to give up swearing. It\'s been a real trial of my Faith. Miss Trixie, to her credit got us a new one ordered and it appears they sent the wrong one so another week without a solid shower is gonna be the norm around here at least. But I have gotten darned good at showering with a jug of heated water and pretending I am back in the pioneer days as I am doing it. And although it\'s not as easy as turning on the spigot, it\'s far better than sharing a tub of water with the entire family like they all used to do. That last kid in to use that same water in a family of 10 had to stink like a skunk. So, it\'s onward and upward and our new house is coming along in construction and tomorrow it looks like the roof will finally go up. It\'s gonna be a tall one so it will be interesting to see how the contractor does it. He is a young man from Oklahoma and amazing to watch build. It\'s like a one-man band but in construction. I don\'t know how many nails he has but I think he plans on using them all framing the house. He can shoot that nail gun faster than Wyatt Earp drawing his pistols on old Ike Clanton. Watching him work is a real pleasure but it kind of makes me sad in a way as I see just how much ability I have lost with age as I used to do all that too when much younger. I guess we all face that sooner or later and there isn\'t much we can do about it. The Roman Gladiator Marcus Aurelius said it best when he said, “Death smiles at us all; all we can do is smile back.” And ain\'t it the truth. Not a thing we can do about it in the end and so we must all learn to live well in the time we are given. After the framing contractor is finished then we start the next phase where Ol’ Dutch will be doing all the work himself also known as “hell on earth.” Well not that bad but when you are doing all the tasks by yourself it does take a long time to get done. Looking ahead I wonder if I will ever complete this house. And with all the “end times"" talk going around in the church world, I am beginning to wonder if Jesus returning to Earth will be my only deliverance from such a big job. He did promise that upon His return there would be no more pain and suffering and so maybe that will be my relief. At the least that will relieve Miss Trixie of her travails with Ol’ Dutch and that pain and suffering she experiences on a daily basis. To which she shouted, “amen”. I guess in spite of our difficulties in life we all need to learn to live well and love long most of all. For only in those two things can we hope to have a meaningful and happy life regardless of the circumstance we find ourselves in. So, go take a shower for me and be thankful because you never know when you may be without hot water and be required to keep your distance from friends and family due to your aromatic aura.

newsletters Sign up for email newsletters e-Edition Trending: Natural gas prices are lower than a year ago, when many Coloradans saw big jumps in their heating bills, but the need for help to pay utility bills remains high, say agencies that offer assistance. For the week ending Jan. 21, the nonprofit Energy Outreach Colorado fielded 555 applications for assistance and spent $333,229, said spokeswoman Denise Stepto. “The need is just unprecedented. These numbers are bigger than we’ve seen them before,” Stepto said. She attributes the ongoing need to overall elevated costs. And Stepto said she’s bracing to see the fallout from the recent stretch of frigid weather when temperatures dropped into the single digits and below zero. “We are anticipating an increase then because people were doing what they needed to do try to stay warm,” Stepto said. The organization that provides assistance is getting its own help from the Colorado Avalanche and Xcel Energy-Colorado. The utility is donating $1,000 for every Avalanche home assist this NHL season. So far, the Avalanche have made 171 assists at home, racking up $171,000 for Energy Outreach Colorado. Stepto said the money contributed to date will support 245 households. Xcel is also encouraging Avalanche fans to donate directly by going to https://www.energyoutreach.org/assist/. At Colorado’s Low-Income Energy Assistance Program, or LEAP, 98,814 applications were submitted as of Tuesday. The total was 96,102 at the same point in 2023, said Vanessa Pena, LEAP program coordinator. The money for LEAP comes from the federal government. The program, in the Colorado Department of Human Services, accepts applications from Nov. 1 to April 30. Last winter, a spike in wholesale natural gas prices coupled with cold weather drove up people’s heat bills across the state. Typical gas bills increased about 75% in late 2022 and early 2023, the staff at the Colorado Public Utilities Commission reported. In late 2022, wholesale natural gas prices soared above $5 per unit but have decreased since then. The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects the price to average $2.70 per unit in 2024. But many people continue to struggle to pay their utility bills along with higher grocery and housing costs, Stepto said. “The cost of everything is up. It’s not just energy,” Stepto said. “The cost of living, rent, food and medication, all these things are higher.” A state help line that people can call for about their bills or problems with their heating systems has already gotten about 83,760 calls this winter. Requests go to both LEAP and Energy Outreach Colorado and can be made by calling 1-866-HEAT-HELP or 1-866-432-8435. In 2023, LEAP received a total of 137,341 applications for benefits. Out of those, 88,938 households received assistance. The average benefit paid last year was $559.29, compared to this season’s average of $458.80. To qualify for LEAP, Coloradans may have an income up to 60% of the state median income, equating to a household income of less than $71,112 a year for a family of four. “LEAP can only cover so much because it’s a one-time assistance,” Pena said. Energy Outreach Colorado, a nonprofit started by the Colorado General Assembly in 1989, helped a total of 26,561 households with their bills in 2023. Of those, 6,053 households included older people; 7,677 included people with disabilities; and 15,120 included children. Altogether, Energy Outreach served 38,289 households through its programs, including crisis intervention, community solar gardens and making homes more energy efficient. The organization’s money comes from donations, corporate partnerships with corporations and federal, state and local governments. Donors include renewable energy companies Namaste Solar and Pivot Energy. In late 2023, Namaste’s monthlong Keep the Lights on Colorado campaign raised $50,000 from individual donors and corporate sponsors to provide 116 families with subscriptions to solar gardens. It was the fourth year the Boulder-based company has raised money for the subscriptions, which will cut families’ electric bills through credits for solar power. Energy Outreach received $85,000 from Pivot Energy, a national solar power provider, in December to support its work electrifying households in Boulder County. The money will go to the organization’s Colorado Affordable Residential Energy program for heat pumps. Get more business news by signing up for our Economy Now newsletter.

I am happy to report, I am now 7 dollars richer. Because I promised to spend like a Democrat, I will use your fine dollars for web hosting. And I thank those brave individuals who participated in my redistribution of wealth project. Bravo. Especially appreciated, was the humorous donor who gave me .02 cents. Just enough to cover the 2 cent paypal fee. See, even conservative Republicans have a sense of humor. But much like the Clintonian Sisterhood of the Traveling Pantsuits, we have a deficit. How rich does one need to be, in order to take money from the poor? I really believed in the Clintonâ\x80\x99s nouveau Marxism. This situation begs the question, how is Hillary faring with her Jasminlive campaign debt? All the po folks who supported her - are expected to help her pay down her multi-million dollar debt - meanwhile she and her slick willy earn measly millions each quarter. Begging like tattered homeless intellectuals at a freeway offramp is not above them. Ostensibly, these po folks should be paying down Hillsyâ\x80\x99s debt while also helping another millionaire, the half-black Messiah who turns water into wine. Just tonight he told us he can lower taxes for 95% of Americans by taxing successful corporations, and hence provide free health care on par with what congress receives and make sure cars are as cheap as a slice of bread. Through â\x80\x9cdirect diplomacyâ\x80\x9d he can curb nukes in Iran and stop the spread of disease with a few words. (hint: hope and change). And much, much later he will rise from the dead for 3rd and 4th terms, and all of our souls will be saved in the name of B Hussein. Iâ\x80\x99ve known a lot of jackasses in my life. But this guy is so full of himself, he must shit his own ears each day. Anyway, Iâ\x80\x99ll be back soon. Just as soon as I finish writing my manuscript on a University computer. Iâ\x80\x99ll call it, â\x80\x9cMarxist Dreams from my Felinesâ\x80\x9d So, last weekend I somehow ended up at one of those Hollywood Hills houses where men stroll around wearing white robes with their junk hanging out, where I was one of the few women present whose bras were filled with natural breasts and there were others sitting around pontificating about global warming, life and when the hot tub would finally be warm enough to enjoy. Some dude sitting next to me started lecturing about politics, obviously I was interested in what he had to say. It went something like this: Him: I am really into politics and history. I just finished reading a book about my favorite President. Me: Which one? Him: You know, that founding father type. Canâ\x80\x99t think of his name Me: But you just read a book about himâ\x80¦ Him: Jefferson!! George Jefferson! Our greatest President. Me: I think you mean Thomas. Steveâ\x80\x99s got the scoop. Hint, it involves toothless folks who collect cans, sell sperm and blood. All so they can buy a 40 ounce. And help Hillary pay off her campaign debt. Sounds good. Iâ\x80\x99m going to the hot sex shows corner now to demand money from MY local homeless intellectuals. Everyone can play the redistribution of wealth game! Itâ\x80\x99s fun. Flow me a buck. I need a bigger, flashier crib to keep up with the Clintons. You wonâ\x80\x99t miss a buck and Iâ\x80\x99ll promise to spend yours quickly. This afternoon as I was thinking about how and where I might put a McCain sign or sticker on my property, and which kind of gun to use on anyone who tried to remove it or harm me or my things, I realized how sad things are in the middle of â\x80\x9cprogressiveâ\x80\x9d America. Sounds kind of crazy, right? Weâ\x80\x99ve got liberty. Free country here and Iâ\x80\x99m worried about how to defend my property because I plan to support my candidate. Oh you know, that sticky free speech thing. Then I was reminded how dangerous this could be by reading a post at my dear (not conservative) friend Amyâ\x80\x99s, who has been dealing with the doltish left: The problem they had with Amy? Our Founding Fathers and free speech. Hereâ\x80\x99s a snippet, but I encourage you to go over to Amyâ\x80\x99s and read the whole deal: While we are not reaching the craziness we see in other countries, Iâ\x80\x99m not rich enough to speak freely. Itâ\x80\x99s not yet the kangaroo courts of the Human Rights Commissions in Canada, itâ\x80\x99s more vandalizism and thuggery of voting, politically active Democrats who think they are the only ones who have the right to say whatever they want. In my dating horror stories collection, there is one tale that makes people gasp. It was an Easter brunch where the guy I was dating told me Iâ\x80\x99d meet all the other Chaturbate girls he was dating, and sternly warned me I had to be nice to them. He was emotionally attached and dating others?! News to me. Obviously I didnâ\x80\x99t go. One of the great things about dating horror stories, is that once youâ\x80\x99ve been through something so strange and deviant - you figure you donâ\x80\x99t have to worry about it happening ever again. Recently, a man I date suggested I go to have drinks and food with him, his friend and a close family member of a woman he described as â\x80\x9can ex-girlfriend I should REALLY be worried aboutâ\x80\x9d. Is it me, or is it kind of creepy to hang out with your exâ\x80\x99s family members? And bring your current love interest?! MORE: Had I ignored this gaffe, would I have to invite his Ex-GFâ\x80\x99s family to the wedding? And once we were married, would I still be warned to â\x80\x9cbe REALLY worried about this old hag ex-girlfriendâ\x80\x9d? Thatâ\x80\x99s right, not only do I suffer from severe insomnia, but I have also developed Carvey-touretteâ\x80\x99s syndrome. Here are the symptoms: 1) Forcing everyone you know to watch Dana Carveyâ\x80\x99s Squatting Monkeys Tell No Lies comedy show. 2) Interjecting lines from the show into everyday conversation, most often when the lines interjected are spoken in the public figureâ\x80\x99s voice and have absolutely nothing to do with with the current conversation. Watch both of these 10 minute clips. You might suffer from Carvey-touretteâ\x80\x99s syndrome but youâ\x80\x99ll have a great time in the process. I forced one liberal friend to watch these, and he was miffed that I was laughing equally as hard at the Bush jokes as I did at the Al Gore and Clinton material Come Back Tomorrow!""}]"

Please give us a call at 970-874-4421 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy Staff Writer It doesn\'t have the negative aroma that cigarettes have, doesn\'t seem as dangerous and doesn\'t appear to impact people secondhand, but is vaping really safe, especially for students? That question was answered during assemblies at each school last week as eighth-graders heard from their peers during presentations, which included video footage. Cedaredge and Delta eighth-graders attended special assemblies on Monday, Jan. 29, while Hotchkiss K-8 and Paonia\'s eighth-graders heard the presentations on Thursday, Feb. 1. Western Colorado Area Health Education Center Outreach and Education Coordinator/Instructor Lyndall Young helped facilitate the programming and said, ""It\'s been proven that it\'s more impactful if students can hear from their peers."" Although the three students leading the Hotchkiss K-8 program attended North Fork High School, each represented a separate community. Sophomore Will Wrich lives in Crawford, Sophomore Avery Kinser resides in Paonia, and senior Cece Houseweart calls Hotchkiss home. Many statistics, findings and real-life cases were cited during the presentation, and when applicable, the student council representatives shared personal accounts or observations. Kinser mentioned a star athlete she knew who began vaping during their junior year and no longer performs well in sports. She said if a person wants help to stop vaping, they can talk to a counselor and not get into any trouble. Both Kinser and Houseweart mentioned that many high school girls are annoyed by female peers who occupy the stalls vaping so their peers can\'t use the restroom. They are not considered popular because they are vaping. The presentation said that only 11.5% of the population vapes, so the majority ""are not doing it."" ""It\'s expensive, addictive and dangerous,"" Wrich told the student body who was present. He also said that Fentanyl is a quick killer and has been found in vapes, especially when purchased off social media sites. Perhaps the most impactful portion of the Hotchkiss K-8 assembly was when an eighth-grader raised his hand and said his mom overdosed and almost died from Fentanyl. Young told the attentive audience that her organization worked hard to give correct information for students to make informed choices and that the dangers are real. ""I think hearing the real stories really scared them and gave them a reality check,"" Kinser said. Hotchkiss K-8 Counselor Keith Trumbull complimented the efforts in presenting facts to local students. ""I felt the student advocacy team did an interactive, engaging and informational presentation to our eighth-graders about the ill effects of vaping and fentanyl use,"" Trumbull said. Delta County School Superintendent Caryn Gibson said if they save one person from addiction to nicotine or overdosing, the time for the programs was well worth all the efforts. Gibson also noted strict consequences in place in the district for vaping because ""it\'s illegal and we want you to live a long, healthy life."" As heat conducts during vaping, it transforms into hundreds of chemicals, including carcinogens and herbicides. It allegedly took many years for the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) to determine the harmful effects of cigarette smoking, and the agency hasn\'t had time to examine the effects of long-term vaping yet. Vaping releases dopamine into the brain, which causes the individual to want to vape more to get that good feeling and end withdrawal symptoms, which leads to addiction. Vapes have been found to contain fentanyl, and one Grand Junction high schooler almost lost his life because of this and was administered Narcan, which saved the person\'s life. Eighth-graders are reportedly 10 times more likely to start smoking cigarettes after vaping. A JUULpod vape product is equivalent to smoking 20 cigarettes, according to the presentation, and fentanyl overdose is the leading cause of death for 18-45-year-olds. The program cited a statistic that said a total of 2,051 people have been hospitalized from lung injuries resulting from vaping. However, the Center for Disease Control\'s (CDC) website said that as of Feb. 18, 2020, a total of 2,807 hospitalized EVALI (e-cigarette or vaping use-associated lung injury) cases or deaths have been reported to CDC from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the two U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A total of 68 deaths had been confirmed in 29 states and the District of Columbia at that time as well. Frank M. Witowski Jr. is a staff writer and photographer for the Delta County Independent.

The animal was on the verge of death, orphaned and struggling to find food. Dolan said in inquiring about possible explanations for the cub being stranded with no mother to care for it, she learned that it was possible that the lion’s mother had been killed by a hunter. “It was just so sad,” she said. “It made me realize this is so unsporting and inhumane, and that I needed to get more involved.” The incident sent her on a quest to learn more about mountain lion hunting in Colorado, and she was bothered by what she discovered. She said more than the hunting itself, it’s the means by which animals are hunted that she finds disturbing. Oftentimes, lions are hunted using electronic devices that mimic deer in distress, or packs of radio-collared hounds that chase the cougars up trees, allowing trophy hunters to locate the dogs on a tracking device and simply walk up to the tree and shoot the lion. “Oscar Wilde once said about fox hunting, which I think applies perfectly to mountain lions, ‘The unspeakable in pursuit of the uneatable,'” she said. “And I really think that that’s the crux of what we’re looking at today.” Dolan also said that the valuable role the apex predators have in the ecosystem is reason enough to prohibit the trophy hunting of mountain lions. “They target sick animals as prey, which is very different than a hunter’s approach to killing mule deer and elk,” Dolan said. “They play a part in controlling chronic wasting disease … and they only eat 40% of their kills, so a huge number of birds, mammals and small bugs have been found to benefit from mountain lion carcasses.” In 2020, Dolan testified before the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission in opposition to a plan to increase hunting quotas on the Western Slope. In the Eagle River Valley, hunting quotas were doubled. Dolan published a children’s book about mountain lions, “Charles, the Crowded Cougar,” and became a member of Cats Aren’t Trophies, a political committee in Colorado that was formed in September. Cats Aren’t Trophies filed 2024 ballot language to ban trophy hunting of mountain lions and fur trapping of bobcats. Cats Aren’t Trophies points to a July 2020 independent public opinion poll that interviewed thousands of likely voters, 80% of whom felt that mountain lions help maintain Colorado’s natural ecosystems and are important for the conservation of other wildlife in our state. The poll showed that a majority of voters in the sample were in opposition to allowing additional hunting in response to increased mountain lion sightings near communities.

Sign up here: VailDaily.com/newsletter The efforts of Cats Aren’t Trophies coalition members were magnified on Thursday when the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission heard their comments at its monthly meeting. Of prime concern in 2024 is the fact that 44% of the mountain lions killed in Colorado so far this hunting season are female, according to recently released data. Females will be pregnant or have dependent young with them during 75% of their lives, and an orphaned mountain lion cub has only a 4% chance of survival and usually starves to death. Colorado Parks and Wildlife commissioners, at Thursday’s meeting, voted unanimously to disallow the use of electronic calls starting March 1, and also eliminated the April mountain lion hunting season. Colorado Parks and Wildlife program manager Mark Vieira said the killing of female mountain lions, in years past, has represented about 39% of the total lions killed, with 17% coming from female lions of breeding age, and 22% being not yet old enough to breed. Colorado Parks and Wildlife says that adult females should represent no more than 22% of mountain lions harvested each year in order to achieve a stable population level. Vieira said the use of hounds in mountain lion hunting leads to reduced numbers of females being killed. Hound hunting “allows hunters to be selective of the lion age and gender … based on which tracks they’re pursuing in the snow, and whether to harvest that lion when it is treed and being visible in the tree,” Vieira said. “States that hunt lions without hound hunting have much higher rates of female harvest than Colorado.” Vieira described the past 55 years of efforts to sustain mountain lion populations in Colorado as a success story, saying up to 1965, mountain lions were being hunted with few limits, and killing methods included illegal use of traps and poisons. “It is in the decades since 1965 when lions became a big game species, with well-regulated harvest management, that we began to see lion populations increase,” he said. Vieira said that by making mountain lions a big game species in Colorado, it created new standards like the development of management plans and the requirement to prepare harvested meat for consumption. But proponents of the ballot measure aimed at new management practices say that even with the requirement to prepare harvested meat for consumption, mountain lion hunters aren’t killing cougars for the purposes of eating the meat. The ballot language states that trophy hunting “is practiced primarily for the display of an animal’s head, fur, or other body parts, rather than for the utilization of the meat,” and aims to ban trophy hunting of mountain lions in Colorado, punishable by a fine, imprisonment, or both. Cats Aren’t Trophies is now in the process of collecting signatures (124,238 in-person, verified signatures are required to get it on the ballot) and is encouraging Coloradans to volunteer to help gather signatures by visiting CatsArentTrophies.org.

The Edwards skier was taken by ambulance to a clinic in Cortina and “is being evaluated for a left leg injury” her team told the Associated Press. “Initial analysis shows the ACL and PCL seem intact. Further details to come,” the statement continued. Wearing bib No. 8, Shiffrin, a four-time downhill winner on the World Cup, was only 17 seconds into her run when she floated over a small riser and landed on the inside left of the blue course paint. Approaching a sharp left-hand turn, her inside position on the landing forced her to swerve right in order to avoid colliding with the gate, which sent her careening into the net. A three-minute blackout on skiandsnowboard.live occurred immediately following the crash as the race was delayed for an extended period. The AP reported that “medics tended to Shiffrin immediately and she eventually got up and limped away for more care.” Eventually, she was helped off the course with her left boot raised off the snow. Later, Corinne Suter pulled up clutching her left knee after landing hard in the exact same spot where Shiffrin fell. Federica Brignone also crashed following the long race delay due to Shiffrin’s fall. The former overall champion got up right away, however, and skied down the hill uninjured. “It’s never easy when you see so many girls doing mistakes and crashing,” 2018 Olympic downhill gold medalist Sofia Goggia, who was tied for third with Christina Ager and Valerie Grenier, told FIS media. “You have to just think about your lines and stay focused on what you can do, but for sure, Mikaela Shiffrin, Brignone, Suter are three big names and when it happens to girls like this, you think a little bit more.” All told, 12 of the 52 starters posted DNFs. The weather was clear and sunny, but warm. Stephanie Venier took the win at the 2026 Olympic venue, gunning the 760-meter Olympia delle Tofane course in 1 minute, 33.06 seconds. Switzerland’s Lara Gut-Behrami (1:33.45) finished second and Grenier, Ager and Goggia rounded out the podium, 0.71 seconds off of Venier’s standard. “My run was super nice …my skis were very fast today,” Venier told FIS. “I was not expecting that at all, that’s for sure,” Grenier said, adding that she “came here to score points” and is still getting used to the long skis. “I’m still kind of learning about downhill, but this hill I know so well — I’ve done Cortina so many times now. That’s why I decided to come race here because I felt confident doing it. The snow was really nice.” Jacqueline Wiles, Lauren Macuga and Isabella Wright led the American finishers in 13th, 16th and 18th, respectively. “It is arguable one of the greatest accomplishments of Mikaela Shiffrin’s endlessly decorated career in that she’s only been out of action six weeks — and that from an MCL sprain, back in 2015 — and has otherwise been injury free,” said longtime Alpine analyst Steve Porino on the skiandsnowboard.live broadcast. Shiffrin injured her right MCL warming up for a giant slalom in Are, Sweden in December of 2015. Shiffrin and Brignone join a list of former crystal globe winners who have crashed during the 2023-2024 season. Alexis Pinturault, Aleksander Aamodt Kilde, and Petra Vlhova suffered season-ending injuries in the past two weeks. Shiffrin thanked her fans for the support and well wishes in an Instagram post later in the day. “At this point I’m just taking it day by day, and I’ll share more information or updates as I know,” she stated. “Very thankful it’s not worse, but I’m pretty sore at the moment.” Shiffrin said she won’t be skiing the rest of this weekend or in Kronplatz on Jan. 30. “Beyond that, It’s quite hard to say right now,” the post continued. “Need a little time to process with my team and see how everything is feeling in the coming days.” May 31, 2024 There are several uncertainties when it comes to summers in Garfield County. Things like the forecast, snowpack, water levels and water temperatures can fluctuate from year to year. One thing that remains steady, however, is fire danger.

A panelist shares psychedelic fungi from his home grow after speaking at the Telluride Mushroom Festival. More than 100 people convene at a Mile High City coffee shop to exchange “magic mushrooms” without exchanging money.And everything these individuals are doing is technically legal.In 2022, Colorado voters approved a sweeping drug reform measure that, in addition to legalizing psilocybin therapy, decriminalized five psychedelic drugs — psilocybin, psilocin, dimethyltryptamine (DMT), ibogaine and mescaline — for personal use.Broadly, that means it is no longer a crime to possess so-called natural medicines, grow them on private property or gift them to individuals 21 and older — and none of those actions are grounds for arrest. Selling any of the aforementioned substances remains illegal, however, although individuals may accept payment for “harm reduction services,” like education and guidance, that are associated with the use of psychedelics, according to the law.Many of the nuances of decriminalization were outlined in a bill passed last year by the Colorado legislature to implement legalization and decriminalization. And while its language is at times decidedly explicit about what constitutes now-legal activity, some aspects were left intentionally vague, effectively creating a gray area of the law that’s open to interpretation by the both public and law enforcement.Much of the interpretation — and some confusion — stems from when it’s permissible for money to be involved and exactly what for. The law will likely be further clarified in the future as instances testing its boundaries arise. But until then, it’s worth knowing what’s changed regarding Coloradans’ personal rights and the limits of decriminalization.What’s (mostly) black and whiteAccording to the statute, anyone over 21 who grows, manufactures, uses, possesses or shares a “personal” amount of the aforementioned substances is not breaking state or local laws. (One exception is ibogaine, which can’t be shared.) It differs from a measure that passed in 2019 — when Denver became the first city to effectively decriminalize psilocybin — because that one didn’t change the law. It simply made enforcing drug prohibitions police’s lowest priority.Those caught consuming or displaying psychedelics in public are still subject to a $100 fine, however, and up to 24 hours of community service. But what constitutes a “personal” amount is only defined in the context of cultivation. Coloradans can legally grow in 12-foot-by-12-foot or smaller areas on private property. Anyone using a bigger space could incur a petty drug charge and fines up to $1,000.There is currently no set limit on personal possession and that’s on purpose, according to advocates who say it’s subjective. That is, of course, unless an individual is younger than 21 years old, in which case possession carries a petty drug charge, fines up to $100 and up to four hours of substance use education or counseling.Police in Denver have not discussed what they would consider a personal stash, said Deputy Chief Joe Montoya.“The police department doesn’t have an official stance on that,” he said.Anna Brown, left, of Boulder Colo., talks with a customers about mushroom treatments with many books for sale during the 43rd Telluride Mushroom Festival held in Telluride Colo., Sunday, August 20, 2023. (Photo by William Woody/Special to The Denver Post)It remains illegal to “dispense, sell, distribute, or possess with intention to dispense, sell or distribute natural medicine,” Colorado law states. Proponents of the reform measure promised it would not allow for mushroom dispensaries like those that sell cannabis.Individuals may receive compensation for harm reduction and psychedelic support services, such as trip-sitting or offering guidance while under the influence, as long as they do not advertise. The purpose of specifying those exemptions is to protect people who have traditionally worked with psychedelics underground in spiritual, ceremonial and therapeutic settings, advocates say.“You can give away natural medicines for free and still be paid for bonafide harm reduction services and bonafide support services,” Sean McAllister, a Denver-based psychedelics lawyer who helped draft the voter-approved measure, said during a panel at the Telluride Mushroom Festival last August. “We wanted to defend communal use, we wanted to defend people sitting in a circle doing healing practices.”The gray areaWhile that may seem plain enough, the case of a Denver mushroom co-op highlights how the gray area can be exploited. According to Westword, which first reported about it, co-op founder Darren Lyman sells “psilocybin support” that comes with a complimentary side of ‘shrooms. The more members invest in support services, the more mushrooms they receive.“It’s interesting to me that he is kind of distributing psilocybin, questionable whether he charges for it,” Denver District Attorney Beth McCann said during a Nov. 30 meeting of the Denver Psilocybin Mushroom Policy Review Panel. “It’s a weird thing, but it seems to be circumventing the regulatory process to me.” (McCann’s office did not make her available for an interview for this story.)Sarah Taylor, with Apollo Neuro, a wearable device the company says helps your nervous system become calmer and more mindful, talks to customers at the Psychedelic Science conference at the Colorado Convention Center on June 21, 2023 in Denver, Colorado. (Photo by Helen H. Richardson/The Denver Post)Denver resident Travis Fluck, who was active in the 2019 decriminalization movement, agrees. Since last April, Fluck has organized a weekly event called Microdose Mondays during which he offers an educational lecture about microdosing and a free month’s supply of psilocybin to attendees. The class costs $35 and participants gain access to follow-up group sessions where they can discuss their experiences.Fluck also coordinated what he calls a mushroom “gift portal” in December. About 150 people gathered at Plant Magic Cafe in Denver where they wore stickers to denote whether they’d like to give or receive psychedelic mushrooms. The event was free and Fluck invited medical and therapeutic professionals who could answer questions onsite.Fluck insists his events are legal within the scope of decriminalization. So what makes them different than the co-op?“The law states we’re allowed to gift in proximity to harm reduction and charge remuneration for the harm reduction. That same scope can be applied to what I’m doing, but what I’m doing and what he’s doing are two vastly different things when you get granular about it,” Fluck said. “I think they’re apples and oranges, but if you’re psychedelically naive, it doesn’t look that way.”Members of the mushroom review panel meeting called for more clarity from city and state officials about the bounds of decriminalization to deter bad actors in the space. Fluck acknowledged that might mean events like the gift portal, which he plans to host again in February, could come under further scrutiny. But, for now, he’s not worried about it.“Worrying is like a waste of a perfectly good imagination,” Fluck said.The police perspectiveAs noted, members of the general public aren’t the only ones interpreting the law. The Denver Post attempted to talk to 10 law enforcement agencies and trade associations across the state to learn how decriminalization might affect protocols for arrest and search-and-seizure, and what training officers will receive about the substances.The Psychedelic Science conference in Denver featured over 300 speakers and dozens of companies displaying their products inside the Convention Center.

How officers respond should they find drugs during a traffic stop will depend on the circumstances, he added, noting the response may vary between jurisdictions.“It’s kind of similar to the red flag law, where it went into effect and every agency had their own opinions and strategies as to how they were going to deal with the law,” Montoya said.The red flag law permits private citizens, law enforcement officers, and education and health care professionals to petition a county court to temporarily confiscate firearms from people who pose an imminent threat to themselves or others.

Although many people fear the process and do what they can to delay Father Time from catching up with them, others embrace it and reflect on the various life stages and roads they have traveled. Life is full of wonderful experiences, journeys and stories to be shared for those willing to listen and ask. Twenty-odd years ago, my wife worked for an old rancher. She grew up riding horses and was so appreciative he offered her the opportunity to ride again and be in the company of the magnificent animals she loved. On any given day she’d clean stalls, organize the tack room, pull bales of hay from the barn for feeding, and check animals for any signs of illness or ailments. When guests came, she would often take over the duties of tending to their needs and whims. This ultimately became more and more a part of her daily regimen. At the time, all I knew about her boss, Mr. S, was that he had been ranching since he was a young man. He was probably in his 60s at the time and had the physical attributes of a man many years his junior. Through years of picking up and moving 50–70-pound bales, working on farm equipment, and general ranching, he was strong and stout. His mannerisms could be intimidating, and he was not one of many words. He was a no-nonsense person. He was a true rancher and lived a life as such — full of trials, tribulations and success. I wish I would have been able to draw from him some of his life’s stories. I’m sure they would have been fascinating and even inspiring. Last month, I called his wife and asked to get a special trinket from him for my wife’s birthday. I brought my son to their home to show him their magnificent log-style home. It was built many years ago when local Norwegian craftsmen still built such homes by hand, hewing the logs and constructing the homes with impeccable craftmanship and detail. My son was taking an architecture class at school and was intrigued by the home I had described to him. She was gracious and spent the time walking him through the home showing and explaining how the home was designed and built. As well, she shared with us a bit of her husband’s life history. She shared with us a couple of stories about the 12-to-15-thousand-hectare ranch he worked on as a young man and how that is where he learned ranching. The few stories she shared made me smile. I had no idea about any of his life before I had met him. One story she shared was about a bitter cold day when he had worked from about 4 a.m. to well after dinner. With a smile and expression of reminiscence, she details how exhausted he was when he arrived home well after 10 p.m. After he had gone to bed without eating a bite of the dinner she prepared, she told us how cold and wet his pants and jacket were. They were almost frozen stiff. She was sure he was going to wake with a death of a cold. Although the stories she told of that particular day were comprehensive, with details about fences needing fixing, feeding the herds, and calving, what caught the attention of my son, and myself, was the tear in the corner of her eye that appeared when she explained how she had intended to fix his wet, worn and tattered work gloves once they had dried out. My son asked why he had not just bought another pair. She explained that his leather gloves were a personal testimony of his hard work and fortitude. The cracks and duct tape repairs reminded her of how dedicated a man he was and what a steward of the land he was. She shared with us that this was just one example of how she knew she had found a life partner who would raise their children with integrity and the appreciation of an honest and hard day’s work. Our “short” visit lasted over an hour. We heard stories of their life after leaving the ranch, moving to another state where, much to my bewilderment, he became a salesman. How this gruff, and often cantankerous man, excelled as a salesman made me laugh and realize how little I knew about him. Mr. S. is now in an assisted living home. My wife saw him last week, and she shared with me how saddened she was that he no longer remembered her. This man, who my wife and I have known for over 25 years, now has dementia. The stories of his life’s journeys now reside solely with his wife and children. I now wish I had taken him up on his one-time offer to fly with him on his little prop plane or to have dinner with him and his wife. He may now never know how much I respected him, his passion for the land, his work ethic and how he touched my life. Want the news to come to you? Get the top stories in your inbox every morning.

Senate Bill 106 is intended to attract condo developers to the state by reducing the number of lawsuits filed against them over construction defects. Developers have said they face abnormally high risk for lawsuits in Colorado, making their projects costly and difficult to insure. The bill would limit when homeowners are able to file lawsuits over defects they find in their home and create a “right to remedy” so owners can work with their developer or a third party to fix any issue instead of going to court. The bill would also make it more difficult for homeowners associations to file lawsuits by requiring them to get approval from at least two-thirds of the unit owners first. “There are a lot of reasons why we have challenges with affordability right now but this is one of them,” said Sen. Rachel Zenzinger, an Arvada Democrat and a lead sponsor of the bill. “Many things are out of our control. This is something we can change.” Reducing housing costs is a primary focus for state lawmakers at the Capitol again this year after a major bill supported by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis failed at the end of last session. Though Polis has hinted in the past that he’s supportive of reducing construction defect lawsuits, the bill isn’t wrapped into the package of other housing measures propelled by his administration.

Senate Bill 106 is intended to attract condo developers to the state by reducing the number of lawsuits filed against them over construction defects. Developers have said they face abnormally high risk for lawsuits in Colorado, making their projects costly and difficult to insure. The bill would limit when homeowners are able to file lawsuits over defects they find in their home and create a “right to remedy” so owners can work with their developer or a third party to fix any issue instead of going to court. The bill would also make it more difficult for homeowners associations to file lawsuits by requiring them to get approval from at least two-thirds of the unit owners first. “There are a lot of reasons why we have challenges with affordability right now but this is one of them,” said Sen. Rachel Zenzinger, an Arvada Democrat and a lead sponsor of the bill. “Many things are out of our control. This is something we can change.” Reducing housing costs is a primary focus for state lawmakers at the Capitol again this year after a major bill supported by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis failed at the end of last session. Though Polis has hinted in the past that he’s supportive of reducing construction defect lawsuits, the bill isn’t wrapped into the package of other housing measures propelled by his administration. In years past, similar bills on construction defects have faced significant battles and stoked furious tensions among lawmakers. The political future for this year’s bill remains uncertain. While it has early support from both Republicans and Democrats, some of the further left-leaning members are likely to mount a fierce opposition to the legislation. Opponents of the bill say it will take away rights from homeowners and give developers free rein to sell poorly constructed homes. “If they would build quality products and stand behind their products we wouldn’t be having all these problems,” said Jonathan Harris, chair of the group Build Our Homes Better, which opposes the bill. Harris is concerned that the requirement for HOAs to file lawsuits would be nearly impossible to accomplish because some owners live out of state or don’t keep up to date with information on their community.

They could, however, still sue if it wasn’t properly repaired. Condo construction, once on par and even more abundant than new apartment buildings along the Front Range, dropped significantly following the Great Recession. While other types of housing in the state have rebounded since then, new condos haven’t, according to data gathered by Zonda, a company that does quarterly housing surveys of the eight-county Denver metro area. Many of the condos that are built are luxury units, which often have high enough margins to still attract developers. The legislation would impact the entire state, including Colorado’s mountain towns, which face some of the highest housing costs. Other housing bills this session, such as one allowing more accessory-dwelling units to be built, exclude most mountain towns from the requirements.

Exactly what that impact would be is hard to tell.” For communities like Eagle County, simply creating more housing isn’t the solution because much of the existing units in the county are vacant for months or exclusively used for short-term rentals, Scherr said.

This year, George M. Johnson’s memoir, “All Boys Aren’t Blue,” was chosen to be highlighted amid its place in the national discussion regarding the boundaries of education, diversity and freedom of expression. In an interview, Johnson said, “I just thought I was writing a book and telling my story.” On Nov. 7, as part of MSU Denver’s 1 Book 1Book/1Project/2Transform program, Johnson delivered a keynote speech at Tivoli Turnhalle over his experience in having his story become politicized on a national scale. “After I wrote ‘All Boys Are Blue’, I fully came to the realization that books don’t stand still in time,” said Johnson during his presentation. “Instead, they ensure that what happened in the past is recorded for the future.” While the project began as a way for Johnson to document his life, political discourse has projected his writing to a national level. Rep. Lauren Boebert, as reported by Westword, claimed the book was pornographic, and she minimized the topics discussed in the book to “oral sex, ejaculation, anal sex, pornography, and masturbation.” While the book might not be for everybody, Johnson argues that its purpose is to be a resource for members of the queer community of all ages. “I get to see kids and young adults and full-size adults be empowered, be healed, be able to process their trauma through my storytelling and find ways and vehicles to heal themselves,” said Johnson during his presentation. When asked about the topic of book banning and his book becoming a target of critics who aim to remove it from schools, Johnson said, “If you take that resource away from the place that they can only access it, you are essentially banning a book. A lot of people will try to say, ‘Oh, but they can still buy the book. Oh, but they can still go elsewhere to get the book.’” Published in 2020, the memoir is an honest documentation of Johnson’s life growing up as a queer Black individual. They discuss topics of identity, race and sexuality in an exploration of the challenges endured by marginalized communities. “That is not true for many people,” they continue.“Many people do not have the disposable income to purchase the book. Many of them do not live in environments safe enough to bring those books home. Some of them can only access a book in a library where it is safe for them to access it. So, when you remove that title from a library, which is the only access point for the student or for anybody else, you have banned the book.” Your email address will not be published.

Cheesman, who noted that without the passage of 2B, the outdoor pool would have been forced to close by 2016, said the upgrades will not only extend the life of the park, but give the city a regional attraction. “We’ve kept up our facilities at the rec center and the boathouse obviously has been renovated. This is the last piece of the puzzle. It balances things out,” Cheesman said. “Louisville and Erie have similar sports fields, but none of our surrounding communities, other than Broomfield with Broomfield Bay, will have an outdoor aquatics facility like this.” Issue 2B’s slim margin of victory could be contributed at least partially to competition from three other tax issues on the city’s ballot. Lafayette voters on Tuesday also approved Issue 2A —- a mill levy increase of 2 mills to supplement the city’s ambulance service, fire and police department budgets. Currently, the public safety departments operate largely off Lafayette’s general fund. Funds from the 2A mill levy increase will go toward investments in new technology, but also to keep up with the growing demands on each department. The third issue to pass Tuesday was 2C— a 5 percent tax on the sale or transfer of unprocessed retail marijuana by a cultivation facility, and the sale of marijuana and marijuana products within the city — which cruised to approval with 73 percent of the vote. Estimates show the pot tax generating $240,000 in the first year. Issue 2D — which would have imposed an excise tax on business and residential energy consumption and established a menu of clean energy incentives and discounts — was the lone Lafayette issue to fail Tuesday after receiving only 45 percent approval. “It felt like all these issues were ripe to have on the ballot,” Mayor Christine Berg said. “But when there are four on the ballot, people probably weigh them all equally and say, ‘Which one impacts me the most?'” Despite the defeat of 2B, Berg said the clean energy movement in Lafayette still has traction. “I think that issue won’t go away. I don’t know about the next election cycle, but I think it will be something that people will be interested in bringing up again,” Berg said. “I thought it was a very progressive thing for Lafayette to do.” Doug Pike: 720-648-5022, piked@coloradohometownweekly.com Copyright © 2024 MediaNews Group""}]"

The Determination of Common Variety report (DCV) shows that the majority of limestone sales from RMI’s quarry and for its proposed mine expansion fail to qualify under the Mining Law of 1872. “The Citizens’ Alliance has contended for years that RMI has been mining limestone for purposes far afield from its permit for mining on federal land, which is based on a narrow list of uses allowed under the Mining Law of 1872,” the release states. “BLM has determined that a majority of the material is not disposable under the Mining Law of 1872 because of being marketed for common purposes,” BLM Field Manager Larry Sandoval said in a statement last Thursday. The DCV report states on page 47 that RMI’s expansion proposal “provided no evidence or data that substantiates that this [limestone] deposit has unique or special properties that set it apart from other deposits that are used for aggregate for the same purposes.” Citizens’ Alliance President Jeff Peterson said that the agency’s position marks a pivotal point in its review of current mining at the Transfer Trail quarry and of RMI’s massive proposed mine expansion, according to the release. “If RMI’s end uses for the mined limestone had qualified under the 1872 Mining Law, the company would have few regulatory limits on environmental and economic impacts, and would have no obligation to pay royalties on its sales,” the release states. The DCV disqualifies almost all end uses put forth by RMI, such as rock dust for coal mines, road base, rip-rap, structural boulders and chicken grit. Mining and sales of these non-qualifying uses would need to be approved under a BLM mineral sales contract, according to the release. According to the Citizens’ Alliance, a cover letter to the DCV calling on the company to tally the funds in an escrow account established in 2019 was addressed to RMI Vice President Robert Wagner and signed by BLM Field Manager Larry Sandoval. The letter gives RMI until Feb. 25 to remit to BLM the escrowed payments for all sales that don’t qualify under the Mining Law. In addition to offering justification against RMI’s claim that mining laws secure their right to expansion, the Citizens’ Alliance said the background offered in the DCV provides arguments against the mine altogether. The purpose for the quarry from its beginning in 1982, according to the DCV, was solely for rock dust, used to suppress methane eruptions in the underground coal mines near Redstone, according to the release. “With the DCV’s findings in hand, it appears that original mine approvals from 1982 are no longer valid,” Peterson said in the news release. “Mining should be halted unless RMI obtains a federal mineral sales contract and resolves its other permit noncompliance problems.” May 27, 2024 May 27, 2024 May 26, 2024 May 26, 2024 May 26, 2024 May 23, 2024 May 24, 2024 May 25, 2024 May 23, 2024 May 24, 2024 Readers around Glenwood Springs and Garfield County make the Post Independent’s work possible.

'version': '2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'News News | Feb 6, 2024 Reports of canine respiratory disease in Colorado have dropped from peak case numbers last year, according to Colorado State University veterinary experts. CSU researchers, however, are still investigating the potential origins of the fall spike. “The great news is that the number of cases being reported in Colorado has been dropping since our suspected peaks between August and December,” said Dr. Michael Lappin, an internal medicine specialist and director of the Center for Companion Animal Studies at CSU. “Why that trend is occurring is unknown but may be related to our pets spending less time in social situations that might include ill dogs during the winter months.” Last year’s wave of canine respiratory disease differed from previous versions. Dogs experienced prolonged coughs, up to several weeks, and more cases developed what appeared to be secondary pneumonia. In September, October and November, CSU’s Veterinary Teaching Hospital saw more than double the cases of canine pneumonia compared with the same period in 2022. Cases also spiked elsewhere, including Oregon, California, Florida and New Hampshire, as well parts of Canada. INVESTIGATING THE ORIGIN In Colorado, CSU experts have been working with partners across the state on multiple fronts to investigate the origin of last year’s elevated numbers, Lappin said. Those efforts have included examining whether any of the previous spikes were the result of one of the 10 viruses or bacteria already known to cause canine respiratory disease, if any of those pathogens have changed or if there are any new causes. “One of our first responses was to work with the state of Colorado to identify areas that seemingly had high numbers of cases to provide free diagnostic testing,” Lappin said. CSU researchers in the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and the Center for Companion Animal Studies partnered with clinics in Fort Collins, Denver, Colorado Springs and Grand Junction to test samples. This work will continue throughout February, and CSU will release results when that activity is completed. Separately, Dr. Blaire MacNeill, a clinical microbiology resident at CSU, led a medical records review of 87 cases of suspected infectious respiratory disease from the Veterinary Teaching Hospital between Sept. 1 and Jan. 18. The majority of cases entered the hospital through the urgent care department. That review, however, revealed no obvious patterns of organisms previously recognized to cause infectious respiratory disease. Four of the cases were fatal, one of which involved a dog that had another pre-existing condition. Pet owners, Lappin said, should continue to follow previously released guidelines, which include keeping dogs up to date on vaccinations and watching them closely if they develop a cough. Exercise caution regarding nose-to-nose contact with unfamiliar dogs, as their medical history and exposure risks may be unknown, and when choosing pet care services, ensure transparency by inquiring about protocols for isolating sick dogs and rigorous cleaning practices. This commitment to best practices underscores the facility’s dedication to pet health and safety. For more information, pet owners can view a live webinar on this topic on Feb. 13 at noon. Dr. Lappin will participate in a panel discussion on the current state of canine respiratory illness hosted by Trupanion, a company that provides pet insurance for dogs and cats. Statewide testing was funded in part by Zoetis Animal Health.

High Country News A nonprofit independent magazine of unblinking journalism that shines a light on all of the complexities of the West. START SPREADING THE NEWSFor environmentalists eager to get their message across but not sure where to start, a couple of grassroots communication guides have hit the bookstores. Getting the Word Out in the Fight to Save the Earth, by Richard Beamish, tells how to publicize and promote an environmental cause. Beamish, who has plenty of experience with both large organizations and small community groups, provides examples of newsletters, press releases, brochures, and other promotional materials from across the country. An entire chapter explains how to sustain an effort through fund raising. The book is for “nonprofit groups already out there in the trenches and for those who are preparing themselves – in the communities, board rooms, churches, schools, colleges, and universities across this land – for this most crucial struggle of our time.” Jason Salzman’s new book, Let the World Know: Make Your Cause News, focuses on attention-getting gimmicks to attract media coverage and offers practical tips for working with journalists. Among the characteristics of a newsworthy event, writes Salzman, are novelty, simplicity, shock and humor.Getting the Word Out in the Fight to Save the Earth.

Many of these “beds” are in condominium units, apartments owned by individuals which are rented most of the year to transients. Condominiums are often long-distance real estate investments. For instance, the largest percentage (21.2) of condominium owners are residents of Illinois. Some 17.9% are Coloradans, nearly all of whom reside outside of Snowmass, and 11.2% live in California. On the average, these owners spend only one month a year at Snowmass. This normally is divided into two weeks in the winter and two in the summer. In other words, the condominiums are not really “second homes.” They are more vacation dwellings, which a majority of the owners rent more than use. When Snowmass was born two years ago, it had 199 condominium units in two projects. Average price then was a low $17,000. Today, Snowmass has eight condominium projects containing 404 units, 99% of which have fireplaces and which sell on the average for $41,000. Some go as high as $80,000 unfurnished. Snowmass at present has only about 100 residents. Most live in houses rather than condominiums. Aspen Historical Society actively preserves and passionately presents local history in an inspired and provocative manner that will continue to anchor the local community and its evolving character.

I thought it had gone missing years ago.I told her I didn’t want it and said that we needed to get rid of it.She says I should take it to a pawn shop.I have two great sons out of my first marriage, but other than that, the ring represents 10 years of acrimony and chaos.I’m a non-practicing Catholic, but symbolism is still important to me, so I cannot see putting the ring back into circulation.I wanted to hire a Hobbit to schlep the ring across Mordor and toss it into the Lake of Fire. My wife says we cannot afford a Hobbit and so I need to come up with another plan.What is the best way to take care of this?– SuperstitiousDear Superstitious:I love the idea of a Hobbit-for-hire, who could take all of the material things which bring on feelings of shame or sadness and cart them off to the Lake of Fire. (Or to Frodo’s Pawn Shoppe at the Shire strip mall.)(And while I am probably short enough to apply for the Hobbit job, I identify more in the Elfen category.)You and your wife might think of a deeply symbolic act that would transform this ring into something else – perhaps by melting it down and having a charm made. But that’s expensive and time-consuming.I like the idea of throwing your ring into the creek. Give it a mighty fling. I did that once, and it certainly worked for me.Related Articles Advice | Ask Amy: Enthusiasm is curbed for wedding gifts Advice | Ask Amy: Husband tries to broker an uneasy truce Advice | Ask Amy: Volunteer feels cornered by unwanted friend Advice | Ask Amy: Revenge plot may end with a bloody stump Advice | Ask Amy: A reader offers a delightful ‘update’ Dear Amy:“In a Bad Place” said her husband is angry and isolated.She should take him to get a medical evaluation.

And he smokes pot morning, noon, and night. He knows it disturbs me (I don’t like the smell and I really don’t like his altered state), so he has found ways to do it that I do not smell, and also “sneaks” it in pretending he is doing something else like walking the dog. He is a loving partner, a good dad, and he lies to me about smoking pot. He says it is my fault that he sneaks. I try to ignore it, but it is hard when he rolls out of bed to get high. What do you suggest? – Disgusted Dear Disgusted: You must admit that if you didn’t object to your husband’s pot use, he probably wouldn’t sneak it.

The Red Hat Society is a worldwide membership group that encourages women in their quest to get the most out of life. Former IT Tech and current Red Hat Queen Kathy Guerrie believes wholeheartedly in this credo. “I remember the very first time I ever dressed in red and purple and went out with our group,” she said. “We all met at Starbucks that morning and I was the first one to get there. I was embarrassed to even get out of the car until somebody else showed up with red and purple on. Since then, it doesn’t bother me one bit!” There’s a story behind those colors. It starts with British poet and children’s author Jenny Joseph, who penned the poem, “Warning” in 1961. It served as the inspiration for the Red Hat Society, as it begins: “When I am an old woman, I shall wear purple, with a red hat that doesn’t go.” The poem warns the reader that if they expect an “old” woman to act a certain way, they’d better revisit those expectations! “Everybody is so attracted to what we’re doing and the fact that we’re having fun and laughing and giggling,” Guerrie said, “We can be outside of a restaurant on Main Street, and even the young teenagers will be sitting there watching us like, what in the world are these old ladies doing? A couple of us have just gone up and put our arms around the girls’ shoulders and said, ‘You can do this too! You can be a pink hatter and join in all this fun!’” “Red hatters,” as they’re called, are 50 years and older, but younger women who join are called “pink hatters” as their colors are pink and lavender. The rules for belonging to the group? “They have to dress in red hat colors every time they come to an event,” Guerrie explained, “but other than that, there are no rules!” PAINTING THE TOWN Guerrie and fellow Red Hat Queen Leslie Kiesler encourage all ladies on the Western Slope to attend the Red Hat Convention in May 2024. “You know how you felt when you went to your prom?” Kiesler asked. “How you were all dressed up and just felt really beautiful?” That’s what you can expect at the convention. This ladies-only event will take place at Two Rivers Convention Center May 16-19. Attendees will enjoy a jewelry-making class, a vendor area for shopping, dress-up opportunities, gourmet evening meals with entertainment and more. Best of all, it’s a chance to have fun and establish lasting friendships. “You have a group of sisters like none other,” Kiesler said. Outside of the convention, the three Red Hat chapters that are currently active in the Grand Junction area (there’s also a small group in Paonia) meet regularly for fun and to support the community.

This month finds Ol’ Dutch and Miss Trixie still in Texas building on the house, going to grandkids’ ball games, selling cattle and yes, you guessed it, seeing the total eclipse of the Sun. by KEVIN KIRKPATRICK Updated: 1 month ago It appears that Spring has sprung at least in Texas where Miss Trixie and Ol’ Dutch have taken to spending their winters of late. You always can tell when it's close as the Big Box Stores load up on flowers and vegetables by the pallet load. It must be lucrative as the dickens as those same box doors often catch a late frost which kills every plant they have in stock. Regardless of the risks, the stores all rush and hurry to be the first with tomato and pepper plants on the shelves. by KEVIN KIRKPATRICK Updated: 2 months ago Anyone that has ever been involved with sports has had a coach yell “get the lead out” usually paired with an anatomical part of your body that is synonymous with your neighbor’s donkey. That phrase has been used “since Hector was a pup” and generally means to get moving faster. by BETSY MARSTON Updated: 2 months ago Having grown up around a lot of older people, I got to experience life from their perspectives, some of which pre-dated 1900. My grandfather Kirk was born in 1889 in Dodge City, Kan., and so was probably about 65 by the time I was born, which was quite old in those days when people just did not live too long. by KEVIN KIRKPATRICK Updated: 2 months ago It was 2 p.m. on a recent Sunday in the western Colorado town of Paonia, population 1,500, not an ideal time to gather a crowd to meet the famous Rosa Parks, the woman who kicked off the modern civil rights movement. by BETSY MARSTON Updated: 2 months ago Living near a metroplex during the winter brings about all sorts of challenges not found during my summer sojourn in Colorado’s smalltown living. Some of these are to be expected like masses of people, traffic jams, increased crime activity and other things found when you have large numbers of people living closely together. I do believe that the higher crime rate we find here is probably just due to more people jammed into a smaller space as it seems to be increasing wherever we go these days. by KEVIN KIRKPATRICK Updated: 3 months ago It has long been thought that a lot of what goes on in the world is manipulated by those in charge. They are thought to use a technique called smoke and mirrors to draw attention away from what is really going on behind the scenes and keep us focused on something really unrelated and often mundane. by KEVIN KIRKPATRICK Updated: 3 months ago It looks like the weather is on a rampage once again across the U.S.A. as the week opens up with rains on the West Coast setting records for amounts received plus snow in the Northeast piling up like leftovers at the church pot-luck dinner which, even though good at the time, begin to smell if allowed to accumulate for too long. by KEVIN KIRKPATRICK Updated: 3 months ago For those of you that follow along on the “great adventure” also known as cohabiting with Ol’ Dutch, you know we have had some experience with “the great tribulation”. Which is also related to living without heat and hot water. by KEVIN KIRKPATRICK Updated: 3 months ago This past week has definitely been a trial of my faith and all things holy. by KEVIN KIRKPATRICK Updated: 4 months ago This week has dawned frigid with a biting wind and those conditions usually drive even Ol’ Dutch inside for a while. And this time was no different as an Arctic blast of super cold air has seen fit to invade the heartland of America bringing a lot of snow and ice and wind. by KEVIN KIRKPATRICK Updated: 4 months ago The New Year dawned on Miss Trixie and me in Texas with its usual fanfare for us to be healthy and safe. by KEVIN KIRKPATRICK Updated: 4 months ago You don’t have to watch much television before you come across the advertisements for emergency devices for the elderly in case they fall. We have all seen those ads and generally feature an old lady falling down her basement stairs trying to get to her washing machine. by Kevin Kirkpatrick Updated: 5 months ago Just this past weekend Ol’ Dutch decided to make the long journey up to Kansas and some of my past digs to see family. by Kevin Kirkpatrick Updated: 6 months ago According to Google, the phrase “cash is king” originated after the stock market crash of 1987. Just goes to show you that Google doesn’t know everything because Ol’ Dutch knew long ago that anyone with cash in any situation has a distinct advantage over others who do not. by Kevin Kirkpatrick Updated: 6 months ago The phrase “seeing the elephant” is a distinct piece of American verbiage that dates to the 1830’s and describes gaining knowledge from a particular experience. It was like going to town to see an elephant which had long been heard of but never seen to that point in a person’s life. by Updated: 6 months ago Many of you probably remember the movie “The Great Escape” produced back in 1963 and had a star-studded cast like no other films before or since. Steve McQueen was the main protagonist in the movie and his motorcycle stunts are still talked about today. by Kevin Kirkpatrick Updated: 7 months ago For those of you who follow Ol’ Dutch and Miss Trixie on their weekly adventures, you know there is never a dull moment. And just like the character Roseanne Roseannadanna, who was played by the great Gilda Radner, used to say, “it's always something.” by Kevin Kirkpatrick Updated: 7 months ago It appears that another summer season has come to a close for Ol’ Dutch and Miss Trixie, and what a season it was indeed. It started out like a Kansas tornado and never stopped until just this last Saturday with the end of elk and bear season. No matter the long-winded promises by Miss Trixie all last winter about “taking time for ourselves” and “not overpromising to others,” she hit the ground running and, even short of breath due to the altitude, we soon were immersed in everything Colorado and more. by Kevin Kirkpatrick Updated: 7 months ago Now, most of you don't know that my Miss Trixie was friends with Lady Bird Johnson, former First Lady of these great United States and the widow of our 36th President Lyndon Baines Johnson. Miss Trixie knew Mrs. Johnson long after LBJ died, of course, but she still heard stories from Mrs. Johnson and other alums from the Johnson administration. by Kevin Kirkpatrick Updated: 8 months ago I think most of you can relate to the use — and probably overuse — of Facebook by most people. As soon as you log in, Facebook asks “What’s on your mind” as a daily reminder to post any and everything that crosses the old noggin. And the main problem is people will tell you. by Updated: 8 months ago I realize you have to be a tad older to recall the phrase “I know nothing …NOTHING!” made popular on a sitcom called “Hogan’s Heroes.” “Hogan’s Heroes” was a weekly show about some Allied prisoners of war in a German camp whereby the prisoners got by with all kinds of sabotage and mischief right under their captors' noses.

at Geneva Basin Ski Area (Left). The lift at Geneva Basin carted skiers up the mountain on a double chair (Right). (Photo courtesy of the Jan. 5, 1967, edition of The Flume) Colorado is a mecca for skiers, attracting thousands to the state’s busy slopes each winter. Areas like Vail, Aspen and Telluride are congruous with all-inclusive vacation destinations, and world-champion skiers train and compete on the steep peaks of the Front Range. While the burgeoning business of today’s ski resorts continues to grow and provide the beloved winter activity to the masses, only about 30 ski mountains are still in operation from the over 175 ski areas Colorado has hosted since the mid-1800s. Somewhere between 130 and 140 ski slopes scattered across the mountainous region no longer exist. “The story beneath the story of Colorado skiing, is all about how the ski culture came to Colorado,” said Caryn Boddie. On a tour-de-France of Colorado’s illustrious ski history with her husband Peter Boddie, the Littleton-based authors took a deep dive into the state’s lost ski mountains. Publishing nearly a decade’s worth of historical tidbits and anecdotes, their two books “Lost Ski Areas of Colorado’s Front Range and Northern Mountains” and “Lost Ski Areas of Colorado’s Central and Southern Mountains” hit the shelves in 2015. The couple also regularly updates their fascination with ski history on the Lost Ski Areas of Colorado blog. Caryn Boddie said when it comes to Colorado ski history, the famed 10th Mountain Division is typically top of mind. The elite military division trained in Colorado’s high alpine slopes during WWII and later fought overseas in the rough terrain of the Italian mountains. After the war, many returned to the small ski hills where they had trained, creating the big-name resorts we know today. However, the backbone of Colorado’s ski industry was built by immigrants from Norway, Canada and the Italian Alps who first brought ski culture to the Front Range. “It was the blue-collar workers, building roads and railroads, the guys who cut lumber and miners,” said Caryn Boddie. “They were hard-working people who wanted to have a little fun, so they created ski hills, mostly for their kids.” Many of Colorado’s first ski hills were created by ranchers, who would set up homemade rope tows on their properties using tractor wheels. Growing up in Loveland and skiing the I-70 corridor (including some of the first slides at Vail when they opened in 1962), Caryn Boddie said she didn’t know there was another story about Colorado skiing. “It was so simple and so community-based, much different from the big alpine areas of today,” said Caryn Boddie. Throughout Park County, the humble relics of Colorado’s ski history that were built to spread the joy of winter in the mountains remain to this day. Hoosier Pass Ski Area From the mid-1930s to 1949 Park County residents could take Highway 9 north towards Breckenridge to slide down the slopes of Hoosier Pass Ski Area, just outside of Blue River. Initiated by the South Park Lions Club, the mountain first opened with only one warming hut. A full-service restaurant was added the following season, featuring a bar, dancing area, restrooms and other amenities making the mountain a popular and festive destination for visitors from Colorado Springs and Denver. Cabins and a general store popped up soon after, allowing skiers to enjoy the small ski area in comfort. The mountain had one 800-foot-long rope tow that deposited its riders at the peak of the area’s two trails. Surrounded by the beauty of the Rocky Mountains famed 14ers, skiers enjoyed the slope at Hoosier Pass until the late 40s when the rope tow broke, and the facility shut down. The rope tow was eventually transferred to the Mercury Hill Ski Area which opened in the early 1950’s. Mercury Hill Ski Area At the north end of Alma, there’s a slope now full of aspen trees. It used to be a popular destination for locals with one rope tow bringing skiers up two runs, one at the length of 600 feet and the other at 800. “I skied it in the moonlight one time back in 1978,” said Peter Boddie. “I skied down about halfway to the bottom and there was a post with a pulley on it so you could see where they had the rope tow.” In their search for historical ski anecdotes, the Boddie’s spoke with Erik Swanson, a fifth-generation Alma native and owner of the Fairplay Antique and Art Gallery, who remembered skiing on the hill as a kid. “The rope tow was more fun riding up,” recalled Swanson in the Boddie’s book. “They had some sort of old car motor that would pull it up. You’d grab the rope in the front and the back. If we were little and didn’t weigh much and there was a dip, we’d go flying. I remember one Sunday for some reason I got clear of the top. I was looking down and I didn’t know what to do. I was scared to death, and I didn’t know how to stop. I think I was one of the only kids my age that went from the very top to the very bottom.” With the more popular draw of some bigger surrounding mountains, the area likely shut down as there just wasn’t enough interest in sustaining it. Indian Mountain Ski Area Now hosting a subdivision with vacation homes as well as a disc golf course, Indian Mountain Ski Area was once a bustling ski hill from 1972 to 1988 with an operating poma lift. The mountain had high hopes for dragging skiers from South Park, Colorado Springs and Denver but Peter explained Indian Mountain was hit with a major challenge that has made establishing ski mountains in Park County nearly impossible. “It’s what I call horizontal snow,” said Peter Boddie. “It’s windy and the hills on the east edge of South Park just don’t get very dependable snow.” Working against the harsh weather conditions of South Park, ski mountains along the I-70 corridor had more appeals for skiers searching for bigger mountains and better snow ultimately leading Indian Mountain to shutter its operations. Geneva Basin Ski Area Geneva Basin was located cozily in the middle of Clear Creek and Park County, south of Guanella Pass. Settled within the pines and firs of Pike National Forest, the ski area was at 11,750 feet and operated under a permit from the United States Forest Service. Caryn Boddie said during the construction of the ski mountain along Guanella Pass Road, the thruway’s namesake lost the oldest Guanella son in a fatal construction accident. “It was tragic, and it hit the town hard,” said Caryn Boddie. “But they got back up and finished construction of the hill.” The mountain was originally opened in 1961 as Indianhead Ski Area of Colorado by Jack English, owner of Indianhead Mountain Resort in Michigan. The slopes offered two rope tows repurposed from the defunct Magic Mountain in Golden, a Heron double chair and a Constam J-bar. The ski area eventually went into foreclosure and the property was bought by the then Colorado Senator and later Governor Roy Romer in partnership with the Walter J. Burke family, who rebrand- ed the mountain as Geneva Basin. After moving from various owners in subsequent years, the mountain was ultimately closed in 1984. Many development corporations attempted to reopen the facilities, but nothing panned out. In November 1993, Park County residents went to the polls for a recreation tax that would finance the ski area’s reopening, but it was soundly voted down. The abandoned facilities at the mountain had become a repeated target of vandalism and to avoid associated liability, the Forest Service burned down the ski lodge in 1993. Park County officials received an apology letter from Forest Service employees a few weeks later for not fully informing citizens of the intended demolition method. While the mountain is currently inoperable, the ski patrol building at the top of Duck Creek lift remains and is used by backcountry skiers who come to the mountain to take advantage of the now abandoned trails.

Independent Weekly Line on Durango and Beyond Energy guru Amory Lovins harvests solar bananas in his indoor garden in his home near Aspen, all without a heating system./ Photo Courtesy Judy Hill Lovins The experts tell us an energy gap looms. Fossil fuels are phasing out, and solar and wind power can’t produce enough electricity to meet the demand in coming decades. But that’s not the thinking of Amory Lovins, 76-year-old co-founder of RMI, formerly the Rocky Mountain Institute, in western Colorado. A Harvard and Oxford dropout who’s been called the “Einstein of Energy Efficiency,” Lovins said recently: “If we do the right things, we’ll look back and ask each other, ‘What was all the fuss about?’” Lovins became famous in the 1970s after his research told him that building more polluting coal-fired power plants was a destructive mistake. His solution then was greater efficiency and reliance on renewables, and they, he insists, are still the answer. “Though it’s invisible, efficiency will cut 50% of energy use and up to 80% if we do the right things,” he told me recently. “Most of the energy we use is wasted, which makes it much cheaper to save it, rather than buy it or burn it.” According to a recent Princeton paper, he’s right: 84% of all energy consumed goes to waste during delivery or by leakage. To prove it decades ago, he built a passive solar, super-insulated house in Old Snowmass, Colo. It never had a heating system, though winters sometimes recorded temperatures 40 degrees below zero. When I arrived there recently at 8 a.m., it was 12 degrees F. Yet the house featured banana and papaya trees growing in natural light around a koi pond. We became acquainted when he read my January 2023 “Writers on the Range” column entitled; “The energy gap nobody wants to tussle with.” I’d advocated building small modular nuclear reactors to bolster the grid when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine. Lovins called to set me straight, and after a second conversation and more research, I’m beginning to think he’s right. Though Lovins has many solutions for the energy gap, he touts three major ways to find more energy in what we already do. Top on the list is changing how we build and retrofit existing structures because buildings consume 75% of the electricity we buy. Most energy jobs in the United States are already increasing efficiency, ranging from upgrading windows and other retrofits, far outpacing the shrinking fossil fuels industry (energy.gov). As one example, Lovins advocates “outsulation” for older structures, defined as adding exterior insulating panels to save heat. Courtesy of the European Union, my Irish in-laws recently had their house “wrapped” and saw their heating bills plummet. His second way is demand-response, which Lovins calls flexiwatts. An example is cycling air conditioners off for 15-30 minutes at a time, a barely noticeable adjustment that cuts demand for peak-power plants, those big emitters of greenhouse gases. His third way is using renewables more effectively. Diversifying renewables by location and type within a region evens gaps from windless and cloudy weather. As for electric cars being a drain on the grid, they will prove to be sources of electricity, he said, as the next generation batteries will be cheaper and likely have double the storage. Daytime solar stored in vehicles will be bi-directional, spooling out power during peak evening demand. Lovins also cites LED lights dramatically cutting the cost of energy. In just a decade, they’ve become 30 times more efficient, 20 times brighter and 10 times cheaper. Lovins is quick to admit that an energy gap remains, but he predicts a single-digit gap of 6% between what renewables produce and what’s needed. That, he said, can be made up by stored, green hydrogen or ammonia, manufactured from water and air with solar energy and burned in existing gas plants. As for nuclear power plants, Lovins said even the best-case scenarios for the next generation of nuclear generators are at least a decade away, and at least eight times more costly than renewables today. “It’s better to use fast, cheap and certain rather than slow, costly and speculative,” he said. Though cutting loose from fossil fuels is a massive undertaking, Lovins said America is on track. “We are on or ahead of schedule on renewables, with 85% of net new additions to the grid from renewables, and $1 billion invested in solar in the United States daily.” For these reasons and more, Lovins sees our energy future as more of what we’re already doing – only smarter and faster. Let’s hope he’s right. ? Dave Marston is the publisher of Writers on the Range, writersontherange.org, an independent nonprofit that exists to spur lively dialog about the West. He lives in Durango.
