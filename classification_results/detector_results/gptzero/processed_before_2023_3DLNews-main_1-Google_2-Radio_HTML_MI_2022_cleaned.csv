Veteran oil analyst Andy Lipow told CNN he expects the national average to hit $5.05 a gallon in the next 10 days. Oil, the biggest component of gasoline prices, continues to get more expensive — even after OPEC+ announced plans late last week to ramp up production. Gas prices have been driven to record highs by a range of factors, including strong demand for energy as people drive and fly more. Supply, on the other hand, has failed to keep up. The United States is pumping less oil than before Covid-19 began, and the market is signaling OPEC+\'s increase is too little, too late. US crude jumped to a fresh three-month high of $120.99 a barrel Monday morning. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\'s Analytics, told CNN in a phone interview that he is feeling more optimistic about the ability of the US economy to get inflation under control without causing a downturn.

Jack was the News Director at TV-13 for many years. He hired all of the on-air talent you saw on TV-13 back then. Jack Hogan passed away last Thursday, August 4th in Clermont, Florida, at the age of 89. Along with being the News Director, Jack was the news anchor and co-host for the long-time ""Eyewitness at Noon"" along with Dick Richards. (That\'s Jack on the right in the picture below.) Jack was responsible for hiring the first meteorologist in the West Michigan area when he brought Craig James to TV-13 in 1973. A year later, Jack hired Bill Steffen to work alongside Craig. On Bill\'s Blog on the WOOD TV-8 website, Bill tells the story on how he was hired back in November of 1974 for $175 a week. Bill goes on to say that there were many candidates for that job, but Jack noted that Bill was an Eagle Scout. Jack was a Scoutmaster himself and admired those who were able to reach the rank of an Eagle Scout. Bill goes on to say that Jack Hogan knew just about everyone. When Jack retired, he was hired as an assistant manager for the City of Grand Rapids. He later worked as a greeter at Meijer -- just to keep in touch with people. For references on his job application, Jack gave the names Fred Meijer and President Gerald R. Ford. I\'d say those were some pretty strong references! Later in his life, Jack moved to Clermont, Florida where he was elected as a city councilman. Jack\'s obituary is very short. On the legacy.com website It just reads... John \'Jack\' Lawrence Hogan, 89 of Clermont, Florida, passed away on August 4, 2022. Jack is survived by his loving family. He will truly be missed. To send flowers to the family or plant a tree in memory of John "" Jack "", please visit our floral store. Here is the link to that obituary. A tribute on the 13 On Your Side website adds: Jack is survived by his beloved wife, Jackie, his son, Scott, his daughter, Kristin and several grandchildren. He is fondly remembered by his colleagues for his sound news judgement, his engaging personality and his ability to attract, develop and retain great talent. Even today, there are legions of journalists and former journalists all across the country who can proudly say, \'Jack Hogan gave me my start.\' Here is a video of the WZZM TV-13 Hot Air Balloon being inflated at some events back in 1985.

He says the kids are really into music, with his youngest taking a shine to Miranda Lambert and Alan Jackson (play ""Chattahoochee and watch him dance all day""). Houser will turn 47 years old in December, which will make him 65 when his new arrival graduates from high school. The age gap between him and the other parents is something he\'s acutely aware of. ""I\'m gonna be the geriatric dad, and you are, too!"" he tells Paul. ""The thing is, it keeps us young. You run around and chase a kid it will keep you out of the chair some."" The conversation about kids began with a question about the sex of the new baby. Houser gave an unencumbered \'no\' when asked if he\'d like to reveal on this platform. It sounds like his days sharing baby secrets are behind him, for the good of his marriage. ""Note to Self"" is Houser\'s first single from an album of the same name, expected on Nov. 11. “This album came together at a time when I was reflecting on who I am and what’s important to me, envisioning the kind of future I’d like to see for myself and my family,” he says of his sixth studio project. His last album, Magnolia, was released in 2019.'}]"

So how did Michigan cities do when it came to rat problems? Flint, Grand Rapids, and Detroit all made the list with the \'D\' making the infamous Top Ten. The Michigan rankings looked like this; ""Detroit spends up to $300,000 a year on rat-elimination efforts, including handing out free poison traps to residents"", according to CBS News. ""Grand Rapids apparently has made progress on the rat front: It dropped three spots, from No. 29, in the latest Orkin rankings"", CBS reported.

In her telling, she never quit the project — as has been rumored in some circles in recent days. Instead, she writes, “I was open to considering anything asked of me. It was my understanding there was nothing I could do to move anything forward at this time. DC is obviously buried in changes they are having to make, so I understand these decisions are difficult right now.” There, Jenkins is referring to the fact that DC Studios is now under the leadership of James Gunn and Peter Safran, who have begun instituting changes to the company’s upcoming releases — such as the apparent cancellation of Wonder Woman 3. “I do not want what has been a beautiful journey with WW to land on [a] negative note,” Jenkins added. “I have loved and been so honored to be the person who got to make these last two Wonder Woman films.” In better news for Jenkins fans, her letter also reveals that the project she initially dropped to focus on Wonder Woman 3, the Star Wars fighter pilot film Rogue Squadron, may actually be alive again. She says Lucasfilm “asked me to consider coming back to RS after WW3, which I was honored to do, so I agreed. They made a new deal with me.” She says she can’t say for certain if the movie will happen, but clearly the project is not as dead as it seemed in recent months. As for Wonder Woman 3, well, that might really be dead — at least with Jenkins at the helm. Her letter conclude with a thank you to fans, ruging them to “keep up the Wonder Woman spirit. Any day that you face struggles, try asking: What would Wonder Woman do? I hope her beacon of love, truth and justice is always there to lead the way for you, as she has done for me.”'}]"
