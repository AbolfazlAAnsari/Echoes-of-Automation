exaggeration to say that the Sig Sauer P210 is the most sought after 9mm target pistol in existence. It started its life, humbly enough, as the sidearm for the Swiss Army and police in 1949. Not exactly a Hollywood sendoff, but the Swiss are not generally flashy types. They are however, precision engineers who know a thing or two about metallurgy and design. (Ever heard of Swiss watches?) This gun is so well engineered that to this day, it’s still considered the gold standard for accuracy and reliability in 9mm. It’s capable of getting two inch groups at 50 yards, which is no mean feat for any handgun, much less a 9mm semi-auto. I was first introduced to the P210 a few years ago when I spent an afternoon shooting a Swiss-made model at Kokohead Range. I was immediately smitten by its balance and trigger. The older models are not easy to find and you’ll spend a minimum of $3000 for the privilege of owning one. The good news is that the P210 is now being manufactured in this country with prices starting at around $1600. (More on that later). History Development for the gun began before the Second World War with the idea of replacing the venerable Luger Parabellum 06/29, which had been in service since 1900. It was originally licensed from French-Swiss designer Charles Gabriel Petter’s Modèle 1935 pistol. Fans of plastic guns will definitely find this gun alte Schule–old school. You won’t find any tritium or fiber optics on the P210, just a post and notch. The magazine catch on the original model is at the heel of the frame—which is where they put them in the good old days. It’s a single-action pistol, with a magazine capacity of eight rounds of 9 mm, 7.65 mm, or .22 LR. (The new Target model has a capacity of 10 rounds). The slide and frame are machined from blocks of steel, which makes it heavy side but durable and of course, more expensive to produce than the modern “wonder nines”. One of the P210’s unusual features is that the slide is seated inside the frame rails rather than on the outside as is generally found on pistols derived from John Browning’s design. American Incarnation of the P210 Understanding the demand for this item, management at Sig Sauer decided in 2010 to produce a new version manufactured in Eckernförde, Germany instead of the SIG plant in Neuhausen am Rheinfall, Switzerland, where the gun was traditionally made. However, Swiss and German made goods tend to be quite expensive in this country. In January, 2016 SIG Sauer announced they would move production of the P210 to their Exeter, NH, factory. This is not one of these deals where the firearm is assembled from parts made overseas. All the parts, with the exception of the grips, will be made in the USA. (The German factory will continue to product P210s for the European market). The P210 Target model is one of two versions released in this country. The other is the P210 Standard which has different grips and sights. The company also plans to release a US-made Super Target, a 4″ Carry version and the Standard (5″ barrel with fixed sights) models all in 2018. Although the latest incarnation of the P210 resembles its Swiss Army predecessor, the manufacturer made a few visible tweaks. Instead of the old fashioned magazine catch, the new version uses a button-style, frame magazine catch. There’s also an elongated ‘beavertail’ much like those found on 1911 and SIG Sauer Elite pistols. There’s also a modern looking slide catch and 1911-esque safety. Tim Butler, Sig Sauer’s product manager, told me that while the U.S.-made models will share the same DNA as the European models, there are differences. In the “same DNA department”, all U.S. models will use the controls designed after the German version of the Super Target pistol. Butler said the U.S. and German version differ with barrel lock up. The Swiss and German P210s use a traditional, multiplelug barrel design (as in the 1911 Browning Hi-Power). The U.S. barrel locks up in the ejection port the same as SIG Classic pistol, the P220, P225j, P226, etc. The reason for the design change was because of a manufacturing process. In order to manufacture the 1911 lockup in a six inch slide you enter from the front with a very long tool to cut the lugs. The distance causes deflection with the cutting tool and could cause potential dimensional inaccuracy. Thus changing to the lock-up improved the manufacturer’s ability to hold the tight tolerances needed without extensive barrel fitting. One thing you notice straight away after field stripping the gun is how incredibly precise the slide to frame fit is. Just moving the slide along the rails you note there’s hardly any lateral movement. The tolerances are very tight yet the slide glides effortlessly. Same with the barrel to slide fit. Very little wiggle. There is no way you can achieve the same kind of fit on a 1911 with out the efforts of a gunsmith. It amazes me that that Sig Sauer can do this is on a production gun and keep the costs reasonable. The hammer box was also modified for the U.S. iteration. The hammer box is where the hammer and sear are housed alone with supporting parts for the function. Butler said that for the the U.S. version “we added adjustability that is set at the factory and non-user adjustable. This was done to eliminate hand fitting of components.” The Target version, which I tested, has a 5″ barrel, adjustable rear sight, magazine with a metal base plate and a target-style grip with a palm swell that is ergonimically correct. MSRP is $1600 for the 5″ barrel and $1800 for the 6″ model. Street price is in the $1500 range. (The European versions are $2100 and $3200 respectively). (The “Super Target” will have additional modifications including a 6 inch barrel, a 1911-style thumb safety and wood grips with integral magwell funneling). Shooting the Sig P210 So why is this pistol, which began its life in the midst of the Second World War, so accurate and well balanced? (We know it wasn’t built with space age materials nor designed with Cad/Cam). There are a couple of reasons but the first that jumps out at me is the very low bore axis which helps make it intrinsically easier to aim. A short explanation. “Bore axis” refers to the relationship between the barrel of the handgun and the shooter’s hand. Thus a “high” bore axis means that the barrel is positioned high above the top of the hand and “low” bore axis means, that it’s closer. So what’s the advantage? First off is recoil management. The closer the slide is to your closed grip, the more energy you’re going to absorb and hence, and the less muzzle flip you’ll have. Thus low bore axis means less movement and easier target recovery. If you’re shooting hot 9mm loads, exaggerated muzzle flip is especially noticeable. Therefore, the lower the bore axis the less perceived recoil and the less snap-back. In the case of the Sig P210 what also helps steady the gun even more is its old fashioned steel construction. The added mass makes it even less prone to flip than a plastic gun. The other benefit to low bore axis with this gun, is superb balance. It doesn’t feel “top-heavy”. Aiming the gun feels quite natural. If you combine the low bore axis, “pointability”, a truly great trigger and some shooting chops, the equation equals great accuracy. I was able to pick up the P210 and begin shooting really good groups fairly soon. The key of course, was squeezing the trigger just so. There’s a bit of takeup follow by a crisp, dependable break at 3.5 lbs. Feeding the Sig P210 Of course, you’re not going to shoot good groups without the right ammo. Since the P210 is one of the most accurate production handguns in the world, I though I would do it justice by testing both factory and hand loads. The 124 gr. factory rounds came from Sig Sauer, which several years ago branched into the ammo business to complement their “hardware”. We tested two varieties–of 124 gr. ammo: their full metal jacket, Elite Ball and their jacketed hollow point, V-Crown cartridges. The applications? Elite Ball is more for practice. The V-Crown is listed as defensive ammo but it’s extremely accurate and makes a great target round. I’ve used it up to 100 yards, consistently whacking an 8 inch gong with my red-dot mounted 9mm 1911. Admittedly, it’s harder to do with the Sig P210 which of course only comes with iron sights. The Elite Ball ammo is less expensive and also quite accurate, but not in the same league the hollow-point.

But the video — an interview between Project Veritas founder James O’Keefe and a self-identified Pfizer employee who claims to show internal emails from the company — does not support that erroneous conclusion. Instead, it shows that the company used a fetal cell line when testing the efficacy of its vaccine. Cell lines, which are key to medical research, are cloned copies of cells from the same source that have been adapted to grow continuously in labs. Nevertheless, users spread the falsehood about the contents of the vaccine widely on social media. “You are mandated to inject dead babies into your body,” one Twitter account sharing the video falsely claimed. “Fetal cells in the vaccines yet they are denying people religious exemptions.” At the heart of the widely shared video spurring the false claims are purported emails among Pfizer officials from early 2021.

THE FACTS: The infrastructure bill, a $1 trillion package that was approved in August by the Senate, does not include such a provision. Yet in a tweet shared by thousands that also circulated on Facebook, a conservative commentator falsely claimed the legislation would impose taxes on cows that would cripple American agriculture. “Just one example cattle farmers have to pay $2600 PER COW a year,” Melissa Tate wrote. “Dairy cows $6500 a year. This will put millions of cattle farmers out of business.” Tate did not respond to a request for comment. The erroneous claim follows a congressman’s false assertion about a separate, $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill, referred to as the Build Back Better Act, that is supported by many Democrats. In a statement criticizing that bill, Oklahoma Rep. Markwayne Mullin said the legislation “would impose a ‘fee’ on all methane emissions, including in our agriculture industry. … The tax is estimated to cost $6,500 per dairy cow, $2,600 per head of cattle, and $500 per swine each year.” But the reconciliation bill as currently drafted includes taxes on methane emissions relating to oil and gas production — not from livestock. A spokesperson for Mullin acknowledged that the bill does not currently contain those provisions. “This is what could happen if the methane fee were applied to agriculture,” Meredith Blanford said in an email. She said that while the text of the bill only specifies the oil and gas industry, it also references the Environmental Protection Agency’s greenhouse gas inventory “and leaves too much room for the EPA to expand its regulatory reach.” Blanford said the numbers were derived from an analysis by the American Farm Bureau Federation, a lobbying group. The organization’s vice president for public affairs, Sam Kieffer, said in a Sept. 30 statement that the group’s economists over the summer conducted an analysis of potential costs on agriculture using proposals relating to the methane tax on oil and gas. “To clear up any confusion, I want to make clear that the current language of the reconciliation bill does not impose a methane tax on agriculture,” Kieffer said. — Angelo Fichera • • • CLAIM: Adam Ali, a high school student from Solihull, a town in West Midlands, England, died from the COVID-19 vaccine.

The actual cause of Ali’s death is unknown, according to a spokesperson from the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS. One false tweet claimed, “Adam Ali 17 years old from Alderbrook school, had his first jab, had instant adverse reaction, convulsing, blood clots,” adding “he died the other day within two weeks and not a word from the media.” Ali, a student at Alderbrook Sixth Form in Solihull, died at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital on Sept. 19. “We can confirm that Adam did not have a COVID-19 vaccination; the cause of his tragic death is currently unknown,” a spokesperson for the Birmingham and Solihull vaccination program at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS said in an emailed statement. — Arijeta Lajka • • • CLAIM: Sex offenders are not required to carry cards identifying them as sex offenders because it is an invasion of their privacy. THE FACTS: Several states require registered sex offenders to carry special identification, and when states have rejected such laws, it has been based on the First Amendment, not privacy. Social media users are misrepresenting sex offender laws as they criticize requirements to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination, and incorrectly compare the two. “So we need a vaccine card to drink a beer at a bar, but sex offenders don’t need to carry anything?” reads the text on one widely shared TikTok video. “The U.S. has over 750,000 registered sex offenders and NONE of them are required to carry a passport because it violates their privacy,” another video’s text read.

indicted for drug trafficking and firearms possession News Release from USDoJ, January 26, 2021 (See UPDATE below) Honolulu, Hawaii – Ping Hong Lee of Honolulu, Hawaii, was arraigned today before Magistrate Judge Wes R. Porter on an indictment charging conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute cocaine, possession with intent to distribute cocaine, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, and felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition. He pleaded not guilty to the offenses. Trial is scheduled for March 30, 2021 before Senior District Court Judge Helen Gilmore US Attorney for the District of Hawaii Kenji M. Price announced the charges. As set forth in court filings, on January 13, 2021, law enforcement officers observed Lee, the lone occupant of a 2018 Porsche Macan GTS, pull into the pick-up area of a Waikiki Hotel. While there, a male entered the backseat of the Porsche with a dark blue duffle bag and then exited without the dark blue duffle bag. After Lee drove away, law enforcement officers tried to conduct a stop of the Porsche but were unsuccessful. The Porsche and Lee were found minutes later. Within the Porsche, law enforcement officers recovered approximately 11 kilograms (approximately 24 pounds) of cocaine from within the dark blue duffle bag, a loaded Charter Arms .38 caliber pistol, and US currency. As charged in the indictment, Lee has a prior 2012 federal drug distribution felony conviction. The charges announced today are merely allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. If convicted of the charges, Lee faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years of incarceration and up to life. The case was investigated by the DEA. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Darren W.K. Ching. * * * * * Feds link Bay Area man to California/Hawaii coke smuggling ring, illegal Hawaiian gambling hall UPDATE SJM Feb 4, 2021: … A Redwood City man has been arrested and charged with possessing at least five kilograms of cocaine for distribution, after state and federal authorities spent weeks tracking him and his cousin’s flights between Hawaii and California, court record show. Javier Chavez, 45, is in Santa Rita Jail in Dublin awaiting extradition to Honolulu, where he faces federal cocaine trafficking charges along with his co-defendant, Ping Hong Lee, court records show. The criminal complaint details how federal authorities tracked Chavez for weeks seeking evidence of his involvement in a cocaine trafficking ring. They were mostly unsuccessful, until authorities in Hawaii pulled over a Porsche with Lee and Chavez inside, and allegedly found a duffle bag with 23 pounds of cocaine inside…. The criminal complaint alleges that authorities were investigating Chavez’s cousin, who is referred to only as “Individual 1,” for alleged cocaine trafficking from the Bay Area to Hawaii. Individual 1 was also suspected of working to retrofit a Hawaiian bar, described as a “known hangout” for drug traffickers, into an illegal gambling den. The federal investigation started with a tip from Hawaii Department of Public Safety Dep. Dexter Kauahi to a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, the complaint says. “Deputy Kauahi stated that Individual 1 allegedly travelled from California recently with (approximately 22 – 33 pounds) of cocaine,” DEA Task Force Officer Sean Springer wrote in the complaint. “Deputy Kauahi also stated that he learned that Individual 1 had recently returned to San Francisco with $400,000- $500,000 of United States currency to purchase more narcotics and is due to return to Hawaii.” After the tip, federal authorities tracked Chavez and Individual 1 as they booked flights between Hawaii and California. They followed the men around airports in San Francisco and Hawaii, watched them hang out at the American Airline’s Admiral Club, and even took note of their trips to the men’s room. On Jan. 13, Springer asked Individual 1 to consent to a search of his bags at the Honolulu airport. Individual 1 appeared “nervous and shaky” to the officer, but the search turned up nothing illegal, the complaint says. But the following day, authorities in Hawaii spotted Chavez and Individual 1 leaving the Hawaiian Monarch hotel in Honolulu and saw Chavez — carrying a blue duffle bag — enter a Porsche being driven by Lee, the complaint alleges. They attempted to stop the Porsche but it sped off and authorities decided to discontinue the chase. But five minutes later, a Honolulu police squad car pulled over the Porsche…. read … Feds link Bay Area man to California/Hawaii coke smuggling ring, illegal Hawaiian gambling hall * * * * * SA: Honolulu man found with 24 pounds of cocaine is indicted for drug trafficking Most Intelligent Comment: “Did a search and his former wife Athena Lee was convicted of growing lots of weed in her home although she took weed for a medical condition.

A: It started very small and the turning point for us at the time (Myself and Wayde, Board of Directors) was an alarming increase in nature tagging at some gorgeous hiking locations. So, our journey began by researching and taking action to remove graffiti tagging from natural surfaces. We were tired of the talk.But very quickly we realized how much litter there was, and illegal dumping, and pallet bonfires leaving nails in the sand. We were truly a Mauka to Makai organization, cleaning everywhere. Q: Isn’t clean up the job of the City & County? Do you partner with other organizations or local governments? A: For the most part it really shouldn’t be anyone’s job to clean up after other adults, but here we find ourselves. That being said, someone’s got to do it and there are many proud community members who take action for any number of reasons. City & County have staff to manage parks but as we can see there’s a lot of space and tasks to cover and they can’t solve it all alone. That doesn’t even cover the jurisdictional gray zones where no one can agree to take charge. I’d love to see that change- where instead of multiple agencies pointing fingers and walking away, they compete with each other to show the most initiative. That’s where 808 Cleanups comes in. If it’s a public space in need of help, we go for it. We believe in positive action without all the roadblocks and gatekeeping. Don’t even wait for us! Everyone should think about taking their own initiatives, and we’ll do our best to support you. I tell people every day, their actions big and small are all significant. We partner with a number of other community groups, organizations and all levels of government where it makes sense to and is productive. Q: How is your work integrated into the local community? A: Community members are the heart and soul of 808 Cleanups. There would be no 808 Cleanups without the community, and we are here to serve everyone and also grow and progress together. We are all interconnected, and there are lessons of the past and present to study to prepare us all for the future. Together we can make the islands the best they can be- that means clean, safe and strong communities for everyone. That’s a natural right. To make that happen, we all need to take responsibility to make that happen. It isn’t going to get handed to us, and it shouldn’t fall onto the shoulders of the few. We also need to look big picture at how we get there. At 808 Cleanups we see the connections across space and time. The importance of Hawaiian people, culture, practices, knowledge is central to our organization. Several years ago, Kimenona Kane, a respected Hawaiian practitioner, joined 808Cleanups to help expand our activities. For example, he is currently helping us restore Puʻu o Kaimuki, a park that was once the site of a heiau. Kimeona’s huge efforts as a kumu to bring these practices to life. Litter and graffiti removal was only the beginning for us- we’ll have native plants return, fishponds return to function, coral reefs restored and sea levels stabilized. Team work both here and worldwide will get us there. Q: How do you fund yourselves? Do you have sponsors? Right now we receive about 14% of our revenue from individual and employee workplace donations, 6% from business donations, and 80% from grants. My top priority this year has been to diversify our funding, that includes writing grants every month as well as looking to how we could expand our revenues. We have some ideas on the table that we hope to test out this coming year. Regarding sponsors, we’ve had the greatest success with folks who know us, participate with us and follow our work thoroughly. In addition to funding, I tell everyone, your most valuable contribution is your TIME! Mahalo nui to everyone who donates any amount of money and time- it makes a huge difference to everyone, believe it! Q: If I want to be a volunteer, how do I get involved? A: 808cleanups.org is the one stop shop for our events calendar and information on our Adopt a Site program! We even have our own free app that’s available for Apple and Android. What’s great is you can track all your volunteer hours in your app’s portfolio, get exact GPS pins on cleanup locations, and find other volunteers and projects in your area! Q: Anything else you care to add? I just want to thank everyone out there who has supported us through thick and thin. We’re working harder than ever through the pandemic and that is in large part thanks to all of you both financially and for donating your time! Many of you want to stay active and give back, and that’s why 808 Cleanups is giving more events and support to you than ever before. Let’s keep up the great work! Robert F.

What is a night marcher?According to the Honolulu Magazine website, “Hawaii’s night marchers, the phantoms of ancient Hawaiian warriors, are said to roam the islands at night.” The Culture Trip website adds, “Night marchers, known as huaka‘i pō in the Hawaiian language, are death-dealing ghosts. “Folklore describes them as a group of spirits—sometimes traveling with ancient Hawaiian gods or goddesses in their midst—that march down the mountainside after sunset. The procession is often accompanied by the sounds of the conch shell, rhythmic drumming and oli (chants).” The Honolulu Magazine website explains, “In life, these warriors supposedly traveled at night to protect people so sacred that the common man was never allowed to look at them. Breaking that rule meant death.” Early recorded sightings of night marchersAccording to the OluKai website, the night marchers were first spotted in 1883, described in archives as “a mighty phantom army … proudly led by the spirit of King Kamehameha, pacing angrily about on the Big Island of Hawaii.” The website says residents “tell ghostly tales of rhythmic chanting, horn blowing, and the beating of distant drums carried on the evening tradewinds. Both locals and visitors report bright torches sighted in the darkness in areas of dense jungle with no trails. “On nights of the full moon, numerous credible sightings of bands of tall and muscular warriors, bronzed and beautiful to behold, are reported. The warriors are described as marching with a god as their leader accompanied by a band of torchbearers leading the way.” In case of an encounterAccording to the HowStuffWorks People website, people should always be hopeful the “ghost warriors take mercy” on them, whether or not they hear them approaching due to wind or being in the wrong place at the wrong time. If the night marchers are not merciful, people will “hear a shreak of ‘O-ia!’, which means, ‘Let him be pierced,’” and death will follow. However, the website explains if the person is lucky and is related, even distantly, to any of the night marchers, they will be spared. “They’ll shout, ‘Na‘u,’ which means ‘mine,’ indicating one of the warriors has recognized [them] as a descendant. The procession will pass [them] by without causing [them] harm.” The To-Hawaii website says, “Areas like the Nu‘uanu Pali Lookout, Ka‘a‘awa Valley and Kalihi Valley on Oahu are rumored sites of night marcher trails, and nighttime visitors are encouraged to be wary.” The website also includes Laie and Kualoa Ranch as locations where night marchers have been spotted. Origins of the night marchersThe Honolulu Magazine website quotes storyteller Lopaka Kapanui, who said, “The night marchers’ job wasn’t to terrorize people. It was simply to protect the most sacred, high-ranking chiefs … The night marchers showed mercy by traveling at night to spare people from harm.” The Culture Trip website explains the night marcher legend has its roots in ancient Hawaii. Traditionally, when a chief traveled through a village, the warriors would blow conch shells and beat drums to make others aware he had arrived. “Commoners were expected to stare at the ground, never, ever making eye contact. The consequence of disobeying this kapu (taboo) was death.” The website says chiefs were thought of “as physical representations of the gods,” so the night marchers believed their duties to protect them continued into the afterlife.• Ke Alaka'iCampus News CenterBYU–Hawaii #192055-220 Kulanui Street Bldg 5Aloha Center Room 134(808) 675-3694kealakai@byuh.edu""}]"
