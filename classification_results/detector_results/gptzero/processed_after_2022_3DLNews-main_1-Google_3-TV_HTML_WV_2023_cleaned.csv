(WOWK) — West Virginia Secretary of State and Republican gubernatorial candidate Mac Warner maintains the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump, saying that the FBI and CIA conspired against the former President. The claim arose in a Republican debate for West Virginia Governor on “MetroNews” when host Hoppy Kercheval asked Warner if he thought the presidency was stolen and Warner said, “Yes.” He said the agencies convinced social media sites Twitter—which is now called X—and Facebook to ban Trump and his supporters from discussing what was really on a laptop computer seized from presidential son, Hunter Biden. The younger Biden, like Trump, is under federal investigation. Democrats call the claims nonsense, but Warner stands behind them. “Now they do this maybe in other countries, that’s the purview of the CIA. But it’s not their job to come in and lie to the American people and decide the outcome of a presidential election by lying to the American people. That’s why I say that this election was obtained by trickery,” said Secretary of State Mac Warner, (R) Candidate for WV Governor. “It’s really a disservice to the fallen heroes who lost their lives in service to this country, who worked for the FBI and the CIA. And really, it’s a disservice to himself,” said Del. Mike Pushkin, (D) Kanawha and State Democratic Party Chairman. Secretary of State Warner said the House Judiciary Committee has the evidence from Congressional hearings and continues to investigate. Democrats call all of this unsubstantiated. Mac Warner says he’s not doing this to appeal to Trump supporters, and there are many in this state, as he runs for governor. Democrats believe he’s doing exactly that. Despite people saying the 2020 election was stolen from the former President, reviews and recounts continue to show that Biden won the Electoral College 306-232, and won the popular vote by more than 7 million votes, according to the Associated Press. The Associated Press also reported that there was little voter fraud in swing states, as well as conspiracy theories about voting machines were unfounded.

The National Weather Service (NWS) issued warnings for areas in western Washington, featuring cities to the north and east of Seattle — and a large part of the Olympic Peninsula, per the Associated Press. The atmospheric river, also known as a “Pineapple Express,” is a lengthy and narrow band of water vapor that can take warm subtropical moisture over the Pacific from around Hawaii. Conditions in Washington state caused the closure of passenger rail stations, schools and roads. The Evergreen State also saw the breaking of daily rainfall and temperature records. Amid flooding, a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter rescued a man from the roof of his truck and rescued several others trapped inside a house with 4 feet of water surrounding it, AP reported. The region is also experiencing warmer temperatures than usual this time of year. In Walla Walla, a city in the southeastern portion of Washington, the temperature was as warm as places in Florida and Mexico. Seattle reported a temperature of 59 degrees Fahrenheit at 1 a.m. on Tuesday, breaking a previous daily high, according to the NWS. The Emerald City also set a rainfall record Monday at 1.5 inches, according to Kirby Cook, the science and operations officer at Seattle NWS office. “We’ll continue to see significant impacts, especially with river crests and rises on area rivers” through Wednesday morning, Cook said. Amtrak said that passenger trains will not run between Seattle and Portland, Oregon, until Thursday due to a landslide. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The body was found September 6, 2022, when the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office responded to the area of Iron Ridge Road in Galax, where remains were found in a wooded area. The investigation indicated the remains had been there for “an extended period of time,” according to investigators. The Carroll County Sheriff’s Office used Othram Inc., “a private company based in Texas that specializes in Forensic-Grade Genome Sequencing and Forensic Genetic Genealogy,” according to investigators. The company developed a full DNA profile, which allowed the use of Forensic Genetic Genealogy, and two direct DNA comparisons of family members to identify the remains as being Logan Nathaniel Bowman.
