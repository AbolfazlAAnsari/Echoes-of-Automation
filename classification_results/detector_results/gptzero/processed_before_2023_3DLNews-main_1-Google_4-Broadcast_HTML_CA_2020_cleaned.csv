Fourteen years later, a new announcement is about to fill each person who remembers this place with nostalgia and happiness: The park will reopen! In an interview with the Pedro Hernández’ wife, owner of Paraíso Azteca who passed in 2003, told us that this recreational center will reopen in April with a new administration. The famous flying saucer, the Old West, a museum about coins of Mexico, a spa, a zoo and a suspension bridge, are some of the attractions that many will remember and will remain in this new adventure that will arrive this 2020. The idea is to remodel the park, while preserving and respecting Pedro Hernández\' projects and ideas. In addition, new modern attractions will be added to attract more children, youth and adults. Although the administration will be new, the name and essence of Paraíso Azteca will be the same. If you want to know more details about when you can start creating new memories in this place that may had been part of your childhood, follow their Facebook page Paraíso Azteca.

(WKRN) — An American Airlines flight from Dallas to Nashville took over eight hours to take off and was delayed three times after a man reportedly joked about having coronavirus. Flight #1076 to Nashville was set to depart around 6:30 p.m. and arrive at 8:40 p.m. Saturday but did not finally arrive at BNA until 4:40 a.m. Sunday. The man, who has not been identified, reportedly wouldn’t lift his tray table up before the plane took off at which point he claimed he had coronavirus. “People were freaked out because nobody knew what was going on,” said passenger Brandon Kenney, “People didn’t know if he was actually sick or if he really didn’t have coronavirus or not.” The situation understandably was taken very seriously. HAZMAT crews and police officers boarded the plane and had the man removed. Video Courtesy: Jason Halbert Passengers were reportedly panicked after seeing HAZMAT on the plane. Police told a passenger we spoke with that the man ‘wasn’t all there.’ “Right after he was escorted off the plane, one of the cops came back and kind of explained the situation to the people that were sitting near him and kind of spelled it out for us and told us not to worry about it and really was just talking about how he was joking about having the coronavirus,” said Kenney. Panic soon turned to frustration for passengers of the plane as part of the flight crew did not want to fly after the incident. Crew issues and maintenance issues led to further delays, all totaling about eight hours. The man who created the initial havoc was arrested. Airports are working to try to stop the spread and are a very big concern right now. Officials say the biggest concerns are social distancing and planes being an issue because social distancing cannot be done on them. Dallas-Fort Worth Airport is one of 13 airports that Americans who are coming back after visiting restricted countries are being flown into so they can be tested for coronavirus. Officials say you should wash your hands and avoid touching your face and take all necessary precautions to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. American Airlines acknowledged that the passenger was arrested for making a false claim. We reached out for further information, and we are still waiting to hear back.

Months after a SoCal Connected investigation found cannabis products at some unlicensed marijuana shops in Southern California contained potentially toxic chemicals, authorities said a sampling of products seized during recent raids at more than 40 illegal stores contained dangerous additives. The raids by the state Bureau of Cannabis Control resulted in 125 arrests, the seizure of more than 10,000 illegal vape pens, along with more than two tons of cannabis and cannabis products worth more than $10 million, and 11 illegal guns, the agency said. “The prevalence of dirty and dangerous vape pens at unlicensed cannabis stores demonstrate how important it is for consumers to purchase cannabis goods from licensed retailers, which are required to sell products that meet state testing and labeling standards,” said Bureau Chief Lori Ajax. “We urge consumers to scan the QR code to confirm that a business is licensed.” In December, SoCal Connected reported that hundreds of illegal pot shops exist throughout the Los Angeles-area, far outnumbering legal stores. SoCal Connected found products from joints to vape cartridges purchased from 11 of the unlicensed dispensaries and delivery services failed safety testing. The investigation, reported in the Dec. 17 television program, tested 36 products, finding evidence of the pesticides Fipronil, Carbofuran, Chlorfenapyr, Dichlorvos, and Paclobutrazol, which the California Department of Pesticide Regulation lists as pesticides that should never be used in cannabis farming. During their raids conducted Dec. 10-12, cannabis bureau agents served search warrants at 46 unlicensed businesses, including five visited in the SoCal Connected investigation -- Save Greens, 11221 Venice Blvd. in Culver City; Westside Meds, 8940 National Blvd. in Los Angeles; and Culver Healing Center, 10955 Venice Blvd. in Los Angeles; Burdank 25 Cap, 10626 Burbank Blvd., North Hollywood; and Green Door, 5522 Cahuenga Blvd., North Hollywood. Tests conducted for SoCal Connected showed: · A vape cartridge at Save Greens contained pesticides including myclobutanil and paclobutrazol. · A vape cartridge at Westside Meds contained pesticides bifenazate, chlorfenapyr, cyfluthrin, myclobutanil, and paclobutrazol, along with lead. · A joint purchased at Culver Healing Center showed signs of six pesticides: abamectin, chlorfenapyr, daminozide, myclobutanil, spiromesifen and chlorpyrifos. · Flower bought at Burdank 25 Cap contained pesticides boscalid, chlorfenapyr, malathion, myclobutanil, Spinosad, spiromesifen, and chlorpyrifos. · Flower purchased at Green Door revealed the pesticides chlorfenapyr, myclobutanil and paclobutrazol. The Cannabis bureau’s tests of a sampling of some of the illegal vape cartridges seized in their operations found that 75 percent contained undisclosed additives, including cutting agents such as Vitamin E, Vitamin E Acetate, Propylene Glycol, Polyethylene Glycol and Medium Chain Triglycerides. In some samples, the vape cartridge was comprised of more than 30 percent agents, authorities said. Nearly all the samples contained misinformation about their THC content. One label included a claim that the oil contained 80 to 85 percent THC, which tests showed that to be 33 percent THC. Another label claimed the cartridge contained 90.66 percent THC, but, in reality, it had 40 percent, the agency said. Some vape products contained a little as 18 percent THC, authorities said. The Cannabis bureau recently launched a campaign encouraging consumers to look for and scan a QR code when they visit a licensed cannabis retailer. Smartphone users can use their cameras to scan the code, linking them to the bureau’s OnlineLicense Search to check its status. Consumers also can check if a marijuana shop is properly licensed online at CApotcheck.com. All commercial marijuana activity in California must be licensed.
