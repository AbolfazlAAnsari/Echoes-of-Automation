Pierce News News Release Pierce Gem Team Cancelling Festival of Trees for 2020‚Ä¶With much reluctance and regret, the Pierce Gem Team is cancelling this year‚Äôs Festival of trees. The current CDC guidelines in place limit gatherings. Our Festival volunteer numbers are over 10 (Thank you Volunteers!!), and that does not give any room for our wonderful auction audience! This year we will be missed, but it also gives more time for the creative juices to flow and flourish for next year. Thank you for understanding that the Gem Team works for Pierce, even to help keep our awesome community safe. We will be back at work on projects soon, and we hope to see everyone next year with renewed positive energy.

Pierce Community Center With the recent changes made by Governor Little to push Idaho back further into State 2, the Pierce Community Center Board, had to make a difficult decision regarding the 2020 Holiday Bazaar. This decision was not easy, but due to the limit of no more than 10 people in a gathering, they are cancelling the bazaar. They are just as disappointed as everyone else but had to think of the community as well as the order set in place by the state. They remain hopeful that things could change and can host a ‚Äúcraft‚Äù bazaar at some point in the near future or early next year. Any vendors who have already purchased their tables will be refunded their deposit within the week. The Community Center will reach out to these vendors in the event they are able to host a future event to see if they would like to participate. This was an event that not only the community and vendors were looking forward to, but the board as well, to bring back some normalcy and joy to our small community. Unfortunately, there was no way possible to see it through with the limitations set in place. They want to thank you for your understanding and continued support the community center and pool. Progressive Jiu-Jitsu of Idaho classes at the Pierce Community Center on Mondays and Wednesdays are cancelled for the next two weeks. They will resume after the Thanksgiving Holiday unless something changes with the Covid-19 restrictions. Please contact the Pierce Community Center at that time to check with any changes that may have taken place. Do not forget about the new hours they are open.Monday through Thursday at 4 p.m. instead of 3 p.m., still closing at 8 p.m. Friday‚Äôs hours will still be from 1 to 6 pm.

Please give us a call at 541-889-5387 Copyright ¬© ‚Ä¢ Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy FRUITLAND Even as other school districts in the area took to alternative means of celebrating the class of 2020 due to novel coronavirus COVID-19, the Fruitland School District stuck to the idea of a traditional commencement ceremony for its high school‚Äôs graduating class, opting to try to postpone until stage 4 of reopening. With Idaho having entered stage 4 on June 13, the wait paid off. The ceremony was held on the football field at Fruitland High on Monday ‚Äî the first time the ceremony had been held on campus since 2002. The scoreboard was set to 20-20 to honor the graduates. The weather was a little patchy, but it didn‚Äôt deter friends and family from watching graduates as they walked the stage. Many did, however, have to bring their own folding chairs to sit around the track as the bleachers were off-limits for this ceremony to encourage social distancing. Superintendent Teresa Fabricius greeted these 104 graduates and those celebrating them as the ceremony began. This was Fabricius‚Äô last commencement before retiring. ‚ÄúWe had to get through a lot of obstacles as you know; we made it into stage four [of Idaho‚Äôs reopening plan] in the nick of time, we had to get a plan approved by the Southwest District Health department, we thank them for helping us,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt took a tremendous amount of work on the part of the high school staff, our students and our senior parents.‚Äù The class of 2020 had 17 valedictorians: Lexington Andersen, Betsie Barlow, Elle Berry, Addison Clevenger, Addison Concidine, Nathan Connell, Maritza Garcia, Katelyn Hardy, Joseph Henggeler, Joshua Henggeler, Hailey Hershey, Megan Jensen, Bradley Miller, Lilly Richins, Deanna Roberts and Austin Smith. To facilitate their speeches, these valedictorians spoke in groups. Following are examples of their remarks: ‚ÄúOur class is unlike any other, not only because of what we are facing in the world right now but because of the bond that has developed over many early morning practices, late night Facetime calls, trying to figure out homework, classroom court cases, debates and competitive review games within the class,‚Äù said Concidine. Hardy remarked about the resilience of her classmates: ‚ÄúLife took us down an unexpected path and we continued moving forward; What a gift we have been given at such a young age to learn resilience and strength in a time of great difficulty.‚Äù Connell recounted the challenges that the class of 2020 faced, even before the pandemic hit. ‚ÄúBut there were also the the good times, when we cried and celebrated,‚Äù added Anderson. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been to nationals for FFA, district three for band, state for sports, performances for musical theater and achieved passing grades in Mr. Carter‚Äôs class.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis class is a class of survivors,‚Äù said Berry. ‚ÄúWe were born in the 9-11 era and now we‚Äôre graduating during the COVID-19 pandemic. We‚Äôve continued to survive the countless late nights, studying vocabulary words, fighting through sickness with ibuprofen so we wouldn‚Äôt have to take finals, and enduring the ever-increasing high school drama.‚Äù Smith made a point to thank teachers and staff, his classmates and his coaches for sharing skills and knowledge with the class. ‚ÄúNot only have our coaches led us to winning seasons, district and state championships ‚Ä¶ but they have led us to greater heights,‚Äù said Smith. They had one salutatorian: Anthony McComb. McComb added his remarks about the things this class went through to make it here. ‚ÄúThis class has earned several state and district sport titles, because the ‚ÄòHonorable Judge Ziegler‚Äô has wisely taught us here at Fruitland academics are number one and sports are number two.‚Äù Teacher Larry Ziegler told the class that while he and his fellow teachers lamented not having more time to teach them in person, he expressed gratitude to the class to be able to make a connection to them. ‚ÄúI watched you come through the time you were little kids, in Idaho history programs and flag football and little league baseball. And I‚Äôve watched four or five of you bite the head off a fish before, if I recall,‚Äù said Ziegler. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs already been mentioned, look at all the obstacles you‚Äôve overcome in one giant detour, but we‚Äôre finally here. And I just have one question: Did anybody figure out what the heck happened?‚Äù A tradition at Fruitland High is the rose ceremony, where each graduate is given two roses to present to the two people in their lives who made the biggest impact. While many parents and guardians received roses, some teachers received them too, including Fabricius. After the graduates walked the stage to receive the holders for their diplomas, Ellie Tesnohlidek led the tassel ceremony, and while the graduates jumped the gun on tossing their caps in the air, principal Marci Haro certified and presented the graduating Class of 2020. Senior awards were presented at the ceremony. A list follows.

(Photo courtesy EILEEN KLATT) EMT‚Äôs Jean Theander and Tatiana Holborn volunteer with both Sam Owen Fire and Rescue and Clark Fork Valley Ambulance. They recently earned advanced EMT certification, which was a huge commitment and a lot of work. (Photo courtesy EILEEN KLATT) When Bonner County EMS volunteered to teach an advanced EMT (emergency medical technician) program in 2018, EMT‚Äôs Jean Theander and Tatiana Holborn seized the opportunity. Both women are EMT‚Äôs for Sam Owen Fire and Rescue as well as Clark Fork Valley Ambulance. The training has two parts: a 3-4 month online cognitive component and psycho-motor, i.e. hands-on, practical training. Skills such as airway placement and advanced IV techniques are necessary for more complex patients. The course required classes 2-3 times a week and months of studying. Jean summed it up succinctly: ‚ÄúIt was a lot of work.‚Äù Jean Theander volunteered with Kootenai County Search and Rescue as a canine handler and trainer for 9 years before moving to Hope with her husband Austin, who is also a volunteer with SOFD. Jean began EMT training after relocating and has volunteered with SOFD for five years. Raising and training German shepherds for search and rescue has been one of her passions for many years. Her first dog, Vanco, is retired now, but Jean continues her work as a breeder and trainer of his descendants. Tatiana Holborn emigrated from Ukraine in 2010 and moved to northern Idaho with her family in 2012. Her interest in the medical field began in childhood. In high school she trained as a health care assistant and became the youngest one ever in the facility where she worked. Tatiana spoke no English when she moved to the USA so language was an additional challenge to EMT training. She had to translate the study material from English to Ukrainian to learn and memorize it. Then she had to translate it back again for the testing. The extra effort paid off. She earned her basic EMT certification 3 years ago and began volunteering with SOFD and CFVA. The National Registry of EMT‚Äôs reimburses tuition for the EMT training courses, but only if the student passes the test on the first try. 27 EMT‚Äôs started the program. Fifteen took the test. Only 4 passed the test on the first try. Jean and Tatiana were 2 of them, Jean in February and Tatiana in September. ‚ÄúFire and rescue have a common goal: Provide our community with good service, whether fire or EMS,‚Äù states Sam Owen Fire Chief and EMT Tim Scofield. ‚ÄúThere are people that really like fire and people that really like EMS. With the interagency collaboration between Sam Owen Fire District and Clark Fork Valley Ambulance, we have enough personnel to provide both services.‚Äù EMS is a major part of the services that Sam Owen Fire and Rescue provides. About one third of all Sam Owen Fire‚Äôs calls are for advanced life support. The interagency collaboration between Sam Owen Fire and Clark Fork Valley Ambulance helps ensure effective Emergency Medical Services for eastern Bonner County. Many of the first responders for Sam Owen Fire and Rescue also volunteer for Clark Fork Valley Ambulance. Sam Owen Fire Chiefs Stu Eigler and Tim Scofield are EMTs and first responders for both Sam Owen Fire and Clark Fork Valley Ambulance. SOFD firefighter Cecil Jensen volunteers as a driver for CFVA as well as a firefighter for Clark Fork Fire and Rescue. Jean and Austin Theander both serve as firefighters and EMTs for SOFD and as EMTs for CFVA. EMT Tatiana Holborn volunteers for both organizations. Clark Fork Valley Ambulance, a volunteer organization under the leadership of Chief Dimitry Borisov, has their headquarters and center of operation in downtown Clark Fork. They maintain an additional ambulance at Sam Owen Fire Station No. 1. Being able to respond from two locations, depending on personnel available and the type and location of incident provides efficiency and a rapid response time. The skills and outstanding dedication of these first responders help maximize the limited pool of volunteer personnel in a rural area with a small population. It takes a lot of commitment and training by the volunteers of both agencies to provide these services. SOFD trains 3 times a month. CFVA trains once a month plus participating in interagency debriefings and joint trainings, such as ice rescue, life flight and emergency vehicle operation certification. Congratulations, Jean and Tatiana! And thank you from everyone in the Sam Owen Fire District for your dedication and service.

So Idaho‚Äôs allocating another $10 million of its CARES Act funds to long-term care facilities, including funding to increase the number of COVID-only facilities from the current two to up to 25 statewide. The current two are Twin Falls Manor and a COVID-dedicated wing within Arbor Valley of Cascadia in Boise. ‚ÄúThe level of COVID in nursing facilities now is just as bad as it was in March and April, nationwide,‚Äù said Robert Vander Merwe, executive director of the Idaho Health Care Association. ‚ÄúIn Idaho, it‚Äôs much worse than it was in March and April.‚Äù Dave Jeppesen, director of the Idaho Department of Health & Welfare, estimated on July 30 that Idaho\'s tally of long-term care patients with COVID would more than double to 900 by December. ""We actually have seen since then a pretty dramatic rise in the number of cases,"" he said Monday. Gov. Brad Little‚Äôs Coronavirus Financial Advisory Committee (CFAC) approved the funding on Friday, which includes $2 million in startup costs for the COVID-specific wings within existing facilities; $7 million for the increased costs of caring for COVID-19-positive patients in long-term care facilities including nursing homes, intermediate care facilities and assisted living centers; and $1 million in transportation costs to transport patients to and from the COVID-only facilities. All the funding is retroactive to March 1, so it covers costs already incurred in the pandemic. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very much appreciated,‚Äù Vander Merwe said. ‚ÄúThese funds are really only given to those facilities with COVID, though. And we had pushed for all facilities. Because all facilities have the same PPE (personal protective equipment) needs, the same staffing needs. You‚Äôve got to treat every patient as if they‚Äôve been exposed, every new admission as if they have COVID.‚Äù Jeppesen, in an Aug. 10 funding request submitted to CFAC, noted that as of July 30, the number of infected residents had been rising by about 100 per month, based on data from the state Division of Public Health. So it was expected to rise to 500 in August; 600 in September; 700 in October; 800 in November; and 900 in December. ‚ÄúThis estimate is based on current rates of transmission,‚Äù Jeppesen wrote. He said Monday, ""What we see ... is that there\'s just a really strong correlation between if we see lots of increase in cases in some areas of the state, that we tend to see a correlation of increase in long-term care facilities."" He said it\'s ""a very difficult thing to forecast."" The state‚Äôs most recent report on COVID-19 infections among residents and staff in Idaho long-term care facilities, published Friday afternoon, showed a total of 1,668 cases to date, including 138 deaths associated with 42 facilities. That‚Äôs more than half the 269 COVID-19 deaths Idaho has reported statewide. ""It\'s one of my big barometers of what we really need to watch, and that\'s why we put some more cash in there,"" Little told the Idaho Press on Monday. As of Friday, the number of current COVID-19 cases among residents or staff of long-term care facilities in Idaho was at 1,338, associated with 98 facilities. ""We always knew when we made this request that it may not be enough, frankly,"" Jeppesen said. Alex Adams, CFAC chairman and the governor‚Äôs budget director, said, ‚ÄúWe recognize that there might be more that needs to be done, but part of it hinges on what Congress does as well. ‚Ä¶ We recognize that more help may be needed on the horizon.‚Äù Idaho already had allocated $13 million of its $1.25 billion share of CARES Act aid for testing costs at the state‚Äôs more than 400 long-term care facilities. The CFAC vote on the funding was unanimous, as were two other funding decisions approved Friday: ‚Ä¢ $2.57 million for emergency food statewide through the Idaho Foodbank and its partners, which are seeing surging demand amid declining donations; and ‚Ä¢ $2.6 million to replace a 24-bed dormitory-style living unit at the Juvenile Corrections Center in St. Anthony with a new facility that allows for social distancing and quarantine. The 1950s-era living unit was the last remaining dormitory-style housing unit for juvenile offenders in the state juvenile corrections system; a recent review by Eastern Idaho Public Health found it deficient for addressing and containing potential COVID-19 outbreaks. Adams said the new facility is scheduled to be built by Dec. 30; that‚Äôs a requirement for spending federal CARES Act funds. ‚ÄúI know the department and the governor‚Äôs office are working pretty closely with the Department of Public Works to ensure that is the case,‚Äù he said. The Idaho Foodbank proposal received strong support from CFAC, Adams said; letters of support were submitted by the Department of Health & Welfare and an array of groups across the state. The Idaho Foodbank partners with more than 400 organizations across the state, including Spokane-based organizations that help serve the five northernmost counties. ‚ÄúThey distribute food directly to rescue missions, church pantries, school backpack programs, women‚Äôs shelters, things like that,‚Äù Adams said, ‚Äúso they have the ability to get food out to a diverse network of partners in all 44 counties. And because of COVID, donations have slowed down, resulting in them having to purchase more food that would traditionally be donated. So it‚Äôs a way to ensure Idahoans have access to food during the months ahead.‚Äù In a typical year, the Idaho Foodbank spends just over $200,000 on food purchases, according to its funding request; since March, it‚Äôs spent nearly $1 million. Since the onset of the pandemic, it‚Äôs also dramatically increased its food distributions to needy Idahoans. After Friday\'s actions, Idaho still had $370 million left unallocated from its $1.25 billion share of CARES Act coronavirus aid funds. Betsy Z.

The company that owned the shipment, Big Sky Scientific, sued the state police to get the product back. A judge ruled Jan. 21, 2020, that the company must forfeit the shipment because hemp is still illegal under Idaho law. Subscribe BOISE ‚Äî A Colorado-based CBD company must forfeit the 6,701 pounds of industrial hemp, at one time valued at $1.3 million, that the Idaho State Police seized a year ago as a trucker drove the product from Oregon to Colorado, a judge ruled last week. Fourth District Judge Jonathan Medema wrote that the hemp in question, which passed tests to be considered hemp under federal law, was still a controlled substance under Idaho law. He also wrote that possession of any plants of the genus cannabis is illegal in Idaho. ‚ÄúUnder Idaho law, it is a crime to possess any plant with that genus, unless one possesses only the mature stalks of the plant,‚Äù Medema wrote in a 33-page memorandum filed Jan. 21 in a lawsuit between the company, Big Sky Scientific, and the Idaho State Police. On Monday, Big Sky Scientific‚Äôs attorney Elijah Watkins did not say whether the company would file an appeal in the case. However, he said he was still assessing and evaluating the judge‚Äôs decision, and looking at pieces of the case that the Idaho Supreme Court might examine. According to a statement from Idaho State Police, the court‚Äôs decision affirmed state troopers‚Äô actions and found they ‚Äúacted appropriately and upheld the law‚Äù in seizing the hemp. Tecia Ferguson, spokeswoman for the agency, confirmed the hemp has not been destroyed, and said the agency will not destroy it until the entire legal process is complete. Both hemp and marijuana are plants of the genus cannabis, but industrial hemp, by federal law, must contain .3% or less of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. Hemp doesn‚Äôt produce a high, but it can be used in everything from clothing and lotion to beer, and provides the raw material for therapeutic CBD-based products. Thanks to the 2018 Farm Bill, under federal law, hemp is legal for interstate transport provided it meets certain requirements. Any substance containing any THC at all, however, is considered marijuana and illegal in Idaho. It‚Äôs why in January 2019 the Idaho State Police in Ada County confiscated a shipment of 6,701 pounds of industrial hemp belonging to Big Sky Scientific, touting it as the biggest marijuana bust in the state‚Äôs history. They arrested the trucker, 36-year-old Denis Palamarchuk, on suspicion of trafficking in marijuana; in September, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of failure to provide supporting documents as a driver because he had a faulty bill of lading. Palamarchuk was the third out-of-state trucker arrested in less than a year‚Äôs span for transporting hemp through Idaho. In November, Gov. Brad Little issued an executive order authorizing the interstate transport of hemp through Idaho, provided transports meet specific regulations. The Ada County Prosecutor‚Äôs Office confirmed last week it will not prosecute people who are transporting hemp grown in compliance with the requirements in the governor‚Äôs order. CIVIL SUIT Even after Palamarchuk‚Äôs criminal case was closed, the Idaho State Police did not return the hemp, which later tested at or below the federal THC requirement for industrial hemp. In February, Big Sky Scientific sued the state police in an attempt to regain the shipment, and the two entities have been locked in a legal battle ever since. Both sides filed motions asking Medema to issue a summary judgment, meaning a decision in favor of one side or the other without a trial, on whether the company must forfeit the hemp. He issued that judgment Jan. 21 in favor of the Idaho State Police. Watkins, representing Big Sky Scientific, has previously argued in this case that the transportation of hemp across Idaho is legal because of the 2014 Farm Bill.

Introducing novices to the basics of yoga is a priority for Beatriz Merl, the owner of a new yoga studio in downtown Lewiston. Montana rancher Sharmen Scafani recalled the first time she noticed something strange with her new horse. It happened when, earlier this year, her daughter sent her a photo of the two-week old horse with a message asking ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with this picture?‚Äù Scafani looked at it closely. ‚ÄúHoly cow,‚Äù she responded. ‚ÄúIs that another leg?‚Äù Sure enough, growing from the horse‚Äôs front leg was a fifth hoof. Scafani had never heard of this happening to a horse before. Though it started small, the extra limb kept growing the past six months. If it kept growing until it touched the ground, she worried about it causing problems for the horse, which was appropriately named Cinco. ‚ÄúIt was definitely going to be a hindrance to him,‚Äù she said.

He said Cinco‚Äôs extra hoof was unique because it was a fully formed distal limb with a bone, joints and ligaments. ‚ÄúThis one was actually fairly substantial,‚Äù he said.

Universal Health Services, which operates hundreds of health care facilities across the U.S., including Intermountain Hospital, on Sunday was forced to shut down digital networks following a ransomware attack. Impacted health care providers moved to paper-based record-keeping, and some patients were rerouted to other facilities and had appointments and test results delayed as a result of the cyberattack, Wired magazine reported. Chuck Christiansen, director of business development at Intermountain Hospital, told the Idaho Press Friday that Intermountain Hospital was not one of the facilities affected by the attack. ‚ÄúWe are still a paper-based facility, and we are going on business as usual,‚Äù Christiansen said. Universal Health Services also operates Boulder Creek Academy, a therapeutic boarding school near Bonners Ferry. Boulder Creek Academy officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. There is no indication that any patient or employee data was accessed, copied or misused during the cyberattack, Universal Health Services said in a news release Thursday.

Morris mainly cites the conflict between the University of South Florida‚Äôs Principles of Community and Aramark‚Äôs reputation. ‚ÄúThis is an issue I take seriously, as allowing corporations like Aramark to profit off students while universities claim to be striving for and working towards inclusive and ethical campus environments seems very hypocritical to me,‚Äù Morris wrote in an email. Morris‚Äô petition has received over half the necessary signatures, and she said that she hopes to devote more time to what she calls her ‚ÄúEnd Aramark efforts‚Äù by collaborating with different student organizations and working with different people who are similarly dedicated to making noise about the issue. However, she also mentions it is hard as a student who has other obligations. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs truly the issue with student-led petitions like this ‚Äì we (students) all have an expiration date. Students are on campus anywhere from 2 ‚Äì 6 years,‚Äù Morris wrote. ‚ÄúUniversity leadership holds their positions anywhere from 5 ‚Äì 20 years giving them the ability to wait out students who will eventually graduate and leave the campus. This is very frustrating and I‚Äôm hoping to begin something that will continue to push for Aramark‚Äôs removal from our campus even after I graduate.‚Äù Even so, there are examples of students who were outraged and adamant enough to make real, tangible change happen before they left the halls of higher education. In late 2018 on New York University‚Äôs campus, students led a lengthy campaign for NYU to cut ties with Aramark after the dining service served a stereotypically racist meal consisting of watermelon, collard greens and Kool-Aid to students during Black History Month. At the end of 2018, NYU students saw the climax of the campaign when the student-led Incarceration to Education Coalition occupied the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library atrium until NYU agreed to cut ties with Aramark. In March 2019, NYU ended its contract with Aramark after more than 40 years. Regardless, in the case of Boise State, Aramark has not acknowledged its troubled past, instead contesting that it is contributing to solving the issues surrounding the prison system in America. ‚ÄúWe have become the target of a well-organized campaign questioning our role in providing important food and nutrition for people that are in the justice system,‚Äù Vice President Communications & Public Affairs at Aramark Karen Cutler wrote in an email to Boise Weekly. ‚ÄúWe are actually part of the solution with a strong commitment to rehabilitating incarcerated individuals so they can transition back to their communities.‚Äù In 2015, prisoners in both Ohio and Michigan were served Aramark food that was infested with maggots. According to goodjobsfirst.org, it racked up $19,724,962 in penalties nationally from 2000 to 2019, over $11 million of which come from employment related offenses, like wage and hour violations, employment discrimination and workplace safety or health violations. Whether or not Boise State students can manage to sway the university they pay almost $25,000 per year to attend, they are starting a conversation about the morality of such vast corporations and what their place is in a community. ‚ÄúMarlene Tromp, please act on this and help Boise State be the university that truly works to improve the lives of Black students in more ways than one,‚Äù Liz Raphael, the creator of the petition for Boise State University to drop Aramark, wrote in the body of the petition. ‚ÄúWe can all do better, this is tangible.‚Äù Boise State students push back against school‚Äôs food service provider, Aramark Your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers: Account processing issue - the email address may already exist Sign up with Thank you .

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 1:56 pm Fernwood residents can expect a special night of martial arts and fellowship this weekend. Empty Hand Combat (EHC) of Nampa will host a special Night of the Kung Fu Warriors at the UpRiver Elementary Gym Feb. 29. EHC founders Cosmo and Sarah Zimik will present a Martial Artist Expert show featuring a team of special guests, Grand Master Chitah Shetty and Master Virender Kumar. The event will serve as a fundraiser for EHC to help support orphans and unprivileged kids in India. The event will also serve as a fundraiser for both the Fellowship Bible and Clearwater Churches. Pastor Rick Pietlicki said that the two churches plan to merge, and that they are seeking funds to build a new church in Emida. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something the two churches have been talking about,‚Äù Pastor Pietlicki said. ‚ÄúMy wife knew Cosmo, since she is from around the area where his dojo is, and we thought it would be fun to have him out for a demonstration and for him to give his testimony about his relationship with God.‚Äù Pastor Pietlicki said that martial arts is something he‚Äôs noticed his congregation has had an interest in, even noting that one of them is a black belt. ‚ÄúI know Veronica (Retana) will be interested since she has done martial arts before,‚Äù Pastor Pietlicki said. ‚ÄúI think it will be fun for everyone.‚Äù The presentation will be from 2 to 3:30 p.m and is free to attend. The two groups will also accept donations at the door. Cosmo and Sarah Zimik will also speak at the Emida Community Center on March 1 at 10 a.m. The two will discuss with the Fellowship Bible and Clearwater Churches their current support of the Indigenous Foundations mission in third world countries.
