beginning of March, sinkholes like this one on the Puckett farm in Linwood have started to collapse in on land across Hart County. Photo submitted. Mary Beth Sallee Reporter, Hart County News-Herald In a three-day rainfall accumulation ending on March 1, south central Kentucky found itself reaching high levels of rainfall throughout many counties. According to the National Weather Service, in Hart County alone, nearly six inches of rain fell during that time. Torrential rainfall not only brought flooding to many areas in the county, but also caused sinkholes to form on several local farms. One of those farms included the Ray farm in Hammonsville. According to DeJuana Lindsey, two sinkholes are now formed on that land. The hole that a calf had fallen in was a pre-existing sinkhole that had been on the farm for years. However, because of the rainfall from weeks ago, that particular hole has gotten deeper. It is now approximately 4-foot wide by 8-foot deep. The excessive rainfall also caused a new sinkhole to form, measuring at approximately 8-foot by 8-foot. “The new sinkhole is very close to the older hole,” Lindsey said. “I do think in time they will meet. There are caves all over the area, so you never know where one might turn up. I am very concerned for our cattle, and with the sinkholes being very close to the pond, I would hate to see the pond drain. We have fenced off the area for now and plan on filling with rock.” A sinkhole that has formed on the property of Lance and Shelly Strother. Photo submitted. Other sinkholes have also opened up on the property of Lance and Shelly Strother, Faye Edwards, and the Puckett farm in Linwood. Chelsea Ballard is the Membership and Volunteer Coordinator at the American Cave Conservation Association (ACCA). She is also a student at Western Kentucky University (WKU) studying karst geoscience and hydrogeology. Sinkholes are one of the many features that she studies and assesses in areas with limestone. “According to Kentucky Geologic Survey, around 40% of Kentucky is covered in sinkholes,” Ballard said. “For anyone in south central Kentucky, you can guarantee to find a sinkhole within a five-minute drive or sometimes just looking out your back door. This is all possible due to a karst landscape that is made up of soluble bedrock, such as limestone, and it erodes from rainwater. Other commonly known features related to this landscape are caves, springs, underground rivers, sinkholes, and disappearing streams.” “Generally, sinkholes continue to grow at various rates depending on their location and how much water it drains throughout the years,” Ballard continued. “If it is a sinkhole that drains after each rain, you can expect it to grow faster rather than a sinkhole that may not be as large of a depression.” Although the sinkholes at the Lindsey, Strother, Edwards, and Puckett properties came after the torrential rains, Ballard stated that during the months from December through April, more sinkholes develop than any other time of the year. She refers to it as “sinkhole season”. “This is due to varying temperatures, ground freezing and thawing, and our winter/spring rainy season,” Ballard explained. “Generally, the transition from summer to fall is a drought season. When we have several inches of rain drop in a short amount of time, the sinkholes flood because of one or two things.” Those two things may include: “In this (second) situation, we had 6+ inches of rain in a short amount of time. The sinkholes became overwhelmed with the amount of water but eventually, the water table came up so high, the water had nowhere to go.” Ballard further stated that she knew collapsing sinkholes would occur after the heavy rainfalls. “One thing to keep in mind, this area is full of caves and underground voids,” Ballard said. “The water from the surface drains through the cracks and crevices of the limestone and slowly, over time, dissolves the rock away. As this occurs, the water below and above is always changing the landscape.” With the development of neighborhoods, roads, and towns, Ballard said water flow plays a major role in causing more sinkholes to collapse in. “As we alter the water flow, it affects the original path, and the water has to now find a new way down,” Ballard said. “This can weaken the new water paths more quickly because the water did not go that way originally.” “Water is powerful,” she added. “The best thing is for our community to be educated on sinkholes, caves, and water quality. Once that is accomplished, you can expect the area to improve on sinkholes from collapsing in and where we should or should not develop new neighborhoods, roads, etc.” However, Ballard said that it is hard to predict when a sinkhole may open up. “Perfect example would be the Corvette Museum sinkhole collapse in 2014,” Ballard said. “The Skydome was built in the 1990s, unaware of a cave below. Twenty-five years later, a sinkhole opened up, swallowing up eight classic corvettes. Bowling Green has been developed on top of the sinkhole plain, where limestone is exposed. As cities, neighborhoods, roads, etc. develop, they are rerouting the original water flow, and it creates problems and concerns very quickly. The water is now finding a new way to get to the main river source, and it can cause the land to collapse in more quickly rather than it taking its original water flow. Bowling Green is essentially day-by-day waiting for another sinkhole to collapse in. There are constant concerns with sinkholes in that area.” But despite the unpredictability of sinkholes, farmers can take the proper precautions when something like that does occur. “If the landowners want to fill in their sinkhole, the best option is to incrementally fill the depression with fill soil that has a high amount of clay and low amount of sand,” Ballard explained. “Continue this process until the depression is filled in. You may want to overfill the hole and create a small dome since it is likely the fill soil will compact and settle over time. Allow the area to sit for a month or two to ensure that a new sinkhole does not form. You may want to lay some topsoil or potting soil on top. Topsoil can help you establish vegetation. Farmers should be on alert throughout the year to make check for new or growing sinkholes. This can cause concerns for livestock or even equipment going off into the sinkholes.” If you would like more information or if you would like for someone to visit and assess your land about sinkholes, caves, springs, or water quality, please email Chelsea Ballard at chelsea@caveconservation.com. And as always, please do not dump trash into sinkholes as it negatively impacts water quality. A calf had to be lifted out of a sinkhole after falling in on the Ray farm in Hammonsville.

Chance of rain 70%. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:49 pm The Commonwealth Journal isn’t the only award-winning periodical in town. The Bridge is the student-produced newspaper of Somerset Community College. Started in the year 2000, The Bridge’s staff over the years has included many talented student-journalists who have gone on to great careers in a variety of fields, while their work on The Bridge has earned numerous Kentucky Press Association Excellence in Journalism awards — this past year, the paper took Third Place for overall General Excellence in their category,with a host of individual honors as well. Stuart Simpson, one of two advisors for The Bridge along with fellow SCC instructor Jeff Harris, noted that the paper is the “direct descendant” of SCC’s first student newspaper, The Mirror. In 1971-72, Simpson was a staff member on that paper and with his long-time advisor, the late Don Orwin, as his first journalism instructor. “Today, we get support from former staff members of both of these SCC student papers,” said Simpson. Stuart came to SCC with a journalism degree from the University of Kentucky and 25 years’ worth of experience with smaller papers from all over the region; Harris earned an English Education degree at the University of the Cumberlands (then Cumberland College), with the intention of pursuing a career as a high school English teacher. “But after joining the school’s student newspaper staff during my junior year, I caught the journalism bug,” he said. “After graduation, I worked for several years as a reporter and photographer for my hometown daily in Middlesboro, Ky., before moving to Somerset and shifting my focus to higher education. Of course, thanks to my work with The Bridge, I’ve been able to stay connected to journalism.” Both teach SCC’s “Special Topics” class, the journalism practicum course. Teamwork is essential, notes Simpson; Harris uses his English background to help students fine-tune articles and columns, while Simpson offers oversight in collecting copy and photos as well as the design of the publication. “Comparing our newspaper to a restaurant, Jeff instructs students how to put the ingredients together to make a great-tasting dish, and I watch over how the meal is plated and brought to the table,” quipped Simpson. “I also give the customers their checks and run the cash register.” The two encourage students to focus on stories that are of interest to SCC students. The slogan on the paper’s front page notes that The Bridge is “For The Students. By The Students” — and it is. Because of this, the staffs looks for news at both SCC campuses—Somerset and London—and SCC’s centers in Russell, McCreary, Clinton and Casey. “Some events that happen at our college might be big news to faculty, administrators and even the general public, but not to our students,” said Simpson. Harris said The Bridge covers all the goings-on at the college, “so there is never a shortage of things to write about,” but the most popular articles tend to be profiles, particularly student profiles. One article that stands out in his memory was from 2006, when The Bridge’s then-managing editor, Kara Sumner, profiled a transgender student on campus. “She handled the story with such sensitivity and insight that it ultimately won her the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Award for College Journalism,” said Harris. “She is still the only community college student ever to have received that award. It was a really big deal for Kara and for The Bridge!” Simpson said believe students who enroll in the journalism class have some interest in writing, but not all. Some have joined to focus on photography and design work and other, more modern forms of journalistic media. “There’s really no ‘typical’ Bridge staffer,” said Harris.”Over the 20+ years I’ve been involved with The Bridge, we have seen all sorts of students come through, ranging in age from late teens to late 60s, and with a wide variety of interests and goals. Some join The Bridge looking to learn the basics of journalism, and some sign up just looking for a fun, hands-on learning experience. The cool thing is that the class provides both, and for many students, a whole lot more.” Print journalism is ever evolving, and The Bridge has tried to evolved along with it. Print issues are still produced, but the publication also works with online platforms, social media, video production — even a podcast. “Modern journalists have to be able to do more than just interview people and write articles,” noted Harris. The podcast came about when former Bridge staff member Demareon Jones suggested starting one a couple of semesters ago. “We are always looking to try new things, but we also have to be cost-conscious because The Bridge, like any other newspaper, is funded primarily through ad sales,” said Harris. “... (W)e encouraged (Jones) to give it a go, but we were skeptical because recording equipment costs money. Demareon showed us, though, that with only a few strategic and relatively inexpensive purchases, it could be done. “And when fellow staffer Noah Allen, who has a wealth of technical expertise in sound and video editing, got involved, we were rolling,” added Harris. “Thanks to Demareon and Noah, The Gateway, as we call the podcast, has had a professional look and sound from our first episode, and it’s proven to be popular with listeners (and) viewers.” The Bridge publishes three issues each semester, printed at J. Frank Publishing in London and distributed to SCC’s two campuses and four centers, as well as other schools, libraries and businesses around the state. A PDF version of the paper is always available on SCC’s website (www.somerset.kctcs.edu) and there are links to the paper and The Gateway video-podcast on Facebook at “SCC The Bridge.” Some Bridge staffers go on to become working journalists, and some go into related fields, such as TV production, visual design, marketing, public relations, and so on. The vast majority, said Harris, go into unrelated fields, like teaching, nursing, and small business ownership. Harris said that one former Bridge editor is currently pursuing a PhD in Environmental Science, another is in an MFA program with the goal of becoming a playwright, and yet another is a JAG attorney in the United States Air Force. “We’re proud of all our ‘Bridge kids,’ and we hope that their experience working on the newspaper staff helped to give them the confidence, if not the specific skills, to pursue their goals,” said Harris. The current staff of The Bridge includes managing editor Stacy Pals and staff writers Alison Causey and Brandi Bowlin. They contribute both news articles and opinion pieces for every issue, as well as put the product together. Harris reached out to Pals after she took a writing course with him last semester and asked if she’d like to be a part of The Bridge staff. She’s found it to be an enjoyable experience, for various reasons. “Just the camaraderie of the entire class,” she said. “Getting to see all the different views from the different students — whenever you’re interviewing them, the different backgrounds that people come from and things that are going on with them.” Simpson said that the lessons students learn in this class — interviewing, reporting, taking photographs, hosting a podcast, and working with a team—these skills can be useful in any career. Harris said that he and Simpson are grateful for the support they’ve received from SCC’s administration and from their colleagues over the years, without whose help and encouragement The Bridge would not exist.

In the past year, the number of applicants has increased from 2,777 to 3,792 — one of the highest recorded applicant numbers the college has ever seen. Dr. Wendy Jackson has been the College of Medicine’s associate dean of admissions for four years. She said this 37 percent increase is much higher than the 18 percent average increase that medical schools across the country have seen. Jackson also said UK has pipeline programs in place for high school students who are on pre-med tracks. “[We’re] hopefully helping support those who are traveling along that pipeline and getting them nice and polished when it’s time to apply for medical school,” Jackson said. This increase comes in spite of the challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic brought to the application process. Though applicants usually meet other students and faculty through in-person interviews and receptions from August to February, the pandemic forced these events to become virtual. Jackson said these virtual interviews became the standard for all medical schools in the country. “We needed to have an alternative plan, so that decision was made by the beginning of summer that we were going to switch to virtual interviewing,” Jackson said. Despite these challenges, Jackson said the College of Medicine prioritized maintaining equity for all its applicants. “We wanted to make sure that all of our applicants that maybe didn’t have access to good connectivity could have that access,” Jackson said. “At our regional campuses, we have the luxury of being able to say if we have an applicant that’s, say, in western Kentucky and didn’t have access to good internet, they could come to our Bowling Green campus, and we would then create a space for them to be able to have good connectivity.” Dr. Robin Cooper, a professor in UK’s biology department, said that society has pushed people to pursue medical school while stigmatizing other careers. “A lot of it goes with parental pushing [and] societal pushing,” Cooper said. “That’s why you go to college, to get a better job, and then you apply to go to the next profession to get a better job and better pay, so I think it’s just accentuated in going into the medical field.” The COVID-19 pandemic has given many people a similar firsthand experience with medicine, leading many to cite it as a possible cause of the increase in medical school applications. “You probably have people who have been affected by COVID and who have seen their family members go through it, and they weren’t able to help,” said Rachel Boice, a senior biology major on the pre-med track. “Nobody really knew what to do, so that’s probably why they were motivated to come in to make sure something like this doesn’t happen again.” Cole Dowdy is a UK graduate entering his second year of medical school at the University of Louisville.

It’s hard to believe it’s been right at a year since COVID-19 entered our lives. You’ll have to forgive the skepticism on the part of the people of Eastern Kentucky when President Joe Biden and administration officials recently announced a series of executive orders aimed at the Climate Change issue.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to put numerous things on hold. Events and decisions have been put off as we’ve been forced to deal with delay after delay and cancellation after cancellation. We owe a lot to our local health departments, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, as they have become more invaluable to our communities than ever before.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:50 pm STAMPING GROUND — The tragic deaths of two well-known, beloved men hours apart on Thursday has this small Scott County community reeling. Darrell Taylor, the pastor of Cedar Grove Baptist Church for 48 years died Thursday from the COVID virus. On the same day, Jim Padgett, an Army veteran and father of two, was killed from a welding explosion in Jessamine County. Padgett, 31, had plans to propose on Friday to his long-time girlfriend Madison “Maddy” Duckworth and the mother of their two girls, five years of age and one year-old. Originally, he planned to propose last week, but the ring he had ordered had not arrived, so he told family members he would propose Friday. “I had no idea,” Duckworth said about the proposal. “His mom told me when we were on the way to the hospital after the accident. I had no idea. He never got the opportunity to ask.” Padgett was a gentle giant, who loved his daughters dearly, she said. “He was a big man, but he had the biggest heart,” she said. “He was just a big teddy bear. He was kind. He was honest. He was gentle. He had two little girls and they had his heart. When he looked at them you could just see it. He would beam with pride.” The couple met through mutual friends almost seven years ago. “I knew who he was, so we kinda knew each other,” Duckworth said. “He came into Buffalo Wild Wings one night while I was working. We added each other on Facebook the day after. We went on a date within a week and we literally have been inseparable since then.” A welder since high school, Padgett made many gifts for Duckworth, their daughters and his family. These include a rose, a man kneeling with a flower and a daisy pencil holder for his oldest daughter, she said. “His mom has tons of things he has made,” she said. Oldest of six children, Padgett was fatherly to his siblings as well, Duckworth said. Padgett graduated from Scott County High School in 2009. He and Bryan Hudson share the school record for the PowerClean lift of 315 pounds, said Cardinals head football coach Jim McKee. He was an offensive guard on the 2008 Cardinal team that lost in the region finals. “He worked so hard,” McKee said. “He had a lot of God-given talent, but he worked hard too. I’d say his ability was 30 percent God-given, and 70 percent work ethic. We don’t have a lot of SEC-caliber players here, we are mostly just blue-collar Americans who work hard. Jim was everything good that represents Scott County High School. I was devastated when I heard the news. Just an awesome young man.” Austin Conway posted of his friend. “Jim Padgett was a beacon of integrity, morality and just all around purity on the football field and in the classroom. He always went back to run alongside those who were struggling to finish the mile or the lap. Never leaving anyone behind,” Conway wrote on Padgett’s Facebook page. Padgett died at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center after being originally transported to the University of Kentucky Medical Center. He was welding on a dump truck when the explosion occurred. The Nicholasville Fire Department is investigating. There are multiple fundraisers planned for Padgett’s family. A GoFundMe page has been set up by the Soldiers 979 Engineer Company, his U.S. Army unit. A Memorial Ruck, a military-style hike, will be held Saturday, Sept. 11 at 3 p.m. at the Legacy Trail in Lexington. The ruck will be family friendly so children can ride scooters or bikes. On Friday, Sept. 17, at 6 p.m. a memorial ride will be held from Man O’War to Frankie’s Plaza at 540 Hecks Plaza Dr. in Morehead, with a portion of the proceeds going to the family. Several Georgetown businesses, including Fava’s Restaurant, have jars collecting funds, as well. “If it doesn’t show what kind of person he was by all that is going on in the community, I don’t know what would,” Duckworth said. “He was good in all aspects. He was a good person. A good son. A good father. A hard worker. Everything they are doing just shows how good of a person he was.” Some type of memorial may be held at a future SCHS football game, although no specific plans have been made. Funeral arrangements have not been made at press time. Taylor, 72, has been pastor of Cedar Grove Baptist Church since 1973, according the church’s website. During his ministry Taylor led the church from a small building constructed in 1880 with an outhouse to its current 8,000 sq. ft. building at 1289 Cedar Rd., which includes 15 acres of land. Taylor’s last sermon was Aug. 8, according to the church’s website. The pastor’s death was announced on the church’s Facebook page. “Brother Taylor has gone on to be with Jesus in Heaven worshipping our mighty God,” notes the church’s Facebook page. “He now knows the unknown, and we are thankful for God’s mercy.” Taylor is survived by his wife of 39 years, Judy, three children and six grandchildren. He retired from Randall’s as a meat-cutter after 20 years and worked as an associate with Johnson’s Funeral Home, here in Georgetown, for the past 20 years. Rob Patterson, the evangelism team leader for the Kentucky Baptist Convention, praised Taylor in an interview with Kentucky Today. “Darrell was a kind soul who pastored Cedar Grove for 48 years,” Patterson said. “The fruits of his faithful shepherding were easy to see as out in Stamping Ground, you would find this vibrant inter-generational church. They always treated guest preachers, like myself, with incredible kindness, generosity and honor. I believe this is because they had come to love their pastor so deeply.” David Stokes, the mission strategist for Central Kentucky Network of Baptists and who has substituted for Taylor during his illness, said the pastor’s work was obvious. “He will be mourned and missed, but the fruit of his labor will continue to make an eternal difference and I believe he was greeted with the words, ‘Well done my faithful servant.’ Indeed, well done Pastor Darrell,” Stokes said. The church’s website and Facebook page are filled with accolades and tributes to the pastor. “Oh my heart is breaking at this news! He is truly one of the best people I have ever been blessed to know,” wrote Traci-Jo Mendez Campbell. “Bro. Taylor baptized me in Elkhorn Creek at Peaks Mill over 45 years ago,” wrote Lisa Carroll Starns. “I babysat his children many times. I am beyond sad to hear of his passing but know that he rejoices in heaven at this moment.” “I have never known a more gentle, honest, dedicated, loving and most of all Godly man,” said Brett Cool. “Brother Darrell taught me more about being a man and a Christian. He was a very bright light in this world.“ Funeral services were held this past weekend. Taylor is Scott County’s 39th death due to COVID and the third since the delta surge began in late July. WEDCO does not yet include Taylor in its Scott County statistics because he passed away in a Lexington hospital. The state conducts regular audits which will eventually update the local statistics.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:54 pm Lora Adkins, pictured, needed to be placed on a ventilator three separate times, and she was finally discharged from the hospital on June 25. Altogether, she spent 116 days in the hospital, with 73 of those days being on a ventilator. After nearly dying from COVID-19 and being hospitalized for more than 100 days, Lora Adkins, 39, of Robinson Creek, is sharing her harrowing experience to warn others about the risks that can come from the virus if people do not get vaccinated. Before the COVID-19 pandemic started, Lora was already considered immunosuppressed. Due to her Multiple Sclerosis, she took a medication that severely impacted her immune system, which made her immunosuppressed and high-risk for potentially suffering poorer effects from COVID-19. As cases surged in Pike County last winter, she, her husband Duran Adkins and their two children maintained a smaller circle of contacts in order to limit any exposure to the virus. Once their daughter, then 8 years old, became exposed to the virus and tested positive three days later, it did not take long for Lora, her husband and their other child to test positive as well. At the time, Lora and her husband were unvaccinated because they were not eligible for vaccinations yet. “With an 8 year-old, if she’s not feeling well, you’re not going to tell her to get away from you,” Lora said. “Momma’s gonna cuddle her. About three days after our daughter tested positive, my husband, my son and I all tested positive.” Lora tested positive for COVID-19 on Jan. 25, but she said she continued to work from home while she was in quarantine. However, on Feb. 7 — 12 days after she tested positive — Lora was admitted into Pikeville Medical Center. She spent a total of 116 days in the hospital between Feb. 7 and June 25, while being on a ventilator for 73 of those days, as she suffered from COVID-19 complications. Lonely and fearful time in hospitalization Lora said it is difficult for her to remember some of her hospitalization, due to her being sedated for most of that time. However, she said she remembers how lonely and fearful she felt while being hospitalized because her family could not come visit her for several months. “I don’t really remember the worst parts of it, and when you’re sedated like that, your brain tries to fill in gaps,” Lora said. “I would wake up, I would have been having a dream and I would think I was somewhere else. It was scary, especially when people you knew couldn’t come visit so you’re surrounded by strangers, and there’s nobody really there to talk you down from you not knowing what’s going on.” While on the ventilator, Lora received a breathing tube through her neck, blood transfusions, CRRT dialysis and ECMO, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, which pumps and oxygenates a patient’s blood outside the body. By the time she was on ECMO, she said, her odds of survival were slim. “One of my best friends is the chief hospitalist at PMC,” Lora said. “She told me that when I was put on ECMO — I was on ECMO for 13 days — because I asked her, ’At that point, what were the options?’ She said, ‘At that point, you either went on ECMO, or it was comfort care and you died.’ And I was 38.” Lora and her husband Duran have been together since 1997, and he said that she has always kept him on a “straight and narrow path.” However, when she was hospitalized, he said it was difficult and scary for him to watch her go through that. “Through all of this, for me, it was rough because I didn’t have that person I went to with my problems or that person, who I went to talk about anything, really,” he said. “I was brokenhearted in a lot of ways from this because I didn’t have her and I had to do this on my own.” Duran got to see her through the glass of her ICU unit on March 6, and he came inside to visit her temporarily on March 11 while she was sedated. Difficult decisions Duran said that he had to make difficult decisions in order to protect Lora throughout her hospitalization. One of those decisions came in early March when Lora was on ECMO and he was asked by the doctors if he wanted to visit her while she was in ECMO for a short period of time. Duran said he told the doctors that he did not want her to have any visitors at that time, including himself, in order to limit any risk of potential infection. While Lora was in the hospital, Duran said that he educated himself on the treatments she was receiving and the ones she could potentially receive so that he could make an informed decision for her. He also hardly slept because he wanted to be awake in the event that there were any developments with her treatments and her condition. Through it all, though, he said that he tried to stay faithful to God and stay positive for his friends, his family and his children. “You become a hollow person, just knowing that you’ve got to stay faithful to God and stay positive to keep people’s hopes up, keep people’s spirits up, stay there for her and stay strong for your kids,” Duran said. “That’s what you’ve got to do.” When the doctors planned to wake Lora up from anesthesia on the morning of April 23, they called Duran in order for him to be in the room to calm her down. As she woke up, he held her hand and he said that moment was indescribable. “When I walked in the room that morning, when I got to see her and touch her for the first time after that long period of time of not actually being able to touch her, it was awesome,” Duran said. “There’s no word to describe it. There’s no word to describe not seeing your wife, knowing the situation, knowing the problem she was having, knowing all the stuff that was going on, all of that, and not being able to be by her side.” Ventilation required multiple times Lora needed to be placed on a ventilator three times — Feb. 22-April 23, May 2-10 and June 17-21 — and she was finally discharged from the hospital on June 25. However, the long period of time she was on a ventilator left her body in a frail state. She said she needed help sitting up in her hospital bed, as well as standing and walking on her own. She needed to use a walker and do physical therapy for several months after being hospitalized, and she said she still suffers from some permanent damage to her muscles and her lungs after suffering from COVID-19 complications and COVID pneumonia. “I actually just stopped doing physical therapy a week ago,” Lora said. “I still have to wear a foot brace. I have foot drop because the tendon in my leg, where it wasn’t being moved for so long, it doesn’t work so I can’t lift my right foot up. … The pulmonologist said that my lungs will probably never be at 100 percent. I get out of breath really easily. I just stopped walking on a walker a couple weeks ago.” While being hospitalized, Lora missed several family moments, including her children’s birthdays, her own birthday and her 17th wedding anniversary, as well as Valentine’s Day and Easter. She said that realization was difficult for her. “It’s very hard to know that you’re missing milestones and, even beyond those milestones, to know that you’re just missing the day-to-day, it’s heart-wrenching,” Lora said.

If Congress approves the stimulus bill Wednesday and President Joe Biden signs it by March 14, the first direct deposits payments of up to $1,400 per person may start hitting bank accounts the week of March 22, based on prior relief plans. Paper checks may be sent out the week of March 29. Dependents are worth $1,400, too, meaning a family of four that fully qualifies will see a payout of $5,600. Meanwhile, the vaccine surplus expected to materialize in coming months eliminates one problem – supply – but accentuates a new one: demand. ""When we start to have more vaccine available, we\'re really going to be in bad shape because what we\'re going to see is a lot of people who don\'t want to get vaccinated,"" said Bernadette Boden-Albala, dean of the public health program at the University of California, Irvine.

J&J has agreed to deliver 20 million doses to the U.S. this month and 100 million by the end of June. ►Gov.
