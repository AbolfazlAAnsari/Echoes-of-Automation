says 36 people are now confirmed dead in the devastating wildfires that have decimated entire communities, including historic Lahaina. The death toll — up from six earlier in the day — makes the wildfires one of the deadliest disasters in Hawaii history and was announced Wednesday night as firefighters continued to battle flames and search for survivors. A county spokesperson said all of those who died were in Lahaina. Dramatic new ground-level footage shows heartbreaking devastation in Lahaina Earlier in the day, authorities announced Civil Air Patrol and state flyovers found at least 271 structures in the community were damaged or destroyed by the flames. Meanwhile, at least three large fires on Maui — including the blaze in Lahaina — are still active and out of control, which means a full picture of the devastation hasn’t yet come into view. Lahaina appears to be the hardest hit area and access to the area is still being blocked off. In addition to the fatalities, officials say dozens more are injured, some critically. And thousands are displaced, with hundreds flocking to emergency shelters and many more sleeping in their cars, including at a Walmart that opened its bathrooms to evacuees. “Tragedy that hits one of us is felt by all of us,” said Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen in a video update late Wednesday night. “These past few days, the resolve of our families, businesses and visitors have been tested like never before in our lifetime.” Given the scale of the disaster, Maui County’s emergency response is strained and Hawaii National Guard and federal resources are offering new aid. On Wednesday, President Biden offered his condolences to the families of those who lost loved ones and offered federal support. Hawaii has asked Biden for a presidential disaster declaration. The White House confirmed early Thursday morning that Biden has approved the disaster declaration for Hawaii, unlocking federal resources to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by the ongoing wildfires. In Lahaina on Wednesday, firefighters continued to battle the flames as first responders and residents picked through the rubble and searched for survivors. Lahaina resident said his home was burned down, but he stayed in the town to help. “We’re gonna do our best to get past this and it’s gonna be tough,” he said. “It’s going to take years to fix. This is not even the worst of it.” He added, “We’ve still got dead bodies floating on the seawall. They’ve been sitting there since last night. We’ve been pulling people out since last night, trying to save peoples’ lives.” Others also recounted similar stories, and the Coast Guard asked boaters in the area to be on the lookout for anyone else in the waters off Lahaina — where people jumped to avoid the flames. A post shared by Hawaii News Now (@hawaiinewsnow) Acting Gov. Sylvia Luke, who announced Tuesday night that the Hawaii National Guard had been activated, said it could take months to assess the full scope of the damage from the fires. “This is the entire state coming together to assist our family on Maui,” she said, at a news conference Wednesday. “We never anticipated a hurricane that did not make impact would cause this type of wildfires. Wildfires that wiped out communities. Wildfires that wiped out businesses.” Want to help those devastated by the Maui wildfires? Here’s how The wildfires on Maui started burning early Tuesday, but continued throughout the day and spread with a frightening speed. Eyewitnesses described an apocalyptic scene in Lahaina town, where residents were forced to jump into the harbor waters to avoid fast-moving flames from a massive brush fire that’s destroyed much of the historic area — and continues to burn. Some survivors said they had only minutes to get to safety. Residents say an overwhelmed fire force — fighting flames all day amid powerful winds — could do little as flames ripped through the historic community, destroying dozens of homes and businesses in one of the worst natural disasters in Hawaii’s history. Richard Olsten, a helicopter pilot who flew over Lahaina town on Wednesday morning, said much of the historic town appears gone. “It’s like an area was bombed. It’s like a war zone,” he said. Luke confirmed Tuesday night that the Hawaii National Guard had been activated to help respond to the sprawling fire crisis. Authorities said in addition to personnel, aircraft were being deployed. An emergency proclamation remains in effect as Luke and others Hawaii leaders are encouraging those with Maui travel plans to postpone or cancel altogether. Honolulu Emergency Medical Services Director Dr. Jim Ireland confirmed to HNN that eight patients had been transferred from Maui to Oahu, including three who are in critical condition. “It’s been very heartbreaking for all of us and frustrating because if we weren’t an island we would drive over and help them from Honolulu,” Ireland said. A post shared by Hawaii News Now (@hawaiinewsnow) Perhaps one of the most harrowing details of the ongoing disaster emerged Tuesday night as evacuees recounted stories of being forced to jump into Lahaina’s water to flee the flames. Subsequent social media posts showed a terrifying wall of flames descending on famous Front Street in Lahaina and destroying everything in its path. One heart-stopping video posted by fleeing residents shows uncontrolled flames in all directions. Lahaina resident Tiare Lawrence compared the scene to something out of the apocalypse, with people running for their lives. “It’s just so hard. I’m currently Upcountry and just knowing I can’t get a hold of any of my family members. I still don’t know where my little brother is. I don’t know where my stepdad is,” she said. “Everyone I know in Lahaina, their homes have burned down.” Thankfully, in an update on Thursday, Lawrence said she has been reunited with her loved ones. Front Street business owner Alan Dickar says he watched business after business in the historic district going up in flames.

There were no fire trucks at that point; I think the fire department was overwhelmed,” Dickar said. “That is the most important business street on Maui.” The brush fire in Lahaina is one of at least seven sizable wildfires that firefighters were battling statewide Tuesday amid treacherous conditions — powerful winds, low humidity and dry brush The winds — fueled by Hurricane Dora as it passes south of the state — topped 55 mph in many spots, with gusts to 70 to 80 mph. In addition to wildfires, first responders are grappling with downed trees and damaged structures. Also on Maui, thousands remain without power. And while the Lahaina fire appears to have wrought the most devastation, widespread damage is also being reported in Kihei and Kula, where evacuations also remain in place.

Steve Sadow, Trump’s lead Georgia attorney, had previewed such an argument at a recent court hearing. On Monday, Sadow filed court papers insisting that the allegations involved “core political speech,” telling the judge the indictment must be dismissed ahead of trial. “The First Amendment, in affording the broadest protection to political speech and discussion regarding governmental affairs, not only embraces but encourages exactly the kind of behavior under attack in this Indictment,” wrote Sadow and Jennifer Little, Trump’s other Georgia attorney. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis (D) charged Trump and 18 others with joining a criminal enterprise bent on keeping Trump in the White House after he lost the 2020 election. Four of Trump’s co-defendants have since accepted plea deals, while Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty and deny wrongdoing. “The Fulton County prosecutors have not identified any non-speech or non-advocacy conduct in the allegations against President Trump,” Trump’s attorneys wrote in the new filing. “An examination of the indictment reveals why: none of the allegations relate to any non-speech or nonadvocacy conduct,” they continued. “Every charge and overt act alleged against President Trump rests on core acts of political speech and advocacy that lie at the heart of the First Amendment.” The indictment is one of four criminal cases the former president faces as he campaigns to return to the White House. Trump has made similar First Amendment arguments in his federal case charging him over alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election. A federal district judge rejected the assertion, and Trump is now appealing. In the Georgia case, the First Amendment argument is one of multiple expected pretrial defenses from Trump. Sadow at the recent hearing said Trump would also be filing a motion to dismiss the charges based on presidential immunity. Trump’s pretrial motion deadline is not until next month.

Please enter a search term. by: Olafimihan Oshin, The Hill Posted: Dec 11, 2023 / 09:44 PM CST Updated: Dec 11, 2023 / 09:51 PM CST by: Olafimihan Oshin, The Hill Posted: Dec 11, 2023 / 09:44 PM CST Updated: Dec 11, 2023 / 09:51 PM CST (The Hill) — The Texas Supreme Court has ruled against a lower court order allowing an abortion for a pregnant woman whose fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition. In a seven-page ruling on Monday, the state Supreme Court said that \u200b\u200bTravis County District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble’s decision to issue a temporary restraining order last week to allow Kate Cox to have the abortion was a mistake. Gamble’s decision on Cox’s medical emergency was put on hold by Texas state Attorney General Ken Paxton (R), who asked the state Supreme Court to intervene in the matter. The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the lower court’s ruling on Friday. “A woman who meets the medical-necessity exception need not seek a court order to obtain an abortion,” the court ruling says. “Under the law, it is a doctor who must decide that a woman is suffering from a life-threatening condition during a pregnancy, raising the necessity for an abortion to save her life or to prevent impairment of a major bodily function.” “The law leaves to physicians—not judges—both the discretion and the responsibility to exercise their reasonable medical judgment, given the unique facts and circumstances of each patient.” The court also found that Cox’s doctor – Damla Karsan – “asked a court to pre-authorize the abortion yet she could not, or at least did not, attest to the court that Ms. Cox’s condition poses the risks the exception requires.” “These laws reflect the policy choice that the Legislature has made, and the courts must respect that choice,” the court said in its ruling. According to state law, a doctor who performed an abortion procedure could be sentenced to life in prison. The decision comes as Cox, 31, has fled the state to get an abortion procedure amid the legal whiplash involving her case. Nancy Northup, the president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which has been representing Cox, told The Hill about their client’s departure from the state, noting Cox has been to the emergency room four times during her 20-week pregnancy. “Kate’s case has shown the world that abortion bans are dangerous for pregnant people, and exceptions don’t work,” Northup said in a statement. “She desperately wanted to be able to get care where she lives and recover at home surrounded by family. While Kate had the ability to leave the state, most people do not, and a situation like this could be a death sentence.” Cox, a mother of two children, sought an abortion after discovering her fetus was diagnosed with Trisomy 18, a chromosomal anomaly that leads to miscarriage, stillbirth or the death of the infant within hours, days or weeks after birth. Her carrying the pregnancy to term would’ve jeopardized fertility in the future, as she and her husband noted that they wanted to have more children. Cox’s case is the first time a pregnant woman has sought a court order to get an abortion procedure since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year. Texas and other GOP-led states have either implemented or enacted their own abortion bans and restrictions when Roe was overturned. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.
