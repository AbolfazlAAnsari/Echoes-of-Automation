Tickets go on sale 10am January 19 via LiveNation.com. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzV74N7aV04 International superstar Lionel Richie boasts a discography of albums and singles second to none. With over 125 million albums sold worldwide, an Oscar®, Golden Globe®, and four Grammy Awards®*, Richie has been honored with distinctions including 2016 MusicCares Person of the Year, 2017 Kennedy Center Honors, and the 2022 Gershwin Prize for Popular Song by the Library of Congress. In 2022, he was both inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and received the 2022 American Music Awards Icon Award, his 18th AMA award. The legendary singer, songwriter, producer, and Tuskegee, Alabama native is a true music icon. Richie is known for his mega hits such as “Endless Love,” “Lady,” “Truly,” “All Night Long,” “Penny Lover,” “Stuck on You,” “Hello,” “Say You, Say Me,” and “Dancing on the Ceiling.” He co-wrote the 1985 song “We Are the World,” recorded by the history-making supergroup USA for Africa. Richie’s song catalog also includes his early work with The Commodores, where he developed a groundbreaking style that defied genre, penning smashes such as “Three Times a Lady,” “Still,” and “Easy.” Richie is one of only two solo songwriters who has written eight number one hits that made the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Earth, Wind & Fire are a music institution. In 1969, music legend Maurice White birthed the music force named after the elements from his own astrological charts.

They’ve released 23 albums; eight went Double Platinum and hit the Top 10, making them one of the best-selling artists of all time. They’ve won an impressive nine GRAMMY® Awards including one for Lifetime Achievement (2012). In 2000, Earth, Wind & Fire was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, cementing their lasting impact on popular music and, in 2019, their contributions to arts and culture were acknowledged with Kennedy Center Honors.

Mike DeWine vetoed a measure Friday that would have banned gender-affirming care for minors, casting the action out of step with many in his own party as thoughtful, limited and “pro-life.” He simultaneously announced plans to move to administratively ban transgender surgeries until a person is 18, and to position the state to better regulate and track gender-affirming treatments in both children and adults. At a news conference, DeWine said he hoped the hybrid approach could win the support of legislative Republicans — who immediately signaled they’re considering a veto override — as well as serve as a national model to states, as gender-affirming care restrictions enacted across the country in recent years face lawsuits. The vetoed bill also would have banned transgender athletes’ participation in girls’ and women’s sports. DeWine said he listened to people on both sides of the legislation who all “sincerely and truly believe their position best protects children,” ultimately deciding he could not support legislation that bans healthcare so many patients, families and doctors told him is saving lives. “Ultimately, these tough, tough decisions should not be made by the government. They should not be made by the state of Ohio,” DeWine said. “They should be made by the people who love these kids the most, and that’s the parents. The parents who have raised that child, the parents who have seen that child go through agony, the parents who worry about that child every single day of their life.” The governor’s veto drew swift rebukes Friday from supporters of gender-affirming care bans, both in the state and nationally. Republican Bernie Moreno, a Trump-endorsed candidate for U.S. Senate, and Center for Christian Virtue President Aaron Baer both called on the Legislature to override his veto. “Mike DeWine has failed Ohio, and it’s our children who are going to pay the price,” Baer said in a statement. Terry Schilling, president of the conservative American Principles Project, said in a statement that DeWine had succumbed to “egregious lies” being perpetuated about transgender care. He said history would remember that DeWine “gave into cowardice and caved to the transgender industry that is preying on so many vulnerable individuals.” The conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom called DeWine’s veto a betrayal. Republican state Rep. Gary Click, the bill’s sponsor, stopped short of supporting a veto override. He commended DeWine for trying to wrap his mind around a complex problem in a short amount of time, while defending his own years of research on the bill. Click said he was particularly disappointed that the ban on transgender girls playing sports could be sidelined if non-legislative solutions were pursued on gender-affirming care. Republican Senate President Matt Huffman and GOP Ohio House Speaker Jason Stephens both expressed disappointment, defending lawmakers’ extensive work on the legislation. Stephens said his chamber is weighing its options with regard to beginning the veto override process. House Democrats said the legislation was based on hate and DeWine’s veto supported “fundamental freedom” and parental rights. Senate Democratic Leader Nickie Antonio, the first openly gay person to serve in the Ohio General Assembly, said her party would continue its fight “until all may enjoy the freedom to live their authentic lives without government interference.” The Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ+ rights organization, and the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Ohio chapter also lauded the veto as a positive for some of the state’s most vulnerable youth. It was a moment of relief for Alicia and Aaron Burkle, parents from Cleveland to Astrid, a 10-year-old transgender girl. The family had been looking into options — even considering leaving Ohio — if gender-affirming care was banned. Since the legislation reached his desk, they, along with their friends and family, have been calling and emailing their concerns. “It’s just been constant action,” Alicia Burkle said. “So to just sit down and listen to his message and hear that he actually listens to families like ours and heard our stories — it actually sounded like he listened.” It’s not a complete win, though, Aaron Burkle said: “We’re breathing a sigh of relief today, but there’s already been a lot of damage done to our community, to families like ours. And we know that this issue is not yet completely resolved.” The vetoed bill would have prohibited Ohio minors from receiving gender reassignment surgery, but also from taking puberty blockers or undergoing other hormone therapies. It would have allowed those already undergoing treatments to continue, however. DeWine directed state agencies to begin the rule-making process to: restrict gender-affirming surgeries to adults only, to set up a system for tracking the gender-affirming treatments both minor and adult Ohioans are undergoing; and to prevent “pop-up clinics or fly-by-night operations” from deceptive practices surrounding gender-affirming care. The governor said a small number of Ohio children would have been affected by the bill, “but for those children who face gender dysphoria, and for their families, the consequences of this bill could not be more profound.” He said he could think of no example where state law overrules the medical decisions of not only parents, but also the medical judgment of a child’s treating physician and medical team. DeWine said he does not see that position as inconsistent with his opposition to November’s Issue 1, a successful abortion rights amendment whose backers similarly argued that government has no place in individuals’ personal reproductive decisions. “On the abortion issue, I believe that’s a question of life and protecting human life,” the governor said. “I believe, ultimately, my decision here was ultimately made about protecting life, and that is the lives of these children.” 1 day ago in Entertainment Thirty years later, Nicole\'s three sisters want her remembered for more than those static images or the violent way she died.

And they want their fellow lawmakers in the Ohio Legislature to do something to reduce it by passing some gun safety bills they have proposed. But the bills are a long shot in the Republican-dominated legislature. Sens. L-R- Sen Hearcel Craig (D-Columbus), Minority Leader Nickie Antonio (D-Lakewood) and Vernon Sykes (D-Akron) speak to reporters at the Ohio Statehouse about gun violence. [Jo Ingles | Statehouse News Bureau]For Sen. Hearcel Craig (D-Columbus), this issue is personal. “I live on the south side of Columbus and almost every day I hear gunfire near my home,” Craig said. Craig, along with Sen. Vernon Sykes (D-Akron) and Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio (D-Lakewood), said gun violence is out of control. “I want you to think just a minute. That’s our children. That’s a father. That’s a niece, nephew,” Craig said. SB 187– would harmonize Ohio law with federal law when it comes to prohibiting domestic abusers from having access to guns SB 188 – would provide gun owners with the option to store their firearms outside the home with regulated gun dealers or shooting range owners SB 189 – would give a non-refundable income tax credit of up to $250 per person per year to cover the cost of handgun safety training, safe storage or locking devices. Republicans have supermajorities in both chambers of the legislature. And in recent years, they have passed bills that give more rights to gun owners and loosen regulations on firearms. The Democrats stress these three bills are bipartisan and were developed after talking to stakeholders, including the National Rifle Association, Buckeye Firearms, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, the Ohio Mayors Alliance and local government leaders, as well as leaders in the alcohol, drug abuse and mental health arenas. “We want to do something. We want to get past ‘stop.’ And this is not a ban on assault weapons or any other controversial issue dealing with guns,” Sykes said. But John Fortney, a spokesman for Senate President Matt Huffman (R-Lima), took issue with the legislation. “Unfortunately, Democrats continue to focus on restricting the second amendment rights of law-abiding Ohioans instead of focusing on the real problem of prosecuting violent crime and keeping offenders in prison,” Fortney said in a statement. Fortney added, “Criminals don’t consult the Ohio Revised Code before committing crimes.” Antonio said she knows it’s a challenge to pass bills restricting guns in this political climate. But she said that’s not enough of a reason to stop trying, especially legislation like this that has more widespread support. “These impossible kinds or pieces of legislation are only impossible until we pass them and then, suddenly we find out, suddenly, maybe 25 years, however long it takes, that indeed it was the right time. It was possible. If we don’t introduce this legislation, we will never know that this time is the right time,” Antonio said. The three bills have been assigned to committees but none has received a hearing.'}]"
