Other families across Oregon are also questioning why their loved ones are being counted as COVID-19 deaths, including the family of a 26-year-old Oregon man who was listed as a COVID-19 death but tested negative for the virus. RELATED: A 26-year-old Oregon man died after testing negative for COVID-19. Now his family wants answers According to the Oregon Health Authority (OHA), there is no difference when it comes to tracking and reporting COVID deaths. OHA spokesman Jonathan Modie explained in an email how the state determines what is counted as a COVID-19 death: We consider COVID-19 deaths to be: Deaths in which a patient hospitalized for any reason within 14 days of a positive COVID-19 test result dies in the hospital or within the 60 days following discharge. Deaths in which COVID-19 is listed as a primary or contributing cause of death on a death certificate. We count COVID-19 deaths this way because the virus can often have effects on an individual’s health that may complicate their recovery from other diseases and conditions, even injuries, and indirectly contribute to their death. Another reason is because OHA is using this data to track the spread of the disease, and to create actionable steps for stopping its spread. So what does that policy mean in practice? We asked Modie about a hypothetical case where someone died from a motorcycle crash and also had COVID-19. Would that be counted as a COVID-19 death? “It would be,” Modie explained. “But I must go back to the point about how we used this data, which is to help us track how COVID-19 is spread in the community.” He added that the state follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for reporting deaths. Epidemiologists like Dr. Carlos Crespo with the PSU/OHSU School of Medicine said, with the exception of a crash or gunshot wound, this is not a misleading way to report data because COVID-19 does exacerbate other health problems. “So, all of these chronic diseases that normally you might not die from, but the fact that you contracted COVID-19 put you over the edge,” said Dr. Crespo. Dr. Payal Kohli, KGW’s medical expert, agrees. She explained a principle in medicine that states the simplest explanation is most likely the correct one. “So, if you want to be very conservative, then the right thing to do is anyone who tests positive for COVID and died, gets hospitalized, or has a bad outcome, you want to say that's from COVID,” said Dr. Kohli. Dr. Kohli also pointed out the downside of tracking and reporting deaths this way. She said ultimately you’re not counting deaths as accurately as you could be. That could bolster to the theory that hospitals and facilities are doing this for financial gain. “A lot of people are saying that hospitals may be doing this in a cynical fashion to try to get more money because they're being reimbursed according to how many COVID deaths we have. But I think in totality, we are underestimating the number of COVID deaths,” Dr. Kohli said. “The CDC has said that for every one case that we've diagnosed, there's likely ten out there that we haven't diagnosed,” said Dr. Kohli. The Oregon Health Authority does not receive federal funds based on COVID-19 deaths. Some facilities may receive some money based on Medicare reimbursement but it’s important to note Oregon has had less than 400 deaths since March. That’s far less than the hundreds of deaths per day reported by states like Florida, so the financial incentive theory isn’t as relevant in Oregon.

An Oregon state trooper is on leave as Oregon State Police investigate a situation that played out at a Corvallis coffee shop. Allan’s Coffee & Tea says four troopers refused to put on a face mask and were seen on surveillance without masks on. The incident happened on the first day of the governor’s statewide mask mandate and has gained the attention of the OSP superintendent, the governor, and the community. In the surveillance video provided by the Oregonian, on July 1 at Allan’s Coffee & Tea, you can see an OSP trooper walk in without a face mask. Then you eventually see three more OSP troopers also walk in without face masks. Allan’s Coffee & Tea says the troopers all refused to wear one, and the coffee shop says one officer even used a profanity to ridicule Gov. Kate Brown’s face mask order. In a statement from Allan’s Coffee & Tea, owners Robert and Kathryn Morgan said in part: The four Oregon State Police Officers put our small business in a terrible position yesterday by openly defying the orders which we as a business are responsible for upholding. I will state clearly that this issue should have never become a political or divisive issue. Very simply we as a small business were choosing to follow the health and safety guidelines of the CDC and the majority of the medical community as well as complying with a state order issued by our Governor. Unfortunately, the State Police made it exceedingly difficult for us to do that. OSP Superintendent Travis Hampton also released a statement, saying in part: Not only are police officers expected to comply with the Governor’s emergency declaration orders, I expect them to set the example for Oregon’s residents as we strive to fight this invisible enemy - the Coronavirus. This conduct is embarrassing and indefensible, especially in the wake of thousands of Oregonians taking to the streets each day to rightfully demand police accountability. Like any police misconduct, the actions of a few bring discredit to the scores of dedicated officers that do not believe they are above the law they are sworn to uphold. Let me be clear, Oregon State Police Troopers are not above the law and this conduct is being immediately addressed. FOX 12 also spoke to community members about the incident. “I think it’s very disrespectful to the public and to the governor to all of us,” Trish Lunceford, a Corvallis resident, said. “They should be setting a good example.” “It’s very disappointing to say the least that some police officers would refuse to wear a face mask,” Ron Wrolstad, another Corvallis resident, said. Gov. Brown said on Thursday that the actions of the troopers are inexcusable and no one is above the law. OSP has not released the names of the troopers involved. OSP confirms the first officer seen in the video is on paid administrative leave during its investigation. Copyright 2022 KPTV-KPDX. All rights reserved.'}]"
