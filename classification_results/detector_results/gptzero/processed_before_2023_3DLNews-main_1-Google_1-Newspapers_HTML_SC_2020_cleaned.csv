Finklea After 12 long years, Douglas Pernell won Dillon County Sheriff on Tuesday, November 3, to become the first African-American in Dillon County to win a countywide office. Pernell convincingly won the election with more than 1,600 votes over Tracy Pelt, who finished second in the race. Pernell had 7,213 votes; Pelt had 5,545 votes; and Phil Davis had 334 votes. When it was apparent that Pernell was the winner, he went outside of the Dillon County Voter Registration Office, where several people were gathered waiting for the results, and announced that he was the next Sheriff of Dillon County. Loud cheering ensued, and Pernell made a speech, which can be seen on The Dillon Herald’s page on Facebook®. He also made a speech at his victory party at South of the Border Convention Center, which will also be available to watch on The Dillon Herald’s page in a reader-submitted video. Pernell thanked everyone for the support they have shown over the years. He said it had been a “long, hard battle.” Then someone yelled from the crowd “but a change has come.” Pernell said he would be a Sheriff for all people. He said that the Sheriff’s Office would not harass anyone, but “we will do our jobs.” Pernell said he was the first African-American ever to win a countywide elected office in Dillon County. He said his hope is that we can all come together and quit fighting each other. He said when he takes office in January he hopes to bring the community together. He said he will be a Sheriff for everyone including those who supported him and those who did not. In his speech at South of the Border Convention Center, Pernell encouraged the young people that if they have a dream that they should not let anyone talk them out of that dream. He said his office will work to make Dillon County a safe place again, but they will need the citizens’ help to do this and if they see something or know something, they must say something. Pernell said when he takes office his administration will be going out into the community and will be reaching out to the citizens. He said we must all work together. He said it will take dedication and understanding and that the Sheriff’s Office will be there to “protect and serve.” He thanked his opponents on the campaign they ran and said he hoped to meet with them and talk. Pernell said if everyone works together that we can make Dillon County a great place to live. Pernell said he will fight for the citizens of Dillon County each and every day while he is in office. In the other contested local race, Christopher Miller won over Marvin Suggs. Miller had 1,131 votes to Suggs’ 797 votes. There were three write-ins. Both questions regarding Sunday Alcohol Sales in the City of Dillon passed. Several wins were confirmed in various races where there was no other opponent including Clerk of Court: Gwen T. Hyatt; Coroner: Donnie Grimsley; County Council District One: Jamal Campbell; County Council District Three: Detrice McCollum-Dawkins, who also made history herself as the first elected African-American Dillon County Councilwoman; County Council District Four: T.F. “Buzzy” Finklea; State Senate District 28: Greg Hembree; State Senate District 30: Kent Williams; State House of Representatives District 55: Jackie Hayes; State House District 57: Lucas Atkinson; and Solicitor Circuit 4: Will Rogers. Donald Trump, Jaime Harrison, and Tom Rice all won in Dillon County. Lindsey Graham and Tom Rice both retained their seats statewide in these races.

The law requires state-supported universities to provide instruction in the essentials of various American founding documents and “the study of and devotion to American institutions and ideals.” An exam covering the provisions and principles of these documents will also be administered. Lander ensured two of its three-credit courses, HIST 111 and POLS 101, meet the state’s requirement by providing the correct type of content and exam. “Our nation and state are founded on the principles of democracy, and an understanding of these principles as provided in our founding documents is a vital foundation for citizenship,” Scott Jones, Lander University’s provost and executive vice president for academic affairs, said. Lander joins Coastal Carolina, Francis Marion University and The Citadel as one of four state-supported schools that comply with the law. South Carolina law has required public colleges to mandate the founding document courses for 96 years. Contact reporter Jonathan Limehouse at 864-943-5644 or follow him on Twitter @jon_limehouse.

than 102 pounds of marijuana and seized more than $300,000 from cars this week during an operation that targets traffickers along Interstates 85 and 26. Sheriff Chuck Wright gave results of this year’s Operation Rolling Thunder crackdown during a news conference Friday at USC Upstate. In total, 45 officers from 15 local law enforcement agencies pulled over 1,275 motorists for minor violations ranging from speeding, following too closely, improper lane changing, failing to dim headlights and more. The traffic stops resulted in 28 arrests, according to data provided by the sheriff’s office. “We had a very successful week of Rolling Thunder,” Wright told reporters Friday. “We’ve been doing this ever since I was elected sheriff, and this is a good way to keep people from other states driving through and dropping off drugs, stolen weapons, and all kinds of stuff that we simply don’t need in our neighborhoods.” Inside Look: How SC cops swarm I-85 and I-26, looking for \'bad guys\' He said this operation “makes Spartanburg County a better place to travel through, a better place to live, a better place to work and do business in.” He added, “I will go after this nonsense. As long as the good people of Spartanburg County put me as the Sheriff, I’m going to go after drug dealers. I’m going to get after people who don’t care about nobody but themselves.” A Greenville News investigation earlier this year found that the Spartanburg County Sheriff’s Office seized nearly $3.5 million from 2014-16 — more money than any other agency in the state. They also confiscated 21 vehicles, 19 guns and other property, including a $50,000 Aximum watch, over the same time period. South Carolina law allows police officers to take money and other possessions under civil forfeiture, even if the owners aren’t charged with a crime. That money is then used by police agencies to purchase new technology or vehicles. The intent is to give law enforcement a tool to use against nefarious organizations by grabbing the fruits of their illegal deeds and using the proceeds to fight more crime. Many people never get their money back, or they have to fight to have their property returned and incur high attorney fees, the Greenville News investigation found. Operation Rolling Thunder has its share of critics. Many of the people are pulled over for ""questionable"" infractions, such as following too closely or improper passing, Beattie Ashmore, a Greenville defense attorney, told The Greenville News. “They’re not doing it (Operation Rolling Thunder) because they want to help law enforcement,” Ashmore said. “It is a money grab.” During Operation Rolling Thunder this year, the sheriff’s office seized $319,595. In the back of a ballroom on the campus of USC Upstate, the site of the news conference, bags of cash were on display, along with guns and large amounts of marijuana and other drugs, including Methamphetamines, Ecstasy and more. Wright said Friday he’d let the court decide if the sheriff’s office can keep the money it collected through this operation. “We will go through the court proceedings to see if we can keep it,” Wright said. “If we can’t, we will do the right thing and give it back.” “I am very, very proud of how the men and women of Spartanburg County support this operation,” Wright said. “Not only do they get drugs and bad guys and bad people off our streets, but they also slow traffic down on I-85. This is a good thing.” This is a developing story. Check back for updates. Contact Dustin at dwyatt@gannett.com or on Twitter @HJDustin_Wyatt'}]"

It is general because it is difficult to talk about a community without joining a community. The topics we will discuss now are based on personal notes, comments, stereotypes, and opinions about China, Japanese, and foreigners. So, do not get angry. Political history is a good starting point or starting point for incorporating differences and similarities: the Chinese revolution greatly influenced the role of Chinese women in society. Legally, they have the same status as men at all times, which is very important. On the other hand, Japan quickly became an industrial power, which is why Japanese women have lived among the most important powers in Asia for decades. They are friendly and calm and appear a little bit shy, but it is enough to live a little in the country to find very active activists, politicians, artists, and street women, still silent. Japanese girls generally marry boys of the same age after college, work together, have few children, and work hard. This pair is very important, so does the work. Although there is a mixed marriage, this is not the most common marriage. Foreigners may be curious, but few people choose to marry Chinese vs Japanese women. The opposite is true in China. Many people say that if a Chinese woman is likely to marry a foreigner, this is what she will wear. They have a closer relationship with their in-laws, and the mother continues to gain weight in marriage. Today, there is a lot of consumerism, and there is no news indicating that more Chinese girls are choosing to marry older men in better economic circumstances than marriage at the same age. Her parents firmly insisted on money and financial security. Here, I make personal notes because I have a Chinese friend: an older sister who is married to an electronics technician and does not like anything because she does not have money or does not have enough money. Another sister married an American company director, and they were not married. No matter what they say, the Chinese are very interested in money. Can we spot the difference between Chinese and Japanese girls? I invite you to laugh together and think together: In general, it must be said that these two women are fighters. They know how to feed their families. Historically, they lived in difficult times of war and famine. They saw their men go out to fight instead of returning or being lost. They have been unemployed for a long time. Even today, all women in the world have faced this situation. They do not realize that this means having a dual job in a family and a professional.
