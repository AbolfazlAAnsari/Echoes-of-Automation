The five videos total about seven minutes of footage, and the crew was shooting for two weeks before production was shut down. The inside look into the filming of the tragic movie comes as special prosecutors in New Mexico will convene a grand jury Thursday to consider recharging Baldwin with involuntary manslaughter. The videos are among dozens that special prosecutors requested from Rust Movie Productions LLC in the spring and didn’t receive until October, according to a source familiar with the matter. NBC News has not reviewed the rest of the videos. Prosecutors announced their intention to re-charge Baldwin with involuntary manslaughter on Oct. 17. It isn’t clear how much of the footage prosecutors reviewed or whether they reviewed any of the five videos. NBC News asked Kari Morrissey — one of two lead special prosecutors on the case with Jason Lewis — which footage her team reviewed, whether any of the footage was involved in charging decisions and what video would be presented to the grand jury.

draws to a close, GBH\'s Morning Edition is calling up journalists from all around our newsroom to get updates on some of the most impactful stories we\'ve covered this year. Keep tuning in for updates. Alternatives to X and government oversight of social platforms are stories to follow in 2024. Paris Alston: This is GBH\'s Morning Edition. As we wrap up the year 2023, we\'re taking a look back at some of the biggest stories from this year, including those in the ever changing world of social media. My co-host, Jeremy Siegel, spoke with GBH\'s social media strategist, Zack Waldman, to get his take on the biggest trends of the year. Jeremy Siegel: Three stories. What is your number one? Zack Waldman: Okay. So we\'re going to start with the soap opera that was Twitter-slash-X, X-slash-Twitter, and Elon Musk. I think that\'s got to be the — Siegel: It\'s got to be number one. Before we go any further, I have to ask, do you call it X at this point? Are you still on Twitter? Waldman: I default to Twitter and tweets, out a habit of more than anything else. Siegel: I\'m about the same. So what exactly happened here? Waldman: Ooh, how much time do we have? You know, since Elon Musk took over Twitter last year and bought the company, it\'s just been a laundry list of head scratching moves for the platform. We could start with the whole overhaul of the verification subscription program, which basically said that for $8 a month, people could purchase the blue checkmark, rendering it pretty, in my opinion, irrelevant and obsolete. There was the institution of rate limits for unverified users where they would be put in timeout if they were on the platform for too long. And then there was the big one, which is really the rebranding of Twitter to X, which kind of happened on a whim out of left field by Elon himself. I think the latest thing that happened, which was super problematic that led to another exodus from the platform was when Musk kind of in many ways endorsed antisemitic conspiracy theories and rhetoric from users on the platform and then went on a tirade bashing advertisers for quietly quitting. It\'s just been 12 months of kind of a disaster, kind of a dumpster fire, for X-Twitter, Twitter-X. Siegel: It\'s hard to imagine anything in the world of social media as momentous as what has happened with Twitter or X. But what\'s your second number two story in the world of social media? Waldman: It\'s kind of very closely tied to what\'s gone on with X, which is kind of the emergence of both new and old alternatives to Twitter, to Twitter 2.0s, If you will. I\'ll go through just a few: Mastodon BlueSky, Spill, Post, Pebble, which is actually now no longer. But the headliner really has been Threads. I would say that is the number one alternative, quote unquote, to Twitter. It did reach 100 million users in its first week after it opened up on app stores. It is spearheaded by Meta and has kind of the cachet of Mark Zuckerberg. And we\'ll kind of see in 2024: can it take over what Twitter became in its heyday, reach that critical mass and become a in vogue platform for everyday users, for media organizations, for brands, for journalists, for newsrooms? The jury\'s still out, but I think that\'s a huge story to follow in 2024. Siegel: Before I let you go, what else have you been following in social media this year? Waldman: Yeah, so I would say just in general, government oversight over a number of social media platforms. We\'ve got a few lawsuits that have either already taken place or are ongoing. You look at TikTok and Montana became the first state to outright ban TikTok for all users. However, that has been put on hold by a federal judge. There are about 70% of states that have already banned TikTok for any folks who use a government-issued phone. And then separately, a lawsuit against Meta from 40-plus state attorneys general who have all come together and are suing Meta for deliberately designing addictive platform features that potentially harm children and underage users. We\'ll see where that goes. One of the attorneys general that\'s involved there is Andrea Campbell from Massachusetts. So just across the board, more oversight, more control, more measures in place to figure out ways to combat the addictiveness and the harms that exist on these platforms. Alston: That was my co-host, Jeremy Siegel, speaking with GBH, a social media strategist, Zack Waldman. You\'re listening to GBH\'s Morning Edition. It was a chaotic year for social media users: First, the company formerly known as Twitter — now formally X — seemed to be in constant upheaval. Other companies, from upstarts to social media giant Meta, tried their hand at gaining some of the market share Twitter lost. “Since Elon Musk took over Twitter last year and bought the company, it\'s just been a laundry list of head-scratching moves for the platform,” said GBH\'s social media strategist, Zack Waldman. Despite the long list of competitors, no one platform has emerged as the space Twitter once was, he said. Another story he’s kept a close eye on, he said, are attempts at government oversight of social media platforms. “About 70% of states that have already banned TikTok for any folks who use a government-issued phone,” he said. “And then separately, a lawsuit against Meta from 40-plus state attorneys general who have all come together and are suing Meta for deliberately designing addictive platform features that potentially harm children and underage users. We\'ll see where that goes.” A worker shortage and a tragedy both stressed the need for more support in New England\'s disability communities. Paris Alston: Hey, Meghan, Thanks for being here. Meghan Smith: Hi, Paris. Alston: So what\'s been the biggest story you\'ve been watching this year? Smith: Yeah. So I covered the fight to increase pay for personal care attendants, which is a MassHealth program that helps people with disabilities with daily activities like getting out of bed, showering and food prep. And a big problem that I heard about was that the low wages for those workers made it difficult for so many people to find and keep PCAs, which meant a lot of people were just left without support.

And the governor, when she spoke about this, called the deal historic. And she said that it was really a show of support for the ""heroic work that PCAs do."" And I think it\'s a bigger story about just a shortage of services for home health care workers that was really highlighted during the pandemic. Alston: And a service that so many people rely on for the things that they need throughout the day. And we know that so much of disability rights comes from the advocacy, right? The people who push for these policies to change. And I know that this year we lost someone who was really instrumental in doing that. Smith: Exactly. In March, Judy Heumann passed away at age 75. A lot of people called her the mother of the disability rights movement, and she was really considered a civil rights hero to a lot of people that were inspired by her. And when she was born, you know, when you think about it, the Americans With Disabilities Act had not been passed yet. So people with disabilities like her were still excluded from so many parts of public life. And she spent years as an advocate. She led protests, sit ins at federal buildings, and she really pushed disability rights to the forefront of national politics, which had not really been there before. And that activism eventually led to the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990. And so many advocates I have gotten to know here in the Boston area really credit her as their inspiration and kind of guiding light for their own work. Alston: So lastly, Meghan, we do have to talk about something that hits pretty close to home: the tragedy of the Lewiston, Maine, mass shooting that happened this October. But you have been looking at some of the aftermath of that and how people who have disabilities were affected by that. Smith: Right.
