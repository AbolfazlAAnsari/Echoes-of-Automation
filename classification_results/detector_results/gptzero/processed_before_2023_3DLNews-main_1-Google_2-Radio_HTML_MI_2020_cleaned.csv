God is already there.” No one expected we would ever experience days like the ones we are living in now. For many, the unknown of what tomorrow holds can bring doubt, anxiety and concern for the future. The uncertainty of our current situation with COVID-19 is definitely something to take seriously, but our hope is not in how our government responds, what the economy does or doesn’t do. We don’t have to live with the anxiety that sitting in isolation could bring or even the possibility of the effects of contracting a virus with no known cure. Fear’s job description is to convince you that your faith will not work. When you focus on fear in any form, it infects your faith. Fear’s assignment is to attack your mind, much like a virus attacks the body. Once infected with fear, your hope diminishes and your faith becomes depleted. But when your hope is in the Lord, His Word becomes your spiritual disinfectant. Just like you spray disinfectant in the air, or use hand sanitizer to kill germs and bacteria, truth from Scripture eradicates fear and brings you back into spiritual health. That’s why it’s vital to know God through His Word. We are told to put God’s words in “your hearts and minds; tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads” (Deuteronomy 11:18 NLT). The first step to a fear-free life is to give your life to Jesus Christ. If you don’t know Him, and would like to, click here. Who is Jesus? The phrase, “the word of the Lord came …” appears in the King James Version of the Bible 92 times. God’s Word led His people through some of the most difficult trials of their lives. And He continues to be our living hope today. The first time this phrase is used, Genesis 15:1, says “the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision: ‘Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your very great reward’” (NIV). God may choose to speak to you as He did with Abraham, and many others whose stories are told in Scripture, but He primarily speaks to us through the Bible. The way to encounter God, as Abraham did, is to study God’s Word and allow it to come alive in us. So, shower your mind with God’s truth. Here are some Scriptures to help you get started. Read these aloud today. Another way to use them is to read the entire chapter that each verse comes from over the next few days. First Last Δ Donate now'}]"

No additional details are available at this time. ORIGINAL STORY: Reports are swirling that Boosie BadAzz was shot in the leg this morning in Dallas. Today (Nov. 14), local Dallas ABC News affiliate WFAA reports Boosie BadAzz suffered a gunshot wound to the leg. Details on the situation are scarce, but according to the outlet, the rapper, born Torrence Hatch Jr., was treated for his injury at a local hospital. He reportedly refused to cooperate with the police about the incident, which allegedly occurred at a strip mall called Big T's Plaza, according to TMZ. There are also other reports that claim Boosie was not shot, with some rap fans and media outlets saying the rapper's Sprinter van was struck, but Boosie walked away unscathed. Boosie has yet to address the alleged incident directly. However, since the situation supposedly occurred, he has posted video of himself on Instagram and on his Instagram Story. In one post on his IG account, he slowly films his entire body from head to toe. In the second video, he calmly steps out of his Sprinter van after putting on some glasses. One could speculate that he is silently disproving the new reports of being shot or he could be just showing off his drip. The Down South rhymer was in town to attend a candlelight vigil for recently murdered Dallas rapper Mo3, who was shot and killed on Nov. 11. The rapper was reportedly signed to Boosie's label BadAzz Music Syndicate. Boosie also performed at a local club and attended a comedy event, according to his Instagram Story. XXL has reached out to the Dallas Police Department, Boosie BadAzz and the rapper's team for comment. See the Many Times Rappers' Social Media Accounts Were Suspended""}]"
