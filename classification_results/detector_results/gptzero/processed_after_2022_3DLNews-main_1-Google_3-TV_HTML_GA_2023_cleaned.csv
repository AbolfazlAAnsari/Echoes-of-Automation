The federal judge overseeing the election conspiracy case against Donald Trump warned on Friday that there are limits on what the former president can publicly say about the investigation as he campaigns for a second term in the White House. Presiding over her first hearing for the case, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington heard arguments on how to structure a protective order that would prevent a public airing of all the evidence turned over by prosecutors. But she also used the forum to address the case’s unprecedented mix of legal and political concerns. Chutkan stressed that political considerations wouldn’t guide her decisions. She also repeatedly said Trump was subject to the court’s rules as a defendant before trial even as he runs for the 2024 Republican nomination for president. “Your client’s defense is supposed to happen in this courtroom, not on the internet,” Chutkan told Trump’s lawyers. The judge said that the more anyone makes “inflammatory” statements about the case, the greater her urgency will be to move the case more quickly to trial to prevent the contamination of the jury pool. She noted that “arguably ambiguous statements” could be construed as intimidation or harassment of potential witnesses. “I will take whatever measures are necessary to safeguard the integrity of the case,” she said. A prosecutor said the Justice Department was prepared to turn over an initial batch of more than 11 million pages of evidence to Trump’s lawyers. Chutkan agreed with Trump’s defense team on a looser version of a protective order for evidence in the case, but she largely sided with the prosecution on what sensitive materials should be protected. She rejected prosecutors’ broader protective order proposal that sought to prevent the public release of all evidence they hand over to Trump’s defense as they prepare for trial. She instead seemed poised to impose a more limited protective order that would bar the public release only of materials deemed “sensitive,” such as grand jury materials. The government considers the vast majority of evidence in the case to be sensitive. The judge sided with the prosecution on what materials are considered sensitive and therefore protected under the order. Thomas Windom, a top deputy to Special Counsel Jack Smith, argued that Trump needed to be supervised when he reviews case materials. In another sign of the unique circumstances facing the former president, Windom quipped about the indictment Trump faces in Florida after classified materials were discovered in his Mar-a-Lago residence. “He has shown a tendency to hold on to material to which he should not,” Windom said. When prosecutors proposed the protective order, it became an early flashpoint in the case. The prosecutors called the judge’s attention to a post on Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, in which he said he would be “coming after” those who “go after” him. They warned Trump could improperly share sensitive information online that could have a “harmful chilling effect on witnesses.” “The defendant has broadcast their strategy, and that is to not try this case in the courtroom,” Windom said. Lawyers for Trump, who has railed against prosecutors and the judge on social media and during campaign events, said the government’s proposed order went too far and would restrict his free speech rights. John Lauro, an attorney for Trump, raised the example of former Vice President Mike Pence — who is both competing against Trump for the Republican nomination and a potential witness in the case before Chutkan. Trump has repeatedly attacked Pence for being disloyal. “President Trump has the ability to respond fairly to political opponents,” Lauro said. Trump, the early front-runner in the GOP presidential primary, says he is innocent of the charges, including conspiracy to defraud the United States. He has portrayed investigations of him as politically motivated. Prosecutors say that a substantial amount of evidence they’re ready to turn over to Trump’s legal team includes sensitive and confidential information — like transcripts from the grand jury that investigated the case and evidence obtained through sealed search warrants. Grand jury proceedings are secret. Prosecutors’ filing last week seeking the protective order included a screenshot of a post from Trump’s Truth Social platform that day in which the ex-president wrote, in all capital letters, “If you go after me, I’m coming after you!” “If the defendant were to begin issuing public posts using details — or, for example, grand jury transcripts — obtained in discovery here, it could have a harmful chilling effect on witnesses or adversely affect the fair administration of justice in this case,” prosecutors wrote in their motion.

Fox News announced two weeks ago that it had parted ways with Carlson. Carlson’s departure came days after the network settled a defamation lawsuit brought up by Dominion Voting Systems. A source close to Carlson told Axios that the former host is planning to use his allies to attack his former employer in an effort to force the network to let him go of his contract, allowing him to work for a rival company or start his own media outlet. Carlson’s contract with Fox News expires in January 2025, Axios noted. The Hill has reached out to Fox News for comment. More on Tucker Carlson: Favre, a three-time NFL MVP, has been embroiled in controversy in recent months for his alleged role in the misuse of federal welfare funds in his home state of Mississippi. Favre is accused of being allegedly connected to more than $8 million in misspent funds from the federal government’s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. This includes Favre allegedly using the $5 million he secured to build a new volleyball facility for his alma mater, the University of Southern Mississippi (USM). Favre’s daughter was a member of USM volleyball team during that time. Favre, who has denied any wrongdoing, recently filed lawsuits against state auditor Shad White and former NFL players turned sports media personalities, Shannon Sharpe and Pat McAfee, for defaming him in public discussions about the welfare scandal.

His family blames the Regional Medical Center in Orangeburg and one of its doctors, and now the family has received a $900,000 payout. In November of 2017, Kenly went to Regional Medical Center or RMC with nausea and abdominal pain and was found to have diabetic ketoacidosis. At the direction of the doctor, a nurse tried to put a central line or catheter into Kenly’s external jugular vein, the suit states. After they tried this multiple times unsuccessfully, the central line was placed incorrectly into an artery, according to the lawsuit. Staff at RMC didn’t recognize the error and it was their negligence, inaction and deviation from normal standards of care that caused Kenly’s strokes and ultimately his death, the suit argues. The lawsuit also alleges as a result of Kenly’s suffering and death, his surviving children should also be compensated because of their pain, grief and emotional distress. The family sued the hospital and the doctor for medical malpractice, gross negligence and wrongful death in August of 2019. Kenly was 27 when he died, and the family got the payout in November.

And the most popular article was about ChatGPT (yes, the AI chatbot that\'s seemingly everywhere today). Video above: See last year\'s top Google searches Since its launch just over a year ago, OpenAI\'s ChatGPT has skyrocketed into the public\'s consciousness as the technology makes its way into schools, health care, law and even religious sermons. The chatbot has also contributed to growing debates about the promise and potential dangers of generative AI, much of which is documented on its Wikipedia page. The second most-read article on Wikipedia in 2023 was the annual list of deaths, which sees high traffic year after year — taking the #4 and #1 spots in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Individual entries for notable figures who passed away also garnered significant interest this year, including pages for Matthew Perry and Lisa Marie Presley. Meanwhile, the highly anticipated 2023 Cricket World Cup took third place — alongside three other cricket-related entries in Wikipedia\'s top 25 articles this year, including the Indian Premier League at #4, marking the first time cricket content has made the list since the Wikimedia Foundation started tracking in 2015.
