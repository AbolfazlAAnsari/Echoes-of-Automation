Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said someone reported a fake crime at her home Monday, the latest in a series of apparent swatting incidents that have targeted her. “I was just swatted. This is like the 8th time. On Christmas with my family here. My local police are the GREATEST and shouldn’t have to deal with this,” she said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Greene added that she appreciates the local police and her family is in “joyous spirits” celebrating Christmas. A spokesperson for the police department in the city of Rome, Ga., where Greene’s house is located, said multiple calls were received through a crisis hotline in both Rome, N.Y., and Rome, Ga., requesting emergency services. A man in New York called the Georgia suicide hotline just before 11 a.m. Monday, claiming that he had shot his girlfriend at Greene’s home and was going to kill himself next, department spokesperson Kelly Madden told the Associated Press. The call was quickly transferred to police when suicide hotline responders recognized the Georgia congresswoman’s address. “While en route to the address, personnel with the Rome (GA) Police Department coordinated with Greene’s security detail to ensure her safety as well as determine that there was in fact no emergency at the address,” the spokesperson said. Swatting incidents have occurred at the controversial Georgia Republican’s home since last year. One happened in August 2022 when a caller claimed a shooting was happening at Greene’s home, and another happened the next day when a caller hinted they may have shot their family. The caller from the first incident last August said in a computer-generated voice in a later call to officials that they were upset with Greene’s position on the rights of transgender youth. The Hill has reached out to local police for comment and additional information about the latest incident. Republican U.S. Rep. Brandon Williams said in a post on X that he was also targeted by a swatting attempt on Christmas Day. The Cayuga County Sheriff’s office said it received a false report of a shooting at the congressman’s home in central New York and sent officers to confirm that there was no present danger. Sheriff Brian Schenck did not immediately respond to phone messages seeking further details. “Our home was swatted this afternoon,” Williams wrote. “Thanks to the Deputies and Troopers who contacted me before arriving. They left with homemade cookies and spiced nuts! Merry Christmas everyone!” The Associated Press contributed to this report. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

delivered straight to your email inbox. With the Iowa caucuses rapidly approaching, a shrinking field of Republican White House hopefuls gathered Wednesday in Alabama for the fourth presidential debate. As usual, former President Donald Trump, who is dominating the GOP primary, didn’t appear. Instead, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie continued their effort to gain a sliver of the spotlight in the race. Here are some takeaways from the final primary debate of 2023. The front-runner in the Republican primary has no end of vulnerabilities. He faces 91 criminal charges and just the night before repeatedly refused to rule out abusing power if he returns to office. But, as has been the pattern, Trump was ignored during much of the debate. There was one great exception in the second hour, when the moderators asked Christie about Trump. Christie complained that his three rivals have been silent about the threats Trump presents to democracy. “You want to know why these poll numbers are where they are?” Christie asked. “Because folks like these three people on this stage want to make it seem like his conduct is acceptable.” Christie then began jousting with DeSantis, who confined his criticism of Trump to the former president’s age and failure to achieve all of his agenda in his first term. “Is he fit to be president or isn’t he?” Christie asked. “Is he fit? Ron, Ron? He’s afraid to answer.” Ramaswamy accused his rivals of all “licking Donald Trump’s boots,” but then proceeded to argue the Jan. 6,2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol was an “inside job” — hardly distancing himself from the former president and his penchant for lies and misinformation. Ramaswamy has been particularly adept at pulling fire away from Trump. The 38-year-old political novice and pharmaceutical entrepreneur has specialized in grating, personal attacks that his rivals just can’t bring themselves to ignore. Video below: Alabama GOP Chairman John Wahl weighs in on 4th GOP presidential primary debate On Wednesday, he challenged Haley to name three Ukrainian provinces that he claimed his 3-year-old could identify, and Christie, who had tried to launch an attack on Trump to open the debate, exploded. “All he knows how to do is insult good people who have committed their lives to public service,” Christie said. Minutes later, Haley took an unusual swing at Trump for failing to go further than simple trade actions against China. But DeSantis jumped in, attacking Haley for her relationship with China. The two Republicans began snapping at each other, leaving Trump unmentioned. Again, it went just as Trump would hope — the candidates fought each other rather than him. Haley was under attack from the opening seconds of the debate. And it didn’t let up for almost 20 minutes, a clear reminder that the former United Nations ambassador’s opponents see her as a growing threat in the race. DeSantis amped up the pressure as he answered the debate’s opening question, which was about his struggling campaign. “You have other candidates up here, like Nikki Haley, she caves every time the left comes after her,” DeSantis said, casting himself as a fighter. The Florida governor then seized on Haley’s recent support from Wall Street and at least one major Democratic donor.

In an fireside chat with Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, Ramaswamy said that environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) business policies are among the “grave threats to liberty,” and said “the climate change agenda” is a “hoax.” “They’re using our money … to implement social and environmental agendas through the backdoor. Through corporate America,” Ramaswamy said. “Using your retirement funds and your investment accounts to vote for racial equity audits or Scope 3 emissions caps that you didn’t know they were using your money to do, and that Congress would have never passed through the front door.” ESG has become a political punching bag for conservatives, who view it as corporations overreaching into the political space. The policies increase diverse hiring, reduce carbon emissions and manage how they invest their money with climate in mind. “This is actually one of the grave threats to liberty today. Wherever you stand on climate change — I think most of the climate change agenda is, I’m just going to say it, is a hoax,” Ramaswamy said. “I’m going to call that for what it is.” The entrepreneur also claimed ESG is comparable to the “back-rooms deals” of Old World Europe, and called for more public debate on the topic. “Wherever you stand on that, we should settle that through free space and open debate in the public square in a constitutional republic,” he said. “That’s the way we do things, post-1776, on this side of the Atlantic.” Conservatives’ crusade against ESG has drawn ire from Democrats, who have called many of the follies a waste of time. Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) called a House hearing over the issue the “stupidest hearing I’ve ever been to.” Ramaswamy’s campaign has gained steam in recent months, rising from an unknown political figure to third in national polling averages — passing former Vice President Mike Pence last month.

The Education Department said Friday that the relief is being provided on income-driven repayment plans, in which the federal government cancels remaining balances for the borrower after they have made their payments for 20 or 25 years. The department said the “fixes” will more accurately count monthly payments that qualify under the plans, and it will notify borrowers who are eligible for the relief in the upcoming days. The Supreme Court struck down Biden’s plan to give $10,000 of student debt relief to low- and middle-income borrowers and up to $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients in a 6-3 decision last month. The majority found that Congress had not directly authorized the president to forgive debts worth in aggregate hundreds of billions of dollars. Biden announced following the decision that his administration would continue to work to provide student debt relief despite the court’s ruling. He said he would base his debt relief plan on a different law, the Higher Education Act, which proponents argue allows the education secretary to “compromise, waive or release” student loan debt. The administration must undergo a public comment period before the plan can go into effect, delaying its potential implementation. The Hill has reached out to the White House for comment on Friday’s announcement. “For far too long, borrowers fell through the cracks of a broken system that failed to keep accurate track of their progress towards forgiveness,” Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a statement. The relief is being provided as part of an adjustment that the administration previously announced in April 2022. Cardona said the plan will ensure that everyone receives the forgiveness that they deserve in addressing “past administrative failures.” Submit Δ Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

""Now 77 Sat 78 Sun 76 by Liz Bonis, WKRC TOPICS: CINCINNATI (WKRC) - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported more than a dozen drugs for cancer patients are in short supply currently. For one survivor, that meant searching for a shot to save his life. For months now, Local 12 has been following the story of Steve Abbott. He is a 10-year advanced prostate cancer survivor. He started his search for a shot at survival when he was told his current therapy was no longer working. “I was told after my third treatment this is not, you're going to need to look at the next thing, and soon,” Abbott said. That’s because while he was searching, a measurement of progression known as a PSA level was rising. “A PSA is a serum or blood test we utilize to screen for risk for prostate cancer,” said Dr. Brooke Edwards, chief medical officer at The Urology Group. So, Abbott’s medical team suggested he investigate a drug made by Novartis. It’s called Pluvicto. “Pluvicto is a radiation treatment, but not with a beam, it’s given with an IV into the body, and it’s a very sophisticated concept,” said Dr. Gary Kirsh, a urologist at The Urology Group. He said the drug targets what’s called PSMA. “PSMA is a chemical on the surface of over 90% of cancer cells, so this becomes sort of like a smart bomb,” Dr. Kirsh said. Due to recent Food and Drug Administration approval and high demand in the U.S., Abbott couldn’t find a medical center to deliver it. It’s a common problem for patients who use certain cancer drugs that are in short supply. It’s a problem for both patients and doctors. “It’s very frustrating for both parties. What we try to do is work around it,” Dr. Kirsh said. That works if there are other drugs that offer similar benefits. But in Abbott’s case, his hard-to-find drug is unique in how it kills off cancer. “This chemical goes right to the prostate cancer cells, attaches to it, and gives off its radiation to kill the cell,” Dr. Kirsh said. So, Abbott got on a plane and flew from Ohio to Italy, where he’d been told a Novartis plant there had supply available. It took about six months, but just weeks ago, the team at The Urology Group delivered his first dose. “My PSA was at least 25, and it’s come down after every single treatment, and it’s come down to 2.9, which is kind of within normal ranges,” Abbott said. While it’s not a cure, he said he now tells patients to do whatever possible to be their own advocate. Since the problem of finding new drugs and paying for them continues to be a problem, Abbott said a person should start at his or her own doctor’s office. “We have people here at The Urology Group who spend all day between financial difficulty when drug is available or when drug isn’t available, they spend all day trying to hook the patient up with drug,” Dr. Kirsh said. Many medical centers now have these kinds of medication hunters, and beyond that, there’s a website called Massive Bio that will help a person search for clinical trials, which may have even newer therapies. Pluvicto now has a note on its website, which says the drug shortage is resolved. Abbott is part of an organization called Cincinnati Cancer Advisors. The organization offers free second opinions for a cancer diagnosis and can help navigate finding the care that a person may need.""}]"

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Menu COLUMBUS, Ohio — There is no way to sugarcoat it — Ohio public officials behaved badly in 2023. Politicians consistently dealt with the law, so Statehouse reporter Morgan Trau broke down a list of the public figures who ran into legal troubles. The FBI has been busy this year. Five of the seven public officials on this list have been dealing with the feds, the other two are being handled by locals. Disclaimer: There were plenty of other public officials that were under scrutiny this year, but the following were the biggest scandals — involving either statewide officials or federal cases. This list does not include lawsuits filed against public officials, if it had — this article would be seemingly endless. Going chronologically, the year started off with a bang with the trial for the largest bribery scheme in state history. Larry Householder Unlikely to ever see the outside of a prison fence for the rest of his life, former Republican House Speaker Larry Householder had a tough year. After his trial from January to March, Householder was found guilty of accepting a $61 million bribe in exchange for selling out the Statehouse to FirstEnergy and other utility companies. He used taxpayer money to create legislation called House Bill 6 that provided a more than a billion-dollar bailout for FE\'s struggling nuclear power plants. He used the bribe money to put himself and his allies into power, demolishing and threatening anyone in his path, as well as paying off credit card debt and renovations to his home in Florida. He then fell into the FBI\'s trap and, embarrassingly, lied on the stand. He seemed to not understand that the feds had recordings of him admitting to the crimes. In June, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. ""I\'m not guilty,"" Householder exclaimed following the verdict. The jury, judge and FBI begged to differ. RELATED: Once the most powerful lawmaker in OH, Larry Householder to serve 20 years behind bars Matt Borges Former GOP leader Matt Borges got the short end of the racketeering stick, having his bribery scheme charges combined in the same trial as Householder. He pocketed over $350,000 from the scandal, but his biggest faux pas was attempting to bribe an FBI informant with a $15,000 check. He was also found guilty, which the foreman of the jury told said it was a much easier decision to make than Householder since it was so clear-cut. ""I did not believe that anything proved that I had engaged in a racketeering conspiracy, which is why I fought this from the beginning,"" Borges said on the day the verdict was read. Due to playing a significantly smaller role in the scandal and for seemingly taking responsibility for his actions in his sentencing request letter, he ended up with five years in prison. RELATED: Judge sends ex-GOP chair Matt Borges to prison for 5 years for joining Householder public corruption plot Bob Young In a three-month period, Former Republican state Rep. Bob Young was arrested thrice, ending up with a multitude of charges related to domestic violence. The ex-Northern Canton lawmaker was first charged with domestic violence against his wife and assault against his brother in July, then violation of protection order in August, and then stalking and violating protection order again in September. He refused to resign until public pressure mounted after his second arrest. He left his seat to focus on ""his faith"" in October. During the trial, the judge was appalled when Young called his teen daughter a ""liar,"" after testifying what she saw during the first assault. ""I may have hit her hand unintentionally or something just so I wouldn\'t get hit again,"" Young said when alleging his wife hit him first. He was found guilty of domestic violence but acquitted on the assault charge. He took a plea deal on the subsequent charges. RELATED: Former Ohio state Rep. Bob Young found guilty in domestic violence trial P.G. Sittenfeld In October, former Democratic Cincinnati city councilman P.G. Sittenfeld was sentenced to 16 months in prison after a jury convicted him of bribery and extortion charges. A jury found Sittenfeld guilty on one charge of bribery and one charge of attempted extortion for taking $40,000 in campaign donations from undercover FBI agents who were posing as developers and asking for help on a Downtown project. ""For the sake of my family, I\'m looking forward to putting this behind me,” Sittenfeld said during the trial. RELATED: Former Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld to report to prison Jan. 2 Elliot Forhan After a tumultuous six months, Democratic state Rep. Elliot Forhan (D-South Euclid) had a civil protection order and a police report filed against him in November from a fellow lawmaker. State Rep. Juanita Brent (D-Cleveland) filed and received a restraining order against Forhan after numerous incidents of harassment, including allegedly showing up to her house on numerous occasions, she said. ""I\'m working with some representatives in defending myself in every respect,"" Forhan said. ""Filing a false police report is a very serious issue."" Prior to the law getting involved, Forhan was stripped of nearly all his legislative privileges due to allegations of “abusive” and “violent” behavior — and the ""pattern of harassment, hostility, and intimidation of colleagues and staff."" He continues to deny all allegations. RELATED: Rep. Forhan not ruling out lawsuit after privileges revoked due to alleged ‘abusive behavior’ Sam Randazzo The dominos continue to fall in the H.B. 6 scheme. In early December, former chairman of the Public Utilities Commission Sam Randazzo pleaded not guilty after being charged with a dozen bribery crimes. Unluckily for Randazzo, who didn\'t also take a plea deal when Householder\'s right-hand man, Jeff Longstreth, and FirstEnergy admitted to the scheme, he now has to deal with the ramifications of the information that is already public. FirstEnergy has already admitted to bribing Randazzo with a $4.3 million payment so the former chairman could help the company behind the scenes — in one way — by pushing and helping to create H.B. 6. Randazzo and his attorney have refused to address the scandal, but Case Western Reserve University law professor Michael Benza explained what fate likely awaits Randazzo. ""He will probably spend the rest of his life in prison,"" the professor responded. ""He would be looking at probably dying in prison."" WCPO\'s sister station, WEWS, had a one-on-one interview with Gov. Mike DeWine, who said he regrets appointing Randazzo to the PUCO. DeWine and Lieutenant Gov. Jon Husted have both been subpoenaed in a civil case relating to this scandal and what they know about Randazzo.

The White House accused House Republicans of putting the nation at risk of a shutdown “that would undermine our economy and national security, create needless uncertainty for families and businesses, and have damaging consequences across the country.” In a memo shared with reporters, the administration outlined a series of consequences that could affect Americans if the government shuts down. The White House said FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund would risk being depleted without a funding bill, complicating emergency response efforts. A government shutdown would stall research on cancer, the White House said, and delay food inspections conducted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Transportation Security Administration and air traffic controllers would have to work without pay, potentially causing travel delays. A shutdown would also limit the ability of the Small Business Administration to conduct its work, potentially harming small businesses, the White House said. And Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reviews could be delayed, which would in turn delay ongoing infrastructure projects. “These consequences are real and avoidable—but only if House Republicans stop playing political games with peoples’ lives and catering to the ideological demands of their most extreme, far-right members,” the White House said. “It’s time for House Republicans to abide by the bipartisan budget agreement that the majority of them voted for, keep the government open, and address other urgent needs for the American people” House GOP leadership on Tuesday had to pull a procedural vote on a proposed short-term funding stopgap after it elicited opposition from hard-line conservatives. Hours later, hard-line conservatives in the House sank a procedural vote on a Pentagon funding bill in a significant setback for Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). The House has less than two weeks to extend government funding past Sept. 30 or risk a shutdown. Meanwhile, Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) on Tuesday warned fellow Republicans to avoid brinksmanship that could result in a government shutdown, warning that shutdowns are always “a loser for Republicans.” The White House has called on Republicans in Congress to pass funding bills under terms agreed to during negotiations in May that led to an increase in the debt ceiling.
