the theme Paint the Town! Set against the beautiful campus of John Carroll University and its Dolan Center for Science and Technology, the party will feature unique drinks and appetizers from The Fairmount and hors d\'oeuvres from Saroj & Carlos. Along with specialty cocktails and delicious food, there will be music, dancing, a silent auction, a concert by Apostle Jones, and an opportunity to mingle with residents and leaders of Cleveland Heights and University Heights and celebrate efforts to improve our cities with neighbors from around the Heights. Brenda Bailey While FutureHeights restructures and develops its next strategic plan, the board of directors is pleased to announce that Brenda Bailey, currently FutureHeights\' volunteer coordinator, has been named as the interim manager, and Robert (Bob) Brown, former FutureHeights board president, has agreed to serve as the interim executive director. The board recognizes Bailey’s attention to detail and enthusiasm for the Heights—qualities that have been invaluable in building the nonprofit community development corporation’s volunteer and donor lists, and ensuring the monthly delivery of the Heights Observer to Heights businesses and institutions. Devlin Pope, conductor of the UH Symphonic Band. “Do You Remember” is the first single off Lauren Lanzaretta’s new album, Soul Ties. Residents and visitors will be treated to a powerful performance—one they will long remember—at Walter Stinson Community Park when Lanzaretta makes her University Heights debut on Thursday, June 13, at 7 p.m. Lanzaretta says concertgoers can expect to hear original songs from her three studio albums, as well as a handful of fun covers. “I love to connect with my audience—to go deeper and bring messages of hope and healing,” she said. Cynthia Booker with students. Building Heights, a cornerstone nonprofit in Cleveland Heights, proudly presents the fourth-season screening of Heights Middle School Shorts (HMSS) at the Cedar Lee Theatre on June 16 (Father’s Day), at 6:30 p.m. Initiated in 2020, HMSS is more than a film camp; it\'s a launchpad for young creatives in the Heights community. Supported tirelessly by the Cleveland Heights-University Heights City School District, HMSS has grown into a pivotal force in nurturing the filmmakers of tomorrow. On May 20, Cleveland Heights City Council approved TWG’s affordable apartment development, Nobility Court (once known as Noble Station). Since the community first learned about the development, it has been shrouded with controversy and opposition. This May 20 council meeting was no different. A packed room (the usual early opposers and first-time resident attendees) brought opposition statements, emotions, and disappointment on many levels and [for many] reasons. The intentional and orchestrated effort implemented to shut down this project came too late. Each council member\'s voting decision was made, after countless meetings, presentations, and discussions since 2023. Intentionally, from the start, the project and process excluded engaging the community. This map orients viewers to the communities listed in the table. Weather-wise, Greater Cleveland seems to avoid the extremes other places endure. Though we sometimes experience weather-related problems, like short-term travel limitations or skies that remain gray for weeks on end, we are unlikely to experience a storm like Katrina, or Buffalo’s Blizzard of ‘22. Despite our great weather, however, we are not immune to other forms of disaster, and the foreclosure crisis that underlaid the Great Recession of 2007–9 is among the worst we have experienced. Though the crisis affected the entire United States, some places, including Greater Cleveland, were hit harder, and within those places, some neighborhoods suffered more than others. The 46th Annual Marilyn Bianchi Kids’ Playwriting Festival (MBKPF) will honor 24 young playwrights the weekend of June 7, 8, and 9. More than 250 students in grades 1–12 submitted plays to this year’s MBKPF, which is the oldest event of its kind in the nation. MBKPF is the culmination of Dobama Theatre’s Young Playwrights Program, which teaches playwriting to students across Northeast Ohio. This year-round education program is taught by professional playwrights and theater artists. The wide-ranging resources available include classroom residencies, virtual workshops, instructional videos, and a fully adaptable curriculum based on grade level. Growing up in Cleveland Heights, I have fond memories of shopping at Russo\'s Fairmount store. Like many longtime residents, I feel a sense of sadness seeing it vacant. Seeing it occupied by Dave\'s Supermarket, which doesn\'t quite cater to the local market around Cedar Fairmount, was disappointing to me. I don\'t mean to come off as a snob, but shouldn\'t we aim for an upscale grocer that fits into a smaller footprint, catering to the residents nearest to Cedar Fairmount? As someone with experience as a former commercial real estate broker, I believe finding the right fit is crucial for ensuring a store\'s profitability and sustainability as a tenant in this space. An outlet grocery doesn\'t seem like the right fit here. I disagree with the notion that the Heights doesn\'t need another grocery store. Summer maker-in-residence Alex Heard is a soft sculptor and performance artist. This summer, Heights Libraries will host a maker-in-residence program in the Heights Knowledge and Innovation Center (HKIC) STEAM Lab at the Lee Road branch. The goal of the program, funded in part by a generous grant from the Cyrus Eaton Foundation, is to showcase local makers and to engage the community in a creative space where they can learn from creative experts and participate in the creative process.The library’s summer maker, chosen from 37 applicants, is Alex Heard. Heard is a soft sculptor and performance artist working in Cleveland. Their colorful, plush costumes explore a variety of topics both absurd and sincere. They graduated from the Cleveland Institute of Art in 2020. Heard performs in the Cleveland area, and has exhibited throughout Ohio. For decades, we’ve heard from Cleveland Heights officials that we need new, well-heeled residents to expand our population and, with it, the city\'s tax base. The current mayor and most council members have bought into this idea as well. Cleveland Heights\' population peaked in the early 1960s at a little over 61,000. Sixty years later, the 2020 census counted just 45,215 residents—due to smaller family sizes, loss of jobs in the region, and white flight, among other things. In addition to population shrinkage, since the 1980s cities like ours have experienced drastic cuts in federal and state funding. Thus, the past three decades have seen a tightening of municipal budgets and corresponding reductions in staff and programs. This home won a 2024 Beautiful Home Award in the ""Two-in-a- Row"" category. University Heights’ 2025 Beautiful Home Awards nominations are underway. Throughout the summer, and no later than Sept. 15, residents are invited to nominate homeowners who exhibit an outstanding investment in their property in a variety of award categories. The Beautiful Homes Committee, a group of residents appointed by the mayor, reviews the nominees, and winners are announced at the annual University Heights Civic Awards in the fall. With the exception of current committee members, anyone can nominate a house for consideration, as long as it’s not for sale. Self-nominations are also welcome. “For more than 60 years, University Heights has recognized homeowners who have done an outstanding job in maintaining their homes, enhancing the city’s neighborhoods, and enabling a sustainable and vibrant community,” said Deanna Bremer Fisher, chief of staff for the city of University Heights.

development consisting of office, commercial, residential and open space on 88.46 acres along the east side of Africa Road. Westerville’s Planning Commission heard updates to what’s known as the Sharp Farm Redevelopment by Epcon Communities and Vincent Romanelli on Jan. 27. The site is on the east side of Africa Road, south of Polaris Parkway and north of County Line Road. The proposal won’t be back on the commission’s agenda until March at the earliest. For the latest updates, go to the city’s website at westerville.org and then click on government to find boards and commissions agendas. City staff weren’t prepared to make a recommendation to the commission about the preliminary development plan during the Jan. 27 meeting due to several outstanding issues, according to Bassem Bitar, planning manager for the Westerville Planning and Development Department. Bitar explained various revisions to the proposal since they last looked at it in April 2020, when staff, the commission and residents expressed concerns about plans for the Sharp House to be removed or relocated. In his written report to the commission, Bitar said, revisions include the following notable changes: • Preservation of the Sharp House in its current location, with the intent of adaptively reusing it along with its immediate surroundings for commercial purposes. This could include a restaurant and special-events programing. • Introduction of smaller, 1-story office buildings east of the Sharp House. The previous proposal envisioned larger office buildings with associated parking in that area, but the applicants have indicated that would not be feasible as a result of the retention of the house that would hinder visibility from Africa Road. The current proposal shows 19.5 acres of commercial development, consisting of 214,400 square feet of office space, 14.07 acres of multifamily residential development, 33.33 acres of single-family development and 21.56 acres of preserved green space. The multifamily development would bring a maximum of 230 residential units – 198 apartments, 18 townhomes and 14 carriage homes – with a gross density of 16.3 units per acre. The single-family portion calls for 160 residential units with a gross density of 4.8 units per acre. Joel Rhoades, regional president and general counsel at Epcon, said in advance of the Jan. 27 hearing that a petition had been submitted and signed by 838 residents in support of the plan. He also discussed the need for senior- and active-adult housing in Westerville. “Back in 2018, the city launched an initiative called Age-Friendly Westerville,” Rhoades said. “As I read, the intent of that was to set up goals and strategies to ensure Westerville remains a great place for residents of all ages. It goes on to talk about a need for diverse housing in the city, housing to provide more choices for an aging population.” During the public hearing, resident Ralph Collins, president of the Courtyards at Village Crossing homeowners association, said the city has been his home for the past 60 years. He worked 35 years in the Westerville City Schools, he said. “After living in our last home for 28 years, we both retired. We wanted to stay in the city and find a freestanding ranch home in Westerville,” he said. “Our options were limited. Luckily, we found the newly proposed Courtyards at Village Crossing off North State Street.” Collins said 17 families living in his neighborhood of 40 homes moved either from the city or within 4 miles away. “Epcon designed our development with the city to create a neighborhood feel and appearance,” he said. “When we learned about the development of the Sharp Farms area west of our neighborhood, our HOA board provided a summary of the plan to our residents. We then surveyed our residents to see what type of development they would like to see in this space.” Collins said 87% of the residents responded affirmatively to the project that represents 35 of the 40 homes and signed a petition supporting that. “The proximity to stores, restaurants, community center, medical offices, the bike plan and Uptown Westerville make this location like ours, an ideal place to live,” he said. “It’s my hope the commission will see the benefits of the proposal so others looking for a great place to live in Westerville will have the same opportunities to enjoy our city that we’ve experienced on a daily basis.” Commission member Steven Munger said the plan represents continual improvement toward the overall land use. “We’ve shown a certain degree of skepticism toward the percentage of residential versus commercial,” he said. “I’m now, personally, at a point where I’m comfortable with the balance. I’m comfortable with the format, and I’m much more comfortable with the scale and the reality of being able to build out those commercial parcels in the northwest corner.” Munger said he still has concerns about residential creep in the ravines and no visual barrier to separate public and private property on the site. Commission member Brian Schaefer said he still has questions about traffic. “Any traffic numbers coming out on Africa Road, that would be one of my biggest concerns,” he said. “Volume in and out of there around peak times, and then does Africa Road turn into people just darting across, or backups on there needs to be answered with a traffic study at some point.” Schaefer said the overall site plan is concerning in regard of supporting the public infrastructure with the amount of commercial versus residential on the property. “From the last plan, it looks like we lost a little bit of commercial,” he said.

But if you compare it to what the women in my family have gone through, it feels small. Miami University entered the Age-Friendly University (AFU) Global Network just three weeks ago. The AFU Global Network ties Miami to a commitment – with about 69 other universities – to increase education and other services for older people outside the traditional college student age range. The workgroup outlined a plan in its AFU application to develop webinars geared toward faculty on age-inclusive education that would cover topics like diversity. A blue and white patterned statue that kind of looks like a big ol’ ding-a-ling on Miami’s North Quad has sparked speculation about its meaning on Oxford campus. They frame the face. They come from a small online business. They also inform the girls and the gays that I am one of them. Friends told Niko Rajani that he didn’t have to change his name as a transgender man. His legal name is Indian, so people in the United States wouldn’t register it as a feminine name. Students received Mandatory POUND cards after completing COVID-19 tests upon arrival to the Oxford campus. The controversial new section of Miami’s Healthy Together plan includes a punch card for each student that tracks any and all sexual encounters between their random COVID-19 tests. So if you have the means and the time and the health and the privilege to go somewhere warm and travel safely, stop wringing your hands in the cold like I did all of last semester and go. This week, you will be hearing three mini narrative podcasts from students in an audio storytelling class here at Miami. This is “Thoughts from Quarantine,” a weekly series in which three of our editors will answer a variation of this simple question: “How are you feeling?” This week’s prompt is, “How are you feeling about your summer internship/job plans? Four days after classes went online, an unofficial Miami GroupMe chat with 156 members and counting was born. Junior Jannie Kamara started the chat on March 17, a day before she was elected president of Associated Student Government (ASG).

children — were killed in a house fire early Monday in Akron’s North Hill neighborhood. Four others were hospitalized. Relatives and neighbors said two Bhutanese families were living in the home at the time. Neighbors described them as friendly, kind people, and said the loss was too tragic to put into words. “They were wonderful, wonderful people,” neighbor Jean Hudson said. Akron firefighters responded about 12:50 a.m. Monday to a blaze at a home on Linden Avenue at the intersection of Birchwood Avenue. It is a block away from Harris-Jackson elementary school. Akron Fire Lt. Sierjie Lash said the home was engulfed in flames when firefighters arrived. Three adults and a child were taken to the hospital with injuries, and a neighbor who tried to help was treated at the scene, Lash said. Cleveland television station Fox 8 (WJW) reported that emergency crews arrived to find relatives and neighbors trying to get people out of the burning house. The Summit County Medical Examiner’s Office confirmed two adults and three children died. Investigators were still working to confirm their identities. Chief Investigator Gary Guenther said authorities believe a 60-year-old man, a 48-year-old woman, an 11-year-old boy and two girls, ages 5 and 16, died in the fire. Lash said this was Akron’s deadliest house fire since May 2017, when a mother, father and five children died in a house fire on Fultz Avenue in what was later ruled an arson. Stanley Ford is currently standing trial in that case and is accused of starting that and another fatal house fire. Dozens of neighbors crowded around the home Monday morning. Among them was Yam Subba, who said his father died in the fire. He drove from Columbus after hearing the news and said he was still trying to find out what happened. Subba said his father bought the house about six months ago and had been in Akron for a few years. He said his stepmother and father lived in the home with their three children. Aaron Suhang, who said his cousins and nephew lived in the home, said other family members were living there while they waited to move into a house in Cuyahoga Falls. He said two other parents and two children lived there. He said four people from the homeowner\'s family, including two adults and two children, and a child from the other family — all related to him — died in the fire. Suhang also said he was trying to figure out what happened. He said a cousin who was hospitalized because of the fire had been calling to find out where his child was, but they did not have have answers for him. The whole thing is hard to process, Suhang said. “We never thought that this would happen to us,” he said. Akron Public Schools spokesperson Mark Williamson told Beacon Journal News 5 Cleveland the children killed in the fire were students at Leggett elementary school, Jennings middle school and North High School. The district released a statement from the superintendent saying grief counselors would be made available. ""Our best efforts now are focused on connecting with our students and staff who will be affected by this,"" Superintendent Christine Fowler Mack said. Lash said the cause of the fire is still being determined. Investigators from Akron and the State Fire Marshal’s office were processing the scene Monday morning. Mahananda Luitel, president of the Greater Akron Hindu Sewa Samittee, said the loss Monday was tragic and that it has had a big effect on the rest of the Nepali-speaking community. He said it\'s a close and intertwined community, and people are grieving but ready to help. ""The whole community is deeply touched. We are with them,"" Luitel said. ""The whole community is ready to support them."" He said he had met one of the victims when they came through his class at the International Institute of Akron. She was born in Bhutan and lived in Nepal as a refugee before coming to America. Luitel said it\'s customary for other families in the community to donate money during the grieving process. He said the organization might also run an online fundraiser if the family approves. It\'s also a time to make sure people are prepared, Luitel said. He posted a video highlighting the importance of smoke detectors and checking them for batteries on Facebook. He said many of the community members don\'t speak English and don\'t see local news or other websites, so it\'s important to put out educational content in their language. ""This fire incident should not go unnoticed,"" Luitel said. ""We have to educate our people."" A woman has since started a GoFundMe account for the family. It can be found at gf.me/v/c/8pzf/vafj26-tragic-home-fire. Hudson said she woke up at 12:35 a.m. when she heard people speaking Nepali. At first, she figured they were having a gathering or celebration. “Then I heard screams, so I looked outside and I saw the flames,” Hudson said. She said she called 911 and when firefighters arrived the flames were stretched across the driveway and to her home. Hudson said some people escaped and went through her backyard. Hudson said another man, whom she identified as an uncle, was covered in soot and trying to save the others in the house. Despite the language barrier, she said the family members were great neighbors and she “was so grateful when the (they) bought the house.” She said they invited her over for gatherings and brought over food after parties. The neighbors agreed to split the cost to rebuild a wall between the homes and they worked on it together. Hudson said the family had just built a new retaining wall and planted flowers in front of the home. When they built the wall, family members who lived nearby came to help. Hudson said many of the people outside the home Monday morning likely were family. She added that they live in a close-knit neighborhood. Hudson said she is shocked each time she looks at the now-charred home. “I can’t believe it,” she said. One neighbor who said she didn’t want to be named said she was heartbroken thinking about the children — who were about the same ages as her grandchildren — who lost their lives. She wasn’t surprised to see many people gathered outside, saying people in that area try to help each other. “In this neighborhood, we’re a family,” she said.

'version': '2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Corrections and clarifications: This story has been updated to correct the years that Newsmax and OANN launched. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, most people have missed the shift of Trump voters away from Fox News and into the hands of Newsmax and One America News Network, two news outlets that are only 8 years old but in that short time have managed to greatly improve their standing in conservative circles. While the average voter may be mostly unaware of these outlets, the Suffolk University/USA TODAY national poll of exclusively 2020 Trump voters offers key data points in what could be a seismic shift in the landscape of trusted news sources for conservatives in the country. First, I want to make sure we keep the relative size of the shift in perspective, as it’s not a 100% change from Fox to its competitors. Fox News is still, by far, the most trusted news network/media source among previously identified Trump voters from various state and national polls taken in 2020. Among Trump voters, 34% trusted Fox News the most, followed by 17% for Newsmax, 9% for One America News Network, with every other network at 3% or less. The above numbers, however, also paint a drastically different picture than the numbers four years ago. In late October 2016, Suffolk University and USA TODAY conducted a national poll of likely presidential election voters, and among those who said they would support Trump over Clinton, a whopping 58% trusted Fox News the most. At the time of our October 2016 poll, OANN and Newsmax were barely 4 years old, so they were not offered as options. However, we do not believe that in 2016 they would have been trusted the most by a statistically significant portion of respondents. Exclusive: Defeated and impeached, Trump still commands the loyalty of the GOP\'s voters Today’s data shows Fox News is losing the most loyal Trump voters. On the issue of whether Trump voters believe Joe Biden was legitimately elected, 73% said Biden was not. Among Trumpers trusting OANN, the number was 90% and among Newsmax Trumpers it was 92% saying Biden was “illegitimately elected.” In a similar trend, 58% of Trump voters said that the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6 was an antifa-inspired attack that only involved a few Trump supporters. Among Fox News viewers it was 59%, but notably less than the 73% who watch OANN and Newsmax. The recent Senate impeachment trial had a doubling down effect for 64% of Newsmax viewers who said the trial made them more supportive of Trump. Among OANN, 49% were more supportive, followed by 41% of Fox viewers. Trump’s loyalty carries into the 2024 presidential election as well, with 62% of Trumpers trusting Fox News, saying that they would like to see Trump run for president in four years. But that high number was less than the 70% and 73% respectively among those who trust Newsmax and OANN. Those who trust either OANN (66%) and Newsmax (64%) the most say history will record Trump as a great president. For Fox News, the number is high (45%) but not quite showing the love of these up-and-coming alternatives. Previous Paleologos on the Poll: Inauguration Day isn\'t the end of the Trump era. It\'s just the beginning. Then we come to the true test of party loyalty – or should I say disloyalty – when comparing Trump with the Republican Party. We put Trump supporters on the spot and asked to whom they were more loyal. In the survey, 54% said they are more loyal to Trump while 34% chose the Republican Party. Among Fox News Trumpers, the numbers were a slightly more modest 51%-37% split in favor of Trump. But among Newsmax viewers 72% chose Trump over the GOP and among OANN, the Trump loyalty tipped to 80%-15%. The poll also asks what the official relationship should be between the Republican Party and Trump. Overall, half said the GOP should be more loyal to Trump while 19% said less loyal and just 14% said the Republican Party is headed in the right direction. Those numbers were pretty much mirrored by Trumpers trusting Fox News, but 70% of Newsmax viewers said the GOP needs to be more loyal to Trump and it was an even higher 80% among OANN. And if the ""unthinkable"" happens for the Republican Party, and Donald Trump forms a third party, the poll tells us that Trump trusters of Newsmax (70%) and OANN (65%) will easily choose the Trump Party over the Republican Party. Among those trusting Fox News, 41% would defect to the Trump Party and 28% would pick the Republican Party with a sizeable 31% undecided and torn. This poses a very, very bad problem for the Republican Party in 2022 and 2024. Move over Fox News.

Someone had been asking questions about Jaber, the way a private investigator might do. Jaber was disturbed by the news. Something felt wrong about it. He felt what little privacy he had as a public figure had been violated. As a first-term councilman, Jaber had won his primary in September 2019 with 81% of the vote, sealing a victory in the general election, in which he ran unopposed. But since he took office in January 2020, Jaber has rocked the city’s political boat. Early on in his term, he verbally tussled with other council members, openly criticized policies of Mayor William Judge’s administration and — in perhaps his most contentious cause — questioned a years-long system of disposing of impounded cars. Eventually, an alternate method of selling the vehicles was tested, and it drastically increased the money reaped by the city. Despite the gains, some resented Jaber’s brash political style. For all his electoral popularity, he had enemies who would like to see him exit the political stage. From the text he received, Jaber knew a little about the man who’d been asking about him. He was bald, and he drove a reddish, late-model Explorer. On May 1, while visiting his aunt in North Canton, Jaber spotted a red Explorer. “Two houses down from [the] house, I see a maroon Explorer,” Jaber said in a recent interview. He got in his aunt’s car and drove up next to the vehicle. “I said, ‘Can I help you?’ ” he said. Jaber told the man inside the Explorer that his aunt participated in the neighborhood’s crime watch, and that he was checking up on a suspicious vehicle. “I work for Spectrum,” the man told him. “I’m in the neighborhood getting new accounts.” But the councilman was far from convinced, sure that the man in the red Explorer, who had been in Barberton the day before, was now in North Canton scoping him out. “I said, ‘You’re lying,’ ” Jaber said. “ ‘Who are you working for and why are you following me?’ ” The man pulled away and Jaber followed him into a cul-de-sac, where the encounter ended. But during the confrontation, the councilman took a photo of the driver in hopes of identifying him. He believes he did identify the man, and what he found stunned him. The man in the red Explorer continued to question friends, neighbors and associates of Jaber. On May 4, the man talked to the manager at a business near Rocky’s Gas, Jaber’s Barberton convenience and gas establishment. There wasn’t much to tell, and the inquisitor moved on to an old girlfriend of the councilman, going to her home three times before she answered, Jaber said. This time, about the second week of May, he was with another man, and the questions were more direct. “Do you believe he’s a good councilman and has he ever done anything illegal in your eyes?” the men asked, according to Jaber's friend. They didn’t talk long, Jaber said. “The only thing I know he did illegal was dip his steak in ketchup,” she told the men. The councilman is known to his Facebook followers as an enthusiastic advocate for ketchup and its use with most foods. The older investigator also told her he’d been working on the case since Jaber started on council. She declined to answer some of his questions. The men left and drove away. Jaber said he heard of other confrontations. On May 18, another associate was asked about the number of vehicles the councilman owned — two, he said. Other questions followed. “He replied to him, ‘None of your business,’ ” Jaber said. “ ’Who are you?’ ” Jaber said he has been investigated before and didn’t like the experience then, either. The councilman said a relative, who eventually pleaded guilty to bribery and tax evasion charges in October 2020 for tax years 2014-2017, ran afoul of the law. “The FBI and local officers checked me out,” Jaber said. “… They investigated me, but I had no wrongdoing.” Jaber did some investigative work of his own, tracking down the man he believes was hired to investigate him. While doing so, he also discovered, he said, the party who hired the PI — information he’s not ready to make public. The private investigator, however, is another matter. Jaber said former Brimfield Police Chief David Oliver, who developed a massive Facebook following several years ago before he ran into legal issues, was the man in the red Explorer. In January 2016, Oliver pleaded no contest to four misdemeanor violations related to his time as chief. Since then, he has restructured his life and founded a private investigation firm. A neighbor of Jaber's said she was questioned April 29 by a man who identified himself as David Oliver. In a phone interview, the woman, who did not wish to be identified for fear of repercussions, said she was taken aback by the experience. ”It caught me off guard,” she said. “… [He] introduced himself to me as David Oliver: ‘I’m a private investigator.’ ” She told the investigator what little she knew about Jaber. The councilman walked his dog every day about 5 or 5:30 in the morning, but most of her knowledge of Jaber came from her trips to Rocky’s, which is near Jaber’s home and hers. “I stop at the gas station sometimes to get my gas and a Monster drink,” she said. “I was caught off guard, so that’s why I brought it up to him. [Jaber’s] a pretty good guy to me.” On Father’s Day, June 20, the councilman said, he made a discovery that angered him. “I had a flat tire [and] I jacked up my car to put the spare tire on,” he said. “I see something taped underneath my wheel well. It was a GPS unit.” Jaber said he believes the device was being used to track his movements in one of his two vehicles. “It’s definitely illegal, of course,” he said. The discovery raised the stakes to another level and confirmed, to him, his belief he was being targeted by political opponents. “There’s no doubt I’m being harassed as an elected official carrying out the will of my constituents,” he said. “This is not the first time attempts have been made to silence me or block my ability to function for my ward.” The councilman said when he ran for council, political opponents questioned his residency, but failed to stop his candidacy. He said he spends much of his free time caring for an aunt and grandmother, which often takes him out of Barberton. Most of the rest of his time is spent at Rocky’s, which is open until midnight. In a phone interview on Tuesday, Oliver said it would be a breach of ethics to discuss his clients or who he might be hired to investigate. “We don’t discuss who we are investigating,” he said. “We don’t discuss any of that.” Oliver said he has nothing to do with tracking devices. “My suggestion is, if he found a GPS unit in the wheel well of his car, he needs to be concentrating on someone else other than me,” Oliver said. “We have nothing to do with any GPS unit he may have or not have found.” Oliver said his experience in court more than five years ago led to a turbulent period in his life where he reevaluated what he was doing and where he was going. He said he works to operate ethically and with an appreciation for other people’s perspectives. He still posts daily on his Facebook page, and has built up a new following. “I can tell you I’m not interested in him right now [and] we are currently working no case involving him,” Oliver said. “… I wish him the best of luck in whatever he’s doing.” Jaber said whatever the status of any investigation, he remains focused on his role as councilman and a business owner. Recently, he became a notary and plans to offer that service at his establishment. He, like Oliver, has a strong Facebook following and uses his posts to promote city businesses and the political positions that have challenged the status quo. Currently, he’s pushing the city to sell its residential real estate holdings and better communicate which commercial properties are available and at what price. A commendation for a local MMA fighter is on his council to-do list. Jaber said he and his shadow could have easily resolved many of the questions the man in the red Explorer wanted answered. “All [he] had to do is walk up to me like a man and ask questions,” he said.

The fort is located on the Fleckenstein farm just north of Fort Loramie. When the posts were removed the holes they left behind were filled with topsoil, which was packed down and took on the shape of the removed posts. Shipley has scraped around some of the molds to bring out their shape. A few the posts broke off at their base, leaving original wood behind. Spraying water on the molds helps keep the soil from drying out and crumbling away. For more photos go to sidneydailynews.com. Luke Gronneberg | Sidney Daily News Fort’s location had been unknown for more than 200 years By Kyle Shaner Sidney Daily News FORT LORAMIE — The location of the 18th century fort for which the village of Fort Loramie is named, which had been lost for approximately 220 years, has been rediscovered north of the village. Wayne’s Legion Research Group, an amateur archaeological group led by West Liberty resident Greg Shipley, discovered the location of the north wall of the fort on Ted and Linda Fleckenstein’s farm, approximately 100 yards north of Loramie Creek. “It’s been the most important single discovery of something that I’ve ever done, and I’ve found a lot of incredible things,” Shipley said. “But I never really thought that I would find a fort wall. Nobody has seen this since probably about 1800; 220 years ago was the last time anybody ever knew where this wall existed because they pulled the logs out, and it was gone.” Wayne’s Legion Research Group, which is entirely self-funded, has conducted archaeological digs on the Fleckenstein property since September 2013. The group discovered the site of Pierre-Louis de Lorimier’s trading post that year and discovered other artifacts during the past eight years, but the site of the fort remained elusive. Many people doubted that a stockaded fort ever existed near Fort Loramie, Shipley said, with some accounts stating there was only a blockhouse. However, he and other members of Wayne’s Legion Research Group continued the search in the hopes that they would find the fort. “A lot of people didn’t really believe that after the Treaty of Greenville that they had fortified this as a stockaded fort,” Shipley said. “But I guess they called it Fort Loramie because indeed it’s stockaded.” The group discovered a black stripe about a foot under the ground on Oct. 2, 2020, which they suspected could be a trench line for the fort. Knowing they would need a lot of time and favorable weather to complete the excavation, they paused their search until July 6. About a dozen members of the group resumed the excavation this summer, removing 3 inches of dirt at a time from 10 foot by 10 foot squares. They eventually discovered the north stockade line of the fort, which is 48 feet 3.5 inches in length, much larger than Shipley had expected. “We knew it would be around but didn’t really know for sure until some of them started doing research and all that stuff,” Linda Fleckenstein said. The discovery marks the first time in almost 50 years that a stockade line was discovered in Ohio, Shipley said. The site of Fort Laurens was excavated in the early 1970s in Bolivar, which is in eastern Ohio. With the discovery, visitors have been a common sight at the Fort Loramies excavation as the Fleckensteins and their friends come to watch Wayne’s Legion Research Group work. “Everybody treats us like we’re the Little League ballgame, and everybody comes and watches us,” Shipley said. “And it’s really fun.” The tree trunks that made up the walls of Fort Loramies are gone, likely scavenged by pioneers around 1800 after the fort had been abandoned by the military, Shipley said. “The pioneers came along and used this for like a quick source of building material after the military abandoned this post about 1800 – there was nobody here anymore – maybe even as early as 1798 or early ‘99,” he said. The holes left by the tree trunks, ranging from 6.5 to 12 inches in diameter, created molds that were filled with topsoil and left a clear outline of where the north wall once had stood. Wood fragments that probably broke off when pioneers removed the posts also were found in the dirt and will be preserved. “Most people didn’t really think there was a fort here,” Shipley said. “And now it’s undeniable. It’s irrefutable that this was a stockaded fortification.” Based on research, which includes United States Department of War documents, Shipley said Fort Loramies was constructed in October 1795 by Gen. Anthony Wayne’s soldiers and had 27 men permanently stationed there. It was a valuable site because of its proximity to Loramie Creek and the St. Marys River – waterways used in transporting military supplies. Supplies from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, would float down the Ohio River and then up the Great Miami River. The waterway would be navigable until the area of Loramies – named for French-Canadian Pierre-Louis de Lorimier, who built a trading post in the area in 1769. The supplies then were transported approximately 11 miles on land to the St. Marys River. From there they could be shipped to Fort Wayne and Fort Defiance, critical outposts in fights against the British and Native Americans. “If it hadn’t been for the Wayne period, who knows if the United States ever would have expanded further,” Shipley said, adding the areas south of the Great Lakes could have been controlled by the British and become part of Canada. Hostilities started to subside with the Aug. 3, 1795, signing of the Treaty of Greenville between the United States and Native American tribes. That treaty led some people to believe the United States wouldn’t have needed a fort at Fort Loramie, but Shipley said Wayne still saw the area as vital to countering the continued British presence in the region. “I think Wayne still thought that he was going to have to go up there and push the British,” Shipley said. “He wanted to push the British out of America. “I think he always had in mind this would be the critical supply hub for his campaign to push the British back out of the northern edge of the Northwest Territory.” After the British abandoned much of the region in 1796, the Americans were able to use the Great Lakes for transportation of supplies. Thus, the recently constructed Fort Loramies was no longer valuable to the American military and soon abandoned, though evidence of its presence remains. “We’ve never stopped finding things. Every day we find amazing things that has to do with the beginning of the old Northwest Territory,” Shipley said, which includes buttons from military uniforms, canister shots used in cannons and Spanish coins minted in Guatemala and Peru. Wayne’s Legion Research Group soon hopes to find remnants of the east and west walls of Fort Loramies. They have a general idea of where the walls would have been but won’t know for sure until they start digging. In the corners of the fort would have been blockhouses that'}]"

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 4:06 am Cloudy skies this morning will become partly cloudy this afternoon. Slight chance of a rain shower. High 77F. Winds W at 5 to 10 mph.. Mainly clear. Low 59F. Winds light and variable. Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 4:06 am There is a rock with a plaque dedicated to Edgar “Tan Pop” Buell in downtown Edon, just south of the double stop light on East Indiana Street. Everyone sees it but nobody looks at it anymore because most of those who know the story behind it — especially the Hmong people of Laos — now live in Minneapolis. Buell dedicated 20 years to fighting communism in Southeast Asia, raising a civilian army through acts of kindness that challenged the philosophy of Mao Zedong, founding father of the People’s Republic of China. It’s claimed the former Edon area resident saved more than 70,000 people during the Vietnam War. Buell was 47 years old and grieving the loss of his wife Mattie when he left his family farm in Steuben County, Indiana, a mile and a half west of Edon, to serve as a missionary. “Mom passed when she was 43,” Buell’s son Howard said. “I was in the Army, my sister was married and he felt kind of lost. He picked up a farming magazine one day and saw a government ad for the International Volunteer Service (IVS). At first, it was just his way to make a trip around the world, work a few months and come back home.” The Edon Commercial newspaper announced his departure in May 1960, stating that he “Embarked Saturday on a job which offers as an inducement long hours of backbreaking work with archaic tools in a disease-infested land. IVS, an organization dedicated to the better understanding among people throughout the world, is sending Mr. Buell to Laos in southeastern Asia to further its diplomatic work.” IVS was based on the principles of Christian pacifism and Buell himself said it was “people-to-people work. I’m supposed to show them modern farming methods and at the same time a better way of life. This isn’t a white collar job. I’ll get my hands plenty dirty.” Six weeks later, refugees started flowing into his base camp at Sam Thong. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army had supplied arms and military advisors to Laos’ Communist Pathet Lao Party to support the Ho Chi Minh Trail into Vietnam and they were attacking Hmong villages, which the CIA had recruited to disrupt the trail. “The Hmong were hill people, looked down on by everyone else,” Howard said. “It was kind of like how we treated the Indians here. They were being exterminated even before the Vietnam War started.” Farmer Buell, who used every bit of his 1936 Metz High School education to raise pigs and learn one new Hmong word every day, got on his shortwave radio and raised bureaucratic hell among the stuffed shirts. A U.S. Army veteran of World War II (1943-45), Buell pulled in everything from clothes, rice and medicine to 20,000 live tilapia from Bangkok, Thailand. “There aren’t enough land crops so we added fish ponds,” he said in a 1967 interview with Walter Cronkite. “Tilapia multiply fast. It’s a simple way we get food into people and make them feel not like we help but they’re helping themselves.” He built a one-room schoolhouse and recruited a teacher to instruct Hmong teachers, who then went out and built their own schools. Within three years they were educating 80,000 students throughout Laos. Buell built a bamboo hospital and recruited a nurse to teach Hmong nurses and they started their own clinics. He also became a midwife and surgeon who delivered 30 babies and operated on battlefield injuries. “It was all see-and-do in Sam Thong, then go out and teach others,” Dr. Charles Weldon said during the Cronkite interview. When trucks couldn’t bring in supplies fast enough, Buell scrounged up a bulldozer and carved out a landing strip. When that wasn’t enough, he bought more, from his own savings, and taught others how to drive them. They built 100 airfields and countless helicopter landing zones in the mountains for the CIA’s secret Air America airlines. “Just seeing those planes, even if they don’t deliver anything, has more effect than anything else,” Buell said. “And those helios have saved many, many lives.” When Viet Cong guerrillas got too close to Sam Thong, Buell organized and trained a 5,000-man defense force. He had one Jeep shot out from under him. He also wanted the Hmong to grow sweet potatoes instead of opium, but given dire poverty and limited resources, he reportedly declared, “If you’re gonna grow, grow it good, but don’t let anybody smoke the stuff.” The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) called him a “regional advisor” but the Hmong knew him as “Tan Pop, Mr. Sent From Above.” Author John Steinbeck (“Cannery Row,” “Of Mice and Men,” “The Grapes of Wrath”) toured Sam Thong in 1967 and wrote: “I think Pop is an example of how the ancient gods were born. The story invariably goes in olden times the people did not live well as they do now. Then a stranger appeared and he taught us to use the plow and how to sow and how to harvest. He brought us healing medicines to make us healthy and he gave us pride so we could not be afraid and, when we had learned this, he went away.” The Paris Peace Accords of 1973 put an end to U.S. military and economic aid to Laos but Buell stayed another year, working as a teacher in the Capital of Vientiane. In 1974 the American Embassy discovered the Pathet Lao and Viet Cong put a $25,000 price on his head, with or without the rest of his body. American pilot Les Strouse smuggled Buell out of the country by driving him to the airport in one of his own uniforms and putting him on a Continental flight to Bangkok. Buell died in his sleep on Dec. 29, 1980, while visiting friends in Manila. “He just went to sleep and didn’t wake up,” Howard said. “He loved the people but it was a hard life. He had two heart attacks in Laos and almost didn’t survive the second one. “Dad helped a lot people come to the U.S.,” he added. “There’s a big Hmong population around Minneapolis and their kids have really flourished.

Stone Foltz, 20, a 2019 Buckeye Valley High School graduate, was hospitalized early Friday after an incident at the BGSU chapter of the Pi Kappa Alpha International Fraternity. BGSU officials have since stripped the fraternity of its status as a student organization this weekend following reports of the incident. Stone Foltz: What we know about the BGSU student who died after an alleged fraternity hazing incident Sean Alto, an attorney representing the Foltz family, said Foltz was at an off-campus event organized by the fraternity where he was given ""a copious amount of alcohol."" Foltz was dropped off that night at his apartment by members of the fraternity, where he was later found by his roommates, Alto said, adding that the roommates called 911 and Foltz was transported to a hospital where he was in ""dire"" condition. Alto confirmed on Sunday night that Foltz had died in a written statement calling the young man a ""beloved son, brother, and grandson."" ""The death of Stone Foltz is a tragedy. At this time we are gathering all of the facts leading to his untimely death and we have no interest in commenting on speculation,"" the statement indicates. ""We do ask that you please show respect and consideration for Stone’s family. Despite their unbearable grief, they agreed to donate Stone’s organs so that others may have a second chance at life."" Meanwhile, Ohio lawmakers are working to revive a bill that would stiffen penalties for students involved in such hazing rituals. Workers removed the Greek letters from the fraternity\'s off-campus house Sunday morning, and Bowling Green police are investigating the events that led to Foltz\'s death. More: Anti-hazing, bullying bill Collin\'s Law stalls in Ohio Senate Education Committee ""We are aware of the incident and we are currently investigating,"" Bowling Green police Lt. Dan Mancuso said. He would not provide further comment on the investigation. A dispatcher said on Sunday afternoon that police had no new information to release. She confirmed that the Bowling Green city police, not the campus police, are investigating the incident. A university spokesperson said the school is assisting police and conducting a parallel student code of conduct investigation. Stone, a student athlete in high school, was ""a beloved member"" of the Buckeye Valley Local School District, Superintendent Andrew Miller said Sunday in a written statement. ""Stone was a friend to everyone who was blessed to know him,"" Miller said in the statement. ""The Buckeye Valley community mourns the loss of this amazing young person and we stand ready to support the Foltz family in the days ahead. ” The news about Foltz comes just one week after a Virginia Commonwealth University chapter of the Delta Chi fraternity was suspended following a death linked to a hazing. Adam Oakes, 19, of Sterling, Virginia, was found dead in an off-campus house on Feb. 27 after he was blindfolded and given a large amount of alcohol, according to news reports. BGSU issued a statement on Saturday saying the fraternity has been suspended. ""We are working with local law enforcement, who are actively taking the lead in investigating this unfolding situation,"" the statement said. ""BGSU is committed to not just the student conduct and law enforcement investigations, but a full inquiry into each Greek chapter\'s prevention and compliance responsibilities under University policies prohibiting hazing."" Yesterday, Bowling Green State University placed Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity on interim suspension for alleged hazing activity. We are working with local law enforcement, who are actively taking the lead in investigating this unfolding situation. (1/8) A university spokesman said the letters were removed from the Pi Kappa Alpha\'s off-campus residence Sunday morning because the fraternity chapter is no longer recognized as a registered student organization. The international Pi Kappa Alpha fraternal organization issued a statement saying it is ""horrified and outraged"" at the incident. The national organization said it has suspended the chapter and instructed chapter leadership to cooperate with all investigations being conducted. The statement also said the organization will pursue permanent suspension of the chapter as new details are learned, as well as expulsion of all chapter members from the international fraternity. The statement said Foltz was an ""unreported new member,"" more commonly known as a pledge. Foltz graduated from Buckeye Valley High School in Delaware County in 2019. He played multiple sports while he was in school. His freshman-year roommate at Bowling Green, Duncan Faulk, said Foltz was known for his outgoing personality. ""Stone was one of the greatest friends I\'ve ever had,"" he said. Foltz had a reputation of being there for friends and family when they needed him, Faulk said. ""I know he will be missed, and this will be very hard on a lot of people,"" he said. Bowling Green freshman Dylan Griev told the Toledo Blade he was shocked when he heard the news about Foltz. ""I know it\'s happened at other universities in the past, but I didn\'t think BG was that kind of university,” he said to the newspaper. Griev said suspending the fraternity is an appropriate response, but added ""I hope they do more."" ""I think (the university is) taking their time to pick apart what\'s happened,"" he said. ""I hope the punishment is appropriate to what\'s happened. I feel really bad for the kid and his family."" Morgan Nance, a junior and member of the coed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega, told the Blade that she thinks the university is taking the matter seriously. ""I think (suspension is) the right way to go about it,” she said Sunday. ""Obviously there\'s an issue with that organization and something needs to be done."" At least one online petition has been started, calling for the permanent removal of Pi Kappa Alpha from BGSU. Nearly 1,400 people had signed it by Sunday evening. “As Bowling Green State University students, we refuse to stand behind the same people that would allow the loss of a beloved student on a campus organization’s off-campus housing,” the petition at change.org reads. Foltz\'s death comes months after a law designed to increase the potential criminal penalties for hazing stalled in the Ohio Senate. Collin\'s Law was named for Collin Wiant, a freshman at Ohio University from Dublin, who died after collapsing on the floor of an unofficial, off-campus fraternity house on Nov. 12, 2018. A coroner ruled that Wiant died of asphyxiation due to nitrous oxide ingestion after he inhaled a canister of the gas, also known as a whippit. More: This is a story about fraternity hazing and the life and death of Collin Wiant. The law would have expanded the legal definition of hazing to include forced consumption of drugs and alcohol and would have increased the crime from a fourth-degree misdemeanor to a second-degree misdemeanor, with the potential of a felony if the offense involved drugs or alcohol. A state senator who was a proponent of the law said she hasn\'t given up on it. ""We\'re so close to reintroducing this bill,"" Sen. Stephanie Kunze, R-Hilliard, said Sunday. Kunze said she kept working on the law after it stalled in the Senate Education Committee in December. She said she has been working with legislators and organizations that represent schools to make sure the bill\'s language is clear, and she is in regular contact with Collin Wiant\'s family. Former Rep. Dave Greenspan, a Westlake Republican who sponsored the house version of the bill, said the alleged Bowling Green hazing should make the bill\'s passage a priority. ""I talked to Sen. Kunze last night after I heard about the story at Bowling Green,"" he said. Greenspan said he is making himself available for discussions about the bill, even though he is no longer in the General Assembly. Legislators expressed concerns over the severity of the penalties, he said. Forcing someone to consume alcohol or drugs would be punishable with prison time under Collin\'s Law. If the bill would have been signed into law in December, Greenspan stressed, it would have been in place during the alleged weekend hazing.

Chuck Muston. “We can’t turn that down. He asked, ‘What can I do?’ and looked around, and he noticed these pictures on the wall.” The Fairborn High School JROTC room had an old command staff board that displayed the portraits of JROTC officers and club leaders. It was old, needed to be updated, and Woodward decided he was the right person to get the job done. But he didn’t stop there. “We came in, worked with him, got everything he needed, and he ran with it,” Muston said. Woodward’s project not only replaced the command staff wall, but provided space on the board to show the portraits of national Air Force leadership. He also created a second board to display the photographs of Fairborn JROTC graduates who went on to serve in the military. It was fun, but “a lot of work,” Woodward said. Woodward was diagnosed as on the autism spectrum with a moderate cognitive delay at four years old. His uncle, Rob Gast, took him to join the Cub Scouts, and Woodward immediately fell in love with it. His grandfather, Lt. Col. Gary Woodward, served in the Air Force for 41 years, and Woodward is actively involved with both the Boy Scouts and JROTC. “I couldn’t be more proud,” Gast said. “He’s always said, ‘I want to be an Eagle Scout,’ and there is nothing that could have gotten his way. Just the sheer perserverance and determination that he has shown all the way through, and loving every minute of it.” Typically, children with autism have a tough time connecting with people and making friends, his uncle said. Not Woodward. He makes friends everywhere he goes. “I can’t go anywhere without someone knowing who Jonathan is,” Gast said. “Either from Scouts or from ROTC. He feels like he’s a part of this. He loved Boy Scouts, loved camping, loved doing the merit badges. He just loves the people that he’s with.” Woodward’s favorite part of Boy Scouts is going to the gun range, but he also enjoys swimming and kayaking. Gast, an Eagle Scout himself, is the Assistant Scout Master at Troop 167, in Kettering. When the family moved to Fairborn, Woodward stayed with the Kettering troop. “All the way through all his merit badges, all his way up through the rest of the ranks, I couldn’t begin to thank everyone…it’s been a team effort,” he continued. Woodward’s Eagle Scout project had a strong focus on leadership. Gast describes Jonathan as a lead-by-example type, showing his peers how to do things rather than explaining, and the students in both JROTC and the Scouts showed up for him on multiple occasions. Scouts volunteered their Saturdays to help. JROTC students showed up to his Eagle Scout presentation, helping him set up and cheering him on. “The fact that these young cadets showed up today for this is a testament to what’s available to the kids,” Gast said. “It gave him opportunities that he would never have had outside these two organizations. It is a unique experience, but they are very well-meshed in how they work with leadership, teamwork, team building.” Now that his presentation is done, Woodward will likely have his Eagle Scout court of honor in July. “I cannot wait to see when he finally gets his Eagle,” Gast said. “His face lights up.” At his Eagle Scout presentation Wednesday, Woodward’s face lit up again. Muston and Maj.
