It is so important to have a strong support system as you strive to be successful as a student and as you strive to be successful in life itself. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my parents, for not pressuring me, but pushing me and encouraging me to do the best that I could do. Thank you for everything you do for me, I couldn’t have done this without you. Although we’re in a time of uncertainty, the class of 2020 will forever be remembered. It is our job to make it so that we’re not remembered for being encumbered by the difficulties that currently beset us, but by our ability to overcome all of these obstacles and continue to thrive. No matter where we are all headed, I am confident that we will prevail. If your student is a top grad who would normally be speaking at graduation, please send a copy of the prepared speech, a headshot, his or her hometown and the name of the school to wvictora@nwfdailynews.com We are also accepting parent- or student-submitted photos celebrating your graduate if he or she attends school in Okaloosa, Walton or Santa Rosa counties. Send those pictures to ntomecek@nwfdailynews.com'}]"

the Middle East weren\'t aiming to break a record. But when the coronavirus made ship stops in foreign countries too risky, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and the USS San Jacinto were ordered to keep moving and avoid all port visits. On Thursday, as they steamed through the North Arabian Sea, they notched their 161st consecutive day at sea, breaking the previous Navy record of 160 days. And they\'re on pace to crush it, since they won\'t hit land again until they get home to Virginia later this year. The milestone, Navy Capt. Kyle Higgins said, ""is not one that I think we really wanted but one that the circumstances of the world thrust upon us. And we embraced it with style.” When the ships left home in January, COVID-19 was just starting to emerge. By the time they crossed the Atlantic and moved into the Mediterranean Sea, the virus was escalating. In March, Vice Adm. Jim Malloy, the Navy\'s 5th Fleet commander, ordered a stop to all port visits to reduce the chance of spreading the virus through the fleet. Other ships were battling outbreaks, including the USS Theodore Roosevelt, which got sidelined in Guam. With that, Higgins, the Eisenhower commander, and Capt. Edward Crossman, the San Jacinto commander, knew their sailors wouldn’t set foot on land for some time. Both were interviewed a few days before the ships broke the record. For more than five months, the Eisenhower, an aircraft carrier, and the San Jacinto, the guided-missile cruiser that accompanies it, have been at sea, with no onboard visitors and strict controls over how aircraft deliver their supplies. The isolation has been challenging. Port calls not only give sailors time for rest and relaxation, they also allow experts to come aboard to do difficult repairs. When the San Jacinto\'s helicopter bay door broke, the crew members had to get creative. It was the middle of the night, and they realized they needed to replace a large sprocket. “My guys did the research, and they said, ‘Hey, these 90-pound dumbbells are made from the same material that we need for this gear,’” Crossman said in an interview from the ship. So, they took the dumbbell down to the machine shop and created the part. “If they were magicians,"" Crossman said, ""they’d have 100 rabbits running around the house because they keep pulling them out of their hats.” Petty Officer 1st Class Joshua Grimes, a machinist mate, is one of the sailors responsible for keeping machinery operating. When the door broke, it was his team that figured out how to fix it. “I was skeptical, but the way things were going I didn\'t really count it out,” he said. “Definitely the helo hangar door is the craziest thing we pulled off.” On the Eisenhower, crew members had to safely replace a large, critical fan motor for the flight deck. It took four teams from the electrical, engineer, supply and machinist departments, but after consulting with experts on shore, they broke down the fan, got it onto a makeshift platform and installed the new part. “Normally, this job would have called for cutting into the ship to get it down there,” said Higgins. “I’m happy to report that the fan and motor are operating fine and we are 100% operational again because of it.” Crew entertainment has also gotten creative. Disappointed sailors watched as they passed countries along the Mediterranean and headed through the Red Sea without stopping. “This is my first ship as well as my first deployment,” said Petty Officer 2nd Class Dionesha Simmons. “It’s a bit of a struggle just because I was looking forward to some of the port calls.” Instead, she said, she\'s having fun making brunch for the Eisenhower crew on “Waffle Saturdays.” She and others take over to give the cooks a break. Higgins and Crossman said they\'re trying to give sailors dedicated time off — sometimes a full 24 hours to do whatever they want, other times a couple days off in a row. They plan more swim days and “steel beach picnics” when sailors can wear civilian clothes and barbecue on the flight deck. The Eisenhower crew had cigar socials with jazz music. One popular event, said Petty Officer 1st Class Travis Bush, was a slam dunk basketball contest that he said relieved stress and showed off some talent. On the San Jacinto, sailors substituted a mustache contest for the March Madness tournament. The 64-person bracket competed to see who could grow the ugliest mustache. “There’s definitely some disappointment in not going into port, especially considering our original plans. But we’ve made it this far,” Grimes said. “It actually makes a lot of us feel very proud that we can be part of this. ... The longest I’ve been underway is a little over 40 days, and it’s destroyed that record.” The 160-day record was set in February 2002 by the USS Theodore Roosevelt, early in the Afghanistan war. The previous 152-day record was set by the Eisenhower in 1980 during the Iranian hostage crisis. Navy historians say it\'s difficult to check long into the past, because records are spotty. Both ship captains planned celebrations. Crossman said sailors were competing to design the certificate that they’ll get, adding, “We’re kind of proud of the fact that we’re taking the record, but we’re going to blow it away.” Higgins ordered “the best dinner” the crew could make, with surf and turf, a big cake and ice cream. He said he\'ll wait before gathering the crew for a celebratory photo. “It’ll be 161 days when we break the record, but we think we may be out here a little bit longer and the potential to pass that mark by quite a bit is fairly good,"" he said. “So we might wait for a more round, even number.” Now one critical question remains: Which ship will pull into Norfolk last, snagging the record? “I\'ve had a couple requests to see if we could stay out longer to make sure we beat the Ike,” Crossman said with a laugh. Higgins says they\'ve joked about it. His response? “Time will tell.”'}]"

to go to sleep when he had a “light bulb moment.” He was lying in his bed, chatting with friends about the coronavirus pandemic and how a Floridian bought the web domain for reopenNC.com — a blank website with an address encouraging North Carolina to reopen. COMPLETE COVERAGE | Coronavirus in Florida Murphy — who said he’s opposed to the country opening back up too soon, citing fear of “another bird flu” — said he didn’t want to see other states follow suit and start campaigns to prematurely re-open states. So he took things into his own hands. As first exposed on a viral Reddit post and subsequently reported on by web-security blogger Brian Krebs and Mother Jones, Murphy bought dozens of web domains including reopenGA.com, reopenAL.com, reopenAK.com and more over the weekend. “I thought, ‘we can use this for good,’” he told the Times-Union. As noted by Krebs, reopen sites — including reopenPA.com — are tied to grassroots campaigns for quarantine protests and gridlocks. Others are connected to anti-gun control pages. Murphy said the premise was to buy the domains before protesters or extremist groups had the chance to do so themselves. Ultimately, he planned to sell the domains to organizations or non-profits devoted to what he calls “real news.” He cited science advocacy groups, MoveOn and the ACLU as examples. “I bought like 200 names all together,” he said. “I bought everything I could find. I had to go through every iteration I could think of. It took me quite a long time.” Murphy said he bought domains linked to phrases including “reopen” and “liberate,” after “Trump opened his mouth about liberating.” Domain history records show Murphy purchased the web domains last week, linking them back to his name, home phone number, home address and personal email. That’s when he said things went awry. “All of a sudden on Sunday, I was at home and the phone just started blowing up,” Murphy said. “My wife was freaking out. The cat was out of the bag.” “You’re a scum sucker,” one caller said. “You should be dead,” said another. “That was just the tip of the iceberg.” Murphy pulled the landline entirely. “It was just craziness,” he said. “When I bought all of these, I thought nothing of it. I didn’t hide my name. I honestly didn’t think it was a big deal. Plus, it costs an extra $10 per site to hide your name.” But when hackers, doxxers and trolls came for Murphy — and his business — he ultimately shelled the extra money to wipe the domain listing information. “[The Eco Relics] Facebook page was hacked into a different language,” he said. “All the liberals were attacking me, thinking I was against them. Conservative guys, I didn’t get one email from a conservative, which is disappointing, because what I was trying to do was exactly what [liberals] would want to do.” Murphy said he spent “at least $4,000” on purchasing the domains and ultimately, scrubbing his ties to each. Records still show the domains trace back to a recent Florida purchase, but no longer list Murphy’s name or specifics. “It was probably a waste of money,” he said. “This is just a huge bill on my credit card.” This wasn’t the first time Murphy has taken an extreme approach regarding the coronavirus. Earlier this month, he offered to lease Eco Relic’s lumber drying machine to hospitals as a way to sterilize large numbers of N95 masks at once. After three days “nonstop” on the phone trying to reach state officials and knowing the machine was too big for hospitals, Murphy gave up. “That’s one of the reasons that prompted me [to buy the domains],” he said. “I realized how critical this was. When I saw people that want to reopen the country, it was killing me.” Murphy said he wants the Jacksonville community to know he “was not trying to profit from this.” “I was trying to do good. I’d really like to find an organization to take these over,” he said. “I did my job. I want somebody to do their job. Everybody thinks the worst. Everybody thinks everything’s a scam it’s just really disappointing.” Still, naysayers question Murphy’s motives. According to Krebs, sites like reopenPA.com and reopenMN.com are allegedly owned by Murphy. Both of those websites re-route to gun right advocacy groups calling to end quarantine. The websites’ ownership has since been scrubbed and the Times-Union was unable to verify original ownership. When asked about this discrepancy, Murphy responded, “I don’t think I own those.” He said he bought so many at once, he’s lost track of which sites are his anymore. He added a promise to sue anyone re-directing one of his domains to a gun rights site. Following an interview with the Times-Union, Murphy provided a list of domains he purchased and screenshots from his GoDaddy dashboard, listing out the domains he owned. Neither reopenPA.com nor reopenMN.com was on his personal list or visible from the dashboard screenshots. “If somebody’s doing that, I don’t own that name. I don’t own that site,” he said. “If you find any, I’ll immediately call GoDaddy [the service provider where Murphy purchased domains from] and shut them down. I’ll also be suing them.” With a deep sigh, Murphy said he was frustrated by how things escalated. “It was just like a torrent of everything coming at me at one time for something I didn’t even do. I was really bummed out,” he said. “My whole purpose of this was I was trying to do something good and save people’s lives. People’s instincts are the worst. The first thing that comes to their mind is ’this guy is evil.’ They don’t think maybe he just bought the domains so he could use them for a good purpose. Nobody came up with that idea.” Emily Bloch: (904) 359-4083 This content is being provided for free as a public service to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 8:23 pm Dr. Jomo Cousins is the senior pastor of Love First Christian Center in Riverview, a city in Hillsborough County. His wife, Dr. Charmaine Cousins, is also a pastor at the church.PHOTOS COURTESY OF DR. JOMO COUSINS BY JENISE GRIFFIN FLORIDA COURIER Long before Dr. Jomo Cousins’ new prayer book was released, the popular Florida-based pastor had garnered worldwide recognition and respect as the “Prayer Guy.” For nearly 11 years, the senior pastor of Love First Christian Center in Riverview has consistently hosted a 6:30 a.m. weekday prayer line which can be accessed via social media, including Facebook, YouTube and Periscope. For about 20 minutes Monday through Friday, the high-spirited pastor delivers live, scripture packed prayers and shares his trademark motivational nuggets to thousands of listeners through the church’s prayer line. Then on Sundays, he preaches to thousands at his church’s three contemporary, biblicallydriven worship services, which are streamed live on the church’s website (LFCC.TV) and via social media. In addition, he hosts a Fresh Wind radio program and has a column that appears in the Christian Voice, a monthly publication. The successful entrepreneur, motivational speaker and former NFL player has another lofty goal: He wants to reach one billion people through prayer. Yes. One BILLION. For a while, the goal was one million. But he’s pretty sure he has surpassed that figure. “God told me a million was too small. I think I’ve already reached a million people,’’ Cousins told the Florida Courier. He estimates that the prayer line is reaching more than 100,000 people a month based on numbers he has been able to track via Facebook Live and other social media vehicles that stream his morning prayers. Thus, his latest book, “Prayer Life: The Conversation – The Workbook that Helps You to Work and Pray Through Life,’’ is a natural progression for the pastor who says people are streaming in on the prayer line from nearly every continent in the world. In “Prayer Life,’’ Cousins guides readers on a journey destined to move them to a closer relationship with God through prayer. The 327-page workbook is filled with questions that prompt self-reflection and includes a Frequently Asked Questions chapter pertaining to prayer. Other chapters deal with the importance of daily prayer, the connection between prayer and trouble, potential reasons for unanswered prayer, dealing with disappointments, and the need for an attitude of thanksgiving. An audio version of the book also is available. Cousins already has two books under his belt – “Fully Equipped: God’s Total Package’’ and “The ABC’s of Success.’’ For those who want to move toward a more successful life, Cousins said it starts with prayer. “Spiritual warfare is real, Cousins relates, ‘’and every Christian should be armed with the tools to walk in the footsteps of God’s promise.’ Cousins is often asked about his ability to quickly recite multiple scriptures from memory at a time – chapter and verse – during his prayers. “It’s an investment of time,” he told the Courier. “I read Scripture a lot in reference to prayer. I’ve done it long enough. I also think it’s my gift. It’s amazing how God will download it to me.’’ Wherever he goes in the world now, he’s recognized. Cousins said he’s often stopped when traveling in the U.S., and out of the country with his family. It usually starts with this question: “Are you the Prayer Guy?’’ The 44-year-old Cousins says in his book, “It was never my intent to be the “Prayer Guy’’ or the young pastor who prays in the morning. My goal was simply to be obedient to God. I made a decision that I really wanted to be about God’s business.’’ “I set my heart that I was going to make what was important to Him important to me. I made a commitment that I was going to start praying on a daily basis. This was a personal commitment (covenant) between me and God.’’ He’s not surprised by the popularity of the prayer line. The key to the success is the consistency. The discipline. “If you can be consistent in an inconsistent world, your light will shine. People are looking for something that’s stable,’’ he remarked. Even while on vacation and on holidays that fall on a weekday, he shows up. And even when his throat hurts. “I know this is what God called me to. I don’t wrestle with it,” he noted. Cousins’ own journey has included a number of triumphs as well as trials. The son of Jennifer Newman and George Cousins was born in Kingston, Jamaica. His childhood was spent in Washington, D.C. He chose to attend Florida A&M University (FAMU) and major in economics. Cousins soon became a standout defensive end on the football team and eventually was drafted in 1998 by the Arizona Cardinals. After a stint in the NFL, he was sidelined because of injuries. He retired from pro football and embarked on a business and consulting career before heeding his call into the ministry. Cousins, who said he didn’t grow up in the church, credits Pro Football Hall of Famer Aeneas Williams with “leading him to the Lord’’ after he was invited to a Bible study at Williams’ home while they were with the Cardinals. “He reached down to me. He changed me,” Cousins said. In July 2008, he started Love First Christian Center in Riverview with the support of his wife, Charmaine, whom he met at FAMU. She also is a pastor at the church. In its first year, the church had grown to a weekly attendance of 300. The Cousins received their doctorate degrees at Tabernacle Bible College. In 2016, the church moved into its debt-free edifice at 12847 Balm River Road in Riverview, a small city located in East Hillsborough County. The three Sunday services – 7:45 a.m., 9:45 a.m. and 11:45 a.m. – attracts more than 2,000 total worshipers. Because of its burgeoning growth, plans already are in the works for a larger sanctuary and an expansive youth center. But in January 2015, while the church was flourishing, the senior pastor’s life took a devastating turn. After visiting a doctor because of a loss of appetite, a blocked intestine was discovered. He was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer. Then came chemotherapy. The cancer didn’t sideline him for long. His wife and another pastor preached for a couple of Sundays each, then he was back in the pulpit – even while wearing a chemo pack. While undergoing treatment at a chemotherapy induction lab in Brandon, he found himself summoned to pray. He ministered to patients as well as the medical staff. Some of the nurses at the lab are now members of his church. And then there were his seasons of loss. His mother died in 2010, his father a year later in 2011, and a brother died last year. In 2012, his daughter Jamya became ill. At age 15, she’s battling an autoimmune disease. Cousins and his wife also have two sons – Jomo II, 20, who is a student at FAMU, and Josiah, 11. His transparency about his own illness, his daughter’s illness as well as his losses have helped to draw people in. Cousins explained that it resonates with people that he hasn’t seen the “manifestation’’ yet of his daughter’s healing. There are times on the prayer line when the tears fall and he can’t help it. “It’s not my goal to cry. On those days, it seems we get the greatest response,’’ said, adding that the callers can relate that he and his family are going through struggles just like them. “We’re not always in a good place; we’re human. As I go through my seasons, I pray my way through,’’ he shared. His favorite prayer? “Lord, help me with me.’’ “I learned my greatest enemy is not the devil; but my poor choices,” he explains. “God provided Adam and Eve with a clear directive. In their haste and misguidance, they choose the wrong path. With that being said, it is always my prayer for God to help me through my imperfection to grow into His perfection.’’ In December, Cousins also made news when he paid $1.3 million in medical debts for about 800 residents living in Riverview, Gibsonton and Wimauma through RIP Medical Debt, a company that buys and abolishes medical debt. At pennies or less on the dollar, donor money is used to pay off debt. Cousins, who knows all too well how staggering medical bills can be, saw it as an opportunity be a blessing to people in the area his church is located. He has received “incredible’’ feedback from the people who were blessed as well as others who were just impressed with the church’s generosity. His own sickness also taught him to take more time for rest and relaxation, something'}]"

Ginsburg’s husband Martin holds the Bible and President Bill Clinton watches at left. The Supreme Court says Ginsburg has died of metastatic pancreatic cancer at age 87. (AP Photo/Marcy Nighswander, File) Kevin Luhrs, Opinions EditorSeptember 25, 2020 In May 2016, President Obama had nominated the Chief Judge of the D.C. Court of Appeals, Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court after the death of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia. It was an election year, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) refused to take action on Garland’s nomination—the seat was filled by Neil Gorsuch, who was appointed by President Trump in 2017. After Scalia’s death, Senate Majority Leader McConnell said, “let’s let the American people decide. The Senate will appropriately revisit the matter when it considers the qualifications of the nominee the next president nominates, whoever that might be.” Four years after this quote, hours after the death of Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Mitch McConnell declared “President Trump’s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.” There are benefits to waiting again. By a 13 point margin in a YouGov poll after Ruth Bader Ginsberg’s death, those polled said they would prefer whoever wins in 2020 to nominate the next Supreme Court justice. If President Trump puts a nominee forward before Election Day, this could swing the election away from Republicans in vulnerable races, which would flip the balance of power in the Senate. If the President waits, however, it would likely fire up his base, specifically Evangelical voters who wish to overturn Roe v. Wade. The rebalancing of the court forces Democrats into a state of desperation. If Republicans lose the Senate and the presidency, the GOP could see retribution in the form of court-packing by Democrats. The idea of court-packing goes back to 1937—Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to expand the size of the court to appoint justices who were friendly to his New Deal programs. This was a gambit that ultimately failed, but the idea didn’t die with his bill. Court-packing is a dangerous idea, and one in which Democrats may find themselves partial to, provided the GOP expands the majority of conservative justices. Granted, this is a rather unpopular idea. In the same YouGov polled mentioned above, 39% of voters polled oppose increasing the size of the Supreme Court compared to 32% of those who support it. Overall, both parties are in an awkward position. Democrats may have to resort to court-packing to regain balance in the Supreme Court, and the GOP is rushing forward with an unpopular timeline for appointing the next Supreme Court justice. This may seem like a blessing for the GOP, but it could be a nightmare for both sides. __ For more information or news tips, or if you see an error in this story or have any compliments or concerns, contact [email protected].

Like many in this nation, I have lost brothers whose goal to make a living wage and be a provider landed them in the prison system on trumped-up marijuana charges – the same marijuana that created a new industry with skyrocketing profits. I have watched sisters struggle to be full-time students because they were forced to work multiple jobs to pay for their education. I have felt the concerns of being a Black parent loathing the day I, too, will have to have the talk with my daughter about the nightmare of being Black in America. Not all of us get to read our children fairy tales; their innocence comes at a price. The feelings that come with being Black are not just felt in the presence of the flashing lights that haunt me, but in the moments I would walk the halls of my school and be called horrible racial slurs by people in MAGA hats. The same students who called me these names at protests would be the people I would have to sit next to in class, knowing that if they could have it their way, I wouldn’t be alive to tell these stories. When my father passed in 2016, I experienced a surge of violence against me just for living in this skin. I had no one to tell me what to expect with this new regime. From Sanford to the burial home in Ohio, the Black experience was the same. Not only did the current president preach this behavior; he also took pride in bringing back sentiments we were all told ended after desegregation. I forgot the pit was this deep! In Sanford, the inequality is felt in our homes and in our pockets. Our median income is half of our neighboring city, Lake Mary. Twenty-two percent of us live below the poverty line. Our unemployment rate is double the national average. These conditions can all change with the policies that Bernard Sanders is bringing to the table. He will eliminate college tuition and student debt. Black women have the highest amount of student loan debt and earn the least when in the job sector. Bernard has plans to close the wealth gap by funding our education system and raising teachers’ pay to a guaranteed $60,000 a year. Finally the possibility that our young ones can actually strive for their dreams without having to compromise their education for dead-end jobs. He is providing the means to reform the system that has given us all sleepless nights. Bernard Sanders is not our savior, but he is our platform to enï¿¾sure change. His message helps us imagine a life where our basic necessities are met. Theft and burglary are the main reason for arrest rates in Sanford, a statistic that would drop if we were living with our basic necessities met. Bernard is giving hope to our children and the coming generations. He promises a world we wish we had been able to dream of, but were too busy losing sleep trying to get by. He legalize marijuana and expunge prior marijuana convictions. He will ensure that the money from legal marijuana is reinvested into communities that were affected by the ‘War on Drugs.’ This means a new life for so many of our loved ones who were told they’ll never see the light of day. He will ensure that those affected by these harsh policies will have educational opportunities for either trade school or training resources to start their own businesses. Bernard resonates with our history and was fighting with us in the civil rights movement and is the only candidate who continues to fight for these same freedoms. He fought for universal healthcare when socialist values could land you in jail. He acknowledges that the solutions are deeply rooted in systemic change. I support Bernie Sanders for president in 2020 because this pit has finally been opened by his ideas. There is no way we will survive like this for another generation. This game we are on our way to winning needs to be played our way. On February 22 at Coastline Park, 900 W. Ninth Street in Sanford, we are having a “Bokey for Bernie” 3-on-3 basketball tournament. This will be a great opportunity to connect with our community at a deeper level with Freedom Sessions being hosted. Each player on the winning team will win a $50 gift card. This will be a family-friendly event and a great way to encourage our young ones to have fun and shoot some hoops. Food will be served, so come early on Saturday, February 22 at 12 p.m. Dashawn DeBose is a Sanford native. Log In Keep it Clean.

Gaetz also potentially violated rules on accepting gifts by allowing a TV studio to be set up at his father\'s house in Niceville. The payments came from Gaetz\'s Member\'s Representational Allowance, which is a government fund for each member of Congress to run their office and pay staff. The Wyoming Secretary of State office shows Presidential Communications and Strategy LLC is registered to Registered Agents Inc., a company that advertises keeping identities of business owners private. Politico reported the company is connected to Darren Beattie, a former White House aide who was forced out his job after appearing at a convention that promotes speakers with white supremacist views. Politico cited ""multiple sources familiar with the arrangement"" for the connection between Beattie and the Wyoming company. Gaetz announced in 2019 that he was hiring Beattie as a special adviser for speechwriting. ► Beattie hired: Matt Gaetz hires ex-White House speechwriter with white nationalist ties ► Questioned on rent: Rep.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 8:37 pm PINELLAS PARK — The grounds at the Wagon Wheel Flea Market, once plentiful with a din of humanity, cars and wares to be sold, sit empty and lonesome now, vacant of their once boisterous clamor. They will remain empty, a half-century’s worth of history left to fade away under the hot Florida sun. A community staple for more than 50 years, the market — which rests in unincorporated Pinellas Park along Park Boulevard — will remain closed, its owners announced on June 10, marking the end of an era in Pinellas County. What began in 1966 as a roadside stand, Hardy Huntley would mold into what would become of the largest flea markets in the state, with 2,000 vendor stalls, both indoors and outdoors. In a statement released on its website and Facebook page, Wagon Wheel owners announced the market would not reopen following its March 15 closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “It is with a heavy-heart that we share with you the news that the Wagon Wheel and Mustang Flea Markets will not be reopening,” the statement read. “This has been the most difficult decision we have ever made as a family. We wish you all the best. It is with tears and fond memories that we say goodbye and thank you.” The sudden announcement sparked both outrage and sadness as vendors and customers alike took to Facebook to voice their opinions. As of June 15, the announcement had more than 5,000 comments and more than 13,000 shares. “I’m heartbroken about it,” said Bob Letsch, who has been a vendor at the market on and off for 40 years. “But what can you do? It’ll probably be condos soon.” Bob, known as Chubby Bob at the market, sold sunglasses at the Wagon Wheel. He said one of the best things about the market was the opportunity it gave seniors on a budget or young business men and women to make a little money each month. “I do feel sorry for small entrepreneurs,” Letsch said. “It’s a shame, really.” Letsch said he doesn’t hold the decision against the owners, who he said are “a wonderful family.” Vendor Wendy Barrett of Gulfport said the suddenness of the announcement left her reeling. “I’m in shock,” she said. “I’ve been there for 27 years.” Barrett said she doesn’t harbor any ill will for the family. “They are thinking about what’s best for them, and that’s how it should be,” she said. “They did what they had to do.” Not everyone has been so forgiving of the Huntley family. In a Facebook message to a TBN editor, Harlan Newman said the closure was contrary to Hardy Huntley’s dream. “We’ve been selling at Wagon Wheel Flea Market in Pinellas Park for decades,” Newman said, “Bringing millions of people to Pinellas Park. “It hurts us deeply that the Huntleys decided to close,” he said. The Huntley family did not respond to numerous requests for comment. Created in 1966 by Hardy Huntley who arrived here in 1958 in a beatup Oldsmobile, the market had gravitated into a place where young and old and the rich and the poor congregate. The market’s name is not the work of a marketing genius. Huntley had an old wagon wheel he’d found on the property, affixed it to a pole and, hence, the Wagon Wheel moniker. The 150-acre Wagon Wheel property was purchased piecemeal over a number of years. The 150-acre property was purchased piecemeal over a number of years. “It was a shell pit and there was a large vein of them that was mined to build Pinellas County’s early roads,” Huntley told Tampa Bay Newspapers in 2007. Huntley quit high school, later earned a general education diploma, and hung out with “the bad boys” of his native North Carolina. He arrived in Florida at 22 with military service behind him and a knack for making money. “I worked in a supermarket for 75 cents an hour,” he said. “Later I built Hardy’s, a drive-thru restaurant where Shoppes at Park Place Mall on U.S. 19 now stands.” It was there that he met his wife, Janet. Huntley and his former partner and friend Norman Scoggins bought land across from where the Wagon Wheel now stands. Park Boulevard was a crushed shell road and they set up a used car dealership. They made enough money to buy a 4-acre tract on what would become the flea market. “We did nothing with it for almost a year,” Huntley said. “Then someone came up with the idea to sell used items.” Calling it “Trade Days,” each weekend people paid $2 to rent space on the property. While merchants sold their wares, Huntley was hawking food and soft drinks. More acreage was purchased in pieces. The land also was used as a dump for appliances, wood, tree stumps and everything else except actual garbage. The merchandise was changing. It was better, and new. Huntley launched the Mustang Flea Market on land that now is the home of a Lowe’s. The Mustang, which is also closing, was later relocated next to the Wagon Wheel. Huntley died in 2013 at the age of 77. Vendors who have items on market grounds will be allowed to pick up their merchandise from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. until Friday, June 19; from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. from Monday, June 22, to Friday, June 26, and Monday, June 29 to Tuesday, June 30.

stunning announcement just six weeks after he chose Jacksonville because of a rift with North Carolina’s governor over Trump wanting a packed convention in Charlotte during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""I told my team it\'s time to cancel the Jacksonville, Fla., component of the GOP convention,"" Trump said in an early evening news conference Thursday when he cited safety concerns. He praised Mayor Lenny Curry, who had been boosting the convention even as a majority of Jacksonville residents polled said they didn’t want the event here. RELATED | Florida adds record-high 173 COVID-19 deaths on Thursday, including 5 in Duval County Trump said he would still give a speech, but that the event will convert to “telerallies.” “I just felt it was wrong,” the president said about hosting an event like this during a pandemic. “… We didn’t want to take any chances.” The convention was originally scheduled for Charlotte, but the Republican National Committee moved most of the activities to Jacksonville last month after that North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper couldn’t guarantee Trump would have a packed arena without a mask mandate in light of the coronavirus pandemic. The president said the convention will do a “relatively quick” event in North Carolina on Aug. 24 to handle the nomination. “We’ll have a very nice something,” he said. “We’ll figure it out. It’ll be online. It’ll be a little bit different.“ Curry and Sheriff Mike Williams posted a joint statement shortly after the president’s remarks. ""We appreciate President Donald Trump considering our public health and safety concerns in making this incredibly difficult decision,"" the statement said. ""As always, in Jacksonville public safety is our number one priority. President Trump has once again reaffirmed his commitment to the safety of Jacksonville Florida and the people of the United States of America."" Earlier this week, Williams announced he could not keep the event safe, given the short timeline given to line up agreements for police officers from other cities to come to Jacksonville for security. City Council President Tommy Hazouri announced Wednesday night that he opposed the event and didn’t think a bill appropriating federal funds would pass, particularly after Curry wouldn’t commit to answering questions at a Friday council meeting. Hazouri said Trump’s announcement Thursday, which he learned about from the televised media briefing, was a “win for Republicans and Democrats alike.” “There are too many questions and too many concerns about our public safety from the coronavirus and also the sheriff bringing up not having enough resources” for convention security, Hazouri said. “That in itself was the silver bullet.” The Republican National Convention consumed elected leaders’ focus at a time the city faces a federal investigation into the JEA privatization debacle, near-record highs in terms of homicides and civil unrest in the wake of police violence, all on top of a global pandemic. “I’m ready to get back to issues that deal with Jacksonville, Fla., and our city and our people,” said Councilman Matt Carlucci, a Republican. “… I’m tired of damn partisan politics splitting our city up. I’m tired of it. We’ve got to do what’s right for the whole city.” Legislation filed Wednesday with City Council showed the city was expecting to to get a $33 million grant to cover security costs for the convention slated to run for four days in late August. Joint statement from Mayor Lenny Curry and Sheriff Mike Williams: pic.twitter.com/4E55XeOos3 In comparison, the city of Cleveland needed $41.5 million in federal grant money for security when it hosted the Republican convention in 2016, and Philadelphia spent $46 million for security costs at that year’s Democratic national convention. Milwaukee has a $40 million budget for security costs at this year’s Democratic convention, which has been scaled back greatly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Jacksonville was expecting a smaller pot of money because the federal government awarded up to $50 million to the city of Charlotte, which had been planning for two years to host the Republican convention. That meant the $50 million for security costs would have to be split between Jacksonville and Charlotte, which still would have some convention events and had already spent money for security-related costs. The legislation with Jacksonville City Council said the 2020 Jacksonville Host Committee would pay for any costs beyond the federal security grant. The host committee has said in the past it would raise “tens of millions of dollars” in private contributions to underwrite the cost of the convention, but it has not responded to questions about how much money it actually has raised so far. The host committee said in a statement Trump “made the absolute right decision for the health and safety of the people of Jacksonville and the entire state of Florida.” “The rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in Florida is serious and the president and the RNC have demonstrated great concern for the safety of all Floridians,” the committee said. Trump’s announcement, which he delivered during a White House briefing about the coronavirus, was a huge reversal for local Republicans who rejoiced on June 12 about the big political pageant coming to Jacksonville. ""We have said all along that Republican leaders would put the safety and security of our citizens above all else,“ Republican Party of Duval County Chairman Dean Black said Thursday. ”While this was not the outcome we were hoping for, we know that President Trump made this decision with the knowledge that he was doing what is best for the people of Jacksonville.“ Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Terrie Rizzo said Trump’s decision was overdue. “I’m glad Donald Trump took his head out of the sand long enough to realize what a predictable, preventable disaster he was about to inflict on the city of Jacksonville,” Rizzo said. “His ego-driven political stunt has wasted precious time and resources during a pandemic, and Floridians will remember his reckless leadership in November.” The June 12 announcement that Jacksonville would get the big political show came at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic had relatively low numbers of cases in Florida and the greater Jacksonville area. But the number of cases has surged since then, turning Florida into a hot spot for the spread of the virus. Trump cited safety as the reason for making the decision to call off the Jacksonville part of the convention. “We have to be vigilant,” he said. “We have to be careful and we also have to set an example. I think setting the example is very important. It’s hard for us to say we’re going to have a lot of people packed into a room and other people shouldn’t do it.” Curry, who was chairman of the Republican Party of Florida when Tampa hosted the GOP convention in 2012, spearheaded the campaign to bring the convention to Jacksonville and was co-chairman of the 2020 Jacksonville Host Committee. When Jacksonville landed the convention, he and the host committee said it would generate at least $100 million in economic impact for the region based on studies of past national conventions in other cities, giving hard-hit hotels and restaurants a shot in the arm. He declared Trump would have a full venue when he accepted the nomination. But the impact of the coranivus pandemic weighed on the convention, which was scaled back in attendance. Instead of using VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena, plans shifted to the smaller Daily’s Place amphitheater and the open-air TIAA Bank Field. Curry acknowledged this week that the economic impact would be less than $100 million, though he said the convention still would help businesses that have struggled. The convention was also slated to run during the 60th anniversary of Ax Handle Saturday, when white supremacists violently beat Black civil rights activists in downtown Jacksonville. Michael Sampson, a local activist with the Jacksonville Community Action Committee, said he and others were going to shift their focus from protesting the convention to supporting the commemoration of that anniversary on Aug. 27. The president’s opening remarks, where he announced the change in plans: “This afternoon, my political team came to me and laid out our plans for the convention in Jacksonville, Florida. It’s a place I love. I love that state. The drawings look absolutely beautiful. I never thought we could have something look so good so fast with everything going on. Everything was going well. A tremendous list of speakers. Thousands of people wanting to be there, and in some cases, desperately be there. They wanted to attend. People making travel arrangements all over the country. They wanted to be there. The pageantry, the signs, they were really, really top of the line, but I looked at my team, and I said the timing of this event was not right, just not right, with what’s happening recently with the flare up in Florida.

Holmes Beach Police Chief Bill Tokajer said the HBPD wouldn’t act on the allegations until it received a complaint from an individual about mask enforcement. “If Publix has their own rules that violate the city’s rules, we would handle that on a case-by-case basis should we find that’s the truth,” Tokajer said. “But that’s not something we’d go and discuss with Publix unless this is a problem brought to our attention.” “My officers can’t be at every business at once,” the chief said. “There are a lot of things going on in the city that require police attention.” He suggested the police department has had a good relationship with the store’s management team, which he said may handle things differently from the corporate directive. “We’ve never had a problem that we have discussed with our Publix local management team that they have not addressed immediately,” Tokajer said. “Their corporate rules and local rules are between Publix and the local management team.” To advertise here, please visit our rates pageor contact us at:sales@islander.orgPhone: (941) 778-7978Fax: (941) 778-9392 The Islander Wishbook – 2023 get it here My summer reading list includes … View Results Email address: Sign up to receive FREE email alerts when we update our site with news and classfieds.

Los medios de prensa y los magnates de las redes sociales han sumido en la oscuridad a cientos de millones de personas en el mundo. El innegable rechazo de la mayoría de la llamada gran prensa estadounidense al presidente Donald Trump, en su coqueteo con el globalismo y un posible nuevo orden mundial, han convertido a los practicantes de esa tendencia en la representación de una tiránica postura contra la libre información, la libre expresión y la ética del oficio, que debería permanecer distante de afiliaciones políticas, responder a la verdad y no a determinada tendencia. Desde hace más de 14 años asistimos a una corriente de desatino de la mayoría de los medios de comunicación en EEUU, que se unen a campañas de desinformación y un férreo control desde las principales fuentes: agencias de noticias, televisión tradicional, radiodifusión (quizás la menos penetrada), buscadores digitales y redes sociales, periódicos y otras fuentes. ¿A dónde fue a parar la imparcialidad? La prensa, que desde hace cuatro años alimenta el odio contra la figura del Presidente de la nación, ajena abiertamente a la imparcialidad y portadora de una política editorial de acatamiento y complicidad con el radicalismo de izquierda, ha “secuestrado”, desorientado y sitiado a millones de personas ávidas de información, tras las elecciones presidenciales del 3 de noviembre. No sólo los han cercado, los han ultrajado al más inimaginable estilo antidemocrático en un sistema democrático. Se han atribuido, con desafiante arrogancia, el derecho a declarar como Presidente electo a Joe Biden, una decisión que solamente puede hacer por la Constitución el Colegio Electoral, tras una certificación oficial de cada estado de la nación, un proceso que hasta el momento no ha concluido. Hoy, millones de estadounidenses conservadores y amantes de los valores antidinásticos conviven en un limbo informativo, censurados y aplastados por votar democráticamente por el presidente Donald Trump para un segundo mandato, por querer un país con ese tradicional respeto a lo disímil. ¿Es esta conducta una señal de democracia? ¿Es esto libertad de prensa? ¿Acaso la prensa está por encima de la Ley en EEUU?

of Excellence at the Chaplin School of Hospitality & Tourism Management and support CasaCuba FIU’s Chaplin School of Hospitality & Tourism Management has announced a $5 million gift from Bacardi USA dedicated to a new and unique educational program tailored for the spirits industry. The gift will create the Bacardi Center of Excellence, which will position the top-ranked school as a leader in beverage management education and partner with one of the world’s most historic and leading spirits companies. The Bacardi Center of Excellence will provide student scholarship opportunities, promote community events and provide pathways to entrepreneurship. The Bacardi Beverage Innovation Fund will be used to establish a beverage curriculum and create collaboration opportunities between Bacardi USA and FIU faculty. The Bacardi Scholarship Endowment will offer students financial assistance and establish professorships. The gift also expands programming at FIU’s CasaCuba. CasaCuba seeks to provide a dynamic home for the discussion and study of Cuban affairs – history, policy and business – and the celebration of Cuban culture. The initiative is bringing together scholars, policymakers, business leaders, students, and the community at large to realize a multidimensional Cuban cultural center and think tank that will be housed in a state-of-the-art facility at FIU’s main campus. Family-owned Bacardi was originally founded by Don Facundo Bacardí Massó in Santiago de Cuba in 1862. Today, Bacardi Limited is the largest privately held spirits companies in the world and South Florida is home to the regional headquarters for North America. “At FIU we are proud to partner with Bacardi, a company with deep roots in our community and a legacy of success that goes back to Cuba more than a century ago,” said FIU President Mark B.
