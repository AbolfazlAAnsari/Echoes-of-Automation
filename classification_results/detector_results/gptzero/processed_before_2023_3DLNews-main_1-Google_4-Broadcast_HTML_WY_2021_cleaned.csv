Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:19 am Bulletin photo by Jessi Dodge A new mural hangs on the side of city hall courtesy of the ongoing HGTV show “Hometown Kickstart.” The mural was unveiled on Dec. 16 while camera crews filmed for an episode of the show, which is expected to air this spring. Main Street was a little busier last Thursday morning as HGTV film crew members, city staff and curious onlookers mingled beneath the gaze of four wooden bison attached to city hall. The bison, which stared placidly back at the onlookers, are part of the new mural installed by HGTV as part of its “rejuvenation” of a public space in Buffalo. Buffalo is one of six small towns to be featured in HGTV’s new series, “Home Town Kickstart,” in which HGTV hosts help rejuvenate small towns by renovating a public space, a business and the home of a “local hero.” On Dec. 16, HGTV hosts Ty Pennington and Jasmine Roth unveiled the mural for city staff as the show’s crew filmed. City-Clerk Treasurer Julie Silbernagel was selected as the person to whom Pennington and Roth would reveal the new mural. In the time between when the mural was installed on Wednesday afternoon and the time it was officially unveiled, Silbernagel did her best not to spoil the surprise, keeping her head down as she went to and from her car. “I guess I went along with the game. I wanted to be surprised because I was afraid that I wasn’t going to be able to react how they wanted me to,” she said. Standing outside City Hall’s front door on Thursday morning, Silbernagel kept her eyes shut and allowed Pennington and Roth to guide her down the sidewalk, around the corner of the building and across the icy parking lot, to where a crowd of more than 20 people waited for her reaction. When Silbernagel opened her eyes and took in the mural for the first time, the crowd cheered. “It turned out really nice,” Silbernagel said in an interview after filming. “I’m just happy that we took a forgotten space and did something with it,” she said. Pennington and Roth also showed Silbernagel a bench, painted by Kelsey McDonnell to look like the Wyoming flag, which will sit on the platform beneath the Johnson County Courthouse. Each of the six towns in the show will receive a bench. A placard sitting on top of Buffalo’s bench reads, “Small town, big hearts. From HGTV to Buffalo, WY 2022” The mural is designed to encourage visitors to take selfies, Silbernagel said, and she, Pennington and Roth took selfies alongside the bison. Pennington pretended the bison were chasing him, raising his clenched fists and his right leg in a mock running position, which drew laughs from those assembled. Once filming finished, city staff and other onlookers took their own selfies with Pennington and Roth as well. While the concept of the mural was created by HGTV and approved by the city, the artistry itself was done by Jason Jespersen, a local artist. For the past month, the HGTV film crew has appeared around town, often accompanied by Pennington and Roth. Pennington has hosted such shows as “Rock the Block” and “Extreme Makeover: Home Edition,” and Roth hosts “Help! I Wrecked My House.” Silbernagel said that the crew spent most of their time in Buffalo and explored the community when they weren’t working. They also understood that city staff and Buffalo residents had jobs to do, which Silbernagel said she appreciated. “Throughout all of it, that production crew, you couldn’t ask for nicer people. I mean, they were so accommodating,” she said. Pennington and Roth were also fun to work with. “They could pull it out of you. While you’re standing there going, ‘I don’t know what to say,’ they would come with some one-liner that you could react to,” Silbernagel said. The project hasn’t been without its hiccups, though. In November, council members approved a contract for updates to the ice rink, a project that would have created a more versatile space that could be used year-round, Mayor Shane Schrader said. But days later that project was scrapped due to supply chain issues, and the mural was chosen as the replacement. The contract for the installation of the mural was awarded to Summit Home at the City Council’s Dec. 7 meeting. There is no immediate cost to the city for the construction or installation of the mural. If the mural needs to be cleaned or repaired, Silbernagel said she thinks it can be taken down relatively cheaply and easily, because it is composed of wooden panels affixed to the wall. And, if for some reason the city decides it doesn’t want it there anymore, it can just take it down, she said. “Home Town Kickstart” is a spin-off of two other HGTV shows, “Home Town” and “Home Town Takeover.” The episode that features Buffalo is tentatively scheduled to air in April.
