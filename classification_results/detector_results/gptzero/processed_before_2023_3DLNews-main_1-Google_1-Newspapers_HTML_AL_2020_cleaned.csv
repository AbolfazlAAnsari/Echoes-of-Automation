JAY HARE/DOTHAN EAGLE Wes and Jamie Chapman pose with a photo of their son Ryles Chapman, in 2014 No phone calls and no written correspondence since 2013 have one local family making a verbal plea for their missing son to come home. For the past four years, Wes Chapman and his wife, Jamie, have done everything they could think of to get the word out about their missing son, Ryles. On Dec. 18, 2013, Ryles left his parent’s pool house where he was residing, never to be heard from again. “The day Ryles left, well it was something no one was expecting,” Chapman said. “In the past Ryles had participated in rehab programs due to an addiction to prescription medications, medications that were prescribed by his doctor. We hoped by Ryles living in our pool house, maybe things would be better for Ryles.” Everyone was hoping Ryles was doing better and with no confrontation between Ryles and his family, it seemed things were looking up, Chapman said. “The day Ryles disappeared I pulled up at our home and I saw another vehicle pulled behind Ryles’ vehicle,” Chapman said. “I thought to myself this must be one of his old buddies, and I got worried. I rushed to the pool house and I couldn’t get in. I ran to get a key and tried to enter, but Ryles had the door blocked by pulling out a cabinet drawer. I could see him and I tried to talk to him, but the last time I seen Ryles he was running from our home wearing his boxer shorts. He left everything inside the pool house. He even left his wallet which was filled with money. He had quit his job that morning and cashed his check.

Our son is out there. We just need him to know he can come home.” According to Dothan Police Sgt. Jason Adkins, the leads and tips have run out over the years. “The last bit of information we received about Ryles, we received about a year ago,” Adkins said. “That information was information we had previously received and it was a dead end.” Adkins stated if any new information is made available to law enforcement an investigator will proceed to investigate. All missing person cases remain open until appropriate information is provided and confirmed in order for the status to be changed, Adkins said. Over the years, the Chapman family has looked into leads and tips themselves trying to locate Ryles. Billboards informing the public have been placed from Dothan to Panama City Beach, Florida. “I know Ryles was OK the spring break following him leaving our home,” Chapman said. “He was seen at Club Lavela in Panama City by a fellow classmate from Northview High School. “I also have proof where his old phone was used up north.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Published 7:21 pm Friday, June 19, 2020 By christophersmith A group of concerned locals has started a petition to remove Covington County District 3 Commissioner Tony Holmes from office after a series of what some say are controversial Facebook comments have surfaced this week. The three comments in question were from Holmes’ personal Facebook page. One was a comment on a post that was shared by one of his Facebook friends about a Mobile police officer being shot and killed in the line of duty. Holmes commented on that post, “You know [friend,] the only way to ever change this may be to bring back lynch mobs.” The second comment was a status on Holmes personal Facebook just after the rioting and looting began in Minneapolis after the death of George Floyd. He wrote, “I’m going to make the same offer to Minneapolis I made to Ferguson a few years ago. I bring who I need with me, a group of 12-16, we are to do what has to be done, and we’re gone. I certainly don’t agree with that happened to this man. Not at all. But the looting and burning, that’s not an answer. My numbers in the book.” The last comment was brought to light in the second comment when Holmes mentioned an earlier post from Nov. 18, 2014 during the Ferguson riots. Holmes wrote, “Because I don’t know any other way to do this, let me do it on Facebook. I’m offering my services to the leaders of Ferguson, Mo. If you will allow me complete supervision of your police dept. Along with your best six sharp shooters I promise there will be no riot. None.” A Facebook friend of Andalusia local Kendal O’Neal sent her the original comments from Holmes and she made a post on Facebook with those original comments. O’Neal wrote in her Facebook post, “From one of our very own county commissioners in Covington County. Make him go viral ya’ll. Why is this man in office? I urge you to file a complaint against Covington County Commissioner – District 3 – Tony Holmes.” After an outpouring of comments and messages, O’Neal started a petition to the Alabama Ethics Commission and the Alabama Attorney General. As of 5:30 p.m., on Fri., June 19, there were 438 signatures. “The outrage, anger and disgust from the community when I posted his comments on Facebook is what led me to start the petition,” O’Neal said. “A group of my friends has all communicated with people who are not OK with this. This is a man who was put in a position of power over this community. He is supposed to represent us. He is supposed to represent the people that live here. How can you represent a huge portion of your community when you’re making statements like that? It is mind-blowing.” O’Neal, Tyawanda Barnes, Lisa Boatwright and Kyle Powell all stated they wanted a resignation from Holmes. “We are calling for his resignation, that is where we are at with it,” O’Neal said. “He should apologize, but he should do that because he should be a decent person. He needs to step down and he needs to do it immediately.” Barnes said she fears for a man in Holmes’ power to say comments like “lynch mob” because she fears for her 21-year-old African American son’s life every time he walks out of the house. “I am tired and this has gone too far,” Barnes said. “I have a 21-year-old black son and when he walks out that door, I don’t know if he is coming back home or not. For Mr. Holmes to sit up and say that in little Andalusia, it is unacceptable. We need your resignation. You need to be gone immediately.” When Barnes first read the comments, she said she was furious. “Listen, I don’t curse, but baby, I was just hurt,” Barnes said. “I was literally in disbelief that a man in this high position could make a comment like this and you just think it is OK? No. It is not OK. I’m going to take the proper steps through the chain of command to do what I have to do to get him removed.” Covington County Commission Chairman Greg White said Holmes comments do not reflect the commission. “What I have been told Tony said does not reflect the commission at all,” White said. “He was speaking on his personal page, but in fairness to Tony, I have not talked with him yet, so I don’t know. I have something that I was told that was posted and I’m a little suspicious of it. What I was told was posted, I have real concern about.” White said he hears the frustration of the people of Covington County and he will do whatever they can to heal the wound. “I have had several phone calls of concern and met face-to-face with a couple of people,” White said. “I hear the frustration and the hurt and the anger. Man, I want us to do everything we can here to heal any wounds and make things right. I am very proud of Covington County as a whole for realizing we still do have problems like any community does, but I want to do things to make things better. I think the entire commission would agree across the board that we want to do things to make things better.” Association of County Commissions of Alabama [ACCA] Executive director Sonny Brasfield said it is important for citizens to realize that the ACCA is not a policing organization for county officials or employees. “We have no supervising role over any county officials or employees,” Brasfield said. “So for us have any reaction to or role in the aftermath of things that happen, be that positive or negative, we always just try to help and provide technical assistance and those kinds of things.” With the petition going around for Holmes to be removed from office, Brasfield said that the only way for a commissioner to be removed from office is if legislative action was taken. “Alabama law says county elected officials can be removed from office by impeachment,” Brasfield said. “It would require following an impeachment process, which requires both a vote in the House and the Senate. Let’s say if I was a commissioner in ‘Jones County,’ and all of the other commissioners wanted me off the commission, there is no way for them to do that. That is not the role of the county commission. That power falls to the legislature.” Below is Holmes’ full statement regarding the situation: “In 2014, a friend of mine posted an article on social media concerning a Mobile, AL police officer being shot and killed by a habitual offender who was out on early release due to the Alabama Prison Reform Act. The matter of prison reform, that results in violent criminals being released early from prison years – even decades – early, is a matter I feel strongly about. Let me be very clear, I am against the early release for violent criminals. “If lawmakers want to allow violent criminals an early release due to overcrowding, I suggested in my social media response to a friend that we bring back lynch mobs. This way the criminals, whom lawmakers feel they cannot make room for in prison, will not have the opportunity to kill another innocent person.

I don’t think I’d ever be able to recover from that. I agree with the old adage: kids should not die before their parents. I have a connection with the legend commonly known throughout basketball circles as the “Black Mamba”. Bryant won five NBA titles between 1996 and 2016. My first interaction came on Oct. 11, 2000 when the then-Charlotte Hornets played the Los Angeles Lakers during an NBA preseason contest at the New Orleans Arena, now known as the Smoothie King Center. During those days, I was a sportswriter with the Biloxi Sun Herald and investigating to see if professional basketball could make a comeback in New Orleans. I was among 20 reporters jumbled around Bryant and I asked him if the league could work in the Crescent City. I remember Bryant was optimistic. Two years later, the Hornets moved to New Orleans. I ended up covering the Hornets for three years and always managed to attend a Lakers contest twice a year. I never had a one-on-one interview with Bryant. Unless you were with ESPN, ABC, or NBC, such occurrences rarely happen in the print media. I never was a Lakers fan, but I admired Bryant for bringing the three I’s to basketball: intensity, intelligence and integrity. Bryant was the last of the old-school breed, unlike today’s game where players want to form superteams. In my opinion, Bryant is one of the 12 greatest basketball players of all time. The other 11 are Michael Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabaar, Larry Bird, Tim Duncan, Bill Russell, Shaquille O’Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, Julius “Dr. J” Irving and LeBron James. Thank you Kobe Bryant for your historic contribution to the NBA. Your legacy will be always remembered by generations for years to come.'}]"

Blakely traveled from Mobile because Montgomery is the birthplace of civil rights, she said. (Photo by Giana Han) This is an opinion column. A week ago a source sent me a text. It wasn’t a tip, but rather the sort of chatter we have between other business. “COVID-19 is over,” he said. He didn’t think the virus had gone away. His point was that, when epidemiologists began saying social justice is more important than social distancing, the struggle against the coronavirus was lost. People were moving on. The virus had lost the news cycle to Black Lives Matter marches. Viruses, I replied, have a way of speaking for themselves. And this week the coronavirus spoke up. After two weeks of being pushed off front pages and the tops of TV newscasts, the virus appears to be back in a big way. Florida, Texas and Arizona have seen sudden spikes in new cases. Alabama, too. In the last month, 7-day averages for new cases here have doubled and are still moving quickly the wrong way. The state set a new all-time high for the rolling seven-day average on Thursday and then beat that on Friday and then beat that on Saturday. So, now, do we change the channel again? With protests that gave way to riots now giving way again to peaceful protests, do we go back to our regular COVID-19 programming? It’s tempting to see the coronavirus and the Black Lives Matter movement as competing issues dueling for our collective attention. But they’re not. If you lay both stories on top of each other to see how they overlap, you will see they’re not so unrelated. Their edges line up very well. In Alabama’s Black Belt, for starters. That region of Alabama gets its name for the dark, rich soil there. It’s there that cotton grew best, there that plantations imported slaves before the Civil War, and there that many descendants of those slaves still live. It’s a place that has struggled with endemic poverty and all the public health problems that go with it. When coronavirus came to Alabama, it was inevitable it would find its way to the Black Belt and inevitable it would hit there hardest. Within days, Montgomery County will likely overtake Mobile County for the greatest number of cases, despite having about half the population. The city that calls itself the Cradle of the Confederacy and the Birthplace of Civil Rights is now Alabama’s epicenter for COVID-19. In neighboring Lowndes County, cases per capita are five times what Jefferson or Mobile Counties have seen, and data visualizations have had to incorporate new colors to accurately reflect the disease’s impact there. In a state that is 26 percent African-American, black Alabamians account for more than 43 percent of coronavirus cases and 45 percent of deaths. A few weeks ago, I wrote about how coronavirus had made its way to the Black Belt, where that scar of our state’s original sin still shows itself whenever some new calamity strikes Alabama. When I wrote that column, I ended it by saying, in Alabama, race is an underlying condition. A friendly reader gently corrected me. Calling race an underlying cause blames the victims and allows our leaders to shrug their shoulders at the problem, she said. She was right. Race is not the underlying condition. Racism is. Racism kills in many ways. It kills through police brutality. It kills through lack of health care. It kills with bullets. It kills with toxins, pathogens and disease. It smothers its victims until they can’t breathe, either by a knee on their necks or a virus in their lungs. Every one of us should look at the disparity and be ashamed we haven’t done enough to fix it. Because black lives matter. We will find a vaccine for coronavirus. Eventually, it will go away. But when that finally happens, that stark historical disparity will still be here. And it will wait there to be exploited by the next calamity — unless we do the hard work to cure it, too.

If they see he was supported then maybe things would be different.” Adam’s parents, Alry and Tim, said they are proud to see him come out of his shell and try cheerleading. Making the decision to become a cheerleader was a big deal for Adam and has challenged him in great ways, Tim said. “Adam is walking on new ground for a male his age, but that doesn’t mean he can’t do it,” Alry said. “Whatever you want to do, no matter how unique you feel, go for it if it brings positivity to your life. I think the younger you start off, the better you’ll be.” Adam even received a signed cheerleader uniform from the Auburn University head coach.

Now, shaken and scared, he pauses when asked about his wife and two small children, ages 5 and 2. “I don’t know where my family is now,” he said, unsure if they were left behind in the fighting or are somewhere in the growing crowd of thousands of new refugees over the border in Sudan. In an interview with The Associated Press by phone from Sudan on Thursday, the 30-year-old gave one of the first witness accounts from what experts warn is a brewing civil war with devastating humanitarian consequences. The conflict could draw in neighboring countries, too. Filimon, who gave only his first name, said those attacking the Tigray regional town of Humera last week came from the direction of nearby Eritrea, though it was impossible to know whether the attackers were Eritrean forces. Tigray regional leaders have accused Eritrea of joining the week-long conflict in the region at the request of Ethiopia’s federal government, which regards the Tigray government as illegal. Ethiopia has denied the involvement of Eritrean forces. Filimon’s worries are far more immediate. After a day-long journey on foot with some 30 others fleeing, he has spent two days in Sudan, exposed to the sun and wind in a border town that is quickly becoming overwhelmed. About 11,000 refugees have fled into Sudan, where authorities are preparing for up to 100,000, the United Nations refugee agency said Thursday. Half of the refugees are children. It was too early to collect statements from the refugees about the fighting, the agency said. Fleeing combatants were separated from civilians. Injured people — injured how, it was yet unclear - were being treated.

coronavirus pandemic began in March. Noel Lovelace, vice president of development at Decatur Morgan, said that as of Thursday elective surgeries are suspended. ""We assess staffing daily,"" she said. There were 87 patients presumed to have COVID-19 in Decatur Morgan Hospital on Thursday. There were 15 COVID-19 patients in intensive care at the hospital, including 12 on ventilators. Morgan County had 173 new cases of the virus reported Thursday, and six COVID-19 deaths over the last two days. On Wednesday, just 7% of the state\'s roughly 1,700 ICU beds were available, according to the Alabama Hospital Association. A fast rise in cases combined with new infections that health officials believe are linked to Thanksgiving travel and gatherings is overwhelming the health care system. Short of staff as COVID-19 cases increase, UAB Hospital said it is bringing in more than 120 nursing students and teachers to help. Huntsville Hospital announced earlier this month it was suspending some elective surgeries. Southeast Health, located in Dothan and serving much of the Wiregrass region, said it was suspending elective surgeries beginning Thursday because of an increase in people needing treatment for COVID-19. Southeast Health announced its cutback in a statement that included a plea for residents to wear face masks, keep their distance from others and wash their hands. On Tuesday, two doctors at the hospital were the first health care workers in the state to receive vaccinations against the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health. More than 4,250 people have died of COVID-19 in the state, and more than 310,000 have tested positive, including nearly 4,700 new cases reported Thursday. More than 2,400 people are hospitalized with the illness. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases has increased by 1,135, a jump of 45%, and one in every 192 people in Alabama tested positive in the past week, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. While the illness causes minor to moderate symptoms in most people, it is particularly dangerous for the elderly and others with serious health problems. Log In Keep it Clean.
