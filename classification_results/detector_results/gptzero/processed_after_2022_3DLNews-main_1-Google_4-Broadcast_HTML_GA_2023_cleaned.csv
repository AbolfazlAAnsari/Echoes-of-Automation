Cracked cold cases, unforeseen arrests, shocking violence and betrayal were among crime cases that rocked the country this year. New York police made an arrest in the infamous Long Island serial killer case that many doubted could be solved. The longtime suspected killer of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway made a surprise confession. And the massacre of four University of Idaho students continued to grab attention from coast to coast. There were serial killer cases in California, Pennsylvania, Texas and Oregon. Documents have revealed new details in the JonBenet Ramsey case. Ex-Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin was nearly killed in federal prison. Here are five of the most followed crime stories of 2023. BRYAN KOHBERGER\'S MOTIONS TO DISMISS IDAHO MURDERS INDICTMENT DENIED While the slayings of Madison Mogen, 21, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Ethan Chapin, 20, took place in November 2022, it wasn\'t until their suspected killer Bryan Kohberger waived extradition in early January that the public got a glimpse of the evidence. Bryan Kohberger arrives at the Monroe County Courthouse in Pennsylvania for his extradition hearing. (The Image Direct for Fox News Digital) Police tracked Kohberger across the country, from his Ph.D. student office at neighboring Washington State University to his parents\' house in Pennsylvania\'s Poconos. Phone records, surveillance images of a suspect vehicle, DNA left on a knife sheath recovered at the scene and a survivor\'s shocking eyewitness account all played roles in a probable cause affidavit unveiled Jan. 5. The victims of the Nov. 13, 2022, University of Idaho massacre, from left to right: Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen. (Instagram @xanakernodle I @maddiemogen I @kayleegoncalves) A judge denied Kohberger\'s request to dismiss a superseding indictment in December, clearing the way for the case to go to trial after the suspect waived his right to speedy proceedings and tried to fight the case on procedural grounds. The judge entered not guilty pleas on Kohberger\'s behalf at his arraignment in May. He could face the death penalty if convicted on any of the murder charges and one to 10 years on the burglary charge. Once a high-powered South Carolina lawyer, Alex Murdaugh\'s world unraveled as years of misdeeds came to light following the June 2021 murders of his wife, Maggie, and their younger son, Paul. Jurors found him guilty in March, and he was sentenced to two life terms in prison. From left: Buster Murdaugh, Maggie Murdaugh, Paul Murdaugh and Alex Murdaugh. (Fox News) ALEX MURDAUGH ‘A SHELL OF A MAN’ FOR FINANCIAL BETRAYAL, GLORIA SATTERFIELD SISTER TELLS INTERVIEWER The six-week trial exposed Murdaugh\'s crippling financial troubles and corruption. While he has pleaded guilty to a number of unrelated financial crimes, he is appealing his murder convictions. ""That jury had heard almost three weeks of evidence not related to the murder, but to the financial crimes, which he\'s always admitted to,"" defense attorney Dick Harpootlian previously told Fox News Digital. ""But we believe it so prejudiced them that when we put the forensic evidence in, which is very, very strong for his innocence, acquittal, they didn\'t hear it."" In a shocking turn nearly two decades after the disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway in Aruba, longtime suspect Joran van der Sloot confessed to the gruesome details of her murder as part of a plea deal on international extortion charges. Natalee Holloway and Joran van der Sloot in a compilation image. (AP, Getty Images) JORAN VAN DER SLOOT HAS CONFESSED TO KILLING NATALEE HOLLOWAY Van der Sloot, now 36, is a Dutch national who murdered Peruvian casino heiress Stephany Flores five years to the day after Holloway vanished. He told the FBI in October he crushed Holloway\'s skull with a cinder block after she refused his sexual advances on a beach near her hotel. Then he dragged her into the ocean and set her adrift. Van der Sloot was sentenced to 20 years in prison for extorting Holloway\'s mother, with credit for time already served in U.S. custody after his arrival in June. The court will allow his sentence to run concurrently with those he faces in Peru for Flores\' murder. His new expected release date is June 9, 2043. Accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex A.

COLLEGE PARK, Ga. — More than $7,000 for a Subway Italian sub. That’s what a metro Atlanta woman discovered charged to her credit card bill after ordering her regular #4 from a College Park Subway. “I could have gone to Italy and got the sandwich,” Vera Conner said. Conner says at the end of every week she checks her credit card statements and that’s when she noticed the charge. “I know exactly what it normally costs, it’s $7.54,” she said. But the bill for the meal charged to her credit card was $7,112.98. “I was like, oh, my God, how did this happen?” Conner said. Conner then noticed that the number on the tipline matched several numbers of her telephone number. She now believes the screen changed to tip when she was trying to enter her phone number to collect her Subway rewards points. I must have been keying it in the pad, and the screen changed,” Conner said. She thought it would be a simple fix but for nearly a month Conner has been trying unsuccessfully to get the charge reversed. Conner says the Subway store manager repeatedly refused to discuss it with her and she received a denial letter when she disputed the charge with her credit card company. “This is unbelievable because I feel like everyone that sees it has to know that it’s a mistake. I’ve worked in retail before. I know how we tally up at the end of the night,” Conner said. Gray has reached out to Subway but has not heard back.

Joe Manchin’s (D-W.Va.) retirement in a post on his Truth Social platform on Thursday. “Because I Endorsed Big Jim Justice of West Virginia for the U.S. Senate, and he has taken a commanding lead, Democrat Joe Manchin has decided not to seek re-election. Looking good for Big Jim!” Trump wrote. Earlier on Thursday, the West Virginia Democrat announced that he would not be seeking reelection – capping off months of speculation over where he would run or not. He faced two GOP challengers: Gov. Jim Justice, who has the backing of the Senate GOP campaign arm, and Rep. Alex Mooney (R-W.Va.), who Trump endorsed in his House race last year. “After months of deliberation and long conversations with my family, I believe in my heart of hearts that I have accomplished what I set out to do for West Virginia. I have made one of the toughest decisions of my life and decided that I will not be running for re-election to the United States Senate,” Manchin said in a statement. “But what I will be doing is traveling the country and speaking out to see if there is an interest in creating a movement to mobilize the middle and bring Americans together,” he added. Shortly after Manchin’s announcement, the nonpartisan election handicapper Cook Political Report changed its ratings of Manchin’s seat from “toss up” to “solid Republican” as Manchin was considered Democrats’ best shot at holding the seat. The decision also came amid the backdrop of polling indicating that Manchin would have faced an uphill climb. An Emerson College Polling survey released last month found Justice leading Manchin 41 percent to 28 percent. Manchin fared better in a hypothetical matchup against Mooney, with the West Virginia Democrat at 37 percent and Mooney at 31 percent. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

More News from WRBL This week, Mass General Brigham, the largest health system in Massachusetts, said it will require masking for health care staff who interact directly with patients in clinical care locations starting Jan. 2. Patients and visitors will be “strongly encouraged” to wear a facility-issued mask. Masks will not be required for staff in hallways and common areas. The health system in a statement said its policy is based on the percentage of patients presenting to emergency departments or outpatient clinics with symptoms of respiratory illness. Once this figure exceeded 2.85 percent for two consecutive weeks, the masking requirement took effect. It will end once the level falls below 2.85 percent for a week. Most hospitals eased or eliminated their masking requirements last spring, after the federal government ended the COVID-19 public health emergency. Another major Boston hospital, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, began requiring masks for patients and staff on Dec. 18. The hospital said the policy would be in place for the “foreseeable future.” The hospital said there is no single data point leaders use to gauge when the requirement will end. “We check a number of different data points, including rates of influenza-like illness, staff absenteeism, and emergency room visits and hospitalizations caused by respiratory viruses. We will lift the mask requirement when these data points remain consistently lower,” the hospital said on its website. Meanwhile, in D.C., the region’s largest rehabilitation hospital is requiring masks for all staff and patients who are admitted, but not for visitors or outpatient areas. In a message to staff, Medstar National Rehabilitation Hospital said the move was meant to protect staff because there’s been an increase in positive COVID tests on admission. As a result, there’s been an increase in exposure from patients to staff members. And in Wisconsin, UW Health recently returned to requiring masks in medical clinics, outpatient care and waiting rooms. The new requirements come as the JN.1 variant has become the most common strain of the virus spreading across the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the variant accounted for 44 percent of COVID-19 infections nationwide by mid-December, up from about 7 percent in late November.

According to the sheriff, the school had the father pick up his 14-year-old son early the next day because he was acting upset over his brother’s disappearance. They searched for him when they returned home, and that’s when the father found his son’s body out back and called law enforcement. Thomas said they later learned the 14-year-old confided to a friend at school that he had killed his brother. The news release said, “He then asked his friend to help him murder the rest of his family and help him bury their bodies. The friend also stated the 14-year-old had a hit list in his bookbag of family members he wanted to kill and made statements about wanting to shoot up the school.” The sheriff said they searched his bag and found that list. The suspect was taken into custody and charged with murder. “We are very fortunate and blessed we do not have more casualties as a result of a 14-year-old having access to a weapon,” said Thomas. He thanked the Pike County school system and district attorney’s office for their help in the investigation. The school system said there was no threat to campus, but they will increase law enforcement presence on the Brundidge campuses as a precaution. Also, mental health wellness support for students and staff have been made available. “The Pike County School System would like to express its deepest condolences to the family and friends impacted by this tragic event,” Superintendent Mark Bazzell said in a statement.
