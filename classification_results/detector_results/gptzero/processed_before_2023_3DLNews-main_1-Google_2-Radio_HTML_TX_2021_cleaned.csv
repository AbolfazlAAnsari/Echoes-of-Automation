I can’t believe this could happen in this day and age… gunfire from a prop gun could kill a crew member? What a horrible tragedy. My heart goes out to her family pic.twitter.com/W479ch56Js I’m so sad about losing Halyna. And so infuriated that this could happen on a set. She was a brilliant talent who was absolutely committed to art and to film. ❤️ pic.twitter.com/vcdFqHsGA0 My greatest fear is that someone will be fatally hurt on one of my sets. I pray this will never happen. My heart goes out to all of those affected by the tragedy today on Rust, especially Halyna Hutchins & her family. Absolutely horrifying and devastating news about cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins. My heart goes out to her family. My heart goes out to Halyna Hutchins family. What a heartbreaking loss. Sending prayers to Joel Souza. I’m sure everyone is devastated. Alec Baldwin Fired Prop Gun That Killed DP and Wounded Director – Variety https://t.co/3apNSUokUb I loved Halyna Hutchins’ work so much. It’s not only a tragic loss for cinema but to so many of you I know who worked with her. You and her family are all in my thoughts tonight. I’m heartbroken for you all. A post shared by Sidra Smith (@sidrasmithofficial) Sick and devastated to hear that my friend and rockstar cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed on set today in New Mexico. I don\'t have words to describe this tragedy. I want answers. I want her family to somehow find peace among this horrific, horrific loss. pic.twitter.com/ElAQNMuQvR – The Associated Press contributed to this report.

8-20-21: The Texas Education Agency (TEA) announced that schools must now inform families when children are exposed to COVID-19. Previously, they were not required to inform parents of COVID-19 cases. Also, the Texas Supreme Court ruled to temporarily allow local mask mandates as of late Thursday evening. Sarai Brinker thumbs through pages of comments she and a group of community members have gathered over the past few weeks. Brinker is a mom to two kids—10 and 11. Neither are old enough to get vaccinated, and for her, the thought of sending them back to school in person and unprotected has her uneasy. There has been a lot of confusion surrounding mask mandates across Texasdue to the legal tug of war between the state and counties over Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s ban on mask requirements. Still, some local officials continue to fight back. However, that’s not the case in Lubbock—the same city where Abbott announced the rescinding of the statewide mask mandate back in March. The lack of mandated public health guidelines locally pushed Brinker into action as students returned to the classroom this week. Over the past few weeks she has worked to collect those pages of signatures from people asking Lubbock’s largest school district—Lubbock Independent School District—to strengthen their language on COVID-19 guidelines. So far, almost 600 people have signed the call to action. “When we have hundreds of children indoors for eight hours a day,” Brinker said, “all we want is for our kids to be able to go to school in a safe environment.” Brinker and the others are not asking for a mask mandate. Instead, they’re asking for three things from the district: For teachers and school staff to model public health guidelines. To provide masks in the classroom to students and staff who may need one. And number one on the list is to change the language from “welcoming masks” to “encouraging them.” The different verbiage is loaded for LISD Superintendent, Kathy Rollo, who believes the shift would place the burden on the schools rather than personal decision. “So does encourage mean that you’re putting up posters suggesting that you wear masks?” she asked. “Does that mean that we’re getting on the announcements every day and saying, ‘ok everyone wear your masks.’” She says the schools already know how to avoid spreading the virus. And, while she appreciates the community feedback, she’s also received several other messages asking that the school not require masks. The district’s firm stance is a stark contrast to the fight several counties and school districtshave taken up over Gov. Greg Abbott’s ban on mask mandates. Even after the Texas Supreme Court temporarily halted lower court decisions protecting mask mandates in the Dallas and San Antonio areas, Dallas ISD Superintendent Michael Hinojosa refused to budge. “We’re going to continue with our mask mandate,” he said in response to the Supreme Court’s move. “To keep students safe, to keep parents safe, to keep families safe and most importantly our teachers, who are on the front lines.” Dr. Amy Thompson is on the frontlines in Lubbock. She is the chief executive officer of Covenant Children’s Hospital. Classes began for most students in Lubbock this week, and as Thompson has watched local hospital bed capacities decrease, she has grown increasingly concerned. “We have had a number of days in these past couple of weeks where we have been out of pediatric beds in our children’s hospital,” Thompson said. While it is still true that children are less likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19, she explained there are still cases. But the main driver in hospitalizations among children is another virus that’s on the rise — Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) — which for Thompson, is making this situation even more alarming. With the double-threat, she considered her worst-case-scenario as a pediatric healthcare provider. “I never want to have to turn away a kid that needs care,” she said. It's a situation Lubbock’s healthcare providers are already experiencing in the adult units. She isn’t the only one worried about capacity. Parents are too. Back at Sarai Brinker’s home, she clears the schoolbooks off her dining room table. She was looking forward to reverting the dining room back to its original purpose, but that’s on hold for now. The call to action she submitted to the district was not adopted. So, for now, maps of the country and the world decorate the teal walls along with artwork her children painted. The china cabinet is a temporary bookshelf, lined with workbooks. Until her kids can get vaccinated this room will remain as is. A makeshift classroom. Less than a week before her 10-year-old daughter was set to start school in person, Brinker and her husband made the difficult decision to withdraw her from LISD. “I went to Meet the Teacher Night,” she recalled. “I went into her classroom and the teacher wasn’t wearing a mask.” She will homeschool her daughter until things get better. Her son on the other hand, about to begin middle school and nearing his 12th birthday—making him eligible for the vaccine—will return to school in person. “I’m just praying he doesn’t get sick in those six weeks,” she said, laughing nervously. She remained quiet for a moment, reflecting on the situation she has been forced into and muttered, “I’m conflicted,” like so many other parents are right now. Brinker counts herself lucky still. Even with the difficult decision her family had to make just days before the start of school, she recognizes that having the option to homeschool her child is not something every parent has. While LISD does not intend on adopting the three requests listed in the call to action from Brinker’s community group, Superintendent Kathy Rollo said they will continue cleaning protocols and encourage students and staff to get vaccinated. Students and staff can get masks from the school nurse. And they will conduct contact tracing and notify parents of COVID cases at their child’s school — measures now required by the state as of August 19.""}]"

rock group the Five Man Electrical Band, best known for their 1971 hit “Signs” — died Friday at age 77. The songwriter, who contracted COVID-19 in November, died in the ICU at Ottawa’s Queensway Carleton Hospital, CTV News reports. Emmerson was reportedly double-vaccinated and had been in the hospital for other health concerns during the past year. ""He had underlying health conditions that made him additionally vulnerable to COVID,"" his wife of 34 years, Monik Emmerson, told the publication. The Five Man Electrical Band evolved from Ottawa’s the Staccatos, who formed in 1963. Emmerson eventually joined the band, becoming their frontman and primary songwriter. After releasing a string of modest Canadian hits, the group changed its name and released a self-titled debut LP in 1969. Their first and only international hit came with “Signs,” the opening track from their second album, 1970’s Good-byes and Butterflies. The tune’s lyrics, bemoaning how nature had been obscured by human directives, were inspired during a drive from Ottawa to Los Angeles. “We were on Route 66 somewhere in Nevada, the early evening, the sun setting,” Emmerson told Ottawa Sun in 2004. “This stretch of the road, there were huge rocks covered in graffiti, you know, \'Jesus Loves Maria,\' stuff like that, and endless advertising signs, go here, do this, and I thought what a shame, all these signs obscuring the beautiful scenery and telling us what to do. It cheesed me off.” “Signs,” issued as a single in 1971, hit No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100. And it\'s lived on as a classic-rock staple — Tesla even covered the song for a charting live version in 1990. While Five Man Electrical Band never scored another hit on that same level, they did earn regional success with a handful of other singles through the mid-\'70s. The group disbanded in 1975, with Emmerson leading its first reformation more than a decade later. Ted Gerow, Five Man Electrical Band\'s keyboardist, mourned the loss of Emmerson to CTV News. ""I had a sister, but I never had a brother, except I had Les,” he said. He also reflected on the endurance of their Emmerson-penned hit. ""It’s become an anthem,” he said. “So, imagine having that as your epitaph that you wrote a song that everybody knows.""'}]"

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Joining the exodus of Hondurans fleeing their benighted homeland, Luis Alberto Enrique and his family search for the unmarked footpath into Guatemala to begin their dangerous, 1,500-mile journey to the Texas border. As they walk through the border town of Corinto on a humid morning last month, his two young daughters tote pink Disney backpacks and their favorite stuffed animals. Enrique says he heard the United States is no longer turning migrants back. ""I heard on the news there is chaos on the U.S.-Mexico border, but I understand they\'re not deporting families,"" Enrique said. ""We\'re putting ourselves in the hands of U.S. law. Here, life is very hard."" Hondurans represent the largest nationality crossing the southern U.S. border asking for asylum — more than 200 families a day, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Many are still expelled under the pandemic public health order, but increasingly, families are being allowed in to begin the asylum process. ""I\'m a farmer — corn, coffee, beans. But I can\'t make enough to feed my family,"" Enrique said. ""We have droughts and then we have floods. And there\'s the lawlessness. Maras [gangs] extort the smallest businesses. We\'re headed to Houston, asking God to guide us and protect us."" The surge of migrants has created acrisis for the Biden administration and has prompted a scramble for solutions to cure deep social ills in Central America. President Biden has named Vice President Harris as the point person to address the waves of Central Americans showing up at the U.S. border. Last week, Harris told the Washington Conference on the Americas that the administration intends to focus on addressing catastrophes in the region — hurricane damage, the coronavirus pandemic, drought and food insecurity — as well as the ""root causes"" of migration, such as corruption, violence, poverty, joblessness and the lack of climate adaptation. The White House plans to spend $4 billion over four years in the region. ""That\'s why they leave home and come to the United States,"" Harris said. ""They are suffering. They are in pain. Many are experiencing unimaginable anguish."" The lives of many Hondurans had already been stretched to the breaking point. For many, it was hurricanes Eta and Iota that finally made life unlivable. The back-to-back major storms struck the same regions of Central America last November. As further evidence of climate change, these were the largest, strongest late-season storms in recorded history. And it was the first time anyone in the region could remember all five rivers overflowing and turning the Sula Valley, on Honduras\' Atlantic lowlands, into one vast lake. The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees recently reported 247,000 internally displaced persons in Honduras, with up to 2.5 million people in need of emergency food assistance. Blanca Marisa Balegas, a 41-year-old mother and tortilla-maker, still can\'t return to her colonia of Santa Isabel, on the outskirts of San Pedro Sula. Five months after the hurricanes, locals don\'t call the disaster by the storm names — like they do in the U.S. Gulf states — they call it by what it was: la llena, the fill. ""Everything is buried in mud. We lost everything,"" Balegas said, mashing a ball of masa into tortillas. ""We thought it was a flood like something out of the Bible. It was terrible. Dead chickens, dogs, pigs floating in the water."" She motions to the nearly deserted streets of the neighborhood where she and her three children are living with her mother-in-law. ""After la llena, they went away to the U.S. to earn more money. They say it\'s easy to cross now,"" Balegas said. ""All that\'s left here is misery."" She said she\'s thinking about taking her children to Mexico or the U.S., perhaps to join her sister in Alabama. She earns only $7 to $8 a day from tortilla sales, and there\'s not near enough to pay a coyote, or human smuggler. Nearby, a bulldozer scoops up dried, rank mud from streets and yards. Residents say that it is the only thing their government has done to help them and that all the food aid that\'s keeping them alive is coming from international donors. ""Our president is a scoundrel. Where is our help!?"" asks María Jiménez, a 50-year-old shop owner in the Ciudad Planeta neighborhood of San Pedro Sula whose home and livelihood were ruined by the storm. The government of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández has been accused of theft of public funds. U.S. federal prosecutors have also implicated Hernández as a ""co-conspirator"" in the crimes of his brother, Tony, who was sentenced to life in prison this year for cocaine trafficking. The president denies any wrongdoing or that Honduras has descended into a ""narcostate."" ""Our institutions are at the service of corruption, impunity and the violation of human rights,"" says Ismael Moreno Coto, a Jesuit priest and longtime government critic. ""Every day, hundreds of people are leaving, and this is one of the reasons."" Kurt Alan Ver Beek, whose nonprofit, Association for a More Just Society, has been working in Honduras for 20 years, says: ""It does feel like, how much more can people take?"" ""Maybe it was the two hurricanes. I know people who lost their jobs because the restaurant where they worked was underwater. I know people who lost jobs because the owner of the restaurant died of COVID,"" he continued. ""Your kids aren\'t in school — you don\'t have money to pay internet to have your kids in school. The gangs are threatening your kids. All of those things combined."" Central Americans asking for protection at the U.S. border often say they\'re fleeing ruthless criminal gangs back home. In many places, every type of business — from the ubiquitous corner shops called pulperías, to Super Chicken takeout joints, to the three-wheel tuk-tuk taxis — are expected to pay weekly extortion to gangs as ""protection"" from rival thugs. One of the gangsters who collects weekly shakedowns is a slight 25-year-old with hoop earrings, a bright red T-shirt and a child\'s bunny-ear backpack. She works for MS-13, one of the largest and deadliest mafias in the Americas. Her nickname is La China; she won\'t give her real name or have her picture taken. ""My job is to collect extortion,"" she said. ""I\'ve done this for four years. They have a fixed time to pay. If they delay too long, we kill the person. There are people who refuse to pay the extortion — they say, \'Oh, we haven\'t sold enough!\' — but it\'s obligatory. They have to pay, or else. In a flat, impassive voice, she describes her work in a gritty section of San Pedro Sula called Sector Satélite. She sits in the back seat of a vehicle during the interview, constantly looking out the window for police in the darkened streets of her neighborhood. A Honduran National Police homicide investigator said in an interview that it would be unusual for a public-facing extorsionista to also be una sicaria, an assassin, who\'s usually a more shadowy figure. But in NPR\'s follow-up query to her boss in MS-13, he texted back, ""She is a devil. She shoots very well."" La China said: ""I\'m accustomed to my work. Anyway, if I didn\'t kill, my jefe will kill me, so we have to do it."" She understands well that extortion and murder are driving migration to the United States. ""We\'ve had lots of people who, after we gave them 24 hours to pay up, we found their houses empty. They had to leave because they say they don\'t have enough money to pay the extortion."" She says if fleeing Hondurans are turned away by U.S. authorities and deported, and they return to their neighborhood, they do so under a death sentence from MS-13. But going north may be an escape for her own family. She says she plans to send her 8-year-old son with her mother to the U.S. later this year. ""I want him to study. I don\'t want him to get mixed up in the mara.""
