obituaries FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — For most of his past two decades with the New England Patriots, assistant coach Ernie Adams’ responsibilities have been shrouded in secrecy. Sticking mostly to the periphery during practices or on game days, Adams occasionally interacted with players or other coaches, but most often could be seen having one-on-one conversations with coach Bill Belichick. It stayed that way right until the end when Adams, a former high school classmate of Belichick, participated in his final practice with the team Wednesday. His retirement marks the end of a four-decade NFL run that began with the Patriots in 1975 as an offensive assistant and continued with short stints with the New York Giants and Cleveland Browns. It’s now ending back where it started in New England, where he has been throughout Belichick’s tenure, spending the past 21 years of his career as the team’s director of football research. But in his first formal interview with members of the media on Wednesday, Adams said his job has always been simple in his mind. “Basically, my job is to figure out as many things as I can to help the New England Patriots win football games,” Adams said. “In the end, that’s what we’re all about here. That’s what we do.” Adams, 68, has been part of each of the Patriots’ nine Super Bowl appearances and six championships during Belichick’s tenure. He said the open-ended role was perfect for him. “Whether it’s strategy, personnel or anything else. The thing that’s been great about my job is I’ve never really had any constraints put on me,” Adams said. “I could go in any area I thought would help us and, hopefully, I’ve made some positive contribution.” Belichick initially announced Adams’ retirement on the final day of this year’s draft. In doing so, Belichick provided a rare glimpse inside the Patriots’ bubble, allowing camera crews to film Adams making the team’s final selection. That player, receiver Tre Nixon, was scouted and chosen personally by Adams. The honor was merited for someone who has been a friend of Belichick for most of his life. The pair originally met as boarding school classmates at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. They hit it off because Adams, a voracious reader, had read the book “Football Scouting Methods” that Bill’s father, Steve Belichick, had written in 1963 while coaching at the U.S. Naval Academy. The fast friends also played alongside one another on the Phillips Academy football team. Bill was the center, Adams was a guard. Belichick said Adams’ impact is hard to quantify. He said he’s touched every area of the teams, from the personnel department to its internal grading of players, to strategy and game-planning. “Ernie’s had such a big impact on our success here with the Patriots in so many different ways,” Belichick said. “I’ve leaned heavily on Ernie for 21 years here and going back to Cleveland and New York and our relationship which started at Andover over 50 years ago. Ernie’s been a great friend. He’s certainly been a great asset to this organization and to me personally.” While it may be a little clearer what Adams has been doing the past two decades in New England, true to form, he is keeping probably the biggest mystery about him quiet. Adams was interviewed for a 2014 NFL Films documentary about the team and in the background the curious phrase “Pink Stripes” was written on a dry-erase board. The meaning of it has been a point of curiosity and jokes among Patriots fans ever since. So what did it mean? “Well, I go back to my Wall Street days, everything we did we said was proprietary trading information, so I’ll leave it at that’s strictly an inside joke and proprietary football information,” Adams said.

house was destroyed Monday morning by a fire. Firefighters from around the region battled the Nov. 29 fire on Spruce Head Island. The fire was reported at about 7:45 a.m. by a contractor who was arriving to do work at the property at 12 Granite St. Granite Street is off the Island Road near Atwood Lobster. The worker reported smoke coming out of the eaves of the home. The initial call was that the fire was on Granite Lane which is in St. George. The person calling in the fire also said the location was near the town line of South Thomaston and St. George but gave no additional information. South Thomaston Fire Chief Bryan Calderwood said the initial miscommunication did not significantly impact the response time because crews were on their way in that direction. Calderwood said when he arrived at Granite Lane there was no fire and crews were redirected to Granite Street. Chief Calderwood said after consultation with the state fire marshal’s office an electrical problem in an kitchen appliance is believed to be the cause of the fire. The contractors on the property were working on an outbuilding. Smoke was still pouring out of the home at 8:30 a.m. Firefighters set up a portable water tank at the intersection of Granite Street and Island Road, as Granite Street is a narrow road. Crews from South Thomaston, St. George, Rockland, Owls Head, Warren, Cushing, and Thomaston were at the scene. Some of the trucks parked by Atwoods, with firefighters walking the remainder of the short distance to the home. Spruce Head Island is part of South Thomaston. No one was home at the time. There were no injuries. The home is owned by Lawrence and Susan Detweiler of Huntington, Vt., according to South Thomaston assessment records. The house is a seasonal residence. By 9 a.m., all departments except South Thomaston, Thomaston, and St. George were able to return to their stations. South Thomaston arrived back at its station at noon.

In the recording, Officer Skinner is heard discussing differential enforcement of white students and students of color by Campus Safety. The video clip, taken on Feb. 14, is just over two minutes long on Instagram. However, the total length of the recording is more than six minute in length, and one student said the full conversation lasted for upwards of an hour. This recording was posted the day after a first-year student was physically restrained by Campus Safety officers, one of whom was identified as Officer Skinner, on the night of March 5. Many students decried Campus Safety’s actions as an excessive use of force. After the video was posted, Vice President for Campus Life and Dean of Students Joshua McIntosh notified students in an email that the officer in the video had been put on leave and that the college would hire an outside investigator to look into the incident and Campus Safety’s enforcement practices. Of the two students interviewed for this article, one student participated in the entire conversation with Officer Skinner. The second, his roommate who recorded the video, was only present for part of the conversation. Both students witnessed the incident in Rand earlier this month. The Student agreed not to publish the names of either student. They said they are “seeking a level of privacy in what has been a traumatic and hard-to-comprehend series of incidents.” The administration has met with both students and is aware of their identities. A previous email sent by a member of Bates Human Resources informed The Student that Officer Skinner is not authorized to speak to students during the ongoing investigation and cannot respond to requests for comment. The student who was present for the full conversation said Officer Skinner knocked on his door in Rand the night of Feb. 14 after purportedly receiving a noise complaint. The officer entered the room where six unmasked students were present. The student said a second officer stood nearby. According to the student, Officer Skinner was wearing a Blue Lives Matter mask that night. The Student obtained a photo of the mask Officer Skinner was wearing at the time, confirmed by both students interviewed. The screen shot is from a video recorded by the student’s roommate in late February. The mask — a neck gaiter — depicts a black and white, vertical flag. The students said there was a single off-color stripe to the side of the jaw. In recent years, the thin blue line flag has widely been recognized as a symbol of the Blue Lives Matter movement. The student, who is Muslim, said he wasn’t personally hurt by the Blue Lives Matter gear but was bothered that Bates Campus Safety officers would be wearing it while patrolling. The student said he confronted the officer about the symbol, hoping it would distract the officer from writing him up. The other five students were told to leave, and the student and the two officers remained. Officer Skinner began sharing his personal views on the issue, the student said. According to him, while the officer was saying “ignorant” things, the student told him they were “insightful.” He continued to agree with what the officer said, still aiming to avoid disciplinary action. In total, the student said the conversation lasted approximately 15 minutes. At the end, the student said Officer Skinner seemed pleased with their talk, but he told the student he would still have to write him up. Not long after, he returned to the student’s dorm room, alone. According to the student, Officer Skinner told him he had two options, but only described one. The student said the officer told him that he could write him up, because he was breaking quarantine rules, and because he had lied to him about being the room’s occupant. The student said he “lost his temper” at being confronted by the worst-case scenario of being written-up and sent home, so he brought the Blue Lives Matter topic up again and attacked him for wearing the mask. “[Do] you know what that represents to somebody like me?” he recounted saying. The student said the officer became defensive and denied it was a Blue Lives Matter symbol. In total, the second conversation lasted near 45 minutes, the student said. His roommate returned to their room partway through and recorded more than six minutes of the discussion before his phone died. The officer left and told the student he would write it up as “community engagement.” The student said he did not receive any disciplinary action from hosting the gathering. The six-minute recording was cropped to create the two-minute video posted to the @batesstudentrights Instagram account. The Bates Student obtained an email sent from Officer Skinner to the student the following evening; Director of Security Paul Menice was cc’d on the email. In this email, Officer Skinner acknowledged the divide between Campus Safety and students, and asked for advice on mending the relationship. “As we discussed last night, there is a gap between students and Campus Safety. What ideas would you have to help assist in bridging the gap between us?” he asked. “As I stated last night, our department is willing to sit with you and any other student(s) that would be interested in talking about any issue that you feel needs to be addressed.” The student responded hours later, encouraging Officer Skinner to reach out to student organizations such as the Black Student Union to initiate more dialogue. “I would say letting students talk first is key, that way you can understand how they feel right away and explain your side in response,” the student wrote. “I know a lot of students of color feel misunderstood and silenced, and I think having a conversation like that would be super productive.” Officer Skinner did not respond to his email. The student and his roommate said they didn’t intend to publicly post the video, even though they were concerned by what the officer had said. The student was grateful Officer Skinner hadn’t written him up. They changed their minds after they witnessed their friend be restrained and handcuffed by Officer Skinner and a second unidentified officer. Later, their friend told them he had been tackled by Officer Skinner in the stairwell, and the students were worried the officer wouldn’t be disciplined for his actions. Related Stories Residence Coordinators Discuss Campus Safety Presence & Intervention “I’ve heard like all this stuff before so like it’s not, it’s not something that I really feel like upset about as much I just wanted to — my intentions behind posting this dialogue was to show the type of person that Dennis was, because I’m afraid there was no actual witnesses that saw it [the alleged tackling],” the student said. In an interview last week with Senior Associate Dean of Students Carl Steidel and Director Menice, Dean Steidel said it would take several weeks for the investigation to conclude, and for the administration to announce the results to the community.

The store he has had 35 years has been down so many workers in the pandemic, he has done a lot more himself and realized, he could not keep doing it. He is down about eight workers from two years ago. He adjusted by having the store open fewer days, or adding days back but for fewer hours. What will he do when the store closes? He will keep open his fireworks store next door and his Boothbay storage business; have more time to volunteer for St. Philip’s Church’s food pantry Help Yourself Shelf, which he does food pick-ups for; and keep serving on Wiscasset’s planning board and ordinance review committee. “So I’m not going to fade away ... I’ll still be a local presence and still do my volunteer work.” He will also have a new job: “I’m going to become a landlord.” Cohen plans to rent out the 17,000 square foot building, maybe not right off, maybe in a year, but someone will want to lease it, he said. Others interviewed agreed. They said the store’s end is a loss but will bring something else to Route 1 and the town, whatever goes in.

Photo courtesy of Port City Models & Talent Lee Nelson is used to being a presence in peoples’ homes. After all, Mainers watched him deliver the news – usually in a shirt and tie – on News Center Maine for 30 years. Now the retired news anchor is in their homes again, only this time on the coffee table, wearing a comfort stretch piqué quarter-zip pullover in deep coral and dock shorts with rusty orange stripes. Nelson, 58, is pursuing two new careers in retirement – as a fitness trainer and as a professional model. The latter got a huge jump-start over the winter when he landed a photo shoot for L.L. Bean’s summer catalog. In the past few years, the field of modeling has opened up to people of all ages, sizes and ethnicities, according to Nelson’s agent Caron Bryan, owner of Port City Models & Talent Inc. in Portland. And all of them, from ages 8 to 88, want to be in the L.L. Bean catalog, both because of the prestige and because the company usually does photo shoots in warm, beautiful places, often in California. “Every one of my models tells me that L.L. Bean is their dream job,” Bryan said. “Models that I have in New York, all over New England – everyone wants to be in L.L. Bean.” Nelson said the shoot, which took place in Portland over two days in January, was “super fun” and “a wonderful opportunity, but it wasn’t anything I had been thinking about or planning at all. It just kind of came my way.” Lee Nelson models a blue windbreaker for L.L. Bean. Nelson says he has already shot two other jobs, one for Nikon cameras and one for a company that sells nutritional supplements. Photo courtesy of Port City Models & Talent Last August, Bryan helped Nelson sort through 850 photos he’d had taken by a professional photographer for his modeling portfolio and whittle them down to 20 that she posted on her company’s website and on Facebook. Some of the photos were shirtless, causing a momentary frenzy on social media. The accompanying profile reveals that Nelson has blue eyes (but you knew that already, didn’t you?), a 33-inch waist and 32-inch inseam, and wears a size 12 shoe. He can do Scottish, German and French accents.Advertisement Bryan initially cautioned Nelson that he might not get a job right away because wintertime is a dead zone in the modeling business. Then came a call from an L.L. Bean producer in December looking for several adult models for its summer catalog shoot. The company had no idea Nelson was trying to become a model, Bryan said, or that she represented him. Because of the pandemic, they were looking for models they could shoot right here in Maine. “For this shoot, because of COVID, all talent and crew were based in Maine and selected with an eye towards inspiring a life lived outside – and Lee represents this lifestyle well,” said Emily Bruce, vice president of creative at L.L. Bean. Bryan told Nelson to put on any L.L. Bean clothes he owned, go outside and shoot a video with an attractive background. “You need to look like you’re in their catalog,” she told him. Nelson, who lives in Biddeford and loves to hike, run and cycle, donned his L.L. Bean flannel shirt, an inner coat, a ski jacket and a hat, and stood in front of the rushing waters of the Saco River with a video camera. He told a story about buying his sister a gift at Bean’s at 1 a.m. one Christmas morning. “I just talked about the L.L. Bean stuff I own,” Nelson said. “I’ve had it all on me. I’ve got coats and boots and sweaters and hats, you name it. Is there anyone in Maine who does not own something from L.L. Bean?” He got the job. He ended up doing two photo shoots, one for the catalog and one for the website. (Nelson also appears in a behind-the-scenes video on the company’s Instagram page.) A post shared by L.L.Bean (@llbean) “When the shoot was for online, I tried on a bazillion clothes that day,” Nelson said. “It was just in and out. They’d snap a few shots, I’d go change, I’d come back, snap a few shots.” And did he get to keep any of those clothes? Nelson laughed. “I wish,” he said. “Those were some great clothes I got to try on.” Success. Please wait for the page to reload. If the page does not reload within 5 seconds, please refresh the page.

is out. I had the pleasure to go see Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. As you are aware, the hero’s journey begins when the character goes on a quest and in this quest eventually saves the world. But what would you do if the one person who threatens the world is your own dad? Personally, I found Shang-Chi to be a great journey throughout. While having some key flaws, it has its share of highlights. One key flaw is this idea that the main villain of the film is being manipulated throughout the film by something that isn’t human, and that can speak perfect Chinese in people’s minds. It’s very hard to believe. A highlight is the fact that this ties into the MCU so well and doesn’t even need to reference other movies all that much to do so. Like there is a certain character who appears fighting Wong. This character hasn’t been seen since The Incredible Hulk. It combines the art of kung-fu movies with the mythical nature of Chinese history and combines them to great effect. There wasn’t too much that went unexplained in this movie. Having said that, there are things that could do with a bit more explaining, see the mid-credits scene. The acting from Simu Liu (Shang-Chi) and Awkwafina (Katy) for instance was subpar at times and great at other points. An example of really bad acting was during the fight scene on the bus, Shang-Chi fights his way to victory and Katy just asks the point blank question of “who are you?”, when she is aware of who he is. The acting in that scene just seemed dumbfounding. A great part was when Shang-Chi was asked when he and Katy would get married by Katy’s grandmother, and Katy just isn’t for the idea. Shang-Chi seemed like he was embarrassed and that was a really well acted scene. It was kind of funny too which was great. Another great scene was the dinner scene between Wenwu and Shang-Chi, Xialing and Katy. They just have a nice chat and Wenwu gets to know Shang-Chi’s friend Katy for a bit. For the most part they both play somewhat believable roles, Shang-Chi as a character couldn’t accept who he was and later came to embrace his heritage. As far as the relationship with Katy to consider, it is explained how they became best friends, but some things about their relationship go unexplained through the entire ending of the movie. The assumption is they grew closer. Shang-Chi’s sister Xialing, played by Meng’er Zhang, was played exceptionally well. You could tell while she was close with Shang-Chi, that there was this distrust about her character. Which is exactly what you’d expect from having been raised the way they were. All the Chinese-American actors do a great job exemplifying the unique Asian culture that the film is about. Just like in the film Black Panther, this film is about the culture as much as it is about the unique storyline that Marvel Studios has conceived. I really enjoyed Tony Leung’s character as the father, you could feel that while he meant well for his family, he was being led down the wrong path. It is his character motivations that leads the character of Shang-Chi and Xialing to their own respective destinies. While playing the role of a tragic villain is not the best one, it is this trait that makes most recent Marvel villains worth watching as their plans come together. There are varying themes throughout the movie. The theme of family is an important one, as family is described throughout the movie as transcending. This idea that we are who we came from is one I’m not sure we needed to think about, because in reality we are not our own father and we are not our mother, we are our own individual person. It’s like if two clones were to live drastically different lives growing up and suddenly meet in the same things. They’re not the same person. However, for the purposes of this plot the idea of we are who came before is an important plot element for the film. More important though, in my opinion, is this idea of acceptance that is shown throughout. Shang-Chi cannot accept who he is. The father cannot accept the fact his wife is gone. Xialing cannot accept the limitations that were placed on her by her father. Towards the end, all the characters learn to accept their limitations, and even in some instances learn to lean on each other. The final thing I’d like to discuss are the action set pieces. On the bus, which was in the trailer, was a crazy way to begin the character’s journey. The best fight scenes are the ones between Leung’s character and the final showdown towards the end was definitely worth waiting for nearly two hours for. Overall, I’d like to address the fact this movie is following Black Widow, which was a disappointing film not worth waiting the extra year for. The reason for that was it didn’t explain much that we needed to know and felt like it was just filler. Also it didn’t leave any room open for a direct sequel, as Black Widow died in Endgame. There are positives and negatives to being second in a new saga. If you’re into martial arts films or films with a mystical Chinese setting, then you won’t be disappointed. If you’re expecting full explanations from beginning to end, then you may not understand it. Still, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is worth a watch.

fourth grade class at Capt. Albert Stevens school asking us to publish some of their stories about what it was like to go to school during the pandemic. We agreed, and so began the series we called “COVID Classroom.” Somewhat to our surprise, the students continued to send stories through the fall, into winter and then spring. We ran 13 articles in all, each one reported, written and edited by students. For the final piece in the series, the class asked us to interview them. The result, below, does not follow the students’ practice of presenting first a question and then the interviewee’s answer. Because we were interviewing a whole class, the story is more an impression of the students’ responses than an exact rendering. We are grateful to Mrs. Nickerson and her class for inviting us to be part of their newspaper project. It has been a joy. BELFAST — The fourth grade class at Capt. Albert Stevens School taught by Nancy Nickerson, like nearly all schoolchildren around the globe, have had an unusual year filled with losses and challenges. They have also gained something precious, as they told The Republican Journal in a video interview June 4: they have become, in the words of one student, “a class family.” During the interview, Nickerson said she got the idea for a class newspaper from one of the students who had kept a blog when he was in third grade to which other students contributed. That student, Eliot Fowler, both wrote and edited stories for the paper. Nearly all the students said putting out their class newspaper, The COVID Chronicle, was among the most memorable aspects of the past year. They experienced many of the things professional journalists do: they gained confidence from learning to write better, learned to communicate well with their peers and to rely on them, honed time management skills, put themselves in their subjects’ shoes to craft good interview questions and took pleasure from doing interviews and seeing their finished work in print. After Nickerson’s class started their paper, the teacher told us, Principal Glen Widmer asked them to distribute it to the entire school, and another, larger enterprise was born: The CASS Times, published monthly through the principal’s office. While it also contained news articles, puzzles,opinion pieces, recipes and more, interviews with CASS teachers and staff were highlighted in the paper. Students talked to a cafeteria worker, music, art and gym teachers, the school librarian, the nurse, the principal, a teacher with triplets in her class and many others. Nickerson was their staff photographer. Students hold up letters spelling “COVID Classroom,” the name of their series of stories that ran in The Republican Journal. Courtesy of Nancy Nickerson Many of the interviews appeared in The Journal, and later some of them were picked up by Penobscot Bay Pilot and Bangor Daily News as well. Students said they were surprised and thrilled at how their project took off and attracted an audience far beyond their own classroom. Among the things students said they had learned from putting out their paper were that “It (putting out a newspaper) is not easy, but you get better going on. … Every article helps us learn,” and “(You have to) think deeply about your writing to make it interesting for the readers.” This pandemic year also taught them more general lessons: Friends are still friends even when you only get to see them on Zoom, extraordinary circumstances demand flexibility and adaptation, and don’t forget to include your thumbs when you wash your hands. Many of the students expressed their appreciation and affection for Nickerson, talking about funny things she did, like bringing in a board 6 feet long to give them a clearer sense of how far apart they should stay to reduce their chance of being infected with COVID-19. The teacher seemed to return their sentiments in full measure. The kids were also nearly unanimous in saying that both the difficulties brought on by the public health crisis and the shared enterprise of the newspaper brought them closer together, forming bonds that will not soon be broken. Eliot summed up his classmates’ thoughts when he said, “I felt like the newspaper was really an amazing thing to do … . I especially enjoyed doing it with this group of classmates because it really turned the year less dark.” Success! An email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup. Error!
