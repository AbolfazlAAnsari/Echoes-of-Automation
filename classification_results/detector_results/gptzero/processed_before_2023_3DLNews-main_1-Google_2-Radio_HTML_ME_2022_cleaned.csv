They can now officially add shepherd to their resume as they successfully corralled the sheep into the back of their police cruiser. It wasn’t long until they found the sheep’s home and returned him. Personally, I’ve always found Maine news to be refreshing. All too often you turn on national news, or venture to other states, and the stories cover so much evil and sadness. I’ll take a sheep in the back of a cop car any day. When keyboard warriors comment on news station posts things like, “This isn’t news,” I always want to ask them, “So what?” Again, I’ll take a story like this in my feed and on my TV any day of the week.
