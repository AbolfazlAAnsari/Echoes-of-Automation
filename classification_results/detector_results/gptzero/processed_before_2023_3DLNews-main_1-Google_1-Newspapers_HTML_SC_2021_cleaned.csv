Scattered thunderstorms for the afternoon. High 76F. Winds S at 5 to 10 mph. Chance of rain 60%.. Variable clouds with showers and scattered thunderstorms. Storms more numerous this evening. Low 63F. Winds light and variable. Chance of rain 50%. Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 3:58 am Annette Breaux is one of the most entertaining and informative speakers in education today. Laurens County School District #55 (LCSD 55) was the recipient of a Rural Recruitment Grant that allowed LCSD 55 induction teachers to hear directly from the renowned author at an induction meeting on Thursday, March 4. Seven Simple Secrets, which Breaux co-wrote with Todd Whitaker, was an induction teacher book study in 2020-2021. Breaux’s writings and presentations generate an immediate impact on the relationships between teachers and students. She left the LCSD 55 induction teachers with practical techniques for rapid implementation in teacher classrooms. In her talk, titled The Secrets to Impacting Student Achievement and Behavior, Breaux shared five basics for all teachers to remember. First, teachers must recognize that they are role models for their students. Then, she cited how important it is to teach with enthusiasm every day and relate all lessons to students' real lives. “There needs to be a big kid living inside of you to be a great teacher,” said Breaux. Finally, she shared some classroom management techniques. Breaux also included management tricks and ways to diffuse potential problems in the classroom in her presentation. LCSD 55 Special Projects Coordinator Alicia Scott, who oversees the induction program, said, “We are very excited to have this opportunity to bring a great educator and a great teacher to speak with our young teachers. It’s rare to have the chance to see and hear in person from someone whose work has informed your practice.” Scott added that LCSD 55 provides all induction teachers with a mentor and supplemental training as part of LCSD 55’s new teacher support system. Dr. Ameca Thomas, LCSD 55 Superintendent, added, “We understand the importance of supporting and growing new teachers. We want to help them develop into effective professionals in the classroom.” Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 3:16 am Turning a former grocery store into a one-stop-shop for voters and veterans will cost Laurens County $1.454 million, the County Council heard last week. That’s the latest estimate from Thomas & Hutton engineering, which is managing a design-build project for the county at the old Winn Dixie building off Hillcrest Drive in Laurens. It is close to the current center of government – Hillcrest Square, which is a converted shopping center. Voter Registration and Veterans Affairs will move out of the first floor of the Historic Courthouse in downtown Laurens. This – the county’s iconic building from the 1800s – will undergo a $3 million renovation. County revenues will fund the old Winn Dixie conversion. Sale tax revenues will fund the Historic Courthouse renovation. But there is much more space in the rear portion of the old Winn Dixie than the county needs for just voters and veterans. Additional uses are being examined. As is where the money will come from. The County can pay for it out of reserves – estimated at between $10 million and $12 million at the current time. Officials also are researching if Covid relief money from the federal government can pay for this work. County Attorney Sandy Cruickshanks says, in his opinion, it can – based on federal guidelines for having offices that protect the public from close-contact, a transmission point for the COVID-19 virus. These are monies from ARPA (the American Relief Plan Act). County officials are meeting Monday to start the process of making a recommendation to Council about how $13 million can be spent. The State of South Carolina is proposing to use some of its money to widen I-26, and the State of Alabama is proposing to use some of its money for prisons. The County Council plans to meet as a committee-of-the-whole to debate how this money should be spent. Also at its Sept. 28 meeting, the Laurens County Council got back to 7 members with the swearing in of Shirley Clark. A Democrat, she defeated Scott Tollison for election to the seat vacated by Garrett McDaniel, who took a job in the Biden Administration. Council appointed an 11-member committee to plan Laurens County’s role in the 250th Anniversary of the Revolutionary War observance in South Carolina. Musgrove Mill in Clinton will be part of The Liberty Trail being developed for this anniversary. The committee will come back, likely in December, with a budget and spending proposals centered on land acquisition and parking areas for Revolutionary War sites in Laurens County. There were 400 battle, skirmish, and murder sites in South Carolina during the nation’s War for Independence. Officials believe this anniversary will be a tourism draw for Laurens County. Council approved a rewritten subdivision ordinance – First Reading, by title only. Final action is about 8 weeks into the future. Council heard concerns from neighbors of a proposed RV Park in the northern area – the Clear Creek RV Park. Even though it has not received approvals, based on the county’s land-use ordinance, the park’s website is promoting it – and opponents say these promotions include offering “a bunkhouse” which they feel would attract transients and crime into a rural neighborhood. The County Council can’t take action until the Planning Commission makes a recommendation. Council added two items to its published agenda – a contract related to Emergency Medical Services and an unspecified employment matter (the council has been studying a recently received employees’ compensation study).
