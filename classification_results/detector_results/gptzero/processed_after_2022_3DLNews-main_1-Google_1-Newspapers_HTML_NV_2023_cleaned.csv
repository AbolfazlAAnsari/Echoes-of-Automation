Holdings. A luxury real estate brokerage is expanding its Las Vegas presence in one of two new leases announced at a Summerlin office building. Douglas Elliman and the Snell & Wilmer law firm have leased at 1700 Pavilion, a 10-story office building that opened earlier this year, according to a news release from developer Howard Hughes Holdings. Snell & Wilmer will occupy the entire seventh floor of 1700 Pavilion, which is about 27,500 square feet, and Douglas Elliman will occupy a suite that is just under 4,000 square feet, according to the news release. Douglas Elliman is expanding its presence in Las Vegas with the Summerlin office, which is about three times larger than the firm’s current space near the 215 Beltway and South Town Center Drive, said Stephen Kotler, CEO of brokerage for Douglas Elliman’s western region. The expansion for Douglas Elliman — which started its Las Vegas operation in 2022 — reflects a higher demand for the luxury real estate in the area, he said. “We have expanded to markets where our clients are,” Kotler said. Douglas Elliman has quickly grown from having about 30 brokers in 2022 to now having about 100 brokers, Kotler said. He also said the high migration of Californians to Las Vegas as well as the surge of professional sports teams in the area and the Brightline West high-speed rail project moving forward is making Las Vegas a fast-growing luxury real estate market. “Las Vegas is becoming the center of sports and entertainment in the country like no other city,” Kotler said. The Douglas Elliman office will be a “showcase” space for its Las Vegas clients and the firm is currently building out the office to match the design of other Douglas Elliman locations in the country. The buildout should be completed by mid-2024, Kotler said. He said 1700 Pavilion for the new office was the “obvious choice” for the firm because of its proximity to the many luxury homes in the Summerlin area and because of the brokerage’s extensive working history with Howard Hughes. Kotler also said being in Downtown Summerlin and within walking distance to many restaurants and retail options as well as the Las Vegas Ballpark is a big plus for attracting brokers to work for the firm. Snell & Wilmer has been operating in Las Vegas since 2001 and its space at 1700 Pavilion will be the center of operations for about 40 attorneys based out of Las Vegas, according to a spokesperson for the law firm. With these new deals, the 1700 Pavilion building is now 90 percent leased, according to the news release from Howard Hughes. Contact Sean Hemmersmeier at shemmersmeier@reviewjournal.com.

It’s me, The Fat Guy, coming at you with a delayed food review. I want to start with a couple of words for you. PREJUDICE: preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience. STEREOTYPE: a widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing. Yeah… guilty and guilty. Mrs. FG and I were invited by some friends to meet them at The Virgin River Cafe for some Chinese food. Chinese food … at a casino! Seriously!? How can this possibly be good? Mrs. FG can be a bit of a food snob, especially when it comes to Chinese. Taking into consideration we lived just a couple miles from the best Chinese Food ever, in our pre-Mesquite days, this was gonna be a tough sell. But being the food troopers that we are, off we went; with heavy prejudice. To make fair comparisons to other Chinese food experiences, I ordered my usual, Cashew Chicken. Mrs. FG went with vegetarian fried rice and vegetation stir fry. I was ready to watch her push it away. But she LOVED IT! Did I mention she can be picky? Now reassured, I gave my Cashew Chicken a whirl. Immediately excusing myself from the table, I headed out to find a Nai-Nai (a Chinese Grandma). This was certainly grandma slappin’…. er …. uh … NaiNai slappin’ good! Oddly enough I found that Chinese Grandmas don’t like being slapped either!! This stuff was GOOD. Good enough, in fact, Mrs. FG took her leftovers home. Something she rarely does! So listen, people. Be it in English or Chinese, ask the rich guy for financial advice. But for food advice, ask the Pangzi (Fat Guy) for food advice. Thats me, and I’m telling you to get yourselves over to the Virgin River Cafe CHOP-CHOP to get yourselves some of this Chinese food! Who knew? Yes, this place is definitely Pàngzi (Fat Guy) approved!! Our favorite Chinese in Mesquite is——Casablanca. ANOTHER casino. Yep. Try it FG. Your email address will not be published.

The public process is broken. For over 20 years, I have participated in land use planning efforts, attending more meetings than I could begin to count and writing more letters than I care to recall. I was even selected as a resident representative to help craft Placer County’s Tahoe Basin Area Plan (TBAP), which was approved in 2017. That planning process and several others I’ve participated in, including the 2012 Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) Regional Plan Update, have provided real opportunities to shape the future of the communities I’ve called home.

Two major planning processes in Lake Tahoe fail to provide an open and transparent public participation forum—the Placer County Tahoe Basin Area Plan (TBAP) amendments and the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) housing amendments. Let’s start with the TBAP amendments. These changes to the Area Plan were developed over a 2+ year timeframe, based on the input of seven business and development community members. The public most affected was not invited to participate, and the resident-representative teams were not reengaged. The final decision took place in Auburn on Halloween, outside of the community that would be impacted. These meetings are not typically held at convenient times or locations, but I can’t think of a better way to discourage folks from attending than that. What’s more is that new information was provided prior to the meeting on October 31st, but the public was not allowed to weigh in with additional comments (as is required by law). The original TBAP process was much more robust. The community brought forth recommendations, and compromises were made. But even then, Placer officials elected greater building heights by selecting the TRPA code maximum height of 56 ft in Kings Beach, not the 48 ft mountain-side and 36 ft lakeside recommendation brought forth by the resident teams. Still, at least we had the opportunity to be heard.

Maldonado, con publicaciones en la revista mexicana Orbe -digital- y antologías de poesías en España, integra el grupo LiterArte, es una apasionada defensora de la cultura, promueve exposiciones en la Galería Kaleidoscope, de reciente apertura, que suma exposiciones de pintura, fotografía, la muestra ‘Tela por donde cortar’, y hace pocos días la presentación del libro ‘Tu historia Mi historia’. La dominicana Llenas se hace sentir con poemas sugerentes y su magnífica conducción del espacio radial (GRACIAS MÓNICA ROCCA) ‘Cultura con sabrosura’, desde también, con al chispa que la distingue, promueve el arte, mientras la pequeña-gigante Cory Ordóñez tiene a bien presentar su libro ‘Amazing Ecuador una cultura bordada entre hilos de texturas y colores’, dando continuidad a sus ejemplares relacionados con la psicología. Pily Coblentz requirió que la animaran para que diera rienda suelta a todo lo que lleva por dentro, y justo es decirlo, protagonizó una sonada presentación de su ejemplar ‘El arte de vivir (muriendo)’, en una actividad en que muchas personas exteriorizaron el cariño que sienten por esta mujer enamorada del magisterio. A todas las escritoras y poetisas muchas gracias. FELICIDADES.

It’s a home fit for a king. Or in this case a prince. An unfinished compound measuring more than 110,000 square feet on a 16-acre estate in Spanish Trail has hit the market for $25 million. Owned by Spanish Gate Holdings Inc., the home at 99 Spanish Gate Drive has been linked in previous news accounts to Jefri Bolkiah, the prince of Brunei. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported in 2007 that the late music superstar Michael Jackson moved into Bolkiah’s compound. Luxury Realtor Ivan Sher, the principal broker and owner of IS Luxury, who is handling the listing, called the property “an unfinished masterpiece.” It started construction in 1996 and is about 90 percent complete. It hasn’t had any work done on it since 1999, he said. “The home is completely enclosed and finished, but what’s not included is appliances and some detailed finish work isn’t complete, but for the most part it’s a mostly completed home,” Sher said. “When they built it, they had different expectations about moving to Las Vegas and ultimately ended up not moving (into the house.)” Sher said this is the first time the home has been on the market but doesn’t know the details as to why it’s being listed now. He didn’t name the owners but said he hasn’t spoken “to the principals” and instead has dealt with lawyers and financial advisers. The 110,320-square-foot compound with 10 interconnected buildings overlooks the golf course with multiple guest residences and pools. In his listing, Sher said the sprawling estate nestled with a Spanish Trail enclave is “a vision of opulence that has taken shape that transcends the realm of imagination and is poised to redefine luxury living in the heart of Las Vegas.” Calling it a “manor of dreams,” Sher said that the home has been listed for more than a week and he’s already shown it to a dozen people and even has one offer and is working on a couple of others. He said many of those touring the home are Las Vegas-area residents who appreciate the land and architecture. “There’s definitely not anything like this in Vegas,” Sher said. “What separates the home is your own 16 acres. It is completely developed with grass, buildings, guest houses and infrastructure and over 100,000 square feet of compound. You even have four guest houses.” The centerpiece of the estate is the main house, which Sher calls “an architectural marvel spanning an impressive 37,466 square feet and crafted with an unwavering commitment to perfection.” The main house has five bedrooms and eight baths, and Sher used flowery language in his listing in describing the property. “A grand great room with soaring ceilings and exquisite detailing welcomes you with open arms,” Sher said. “The grand dining hall, an opulent stage for culinary mastery, invites you to host extravagant feasts. The music room resonates with the melodies of life, while the entertainment room promises unforgettable evenings of laughter and entertainment. For those who appreciate the noble sport of billiards, a dedicated billiard room awaits, adorned with all the trappings of leisure. A chef/catering kitchen, complete with a chef’s office, ensures every culinary masterpiece is executed with precision. Not to be forgotten, a one-bedroom, one bath butler quarters stands ready to attend to your every need.” The house is so large that it has rooms that other people wouldn’t have rooms for, Sher told Real Estate Millions. “In the main house, you have an entertainment room, billiard room, music room and a room where your clothes and jewelry are laid out in front of you,” Sher said. “The primary bedroom has a balcony that opens up and overlooks the great room. All of the secondary bedrooms are massive, and the scale of this is part of what’s so impressive. You walk in and you are in such awe of the spaces. You have a greeting room and breakfast room. You have all of these separate rooms with a very specific function.” Beyond the main house, the estate has a 47,367-square- foot athletic club/pool house. There is an indoor badminton court and a square court for squash. It has a hotel-sized spa, with a gym, men’s and women’s locker rooms and spa areas, Sher said. The building also has an indoor pool, bowling alley and nightclub. There is a guest suite with 10 baths. Two guest homes, each spanning 4,544 square feet, have four bedrooms and three baths in each, accompanied by private pool areas, Sher said. Two smaller villas, each offering 2,713 square feet feature three bedrooms and two baths. A separate study pavilion building, spanning 1,715 square feet, provides a quiet sanctuary, Sher said. A carriage house measuring 3,323 square feet showcases an eight-car garage and additional living space, including two bedrooms and three baths. The estate also has 30 spaces of uncovered parking. The estate has caretaker quarters with seven bedrooms and nine baths, with an eight-car garage. The landscaped grounds have resort-style amenities with a tennis court and two grand lawns for gatherings and celebrations. Sher said in his listing that garden terraces “meander throughout the property, offering enchanting views and a sense of serenity.” The listing continued, “Fountains dance to the rhythm of nature’s symphony, creating an ambiance of tranquility that envelopes you. Three outdoor swimming pools offer a cool respite on warm desert afternoons. Each pool area is a private oasis, perfect for lounging or entertaining. The estate has left no stone unturned in the quest for the ultimate in luxury living.” Sher said whoever buys the estate will need to put $20 million to $30 million into it to complete it. As for potential buyers, one is interested in the land and wants to develop it and put guests in the secondary homes. “That’s the most likely buyer, but it’s also a passion project,” Sher said. “They have fallen in love with it and connected with the property. Some want to preserve it and continue it. For those people, it’s the deal of the century. If they are just buying the land, $25 million is the right price. If they are going to keep the structure, then they get 110,000 square feet for free and put in another $20 million-plus.” The compound is located in the Spanish Trail Country Club, which features 27 holes of golf. It’s on the western-most portion of Spanish Trail and at the corner of Durango Drive and Hacienda Avenue. Sher said the home, which is steel and concrete and has no wood framing, doesn’t look like it has been sitting for nearly 25 years because it “looks almost untouched in a good way. It looks pretty immaculate for sitting there for 25 years.” Sher said the property is not just a residence. “It’s very special,” Sher said. “Whoever gets it is going to be incredibly fortunate and have a one-of-a-kind property, especially if they keep the house.” About the compound Price: $25M Location: 99 Spanish Gate Drive in Spanish Trail Size: 110,320-square-foot unfinished compound with 10 interconnecting buildings on 16 acres.

celebrated some conservation wins at their annual meeting here this week but quickly began sparring over who will bear the brunt of future pain that they agree a drying climate will dole out. Talk of cutbacks has long focused on the three states collectively known as the Lower Basin — Arizona, California and Nevada — and on Wednesday, representatives of California water districts and tribes signed federally funded deals to leave more water in the river’s largest reservoir over the next two years. On Thursday, interstate rivalries re-emerged as officials from the Upper Basin made clear they expect the Lower Basin to cut back much further before coming after their water. Farmers and other users in the headwaters states of Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico already go without in dry years because they don’t have a giant storage pool like the Southwest’s Lake Mead to augment nature. The region needs a plan to keep Lake Powell and Lake Mead from collapsing to the point where they can’t produce power or, in the worst case, even pass water downstream. The dams were not constructed with bypass tunnels at their bases, but have mid-dam turbine intakes and bypasses. The states dodged disaster this year after a wet winter, unlike most in this century, raised water levels at Lake Mead and Lake Powell, leaving each about one-third full. Arizona, California and Nevada still need a consensus plan that will pay users to forego some of their water, but they will likely have to give more when new shortage-sharing rules are negotiated to govern the river beginning in 2026. The upper and lower basins split just downstream of Lake Powell\'s Glen Canyon Dam, at Lees Ferry in Arizona, though Lake Powell\'s storage is primarily used to ensure the Upper Basin has enough water to fulfill its yearly obligations to the Lower Basin. The Upper Basin states use roughly half as much, and less in years when mountain streams dry up, and concerns over that disparity surfaced Thursday. “We can’t accept something that continues to drain the system, that puts 40 million people at risk,"" Colorado’s river commissioner, Becky Mitchell, told her interstate colleagues at the annual Colorado River Water Users Association conference. During a discussion of the upcoming negotiations, Mitchell agreed that Colorado and its Upper Basin neighbors will work to solve the growing crisis, but said the downstream states have the biggest obligation to live within their means and protect reservoir storage. Colorado farmers already suffer water cutoffs, even if they have water rights that predate the compact, because “Mother Nature” gives them no choice, she said. Those farmers aren’t getting paid in federal dollars to leave water in the system, as some California and Arizona agencies are. The upcoming negotiations must recognize and account for the hardship they already face, Mitchell said. “The one person that you cannot negotiate with is Mother Nature. She will win every time. She’s been telling us what to do,” Mitchell said. “I want an agreement that lessens the pain for all of us, not just some of us.” A new century of water: As the Colorado River is stretched thin by drought, can the 100-year-old rules that divide it still work? Lower Basin officials, including Arizona Water Resources Director Tom Buschatzke, said their states will “own” what they call the river’s and Lake Mead’s structural deficit, meaning they will accept deepening cuts as they become necessary to keep water flowing past Hoover Dam. But they can’t afford to cut enough to save the shrinking river without help from every corner of the watershed, he said. “This is a basin-wide problem that’s going to require basin-wide solutions,” said J.B. Hamby, who chairs the Colorado River Board of California. He meant the entire river basin, not just the three down-river states. The century-old Colorado River Compact designated those three as the Lower Basin and awarded what was then thought to be about half of the river’s flow. As it turns out, the 7.5 million acre-feet of water that the Lower Basin uses, not counting evaporation, is now considerably more than half of what the river naturally delivers. The Upper Basin has only developed enough uses to take about 4.5 million acre-feet. Each acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons, or enough to support a few households for a year, though most of the water goes to farms. Other Upper Basin water officials said their constituents already face cutoffs in many years, and that the need to send enough water downstream to cover Lower Basin demand leaves their states unable to fully develop. Utah farmers faced shortages this year, after the big snows of last winter, Utah’s Colorado River commissioner, Gene Shawcroft, said. “Even though we have an incredible (2022-2023 winter) snowpack, we’re still way behind where we need to be, and this year doesn’t look much better,” Shawcroft said. New Mexico’s river commissioner, Estevan López, said the Lower Basin’s willingness to tame its water deficit is welcome, and he acknowledged that all states must help in some way. “It’s going to be a shared responsibility,” he said. “Nobody’s going to be left out.” Water for the river: To keep the Colorado River\'s heart beating, people step in to do what nature once did The dispute over how much the mountain states must give could complicate attempts to reach consensus on a new management regime in the next two years. The old shortage-sharing deal the states negotiated and the U.S. Interior Department approved in 2007 expires in 2026, and everyone agrees its existing terms are not adequate to keep the river from drying, possibly to the point where it can’t flow to users downstream of Lake Mead. That would include nearly everyone who uses river water in Arizona, including metro Phoenix. Arizona has so far borne the brunt of the 2007 rules, a point Buschatzke emphasized by noting that those rules led to his state giving up 592,000 acre-feet of its 2.8 million acre-foot share this year. Arizona took those cuts before California faced any mandatory cuts, because the state previously had to accept a lower priority to secure congressional approval for the Central Arizona Project Canal that delivers river water to Phoenix and Tucson.
