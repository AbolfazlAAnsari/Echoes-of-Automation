Althorp Cannery on Chichagof Island west of Juneau near the mouth of Glacier Bay with a load of more than 3,000 tons of salmon and herring. The Ketchikan - a 250-foot Alaska Steamship company vessel - was headed with its cargo for Puget Sound, but it didn\'t get very far. Just outside of the Port Althorp harbor, the ship ran into a large iceberg that had floated down from the north. The ship began taking on water and the 30-member crew managed to beach the ship in nearby Pinta Bay. The holes were repaired, and the ship went on its way. None of the 30 crew members on board were injured. But the story made the New York Times on September 30, 1922. Steamship Nizina Eureka (1899-1937), a steel-hulled freighter built in Ohio was purchased by the Pacific Coast Steamship Company in 1907 and sold to the Alaska Steamship Company in 1916 and renamed SS Ketchikan and later Nizina. She was scraped in 1937. Photo Courtesy: Islapedia (The California Islands, Saving Their History, Telling Their Stories. https://www.islapedia.com It was barely a decade after the sinking of the Titanic and any time a ship hit an iceberg, it was still pretty big news, no matter how minor the scraping. The 2373-ton SS Ketchikan had been part of the ASC fleet since 1916, according to information in the Alaska State Museum on the history of the Alaska Steamship Company. Originally the ship was built in Washington state in 1898 to take advantage of the sudden need for larger ships to handle Gold Rush era traffic to Alaska. It was called the Eureka until Alaska Steamship bought in and renamed it the Ketchikan. In 1926, the Ketchikan was renamed the Nizina and continued to serve until 1937, when she was scrapped. And that\'s just about all we know about the SS Ketchikan. Fortunately, there is a much bigger story to tell about the Alaska Steamship Company, which was the primary way that goods and people came and went from Alaska for much of the early 20th Century. After the United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867, the US government immediately began subsidizing monthly boat service into the newly acquired territory. Initially, ships traveled between Portland Oregon and Sitka and also made occasional stops in Wrangell, which was the only other “established” community in the region. The primary service was to deliver the mail. Some of the ships also stopped at Fort Tongass, the brief military port post that was established on Tongass Island near the southern Alaska border with Canada. An early visitor on one of those steamships was none other than William Henry Seward who visited the Alaska territory in 1869 on the ship, The Active, shortly after resigning as Secretary of State. Seward gave a speech in Sitka in which he promoted the idea of an eventual Alaskan statehood and he also visited Fort Tongass. Seward had been the prime mover in the US acquisition of Alaska and he made the trip north even though he was in poor health and would die not long after he returned from his Alaskan trip. For the first two decades of Alaska service, the mail was handled by a revolving number of smaller ship lines. That changed in 1881 when the Pacific Coast Steamship Company of San Francisco took over the mail contract The Pacific Coast Steamship Company brought several familiar steamers intro the region including the Eureka (a different ship than the one that became the SS Ketchikan), the Idaho and sidewheeler, the Ancon, which would famously sink near Loring in 1889. With the development of the cannery at Loring in the early 1880s, the Ancon particularly became a familiar site in ""Tongass Narrows"" it approached Loring. Soon,""Tongass Narrows"" or sometimes just ""Tongass"" was listed as an ""as needed"" stop on the PCSC schedule, even though there was no community yet in the area around a large salmon stream called - appropriately enough - Fish Creek.

Public domain (first published before 1923) Stories about visiting Alaska were also appearing in national magazines and newspapers and PCSC noted at the time that around 25 percent of its Alaska business was tourism related. By 1891, there was a wharf in the growing community of Ketchikan - still sometimes spelled Kichikan - and ships were stopping monthly in the community. Over the next decade, as Ketchikan grew, steam ship visits became more frequent, and businesses developed in the ""downtown"" area to cater to their needs. Early curio and jewelry stores popped up along the waterfront. Multiple steam ship companies entered the market including the newly formed Alaska Steamship Company. With weekly steam ship visits now the norm, the local tourism industry continued to grow. The Klondike Gold Rush of 1897-98 caused a boom in the steamship travel to Southeast Alaska also led to Canadian-based steamships entering the market. In 1894, the Alaska Steamship Company was formed in Seattle. When the Klondike Gold Rush hit in 1897, the ASC expanded rapidly like just about all the other shipping lines on the West Coast, but unlike nearly all the others, it survived the Gold Rush. In fact, thrived. While several of the other lines had trouble adjusting to the sudden market drop after the gold boom ended, the Alaska Steamship Company set up subsidiary operations to carry ore from other mines in Alaska, particularly those in the Copper River area. That led to mergers than gave the ASC more than enough financial muscle to survive any downturns. The biggest merger was when the Alaska Syndicate bought controlling interest in the Alaska Steamship Company to service mines in the Wrangell Mountains. The Syndicate was owned by JP Morgan and Company and the Guggenheim family. Then there was another merger with the Northwest Steamship Company which also owned more than a dozen large canneries in the region. Soon there were 18 Alaska Steamship vessels plying the territorial waters from Ketchikan to Kotzebue. As other lines folded, Alaska Steamship developed a near monopoly on shipping to Alaska. Large ACS steamships such as the Alaska, the Chena, the Baranof, the Denali, the Aleutian, and the Nenana were common sights in the Inside Passage, dominating both the passenger and the supply markets in Southeast. In 1923, the Alaska Steamship Company inaugurated service of a 350-foot primarily passenger vessel, the Alaska II, on the Inside Passage run. While it wasn\'t the first passenger vessel on the run, it was the first ship to devote more space to passenger accommodations than the cargo storage. In 1932, she received new turbo electric powered engines and cut the travel time from Seattle to Ketchikan to under 40 hours for the first time. The Great Depression of the early 1930s put a damper in pleasure travel and for those years most of the steamer traffic to Alaska was supplies and people coming and going from the Territory. But after World War II, there was another push to increase tourism in the Last Frontier. Unfortunately other areas such as Europe and the Caribbean also saw tourism booms and Alaska didn\'t not keep up. That also spelled the end of steamship passenger service to the region.

exceeds Well test results from Kuparuk prospect beat ConocoPhillips\x92 expectations Kay Cashman Petroleum News A ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc. spokesperson told Petroleum News May 4 that well test results from its Coyote prospect west of the Kuparuk field were \x93very successful,\x94 exceeding CPAI expectations and \x93providing key data to help us better understand the Coyote reservoir interval.\x94 The company had side-tracked an existing well at 3S drill site in the Greater Kuparuk Area to test the Coyote prospect, which had been identified from review of a 2015 3D seismic survey. CPAI got the well down at the end of 2021. The company plans to drill a follow-up pair of wells (one producer, one injector) in the same area in Q4 2022 that \x93will enable us to gather other critical data to help us better plan for a future development of this reservoir from the 3S pad.\x94 CPAI officials have said that the primary Greater Kuparuk Area field development projects include Coyote, Nuna and Northeast West Sak. Regarding the status of Nuna, the company told PN on May 4: \x93We continue to progress the project planning and approvals for the development at 3T, a planned future drill site where we plan to locate the Nuna development. It will be sited on the existing gravel pad within the Nuna acreage we acquired from Caelus. We plan to drill some wells in the same reservoir in the 3S area in Q3 2022 that will provide key learnings to help us further optimize the 3T development plans.\x94 The 2015 survey was part of CPAI\x92s agreement to purchase the Nuna discovery from Caelus. It was a high-quality survey that covered the majority of the Torok reservoir accumulation, the target of both developments. The Torok sits at about 4,500 feet in the area. Pushing the envelopeWith improved drilling technology, in particular technology around horizontal drilling, CPAI has been working to contact more reservoir footage from a single well, which has led to a smaller footprint for each barrel of oil produced in the Greater Kuparuk Area. The company, which is headed by Erec Isaacson, continues to push the envelope on how far it can drill in a given well. The longer it can drill, the fewer number of wells needed in total to recover the resource. CPAI executive Lisa Bruner provided PN in a December interview with an example of pushing the envelope: \x93In 2018 we drilled one of our West Sak reservoirs called 1H NEWS. We only had four producers in that particular development, but we drilled a total of 127,936 feet, or 24 miles, of total lateral footage in four wells. We had low trouble time and really high efficiency so in terms of the number of days per foot drilled we made really significant progress. I would say with that development we pushed the boundaries of how much reservoir can be contacted with a single multilateral well.\x94 In 2015-16 the company drilled the Torok reservoir at Drill Site 3S, drilling a well pair and contacting more than 4,000 feet of reservoir in a single lateral. In its latest well pair it contacted about 12,000 feet of reservoir from a lateral, so a 300% increase from well pair to well pair. \x93We\x92re continuing to look for opportunities to push those lateral lengths even farther as we continue to develop the field,\x94 Bruner said. Kuparuk updates filedOn May 2, CPAI\x92s Greater Kuparuk Area development manager filed the 2022 updates to the plans of development, or PODs, for the Kuparuk, Meltwater, Tabasco, Tarn and West Sak participating areas, or PAs, within the Kuparuk River unit. \x93As always, these plans are subject to change based upon business conditions,\x94 Kuparuk unit operator CPAI told Derek Nottingham, director of Alaska\x92s Division of Oil and Gas, in its filing. The document was also the annual update to the Kuparuk River unit plan of development, as required by a letter dated April 11, 1986, from the Department of Natural Resources. The unit POD must be submitted by July 1 of each year for approval by Aug. 1. The POD period runs from Aug. 1, 2022, through July 31, 2023. The May 2 filing was done by CPAI on its behalf and on behalf of other KRU working interest owners, Chevron U.S.A. Inc. and ExxonMobil Alaska Production Inc. Kuparuk PA updateSummarized below by CPAI are \x93notable activities\x94 that were completed within the Kuparuk PA over the preceding year (Jan. 1, 2021, to Dec. 31, 2021): \x95 Completion of well sidetrack into the Brookian-age Coyote reservoir from DS3S. \x95 Completion of six CTD wells beginning in Q4 of 2021 added approximately 0.14 MBOPD gross oil in 2021. \x95 Completion of six workovers adding 0.1MBOPD in 2021. \x95 Execution of non-rig wellwork activity added approximately 7.3 MBOPD gross oil in 2021 compared to 9 MBOPD in 2020. \x95 Successful conversion of OPL Pipeline from NGLs to fuel gas. \x95 Successful completion of water filtration trials at multiple drill sites in 2021. In regard to Kuparuk base reservoir management, the company said it\x92s focused on \x93simultaneously optimizing the life cycle of the subsurface depletion processes of primary production, water flooding, miscible gas EOR, and immiscible gas.\x94 The company\x92s development drilling strategy is to target high value locations and to apply the appropriate well construction and completion technologies to minimize development drilling costs.

Cost reductions and efficiencies will be \x93essential\x94 to unlock the value of remaining Kuparuk resources, the company said. During the plan period CPAI plans to maintain the current operation of a workover rig and a coil tubing drilling rig. Rotary drilling is planned to resume in Q3 of 2022 \x93with an injector/producer pair in the Torok (Moraine) reservoir.\x94 CPAI said it \x93continues to monitor the two existing Torok (Moraine) horizontal producer/injector well pairs at DS-3S, to determine long-term deliverability and waterflood performance of the reservoir. This information is being used to characterize connectivity and to determine optimal inter-well spacing for future developments including the Torok (Moraine) wells planned during the plan period.\x94 CPAI intends to apply for a separate participating area for the Torok (Moraine) reservoir ahead of the 2023 Kuparuk River unit plan of development submission. \x93In addition to the Torok (Moraine) planned wells, CPAI also plans to pursue a well pair within the Coyote reservoir and an additional Kuparuk target during the plan period,\x94 the Kuparuk PA update said.

Please give us a call at 907-561-7737 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Service | Privacy Policy When I first noticed the large, red form in late July, I thought I’d found some kind of mutant berry. About 1½ inches long and three-quarters of an inch wide at its thickest point, the purplish-red “fruit” was faintly pear-shaped, with bristly, almost thorny, hairs covering its rough skin. Because it grew near some red raspberry plants, I wondered if it might somehow be related to those berries. Or maybe it was a deformed rose hip. Of course, rose bushes were also nearby. Whatever it was, the object seemed to grow directly from the plant’s main stem, no more than an inch or two above the ground. And the stem ended just above the bulging shape. Curious to know more, I pulled out my iPhone, went to its iNaturalist app, and used the fruit’s image to seek its identity. What came up was Diplolepis polita, the “spiny leaf gall wasp. A “gall” is a deformity caused by the eggs or larval forms of insects “invading” a plant, most commonly a leaf. The suggested ID also indicated that a wasp was responsible for this particular gall. I vowed to learn more. But before I could do an online search, I heard back from two iNaturalist “identifiers.” Both suggested that a wasp named Diastrophus turgidus had produced “my” gall. It turned out that one of the two, a fellow named Charles, is a Ph.D. candidate studying members of the Diastrophus genus. He wondered if I’d “be open to collecting and sending the gall” to him in the hope that he might “rear wasps” from it. I expressed my willingness to do so and asked Charles if he had any special instructions on how to best wrap/preserve the gall for mailing and further indicated my desire to know how the gall is formed. That began a series of exchanges that have now stretched across several weeks. My package safely reached Charles on August 9, and after a couple of gentle reminders, he sent me some general information about Diastrophus turgidus and its gall. A good starting point would be to share a definition of “gall.” Charles simply describes it as a “tumor-like growth” on a plant (a description he apparently pulled from the Current Biology article). A more detailed description I found online is this: “An abnormal swelling of plant tissue, caused by injury or by parasitic organisms such as insects, mites, nematodes, and bacteria.” Next, Diastrophus is a genus of gall wasps that are part of the larger Cynipidae family. D. turgidus is one of least eight species known to occur within that genus and reportedly was first identified in 1870 by Homer Franklin Bassett, who described the gall as “an abrupt swelling involving the whole circumference of the stalk.” (Taking things back even farther in time, Current Biology notes that the study of gall wasps in general included the work of “pioneering 19th century female naturalist Mary Treat.” Need I add that it’s refreshing to see groundbreaking women being acknowledged this way?) It’s almost a certainty that other species have not yet been identified, because much remains unknown about galls and the organisms that form them. Are you with me so far? The best is yet to come! The wasps that create the gall I happened upon in Ruth Arcand Park target only Rubus idaeus strigosus, better known to us ordinary folks as the American red raspberry. It was, therefore, no coincidence that I found the gall near several other raspberry bushes. Nor was it a coincidence that the gall formed on the plant’s main stem because that’s where these particular gall wasps lay their eggs. As Charles explains, the cycle starts with an adult female wasp mating with an adult male. The female then searches for a suitable host plant — a red raspberry—and injects or oviposits her eggs into the stem tissue. (Apparently, multiple wasps may deposit eggs on the same stem.) That egg laying begins the gall’s formation, a three-stage process that apparently is stimulated by the adult wasp’s venom, in combination with salivary secretions from the larval forms produced by its eggs. I won’t go into the details of that process here for several reasons. First, the scientific terminology is hard to follow—and even harder to translate into ordinary language for a forum like this one. Second, as Charles admits, “The exact mechanisms responsible for and behind the development and growth of the galls is still being uncovered.” Or as the authors of the Current Biology article put it, “We still know little about how galls are induced.” In the end, the interaction of wasp and raspberry stem produces a softer, nourishing interior with enough room for up to several dozen chambers in which the larvae can grow and thrive; and a harder, thorny, protective outer layer. Researchers say the gall benefits the wasp’s larval and pupa stages in at least three ways: the host plant provides nutritious “food”; the gall offers a “stable environment” while protecting the developing wasps from harsh external conditions, for instance, extreme weather; and it helps defend them from predators. What’s also rather remarkable is that the gall forms an entire ecosystem of life forms. In fact, gall wasps are considered “ecosystem engineers” in that they “modify the environment” in a way that enhances species diversity and richness. This is possible because the gall does not provide their wasp creators full protection. Eventually, an assortment of other organisms may inhabit the gall, including a wide array of parasites and predators that may “attack and consume” at least some of the wasps in their larval or pupating forms. There’s lots more to this story, including much that’s yet to be discovered by researchers. What strikes me the most is the complexity, diversity, and mystery that this strange-looking gall — and many other galls on other plants — holds within it. It’s so easy to miss or ignore the many insects that inhabit what we humans imagine to be “ordinary” woodlands; to overlook or turn away from the abundant blemishes — many of them galls of various kind — that adorn local plants; and to give little or no thought to the many complex natural processes going on around us all the time. Sometimes it takes a mutant-like form to get a guy’s attention and lead him into a largely hidden and rather extraordinary world, yet another of the many small but marvelous wonders with which (or with whom) we share this miracle of a planet.
