Yes, the left and fake media are being used to deceive and are being used by Satan to steal, kill and destroy those who are drinking from the contaminated well, watching CNN and other communist news outlets — you are being misled by the lies from the pit of hell. Even the so-called church and so-called Christian pastors are totally clueless, being led to the slaughter due to compromise and some doing Satan’s bidding. The church has failed; woe unto the shepherds who are leading their flocks to the slaughter house. When I saw the video of the death of George Floyd, it was horrific. I would have tried to stop this cop if I had been there. That policeman and the other three who stood by should all get life in prison. This was a disgrace and they all must be punished. Allowing Antifa and those following their evil deeds to destroy cities, loot and kill cops is a disgrace, too. Satan is having his way in destroying our country, and it seems we are falling from within. We are truly living in perilous times — the days of sorrows — at this very moment in time. God’s prophecies were written centuries ago and they cannot and will not be changed. The evils before us due to sin, God has allowed. During this time as things are unfolding of the end of days, we as God’s children must be that testimony like Jesus to those who are blinded, witnessing and sharing God’s truth in his word as to what is happening in our world now. Jesus said these things would happen in the latter days. “Jesus said, ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the father except through me.” John 14:6. I pray anyone reading this heart-felt message will repent from your sins and turn to Jesus before the tribulation time. God’s wrath poured out on the whole world for those who rejected his son Jesus and who follow the evils of this world. For those who truly know Jesus as Savior, we will be taken from this wicked world before God’s wrath takes place.

stuntwoman-turned-lawyer who represented him and her fiancé — a disbarred lawyer and convicted felon — took a gothic turn this week when the accused accident stager was fatally shot ahead of his arraignment. Cornelius Garrison, 54, was killed Tuesday night inside a Gentilly apartment, just four days after prosecutors accused him of causing more than 50 car crashes in exchange for $150,000. Garrison’s lawyer, federal public defender Claude Kelly, confirmed his client was the man shot dead in the 1500 block of Foy Street. Cornelius Garrison grew increasingly concerned for his safety as federal authorities zeroed in on him for allegedly having a hand in a sprawli… Garrison was scheduled to enter a plea in the case Oct. 5 along with several other defendants in the case, which has so far resulted in charges against 28 people. Kelly wouldn’t say whether Garrison intended to stand trial or plead guilty and cooperate with authorities against other defendants. But Kelly acknowledged that a wide circle of people knew Garrison was under investigation for having a hand in what authorities portray as a sprawling scam involving dozens of staged car wrecks resulting in hundreds of thousands of dollars in fraudulent insurance payouts. Sources familiar with the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Garrison had been cooperating with federal authorities, and investigators were examining the possibility that his killing was a hit meant to silence a witness. Whatever the motive, Garrison’s killing could have an effect on a case that presumably was being built against his attorney, Vanessa Motta. The charges filed against him allege that Motta, who features her work as an on-screen stuntwoman in television commercials billing her as “a bad a— attorney,” helped secure a fraudulent $650,000 settlement in an accident that Garrison staged and for which he was paid a share of the settlement. The court records don’t name Motta or her fiancé, Sean Alfortish, but they strongly suggest that Alfortish was paying Garrison to stage the accidents and referring the resulting legal work to Motta. Justice Department policy generally calls for using pseudonyms for people accused in documents of breaking the law but not charged with a crime. The indictment calls Alfortish “Co-conspirator A” and Motta “Attorney B.” His legal debt to society paid in full, Sean Alfortish wants back in the horse racing game. The car wreck allegations come about three years after Alfortish finished serving 28 months in federal prison. He pleaded guilty to rigging an election for the presidency of a nonprofit association for horse racing pros and track workers and to misspending some of the group’s money as president. That case cost Alfortish his law license. He now works as a medical financier, paying a portion of injured people’s medical bills up front in exchange for a larger payout if they collect damages from a lawsuit. Motta’s attorney, Dane Ciolino, acknowledged federal investigators have spoken to his client about the case and that Garrison’s charging documents refer to her. But Ciolino maintained Motta’s innocence and noted that the court records stop short of describing her as a co-conspirator. “I can tell you she had nothing to do with staging any wreck with Cornelius Garrison,” Ciolino said. “They’ve asked her for information, and she’s provided it.” Sources with knowledge of the case confirmed Thursday that authorities are closely scrutinizing Alfortish’s alleged role in the staged-accident scheme. The Sept. 18 indictment charging Garrison alleged that the person who paid him to crash cars into other vehicles was associated with a property where Motta’s law office was once located. That description seems to fit Alfortish, who once had an office in Kenner with an address where Motta also listed her workplace. Insurers have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to settle the fraudulent claims, authorities say Insurers have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to settle the fraudulent claims, authorities say Neither Alfortish nor Motta, who have a lakefront home together, has been charged with a crime. Attempts to contact Alfortish or an attorney representing him were unsuccessful Thursday. Garrison is among more than 28 defendants charged so far in the sweeping inquiry, which alleges that he and other motorists known as “slammers” intentionally crashed into 18-wheelers and other commercial vehicles in hopes of getting big insurance checks. Prosecutors have already secured guilty pleas from several defendants. Other defendants are accused of being passengers in on the scam. Their presence increased the number of alleged injuries in the staged accidents and thus boosted the payout. Sometimes a passenger would pretend to be the driver, when it was really Garrison. After a typical wreck, Garrison would abandon the car and one of his passengers would pretend to be the driver, call 911 and report the crash. An unnamed co-conspirator, matching the description of Alfortish, would pay Garrison a fee and advise him the payout would be larger if Garrison underwent surgery, prosecutors alleged. If anyone asked about the compensation, Alfortish told Garrison to say it was for construction work, according to the indictment. Motta usually represented the plaintiffs in those crashes, the indictment says. One such collision occurred in October 2015, when Garrison drove a Dodge Avenger belonging to another defendant into a bus. Court records show the Arnona Rose law firm first represented Garrison in the personal injury case filed after that crash. But in the summer of 2017, Garrison moved to replace that firm with Motta, who demanded a $2 million settlement from the bus company and its insurer. The bus company and its insurer paid $677,500 to settle that case, with $650,000 of that going to Garrison in an Aug. 7, 2018, check, the charging documents said. A little more than two weeks later, Motta gave Garrison a check for nearly $81,000 “in settlement for his fraudulent lawsuit,” the indictment said. A second wreck mentioned in the indictment naming Garrison occurred in September 2017, when he allegedly crashed a Toyota RAV4 into a tractor-trailer. That wreck ultimately resulted in a $30,000 settlement, prosecutors said. Garrison had faced one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and six counts of mail fraud. Kelly said Garrison was worried about his safety the entire time he was under the federal microscope. When news spread that police had found Garrison shot to death inside an apartment, both the defense and the prosecution were shaken, Kelly said.

Discussion regarding the plan to return the college back to its prominence was the topic of the Presidential Leadership Roundtable on Tuesday March 26th. Held in Pinchback Hall, … After almost three years of suspense, the long-awaited project from the Philadelphia-based rapper Lil Uzi Vert has dropped to the masses. Being one of the biggest stars on the planet and having a fan base that rivals that of some pop stars, Uzi has produced high-quality projects such as Luv is Rage 1 & 2, and The Perfect Luv Tape. The recent hiatus that the rapper has been on since mid-2017 prompted some fans to think that new music from the artist would never drop, until now. Composed of eighteen tracks in total, Eternal Atake does a good job of not being repetitive in its tone despite having very few guest verses. With each song having its own brand of soulful harmonies and melodies along with traditional trap drums and samples, there were very few times that the same type of song was found twice. Despite this, the flow of the album is concise and there aren’t any songs that feel out of place next to their contemporaries. In songs like “Lo Mein,” “Homecoming,” and “Silly Watch,” listeners were able to get a taste of how refined Uzi’s pen can be when he puts effort into being a wordsmith. This being said, like many rappers of his generation, the best of Uzi can be found in his production and delivery. “Slidin’ all on the ice like a hockey shot, Seventeen-five for a t-shirt; he got half like he pulled up just with a crop. Gators on me, you can’t catch me in bummy Crocs,” rapped Uzi in “Silly Watch.” This is an example of an unimpressive bar becoming a hard bar due solely to its delivery and production around it. Despite the production value and simplistic bars, the album in itself showed an improved pen from Uzi that was only interested in staying in its lane and having a good time, which can be found on any track in the album. The track “Homecoming” is a perfect example of this as we are given a catchy hook that’s then followed by 16-bars from Uzi. While there’s no direction for the song itself theme wise, it’s the type of turn-up song that clubs will have in rotation all summer. “I’m movin’ the bit just like an alien, chop with a fifty, my Uzi Israeli. See, I turned to the boss, can’t deal with no middleman; Anthony Davis, don’t deal with the Pelicans (What?),” rapped Uzi on the track. All in all, Eternal Atake filled the role that it was supposed to and will satisfy the fans who have been waiting for the project for so long. While it’s not clear when a new project will come from Uzi, the artist confirmed that a deluxe version of Eternal Atake is already in the works with names like Young Thug attached to it.

'When the federal government announced it would distribute nearly $6.3 billion to colleges to give to students in need, the aid was met with fanfare. The Education Department said April 9 the coronavirus money was on its way. For nearly every student, the money still hasn’t arrived. On Tuesday, the Education Department specified that huge groups of students wouldn\'t be eligible at all. For instance, students who are ineligible for federal student aid can\'t get this emergency money. That includes undocumented students, international students and recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program from President Barack Obama\'s administration that offered immunity for two-year periods to immigrants brought to the country as children without documentation. And some eligible students don’t even know the money is supposed to be available to them. That was the case for Alyssa Willey, 22. She is in her final year studying photography at the University of South Carolina, and the last few weeks have felt precarious. She normally works two part-time jobs, one at a local vintage thrift store and the other as a manager of a photography lab at the university. She hasn’t been able to work at either for roughly two months, and she worries about her ability to buy groceries. She is behind on her April rent, though her landlord is giving her more time to pay. She has applied for unemployment, but hasn’t heard anything yet. Her tax refund has yet to arrive, and she wasn’t eligible for the stimulus checks made available through the CARES Act. She also said she was looking to receive some aid from the university tied to her job, but she hasn’t seen that money either. “People keep saying, ‘Here is all this money,’ ” she said. “But it’s not being given out.” College students + stimulus checks: Here’s what you need to know And now she feels the same way about this latest round of federal money. It would help, she said, but she is not sure if she will be eligible for it. Jeffrey Stensland, a spokesperson for the University of South Carolina, said the university has developed a method to distribute money to students, and officials are eager to start communicating that to students. Still, that means so far students have heard nothing. The university, like many around the country, blamed the Department of Education for a lack of guidance. The Education Department had said colleges were unnecessarily delaying the process, before releasing more instructions on Tuesday. “We were advised not to offer specific details prior to those being issued,” Stensland said. “Please know that we’re doing all we can to address the multitude of questions and concerns of students and families.” Meanwhile, Willey said she will wait. “We’ll get through it,” she said. “I have had times before when I haven’t had any money.” Financial crisis: Coronavirus could change where students go to college, if they go at all Through the CARES Act, colleges will receive about $14 billion, roughly $6.3 billion of which must go to students who are impacted financially by the coronavirus. The amount a college receives is largely based on the number of full-time students who are eligible for Pell Grants, federal scholarships for low-income students. Institutions themselves are supposed to determine who will receive the money, according to the Education Department. The funding was meant to help students pay for course materials, food, housing and health care, among other things. Colleges had been wary of distributing the money for fear of running afoul of future guidance from the federal government, said Justin Draeger, CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. There were questions, he said, of which students were eligible and just how the funds could be used. Colleges needed assurance they wouldn’t be penalized for how they give out the money down the line. Colleges are on the edge: For many, coronavirus threatens their very existence Colleges also are figuring out whether to institute an application process or how to find out how students have been affected by the coronavirus, he said. But the biggest problem? Of the institutions Draeger has spoken to, all have yet to receive it. And they can’t distribute money they do not have. On Tuesday, after USA TODAY and other media outlets wrote about this issue, the Education Department said it had released some of the federal money meant to shore up institutions\' finances. The department said about half of eligible colleges had applied for the emergency money. Ahead of Tuesday\'s comments from the Education Department, the USA TODAY Network reached out to more than a dozen institutions across the country to find out what they had told students about the federal aid. For the most part, their answers were light on details. Few colleges could say when the money might be going out to students. Many said they had developed formulas or rough ideas for how to get the money to students, but they didn’t want to implement those without further guidance from the federal government. Arizona State University is supposed to receive roughly $32 million for its students — one of the largest amounts of any university in the country. Officials said priority would be given to students with ""unforeseen financial changes due to issues such as job loss, income reduction or illness."" As of Monday, universities such as Ohio State, Indiana and Louisiana State — each of which is receiving millions of dollars from the CARES Act — lacked a plan for distributing that money to students. Ohio State released a plan on Tuesday, saying students must apply for the money and it would be distributed based in part on students\' circumstances. The University of California at Berkeley also said it was still developing a process to distribute money. ""Our main focus in allocating the funds will be to ensure that students can continue to make progress towards graduation,"" spokeswoman Janet Gilmore said in an email. Clemson University in South Carolina said it hadn’t made any decisions yet, but a working group would give recommendations to its board of trustees. Similarly, the University of Texas in El Paso said regents for the University of Texas system had to approve any plan for dispersal. At Bob Jones University, a private university in South Carolina, students will have to fill out an application for the money. Priority will be given to students who were financially affected by the disruption of the spring semester, the college said. McMurry University, a private university in Abilene, Texas, is planning to pass out money based mostly on students\' expected financial contribution, a federal number based on a family’s wealth that schools often use to award financial aid. Two for-profit universities, the University of Phoenix and Grand Canyon University, said they planned to give students an extra allotment of federal money. Both the student aid money and additional federal money meant to shore up universities during the pandemic would go to their students, the colleges said. The online-heavy University of Phoenix, however, is only giving its money to students who were not ""exclusively studying online before the COVID-19 pandemic.""

""We can\'t keep businesses closed forever, we can\'t isolate South Carolina from the rest of the world,"" he said. During an afternoon press conference in Columbia, the governor urged people to stay out of confined places, avoid crowds and respect others. ""We all have to practice that social responsibility,"" he said. South Carolina surpassed 15,700 total coronavirus cases on Wednesday, with 3,641 cases reported since the beginning of June. In Greenville County, 678 of its 2,371 cases were reported in June, according to data from the state Department of Health and Environmental Control. State Epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell said as cases rise across the state, the percent of people testing positive is also increasing, showing that more people who are being tested are sick. On Wednesday, 12.9% of new tests statewide were positive. The percent positive on May 27 was 2.7%. ""I have to say that today I am more concerned about COVID-19 in South Carolina than I have ever been before,"" Bell said. ""For the past two weeks, we\'ve seen some of our highest daily numbers since the pandemic began."" State health officials noticed a spike in cases following Memorial Day weekend, and have seen an ongoing, upward trend in new cases since, Bell said. She did not say whether or not the new cases were tied specifically to protests, but said they could be attributed to various large community gatherings. Greenville County, identified by DHEC as a ""hot spot"" for the virus, had 145 new cases Wednesday. There were several instances in the Greenville area of the virus being spread among members of the same household, she said. Bell said she couldn\'t stress enough how necessary it is to consistently take precautions, specifically wearing a face mask in public and practicing social distancing. ""We really need all South Carolinians to take these precautions every day, not just to protect ourselves, but to protect others who may become severely ill or could even die if they\'re exposed,"" she said. McMaster echoed those precautions, and said he would not close down businesses or require face masks in public. ""The answer is individual responsibility, it\'s not mandates by the government,"" he said. Coronavirus updates in SC: Here\'s what you need to know Later this month, the General Assembly is expected to begin deciding how to allocate an initial chunk of the $1.9 billion in federal COVID-19 aid South Carolina is receiving through the CARES Act. McMaster requested lawmakers put at least $500 million into the state\'s unemployment trust fund, which is typically funded by employer contributions. At the start of the pandemic in early March, the fund had $1.1 billion. By December, projections show the fund will be more than $600 million short, McMaster said. A $500 million contribution will nearly bring the fund up to level, but ""if the economy is worse than we thought, then that $500 million won\'t even be nearly enough,"" he said. In addition, McMaster asked $225 million be used to reimburse COVID-19 expenses to state agencies, local governments, hospitals, first responders and institutions of higher education. Public school districts could also receive $215 million for five days of additional classroom instruction either by starting the school year early or expanding school hours.

After a regular season that had the highest of highs and lowest of lows, the McNeese men’s basketball team earned a trip to the Southland Conference Tournament thanks to a late Dru Kuxhausen 3-pointer to beat Lamar on Saturday. The Cowboys (15-16) and Cardinals (15-16) met twice in the regular season, with each team going into the opposing arena and leaving victorious. A season series can’t get much closer, with Lamar outscoring McNeese 162-161 in both games during the regular season. The score will be settled for good when No. 7 seed McNeese and No. 6 seed Lamar will play for the third and final time this season tonight in the first round of the SLC Tournament at the Leonard E. Merrell Center in Katy, Texas. “Obviously we’re looking forward to going and playing in the conference tournament,” McNeese head coach Heath Schroyer said. “This is championship week and we’re obviously excited to be a part of it.

In the loss, the Cowboys allowed Lamar to shoot 50.8 percent from the field and 43.8 percent from 3-point range. The 14 3s that the Cardinals hit in the win over McNeese on Feb. 1 tied for the third-most that the Cowboys allowed in a game. Contrast that to Saturday, when McNeese held Lamar to 31.8 percent shooting and 33.3 percent from beyond the arc. Lamar sophomore Davion Buster scored 39 points on 11 of 18 3-point shooting when the Cardinals beat McNeese, and he was held to 10 points on 2-of-7 shooting from the field in Saturday’s game. “There’ll be a lot of people,” Schroyer said when asked how McNeese will guard Buster tonight. “I think you have to rotate multiple guys on him. I think he’s a phenomenal player. He had our attention obviously from the jump. We’ll rotate everyone through him to be honest.” When McNeese is on offense, Schroyer said to he expects senior forward Sha’markus Kennedy to be double-teamed when the ball is passed to him in the post. They’re hoping Kennedy will make the correct pass that leads to finding the open person for a good shot. Lamar will also pay plenty of attention to Kuxhausen, who didn’t have his best shooting game (5 of 14 from 3-point range) against Lamar on Saturday, but he got the big shot when needed. “I’m guessing it’s going to be tough,” Kuxhausen said. “They’re a really good team.

We’re going to be ready to play, so I think it’ll be a good game.” McNeese forward Truman Moore is working his way back from a concussion he suffered last Friday and is questionable for tonight’s game.

In spite of the injury, Lawson has been effective, averaging 9.4 points and five assists in his last seven games since the injury. McNeese is 3-4 in those seven games, with Lawson averaging 14 points and 6.3 assists per game in the wins. He didn’t crack double figures in the losses.
