The saloon, famous for its live bull riding nights which attract roughly 4,000 spectators, was making one million dollars a month pre-pandemic. During the height of enforced health and safety restrictions, the saloon was making less than a tenth of what it previously made.“We were closed for takeout only for three months, and then an 8 p.m. curfew for a couple of months, and then under severe distancing and face mask requirements for six months. So really we’re just now kind of getting back on top,” owner Larry Wendt said.Wendt had to lay off over 70 staff to be able to stay open, as well as put a stop to entertainment such as live music, dancing and bull riding due to social distancing regulations. The business is currently still under stadium law, which means that it can hold 500 or more people but the amount of people coming in and out has to be controlled. “We don’t have a strict social distancing or any facemask requirements, but we do kind of limit the number of people in and out. The reason for that is quite frankly, we just cannot hire enough staff to keep up with the demand that we’ve got. There is a lot of pent up demand out there from COVID to get out and see bull riding or dance or listen to a live band and eat some good, award-winning barbecue,” Wendt said. Phoenix Magazine voted the establishment “Best of the Valley,” and True West awarded it “Best Western Saloon,” calling it one of the “last truly great cowboy saloons.” The saloon has faced many hardships over the years. The original Buffalo Chip Saloon, built in 1951, burned down in 2015 at the hands of an arsonist. It was rebuilt in 2017 after major fundraising. Wendt said his business is finally starting to recover from the pandemic, but it will take some time to recover completely. The Buffalo Chip now makes about $500,000 per month, compared to the one million it was making before the pandemic hit. Angela Stormer, manager of the saloon, said the period after COVID-19 began to affect businesses was an extremely stressful, emotional and an uncertain time for her, as well as everyone who needs to work to get by. “We had about 130 employees at the time, and a month into COVID – we had three left. It was very scary. As a mother, I was scared, and I will never forget the day Larry told us three office employees not to worry. He literally found jobs around this vacant, closed down restaurant for us to do and paid us with his own personal money just so we could pay our bills and feed our children,” Stormer said.Cave Creek Mayor Ernie Bunch said that lockdown restrictions seriously impacted the town. Cave Creek is a popular western tourist attraction and entertainment area, but with saloons and places of mass gatherings closed, many people lost their jobs and the town and its residents and businesses suffered financially. “The story of the Buffalo Chip is about resiliency of the brand. COVID started in March of 2020, and just five years before that on Thanksgiving Day the place burned to the ground. The resiliency of the ownership makes it a special story; we’re talking in a period of five years, two major catastrophes affected that business. In one of them, it was completely destroyed, and then the other brought it to its knees, but it’s back,” Mayor Bunch said. Mayor Bunch said that once the valley lost Rawhide, the western atmosphere kind of disappeared from the area, but the Buffalo Chip brings to Cave Creek what Rawhide brought to Scottsdale. “The Buffalo Chip is just another prime example of what Cave Creek has to offer the valley,” Mayor Bunch said.The saloon might be Cave Creek’s main attraction, and for good reason. The venue is family friendly and hosts a wide array of events aside from bull riding, such as dance lessons, sports game watch parties and live music. Wendt said Waylon Jennings, Garth Brooks and Asleep at the Wheel and many more have played at his business.As for the main attraction, about 20-30 amateur and professional bull riders are recruited from all over the country for every show. Occasionally, a spectator can ride a bull as long as they haven’t been drinking and they sign a waiver. Luc Pascale, 21, said he’s ridden over 100 bulls at the Buffalo Chip. For those who are less daring, there is a rideable mechanical bull at the saloon. As well as bull riding, there’s mutton bustin’ on Friday nights – which is when kids younger than 10 years old ride a sheep for as long as they can hold on. “They wear their cowboy hats and everything, but these kids hang on to the sheep and run across the arena, and it’s just fun to watch,” Wendt said. Kelley Francis, digital communications specialist for the town of Cave Creek, said that her family has been going to the Chip for the last 20 years. “We don’t have many places like the Chip and Harold’s and the other businesses in town, and it’s been around for a long time and that speaks to the heritage of this town. I think it’s relevant for places like the Chip to succeed to keep the western heritage that a lot of people from around the world adore,” Francis said.'}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:50 am An airsoft player points an imitation gun around a corner at Dreadnought Airsoft in Phoenix on Nov. 22. The player has removed the fake gun’s orange tip. Tempe police responded to a 911 call on Jan. 15, 2019, about a suspected burglary in an alley. Officer Joseph Jaen arrived to find Antonio Arce, sitting in a truck with a handgun. Jaen called to Arce, 14, who turned and ran. “Let me see your hands!” Jaen yelled, but Arce continued running, and Jaen shot and killed him. In body camera footage taken minutes after the shots, Jaen can be heard saying “It’s a (expletive deleted) toy gun.” It was, indeed, an airsoft replica of a Colt 1911 pistol, with its orange tip still intact. “That’s supposed to alert the public, as well as the police, to the fact that this is not a real gun,” said Daniel Ortega Jr., a lawyer for Arce’s family. Airsoft guns use springs or compressed air to fire nonlethal plastic projectiles. Since 2015, at least 4% of deadly police shootings nationwide have had victims holding “toy weapons,” including children’s toy guns, nonfunctional replicas, BB guns, and airsoft guns like Arce’s, according to the Washington Post’s Fatal Force database, which catalogs such shootings. The most recent shooting of a victim with a “toy weapon” in Arizona occurred in Phoenix on Nov. 30, when an “unidentified person” with a BB gun was shot. There have been at least three since then, according to the database, the most recent on Jan. 9 in Pembroke, North Carolina. Arce’s death was one of 214 fatal police shootings nationwide since 2015 – 12 of them in Arizona – in which the victim carried a “toy weapon.” “That incidence alone – a few short minutes, seconds – ruined the lives of a number of people,” said Arizona state Sen. Lela Alston, D-Phoenix. Arce’s shooting recently has received renewed attention in Tempe city hall. Police reform has “accelerated during 2020,” prompting the city to “embrace the notion that change is positive” in the field of public safety, as City Manager Andrew Ching told the city’s newly founded Public Safety Advisory Task Force on Oct. 14. The task force’s goal is to formulate a strategic plan to improve local policing in 2021, and the group concentrated on Arce’s case at its Nov. 10 and Dec. 2 meetings. “(Tempe’s) actually taking this moment, and this opportunity,” said Michael Soto, task force member and executive director of Equality Arizona, “to ask these hard questions of what’s actually happening in this police department.” Soto asked one key question on Nov. 10: Are police officers trained to distinguish airsoft guns from real ones? His question went unanswered during that meeting, but Greg Bacon, media relations detective for the Tempe Police Department, said in an email interview that officers are not trained to differentiate fake guns from real ones. They are trained to de-escalate situations involving any apparent firearm. Law enforcement’s “biggest concern regarding imitation firearms,” Bacon said, is their realistic design. Police must treat all guns they encounter as imminent threats, according to David Carter, a criminal justice professor at Michigan State University whose research on imitation guns dates back to a 1990 Bureau of Justice Statistics report. The report was commissioned as part of a 1988 federal law mandating orange tips on imitation guns, prompted in part by a hostage situation in which a man threatened a Los Angeles reporter with a realistic-looking airsoft gun during a newscast. Carter said his 30-year-old survey of American police departments remains persuasive today, in part due to a lack of funding for additional research since 1990. Beginning with the Dickey Amendment to the federal omnibus spending bill in 1996, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was prohibited from funding research related to gun control, according to a 2019 dissertation on imitation firearms by Kristine Gregory, a police detective in Colorado. CDC research into “firearm violence prevention” resumed on Sept. 30. Imitation guns are designed to look like real firearms, which potentially endangers those who take airsoft guns out in public, experts say. Similarly, real guns can be manufactured in bright colors typically associated with toys. Because any gun presents potential risk, Carter said, the circumstances officers encounter and the behavior of the person holding the gun matter more than the gun’s physical appearance. In Arce’s case, said Ortega, the family’s lawyer, what Jaen saw – a boy about 100 feet away, quick to flee – should have dissuaded him from shooting Arce “whether it was an airsoft gun or not.” Carter said education about the risks of playing with guns, genuine or fake, would limit killings of people holding airsoft guns. “But realistically, I think it falls on the police,” he said, adding that use-of-force training could help. In its Nov. 10 workshop, the Tempe task force called Jaen’s minimal de-escalation training a “notable failure” by police in the Arce shooting. Beyond police reform, a review of recent legislation reveals a push in California, New Jersey, New York and other states to address imitation firearms by mandating unusual colorations for fake guns. However, imitation guns’ aesthetic authenticity currently benefits many groups. Police, military and civilians alike say they can use airsoft guns for firearms training. Gun manufacturers say airsoft guns attract younger consumers, and military simulation (MilSim) hobbyists rely on airsoft guns to mimic combat scenarios. Efforts to regulate imitation firearms could affect all these practices, airsoft fans say. Arizona has neither proposed nor enacted any such laws. Geraldine Hills, founder of Arizonans for Gun Safety, said “the last time we passed any substantial gun regulation policy in the state was 2000” because of Arizona’s gun-carrying culture. As such, Sen. Alston said, “the imitation gun issue just has not risen to the point that it’s been a major issue for us.” About airsoft guns’ realistic design, she added, “Well, that I don’t get at all. I have no idea who would benefit from it.” Hoxton November and other MilSim participants say they appreciate the realism. November, based in southwestern Arizona, is an administrator of the Airsoft Arizona Facebook group, a forum for 3,500 fans who attend events across the state. Many gather weekly, role-playing as military groups. “It’s no different than any other hobby out there,” said November, an Army veteran whose name is an alias he uses in Arizona’s MilSim community to avoid creating issues with his government job. November entered MilSim in 2008 in North Carolina when he befriended a man selling airsoft guns from a mall kiosk. Soon after, he was hooked. “You end up creating a really strong friendship and a really strong bond, and it’s the same like when you’re in the military,” November said. On the airsoft playing field, realism is essential, said Bryan Bijonowski, owner of VIP Airsoft Arena in Phoenix and Gilbert. “No one’s going to want something that looks like a toy,” he said. One obstacle to realism is federal law. Vendors must sell airsoft guns with orange tips on their barrels to distinguish them from real guns. Many players discard these tips after purchasing their weapons, November said, and MilSim participants sometimes tease those who don’t. Imitation gun realism also benefits manufacturers. A gun company can use airsoft to “expose (its) brand to a much wider consumer base,” said Tim Seargeant, marketing manager for Kriss USA, a California arms company that makes the airsoft line Krytac. Krytac’s airsoft guns imitate real firearms made by Kriss, as well as War Sport and Barrett under licensing agreements. Seargeant said customers have to be 18 to purchase airsoft guns, but many users are in their early teens. “Hopefully when they grow up, they become gun owners,” he said. “They’ll remember that hey, they had the Kriss Vector airsoft gun when they were a kid.” Airsoft guns aim to replicate firearms, he said, and so do not contain additional safety features. Charles Heller, media coordinator for the Arizona Citizens Defense League, an activist group fighting restrictions on gun ownership, said this authenticity makes imitation guns valuable for firearms training. “These are tremendous tools of safety,” Heller said. “This is how you safely teach a child how to shoot a gun.” Military and law enforcement also employ airsoft guns. “It can be a useful tool to use airsoft for training purposes … when the proper restrictions and safety measures are taken,” said Gregory, the Grand Junction, Colo, detective who wrote the 2019 dissertation. This utility depends on realism, she said. “In a military-type setting, I don’t think a neon green airsoft gun is going to do the trick,” Gregory said. Since Congress mandated orange tips in the 1980s, airsoft guns have become more authentic through advanced electrical mechanisms and metal exteriors, Seargeant said in an email interview.

On July 30, the San Carlos Apache Tribe announced the acquisition of the Dream Manor Inn of Globe, Arizona. The purchase of Dream Manor Inn was made by the San Carlos Apache Healthcare Corporation (“SCAHC”), a subsidiary enterprise of the Tribe, known in Apache as Izee’ Baa Gowąh (to heal, serve and empower the N’dee, the Apache people). Chairman Terry Rambler said, “This is a truly historic investment – the first time the Tribe has ever purchased property and a major business outside our Reservation. For quite some time the Tribe has been the largest employer in the region, now with over 2,500 employees, purchasing over $130 million in goods and services, a combined payroll of over $100 million and annual revenues of nearly $300 million. From Apache Casino & Resort to world class fishing and hunting, from our sawmill, sand and gravel operation, and convenience stores, from our telephone and internet services to our hospital, we have become integral to the region’s economy. We now join the City of Globe as a proud member of its business community, and we look forward to our growing partnership over the years to come.” Steve Titla, Chairman of the SCAHC Board of Directors, said, “The footprint of Izee’ Baa Gowąh has exponentially grown over the past six years since we opened. We have grown to almost 770 employees, including over 150 doctors and 90 nurses, many of whom travel from Tucson, Phoenix and all over the country to work at our hospital in Peridot and the Clarence Wesley Health Center in Bylas. The growth of our programs has forced us to think outside the box and be innovative in securing our future. The purchase of Dream Manor was a business decision, one that will greatly assist the Corporation with recruitment and retention of top healthcare providers and staff by offering premier housing.” SCAHC operates a Level IV trauma center and hospital with 12 inpatient beds, accredited by The Joint Commission, as well as the Clarence Wesley Health Center, a satellite outpatient primary care, specialty and dental services. The hospital operates an outpatient surgery unit that will feature six highly experienced and credentialed surgeons that will provide cancer screening (colonoscopy and endoscopy), cataract surgery, minor orthopedics and general surgery. SCAHC is also in the final stages for critical access hospital designation. During the Covid-19 pandemic, SCAHC was seeing 824 patients per day on average. Fiscal year 2020 unaudited financial statements for the Corporation indicate a net profit of close to $14 million, while unaudited revenue totaled $122.7 million. The Dream Manor Inn has 35 rooms, two kitchens, a banquet facility, a gym and conference rooms. It sits on a 25-acre hill overlooking the junction of U.S. Highway 60 and Arizona State Route 77, and will remain a premier commercial hotel, permitted by the City of Globe. Guest rooms, conference and banquet facilities will all be subject to availability.

(Miner file photo) PHOENIX - Federal land-management agencies have agreed to do more to keep cattle from grazing in sensitive habitat for threatened and endangered species in the Verde River watershed, settling a lawsuit filed by environmental groups. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service agreed to regularly inspect riparian areas near grazing land and promptly take steps to return any cattle to their owner and fix broken fencing. The settlement was approved on Wednesday by a federal judge in Phoenix. “Their cows get fat by destroying our rivers. These ranchers make money by disobeying or by not following the rules and the law,” said Robin Silver, cofounder of the Center for Biological Diversity, which filed the lawsuit along with the Maricopa Audubon Society. “Now this requires the ranchers actually to comply. And it requires the Forest Service to actually do their jobs.” The settlement is the third this year involving cattle grazing in Arizona where federal officials agreed to enforce longstanding protections for endangered species and their habitat. Cattle have for years been banned from streambeds and other sensitive areas but little has been done to enforce that law. Environmental groups have for decades been at odds with the federal government over what they consider lax enforcement of grazing boundaries. They say cattle grazing near rivers and streams trample wetlands and destroy habitat that allow rare plants and animals to thrive. Those include southwestern willow flycatchers, yellow-billed cuckoos, Gila chub, loach minnow and spikedace fish, Chiricahua leopard frogs, and narrow-headed and northern Mexican garter snakes. The Verde River agreement affects 140 miles (225 kilometers) of streams and 22 ranching allotments in Northern Arizona. Two similar settlements this year affect the White Mountains in Eastern Arizona and the Gila River watershed spanning the Arizona-New Mexico state line. Cattlemen say the federal government is already overextended managing the forests and other lands they control. ""At the end of the day, the US Forest Service doesn’t have a good track record,"" said Patrick Bray, executive vice president at the Arizona Farm and Ranch Group, which represents many cattle ranchers. “It’s going to take maintaining fence, it’s going to take working with permittees and others to make sure that you meet it.” Bray and others say the federal government is being hamstrung by environmental groups like the Center for Biological Diversity, and that many of the cows that are causing damage are unbranded, wild cattle that no one owns. “The Center for Biological Diversity, they’re a radical left wing group. And they do what they can to get rid of cows,” said Steve Pierce, a former state lawmaker who owns a ranch north of Prescott. “But the other side of it, the cows aren’t destroying nearly as much of the habitat as the forest fires.” Pierce said if the federal government allowed enough cattle grazing and other uses, there would be fewer fires and better habitat for endangered species. Republican Rep. David Cook, a rancher from Globe, said it was wild cattle doing most of the damage. He described a merry-go-round where the federal government agrees to keep cattle out of sensitive areas to settle a lawsuit but no cattlemen are allowed to argue their side of the debate in court and little is done. Then years later another lawsuit ends in a settlement. “So now they’re wrong again, right?” he said of the Forest Service. Bray agreed. ""Maybe the (Center for Biological Diversity) feels that they got what they needed or wanted"" he said. “At the end of the day, I don’t hold much faith that the U.S. Forest Service is going to follow through and 10 years from now we’ll be in the same boat.” Your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers: Account processing issue - the email address may already exist Thank you .

The jury’s judgment Thursday caps a trial centered on lurid claims of sex and financial coverups and exposes Trump to prison time. The verdict represents a stunning courtroom reckoning for Trump, who was indicted in three other felony cases but wasn’t convicted until now.

The Disciple Christian Motorcycle Club is a group of men who are tired of sitting on the spiritual sidelines and are determined to further their walk with God, all while indulging their love for motorcycles and reaching out to the biker community. Changing lanes while driving is a common maneuver that most motorists perform regularly. However, this seemingly simple action can become dangerous if not done with care and caution. One of the most crucial aspects of changing lanes safely is checking blind spots. Blind spots are the areas around a vehicle that are not visible to the driver either in the rearview mirror or the side view mirrors. Failing to check blind spots before changing lanes can lead to accidents, collisions, and even fatalities on the road.

She is being nursed by a mare from a nearby ranch, who lost her foal at about the same time. Holly Shaffer has owned the Royal Star Equestrian Center in Tucson for many years, and when she recognized the pressing need for an equine retirement venue, she started looking for room to expand. After years of searching for just the right spot, she happened upon a property for sale in Sonoita, and she knew in her heart it was meant to be. In April, 2018, she bought the ranch and named it Doc Bar, in honor of the legendary racehorse whose lineage she is now helping to keep alive. Shaffer had spent many weekends at the home, built in 1961 by Art and Harriette Pollard. Their daughter Daisy has been a friend of Shaffer’s since the mid-1980s when they were students at the University of Arizona and bonded over their shared love of equine activities. On the many occasions when Shaffer came to visit Sonoita, the two girls spent hours riding their horses over miles of rolling grasslands. “Daisy and I have been friends ever since,” she said. Daisy Pollard visited Shaffer and her husband David recently and reminisced about her days growing up in Sonoita. Remarking on how built up the area has become, she said: “It was wide open here. You could ride all over and gallop down these long draws and it was so much fun. The only house you could see was back where George Yakobian’s Los Encinos Country Club was, and that was pretty far away.” Shaffer’s passion is to continue the legacy left by Pollard and his well-known racehorse and stallion, Lightning Bar, with a particular focus on Lightning Bar’s son, Doc Bar. Holly Shaffer, left, and Art Pollard’s daughter Daisy stand next to the plaque honoring Pollard’s most famous stud, Lightning Bar, who was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 2008. The plaque has been displayed in the stallion barn at HS Lightning Bar Ranch since the horse’s death in 1960. She works closely with Mike Hogan and Lyle Stephens, who own the former Sonoita Stallion Manor, now known as HS Lightning Bar Ranch, on a nearby parcel which was also part of Art Pollard’s original property. Hogan and Stephens specialize in breeding horses from both these lines. Lightning Bar had a promising record in quarter horse racing, but was injured on the track in his prime, so Pollard put him out to stud. Out of his get, he was leading the nation percentage-wise for AAA stakes mares. Unfortunately, Pollard’s breeding program was decimated by Colitis-X in 1960. Lightning Bar, only 9 years old at the time, went down at the Sonoita Fairgrounds where he had been sequestered for safekeeping. Pollard told the vet to bury him where he fell, to help keep the virus from spreading. His unmarked grave is just outside the first stall at the Sonoita Fairgrounds. Over the next year and a half, Pollard lost his entire brood mare band to the dreaded disease, a disaster that took the heart out of his breeding program. He ended up selling the Sonoita Stallion Manor, but kept the main house and several hundred acres, which he ran as a brood mare operation. ‘A touching tribute’ All five of Shaffer’s mares are from the Doc Bar and Lightning Bar line, and have dropped foals in the past few weeks. “We also have two Lightning Bar yearlings that we bought from Hogan and Stephens, and we hope to breed them someday too,” she said. The mare Sable is a great-great granddaughter of Lightning Bar and a great granddaughter of Doc Bar. David Shaffer assisted at the birth of her colt Merlin. It was his first such experience and he said he found it amazing. Describing the routine when the mares get close to foaling, Shaffer compared herself to a “helicopter mom.” “Every two hours since Feb. 1, I checked the mares. If I think it looks like it might be close, I just stay and watch her. There’s a lot to be said for that because they’re tricky. I go out for the night check and they are watching me, and I think, ‘I know that look,’ and I’ll just sneak around the corner and in about 10 minutes they’re having the baby,” she said. When Daisy Pollard got her first look inside the house in many years, she was delighted to discover that it has remained basically unchanged. Designed by Tom Gist, a disciple of legendary architect Frank Lloyd Wright, the spacious home commands spectacular views from all the upstairs windows. One of most interesting things in the home is an 1860s jockey scale signed by Young’s of England, one of only three known to still be in existence today. The leather seat for the jockey is attached to a beautifully hand-carved oak table and all the fittings and weights are brass. Shaffer first saw the scale and was fascinated by it during her visits during the 1980s. She said she feels honored to now have it in her home. This antique l880s jockey scale, one of only three still in existence, belonged to Harriette Pollard, Art’s wife. After her death a few years ago, it was returned to its former home at Holly Shaffer’s Doc Bar Ranch. At the conclusion of her visit, Daisy took a moment to reflect on all the changes in Sonoita and all the things that have remained the same. “I think what Holly is doing at the Doc Bar Ranch and what Lyle and Mike are accomplishing at the HS Lightning Bar to keep my dad’s legacy and the quarter horse lineage alive is truly amazing,” she said. “I am really touched by it because I think in this society we tend to lose track of history.

Rita Mountains east of Green Valley, in 2017. Hudbay Minerals Inc. announced a ""significant"" new finding of copper mineralization next to its Rosemont Mine site. ""It may prove to be a viable open-pit operation"" with multiple pits on the west slope of the Santa Rita Mountains facing Green Valley and Sahuarita, the company said. The copper found at the new site ""on our private land,"" in a region called Copper World, is of a higher grade and shallower depth than at Rosemont, the company said this week in a news release. “Copper World has the potential to host at least four economic deposits with a relatively low strip ratio and may prove to be a viable open-pit operation that is either separate from or additive to our Rosemont project,” Cashel Meagher, Hudbay’s senior vice president and chief operating officer, said in the written statement. Copper World is on the western slope of the Santa Rita Mountains southeast of Tucson, while Rosemont, site of a long proposed open-pit copper mine, is on the east slope. Benjamin Wilder, director of the Desert Laboratory on Tumamoc Hill, explains why the site is the heartbeat of the Tucson region. The 860-acre ecological reserve is visited by hundreds of people daily who climb the 1.5-mile hill for exercise. Wilder says visitors are walking through a history of plants, ecology and people. Video by: Mamta Popat / Arizona Daily Star, Jan. 14, 2021 The Green Valley News quoted the vice president of Hudbay\'s Arizona Business Unit, Andre Lauzon, as saying: ""It is likely that some parts of Copper World and its operations would be visible from Green Valley and Sahuarita."" ""Based on our current exploration program, there could be multiple open pits within Copper World,"" Lauzon also told the Green Valley News. “This new discovery on our private land in Arizona demonstrates our team’s strong expertise in exploration,” Peter Kukielski, Hudbay’s president and chief executive officer, said in the company\'s news release. “They saw an opportunity to consolidate mineralization in the region and we are excited to continue to explore Copper World while remaining committed to advancing Rosemont through the appeals process.” In 2019, a federal judge overturned the Rosemont Mine\'s operating permit from the U.S. Forest Service, and that case is pending before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2021, Hudbay will continue mineralogical, metallurgical and geophysical studies of the Copper World region, which has a history of mining from 1874 to 1969, the news release said. ""Hudbay has a current exploration budget of approximately $10 million for its Arizona properties in 2021 which is likely to increase with further exploration success. Hudbay will review the results from its 2021 exploration program to determine the next steps for its Copper World properties and the potential synergies with Rosemont,"" it added.
