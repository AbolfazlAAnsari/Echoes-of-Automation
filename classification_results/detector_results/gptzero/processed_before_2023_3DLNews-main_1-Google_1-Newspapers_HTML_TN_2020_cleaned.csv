asking about diabetic recipes. Diabetic cooking has really come a long way over the last few years. Now it is sometimes hard to tell a diabetic dessert from the sugar-filled ones. For as long as I can remember someone in my family had diabetes, and I know how difficult it can be to manage and how much a good recipe is appreciated. I have managed to round up a few good ones this week, and I know that some of you out there are bound to have some that you have tried and like. Please share, because if you are a diabetic, then you know how desperately fellow diabetics seek out a good recipe. Do send them in, and I will be more than happy to include them. Even if you are not diabetic, these recipes offer a lower-calorie alternative to desserts. I have talked to several people this week who have promised to send in some of their favorite recipes, and I am looking forward to getting them and to sharing them with you. One of the reasons I enjoy talking about recipes and cooking with people is that it always leads to such interesting conversations because food and cooking seems to be one of the things that connects people in a way that few other things. This week, make yourself and someone else happier--share something good, even if it is just a smile!

Winds light and variable. Chance of rain 50%. Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 3:22 am The history of our news organization can be traced back to 1916. Since then we have reflected Kingsport and its growth. The Kingsport Times was the first newspaper to serve Kingsport. Like many Kingsporters, it had its beginnings elsewhere. Printed weekly as the ""Progress,"" at first in Johnson City and delivered here, the Kingsport Times was read in 1916 by the residents of an area incorporated the following year as the City of Kingsport. It later started semi-weekly editions and thrived with the prospering city. Daily publication began in 1924. In 1938, a group of stockholders headed by C.P. Edwards Jr. bought the newspaper, and Edwards became president. In 1942, publication of the morning Kingsport News was started. In its earlier days, the publishing firm, located on Market Street, employed a staff of 14 and operated a commercial printing plant as a sideline. But just as Kingsport was growing beyond its corporate limits, the newspaper had outgrown its earlier quarters and expanded to three downtown buildings. Sandusky Newspapers Inc. purchased the Times-News from Edwards in 1962. Since 1970, the newspaper has been produced at the Kingsport Publishing Corporation\'s plant and offices at 701 Lynn Garden Drive, and the Kingsport Times-News has continued to record the Kingsport region\'s progress. The Kingsport Times News began 2020 under a new company name – Six Rivers Media, LLC. Former owner Sandusky Newspapers Inc. sold all properties outside Northeast Tennessee, thus the formation of the new company with a name more reflective of the paper\'s local ownership and presence. Principals in the new company are David Rau, Allen Rau (who lives in the Tri-Cities) and Madeline Rau. Allen serves as CEO. Ron Waite, publisher of the Times News and Johnson City Press, is president of Six Rivers Media. In addition to the Times News and the Press, The Erwin Record, Jonesborough Herald & Tribune, Mountain City Tomahawk, and Six Rivers Digital round out Six Rivers Media.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 2:26 am Jo Bryson practically grew up at the Crossville Fire Hall on Henry St. Her father, Tommy Girdley, was the fire chief and the young Jo ran the show, said Mike Turner, Crossville Fire Chief. “They brought me from the hospital to here,” Jo said. Girdley was Turner’s mentor. “I always say he was the best fire chief,” Turner said. “He had too short of a career here.” Girdley began working for the city fire department July 28, 1967, following military service in Vietnam. He was 36 years old when he died at the scene of a training fire March 24, 1983. “We had a training fire with the county,” said Turner, who was assistant fire chief for the county at the time. “We would go in the house and set the fires and the guys would come in and put them out.” They’d done that several times when Turner said Girdley told him he was tired. They went outside to sit down and Girdley fell backwards. Turner said he began CPR but efforts by the firefighters were unsuccessful. Girdley is the only firefighter who died in the line of duty. The main station of the Crossville Fire Department is named in his memory and he is recognized on the memorial in front of the station. He name is also on the Tennessee Fallen Firefighter Memorial in Bell Buckle and the National Fallen Firefighters Monument on the campus of the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, MD. Bryson gathered recently with her aunts, Judy Raines and Jackie Richards, and daughter, Julie, at the Crossville Fire Hall. Girdley’s wife, Stephanie, passed away several years after him, and his other sister, Cindy Purcell, passed away earlier this month. Turner presented Bryson with a tin plate from the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation made to go on a firefighter’s hat. “I still have his hat,” Bryson said, fighting back the tears in her eyes. She shared a photo of her dad sitting by a row of alarms, and they wondered what he would think of the department today. Girdley had six firefighters on staff. The rest of the crew were volunteers. Today, the Crossville Fire Department has 40 full-time firefighters, Turner said. And the emergency communications have come a long way from when Girdley’s mother, Eileen, lived upstairs and served as the fire dispatcher. She had a phone that would ring at each firefighter’s home, and she would repeat the address of the fire over and over. The Crossville Fire Department has always held a special place for Bryson and her aunts. She was only 11 when her father died, and she said her memories of his funeral weren’t clear until her mother’s death some years later. Then, the fire department had trucks at each stop during the procession. “That meant a lot to me,” she said. Raines said she still caught herself looking for the driver whenever she heard a fire engine siren. “Just for a minute,” she said. After sharing some stories, Turner took the family on a tour. It was Julie’s first time seeing the place that had meant so much to her family. Heather Mullinix is editor of the Crossville Chronicle. She covers schools and education in Cumberland County.

Recently, the viral app TikTok made an internet sensation out of a rock created by a meteorite impact: moldavite. Videos on the app professing the crystal’s intense powers made moldavite into a hot commodity among young audiences, and #moldavite has more than 47.3 million views on TikTok. Linda Bonds, the owner of Stones of Spirit rock shop in Knoxville, Tennessee, wasn’t aware of the TikTok sensation but said that many people have ventured into the shop in search of the crystal. “Right now they’re driving me crazy for moldavite. … They’re all wanting it,” Bonds said. “They don’t know really why they want it, or maybe that video that I didn’t see is the reason why.” The rock is on the more expensive side — a small stone is about $20 and a pendant necklace is around $40 — but that hasn’t stopped customers from buying up Bonds’ stock. The moldavite trend, however, is just one glimpse into a larger American movement toward New Age practices, such as astrology and psychic powers. According to the Pew Research Center, 42% of Americans believe that spiritual energy can be harnessed from physical objects such as crystals. Younger Americans in particular are leaving organized religion in favor of New Age practices, which often differ from Western organized religions in the sense that they are more focused on personal spirituality and often don't involve worshipping a particular god. Although these beliefs have recently become more common in the Western world, crystals have been used in various practices throughout the world since ancient times. Stones of Spirit is packed with a variety of colorful crystals, some of staggering proportions, with origins from Brazil to outer space. The crystals occupy the grand majority of walking space in the small store near West Hills, resting in clusters on the floor and atop layers of shelving. Many customers use crystals for healing or feel their energies, Bonds explained. Particular stones have specific purposes; the multi-colored fluorite, for instance, increases focus and calm, while the dark-purple lepidolite aids depression and anxiety, Bonds said. “Crystals emit energy, and energy for many people is healing, different types of energy. It’s often been said that the healing of the future will be light and sound, and so the crystals, too, are emitting an energy,” Bonds said. “Now this is something that has been known for thousands of years, but it’s not always been talked about. It’s not always been, quote, ‘acceptable.’” Lepidolite (left) and fluorite (right). The presently popular moldavite is known for inducing dizziness. Stones of Spirit employee Di Anna Schlarb said that while she typically does not feel crystals’ energies, she experienced moldavite’s effects. “I can’t touch a stone and feel it, but when I was drawn to moldavite I purchased a pendant and wore it, and driving home that evening I felt drunk,” Schlarb said. “I felt dizzy, and I didn’t know what was wrong with me because I was perfectly fine … I picked the pendant off my skin and immediately those symptoms went away.” Bonds also does not feel crystals’ energies, she said, but cites her close proximity to the rocks as a contributing factor to her good health. “I’m here every day. I am 70. I’m healthy. I’m feisty. They seem to be doing a good job with me,” Bonds said. Behind the glimmering amethyst and quartz stones that line the shop walls is, of course, a more complicated mineral backstory. Assistant professor of petrology and geochemistry at the University of Tennessee Nick Dygert explained how a crystal’s energy emerges from its composition at different phases. “Every mineral has a specific thermodynamic energy associated within it in a system. ... That system has what we call components, so basically chemical constituents or elemental constituents that will arrange themselves in different types of crystals,” Dygert said. However, Dygert explained that humans are not able to feel such energies. “We use thermodynamics to describe these relationships and these energies, but it’s really only something that can be worked out in a lab,” Dygert said. Likewise, Dygert asserted that there is no evidence that crystals possess healing powers, although minerals such as iodine and sodium chloride are essential to human life. Moldavite’s composition in particular has no scientific reason to produce effects of dizziness, Dygert said. “I think that the healing crystal industry is kind of built around the aesthetics of minerals. … There’s this whole industry built around the supposed properties that they have,” Dygert said. “Well, there's no scientific evidence to support most of those properties, but there's nothing wrong with, say, having a beautiful mineral specimen on your desk, like you would have some nice flowers or something like that.” Scientifically-backed or not, the healing crystal industry retains its place in popular culture.

Just tell me it’s not true As we continue looking back into the past of the fall of 2007 in Marshall County sports history, it comes with a very heavy heart, broken actually. When I started this I knew at some point during the journey there was going to be a large amount of sadness, but I didn’t expect it to come this soon. I have never been the kind of sports writer that does things from a far, I like to be in the action, getting to know the coaches, the kids, and the parents. That comes with a price, most notably when one of the young athletes suddenly passes away. My first heartbreak was DeShaun Greer, who was a 2008 graduate of Marshall County High School, a great two-sport athlete for the Tigers, and an even better young man. Greer signed a scholarship to play basketball at Kings University in Bristol and was senior in college when he was tragically murdered in 2014. He was 24 years old. I worked with his mom Kim at Saturn and really liked the entire family, covering DeShaun from middle school thru high school. That was tough. Then in 2017, Cornersville’s Bryan Giles was killed in a household accident at just 15 years old. Giles was a sophomore on the Bulldogs’ football team and his passing left a undeniable mark on his teammates, who went on to carry his number 62 jersey to every game, including back-to-back state tournament runner-up finishes in 2017 and 2018. That was very sad, but very inspirational. Now, I got hit with a ton of bricks this week when I found out that Lewisburg’s Dane Pickle passed away last week from health complications. I knew Dane really good, spending many a ballgame in the dugout with his coveted A-Plus Collision Center team in the Marshall County Babe Ruth League and during the all-star seasons. Dane was funny, played with a tremendous heart, and was a very loving, smart young man. He was 24, my daughter will be 24 in November, and I cannot imagine how devastated his parents Danny and Jill and his sister Taylor are right now. All of humanity is a little less full today. We will miss you Dane and hopefully we can carry on your name and spirit through your kindness to others. Middle school hoops breeding ground for success Middle school basketball got underway in the first week of November in 2007 and CMS coach Joy McMasters finally got the game she wanted that didn’t happen the season before. The Lady Bulldogs were coming off an 18-1 season, but wanted the final measuring stick versus longtime foe Moore County. The two teams were scheduled to play in the final game of the 2006-2007 campaign, but the contest was cancelled. Cornersville had won its season opener a few days prior to hosting the Raiderettes, who didn’t know what hit them as the Lady Dawgs stormed out of the gate behind a stout defensive effort by current Forrest High School assistant coach McKenzie Hopkins and Brittany Crowell. Hopkins stole the ball several times in the first half and tagged-teamed with Crowell and Ashley Warren to build an insurmountable 26-4 halftime lead. Moore County never recovered, scoring just four more points the rest of the game as the Lady Bulldogs cruised to 40-6 win. Second year boys coach Adrian Wilson had the Bulldogs fired up in the second game of the night, maybe a bit too much as they turned the ball over several times in a first half that ended in a 10-10 draw. The Bulldogs also trailed 17-14 at the end of the third period before stepping on the gas behind an 8-2 run to lead by nine points. The Raiders responded with a 6-0 run and had the ball trailing by just three when Brandon Lowe made the hustle play of the night for the Bulldogs when he raced down the floor after a Cornersville miss to block a shot in the paint. Dillon Bean sealed the deal moments later when he nailed both ends of a one-and-one situation from the free throw line and Wilson was ecstatic as he secured his first win ever over Moore County. ""This is a big win for us and the program,"" Wilson said. ""It is the first time I have coached a victory over a Moore County team at any level since I have been here."" The Bulldogs had a balanced scoring attack with Spencer Gault leading the way with six points, Blake Poteat had five, and Brandon Lowe, Nick Lowe, Jacob Gentry, and Bean all tallied four points apiece. The CMS girls rolled on with a 32-17 win over Elkmont in the Cornersville Athletic Booster Club Tournament as Hopkins had a game-high 12 points and current Cornersville High School coach Martha Jane McMasters had six. The Lady Bulldogs beat Columbia Academy 37-22 in the tournament title game to remain undefeated on the season. The inexperienced Bulldogs squad fell 56-21 to CA in the consolation game. Midway through the season, the Lady Bulldogs remained undefeated at 10-0 and hosted Elkton in an early December matchup at home. McMasters threw a 1-3-1 defense at the Lady Elks and went up 10-1 at the end of the first quarter and 16-7 at the half. The CMS defense was too much for Elkton, which scored just three points in the third period while the Lady Dawgs exploded for 19 points in the stanza to put the game away. The Lady Bulldogs won two more games before the Christmas break and came back with a tough task, travelling to Waynesboro on January 4, 2008 for the Rotary Classic. Things looked very good for the squad that had not lost a regular season game for two years as they led 21-12 at the half. The Lady Wildcats began to scratch and claw their way back in to the game, taking a late third quarter lead. There was very little fourth quarter scoring until a Kaitlin Rodgers basket down low gave the Lady Bulldogs a 30-29 lead with a minute and half remaining in the contest. A Taylor Hatchett jumper put Wayne County back in front and after a questionable offensive foul call on Cornersville with 30 seconds left, the Lady Wildcats escaped with the 32-30 win. The Lady Bulldogs went in to a late season tailspin, losing two more games before the start of the James C. Haile Tournament at MTCS in late January. McMasters’ squad broke out in a big way, scoring a season-high 57 points in a big 57-44 win over the Rockvale Lady Rockets. Hopkins went off, scoring a season-high 27 points and Crowell poured in 19 points in the first round win. Next up was the rematch with Wayne County, a game the Lady Bulldogs wanted since losing at Waynesboro earlier in the month. Cornersville fell behind 14-6 early before mounting a comeback that led to a 27-26 lead on a Hopkins bucket with 20 seconds remaining in the third period. The Lady Bulldogs could not sustain their momentum as Wayne County outscored CMS 12-4 in the final period in the season ending loss for Cornersville. LMS teams go deep in postseason Up in the county seat, first-year LMS coach David Lovell had lost the season opener to Meridianville, Alabama before returning home to take on Mt. Pleasant and the hometown Tigers fell behind 7-0 early. A Jesse Kilpatrick steal and feed to Kevin Peterson got things going and with just three seconds remaining in the first half, Peterson stole an inbounds pass under'}]"

A confirmed small-scale tornado landed in Claiborne County Saturday evening, causing minimal damage throughout Tazewell and New Tazewell, according to the National Weather Service. “It was fairly weak and short lived,” said Derrick Eisentrout, forecaster for the National Weather Service – Morristown. Eisentrout said the tornado touched down at 5:50 p.m. and lasted for about three minutes. He said the tornado registered as an F0, which is the lowest designation on how strong a tornado is categorized. The maximum wind speed was 65 miles per hour, he said, and at its peak it was about 30 yards wide. The tornado landed around Pine Street in New Tazewell. Eisentrout said the damage reported included a roof blown off a barn, several uprooted trees, a tree hitting a house and damage to shingles to one home. No injuries were reported in the incident. It was the second time in three months Tazewell has been hit by a tornado. A tornado with 80 mph winds touched down in Tazewell on Oct. 31, according to the NWS. The tornado came as a warm front came across East Tennessee, setting record high temperatures in January for Knoxville and the Tri-Cities. Highs on Saturday were recorded in the upper 70s, well above the normal temperature of 46 degrees for this month. Eisentrout said there was numerous reports of damage across the Lakeway Area on Saturday with power outages and trees blown down. “Most counties had reports of trees down,” he said. He said the coming week will not see storms coming through the area, but it will be active. Eisentrout said there will be a chance of rain for the next few days, starting Monday night. Temperatures will continue to be above normal, he said. “For this time of year, it’s going to be warm and wet,” he said. Recovery begins after storms kill 11 in Midwest, South Icy roads, deadly tornadoes, punishing waves — severe weekend weather has been blamed for 11 deaths and major damage in parts of the Midwest, South and Northeast. Tens of thousands remained without electrical power Sunday as a result of the storms a day earlier. Officials in far-flung locations were assessing the damages while utility crews worked to restore power. The storms toppled trees, ripped off roofs and, in some areas, reduced buildings to rubble. The National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with winds of around 130 mph (210 kph) hit a high school in Kershaw County, South Carolina on Saturday, causing extensive damage. The National Weather Service said it was a tornado packing winds of at least 134 mph (215 kph) that hit Alabama’s Pickens County on Saturday, killing three people. “I could hear everything just coming apart,” Larry Jones, standing amid the rubble in Pickens County, said in a video posted by The Tuscaloosa News. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey praised the state’s first responders in a statement Sunday expressing grief over the deaths. We offer a full suite of print and online subscription services for our customers.

The fighting represents the biggest escalation in decades in a long conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the separatist territory. As Azerbaijani troops pushed farther into Nagorno-Karabakh, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to quickly discuss possible security aid to Armenia. There was no immediate response from the Kremlin. Russia, which has a military base in Armenia and has signed a pact obliging it to protect its ally in case of foreign aggression, faces a delicate balancing act, of trying to also maintain good ties with Azerbaijan and avoid a showdown with Turkey. Pashinian’s request puts Russia in a precarious position: joining the fighting would be fraught with unpredictable consequences and risk an open conflict with Turkey, while refusing to offer protection to its ally Armenia would dent Moscow’s prestige. Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a war there ended in 1994. The latest outburst of hostilities began Sept. 27 and left hundreds – perhaps thousands – dead, marking the worst escalation of fighting since the war’s end. The foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan met Friday in Geneva for a day of talks brokered by Russia, the United States and France, co-chairs of the so-called Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that tries to mediate the decades-long conflict. The talks concluded close to midnight with the two sides agreeing they “will not deliberately target civilian populations or non-military objects in accordance with international humanitarian law.” But shortly after the mutual pledge was announced by the Minsk Group co-chairs, Nagorno-Karabakh authorities accused Azerbaijani forces of firing rockets at a street market and a residential building in the separatist region’s capital, Stepanakert. They said that residential areas in the town of Shushi also came under Azerbaijani shelling. In Stepanakert, shop owners came to their stalls to collect their merchandise and clear the debris after the shelling. “It seems they reached these agreements, but there is no truce at all,” said Karen Markaryan, a shop owner. “People don’t believe these empty words. And what will happen next is only known to God.” Azerbaijan’s defense ministry denied targeting civilian areas, and in turn accused Armenian forces of shelling several regions of Azerbaijan. The rapid failure of the latest attempt to contain the fighting follows the collapse of three successive cease-fires. A U.S.-brokered truce frayed immediately after it took effect Monday, just like two previous cease-fires negotiated by Russia. The warring sides have repeatedly blamed each other for violations. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev has insisted that Azerbaijan has the right to reclaim its territory by force after three decades of fruitless international mediation. He said that Armenia must pledge to withdraw from Nagorno-Karabakh as a condition for a lasting truce. Azerbaijani troops, which have relied on strike drones and long-range rocket systems supplied by Turkey, have reclaimed control of several regions on the fringes of Nagorno-Karabakh and pressed their offensive into the separatist territory from the south. On Thursday, Nagorno-Karabakh’s separatist leader said Azerbaijani troops had advanced to within 5 kilometers (about 3 miles) of the strategically located town of Shushi just south of the region’s capital, Stepanakert, which sits on the main road linking Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia. With Azerbaijani troops moving deeper into Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia’s prime minister made his first public plea for Russia’s assistance since the latest fighting started. While Pashinian stopped short of directly asking Moscow to intervene militarily, he asked Putin to conduct “urgent consultations” on the “type and amount” of assistance that Russia could offer to ensure the security of Armenia. The Armenian leader argued that the fighting is raging increasingly close to the border of Armenia and pointed at alleged attacks on the Armenian territory, according to a statement released by his office. During more than a month of fighting, Armenia and Azerbaijan have repeatedly accused each other of taking the fighting beyond Nagorno-Karabakh. Each side has denied the opposite claims. Retired Lt. Gen. Yevgeny Buzhisnky, the former chief of the Russian Defense Ministry’s international cooperation department, said Moscow would stay away from the conflict. “I exclude the Russian military’s involvement,” Buzhinsky was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. “Azerbaijan is far too important for Russia to wage a war against it and Turkey.” He noted that Azerbaijan has tried to avoid hitting Armenian territory, so “there is no reason for the Russian military intervention.” According to Nagorno-Karabakh officials, 1,166 of their troops and 39 civilians have been killed. Azerbaijani authorities haven’t disclosed their military losses, but say the fighting has killed at least 91 civilians and wounded 400. Putin said last week that, according to Moscow’s information, the actual death toll was significantly higher and nearing 5,000. Armenia accused Azerbaijan of using white phosphorus munitions in fighting over forests close to residential areas. Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan put what he said was a short video of the attack on Twitter, saying it demonstrated Azerbaijan’s “total disrespect of its commitments, continued aggression, devastation of civilian population and use of banned weapons.” Azerbaijan has denied the accusations of using the incendiary weapons.'}]"

transferred to assistant principal position at East Elementary School. by Danny Wade Just when it was reported that a lawsuit against the Humboldt School Board had been settled out of court, another case has come to light. This time, former Humboldt Jr./Sr. High School principal, Jason Newman, has filed a complaint. With the ink barely dry on Dr. Versie Hamlett’s $215,000 settlement, Newman’s attorney, Justin Gilbert, filed the lawsuit in federal court last week with the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee. Gilbert also represented Dr. Hamlett in her case against the school board. Similar to the defendants listed in Dr. Hamlett’s case, the city of Humboldt and the city of Humboldt Board of Education; Newman’s complaint lists the city, board of education, and Lillian Shelton and Leon McNeal, in their individual capacities. Newman’s case stems from his demotion from principal of HJSHS to assistant principal at East Elementary School. In the lawsuit, Newman alleges his transfer was due to him being white and not black. Even though the city of Humboldt has done nothing to be named as a defendant, Humboldt City Schools is part of the city and therefore falls under the city’s liability. “Mr. Newman was hired by Dr. Versie Hamlett, the city’s first black director of schools,” as stated in Newman’s legal complaint as background for the case. “Leon McNeal, a black member of the Humboldt Board of Education, disliked Mr. Newman’s hire because Mr. Newman is white, not black. Mr. McNeal made this known to Dr. Hamlett. Leon McNeal “On March 30, 2020, Dr. Hamlett sounded a loud and public warning of institutional racism inside the city of Humboldt school system. In a federal lawsuit, based on personal conversations with McNeal himself, backed by contemporaneous notes and witness confirmation, she alleged the city and board, through McNeal’s influence, intended to replace white educators with black educators because, according to McNeal, only black educators were qualified to teach black students in Humboldt. With Dr. Hamlett’s departure, this would become the officially sanctioned policy, custom or practice for defendants, carried out by Ms. Lillian Shelton, the new director of schools.” Newman’s contract was renewed on May 22, 2020, prior to Dr. Hamlett’s contract ending and well within her authority. Her settlement was finalized on August 5. Lillian Shelton Days later on August 10, Shelton demoted Newman to assistant principal at East Elementary. Shelton created this position herself, without putting it into the budget to be adopted and approved by the school board, according to the complaint. According to the lawsuit document, Shelton altered Newman’s 2020-21 contract by handwriting “assistant principal at East” on top of the contract. Shelton sent Newman a letter dated August 11 stating he was immediately transferred. “That same day, August 10, 2020, Ms. Carla Brown, a black female, announced to her current employer in adjacent Madison County that she had been chosen to replace Mr. Newman as the high school principal,” according to the lawsuit document. “Her selection was made outside the normal hiring and interviewing process. On August 19 and 21, the board’s hiring committee conducted fake interviews for Mr. Newman’s principal position, the same position already offered to and accepted by Ms. Brown. “The candidates were not informed that the selection had already been made, that Ms. Brown had already resigned her existing position in the neighboring school system, or that their interviews were merely tokens, window dressing. “That ‘interview’ process confirmed what Dr. Hamlett had previously warned, and board members already knew: A job requirement was now being black. As it was explained in that ‘interview’ process, ‘we have too many whites in the system teaching our black kids.’ Being white was a disqualifier under defendants’ policy and practice of removing whites. Therefore, Mr. Newman’s white race caused his demotion and the interference with his contract as principal of Humboldt Jr. and Sr. High.” The lawsuit alleges the city, board of education, McNeal and Shelton face a systemic crisis of their own making. The discrimination is intentional and emanates from the very highest level, its board of education, carried out at the director of schools level. “Because there is no supervision of the board, defendants have proved incapable of reforming themselves and coming into compliance with non-discriminatory employment decisions under the Fourteenth Amendment, and the THRA. Put simply, discrimination is the policy. “For these reasons, Mr. Newman seeks damages for the sting of racial discrimination, including humiliation and embarrassment, along with the loss of stature, prestige, reputation, and earning capacity due to the discrimination,” as stated in the complaint document. “He seeks his attorneys’ fees and costs by statutes. And he seeks reinstatement of the position, any pay losses and benefits.” The lawsuit requests monetary damages sustained by Newman, including but not limited for humiliation and embarrassment, and emotional or reputational harm, and loss of wages or lost earning capacity. The lawsuit also seeks to prohibit the defendants from retaliation and requires racial discrimination training. “It seems this is the day Dr. Hamlett warned us all about, and it did not take long,” said attorney Gilbert. “We must do our best to fight racial discrimination early because the long-term impact cripples schools, communities, businesses and minds.” “I don’t think anyone likes filing lawsuits, but maybe my speaking out can help others,” said principal Newman. “I know Pastor Hodge and others are fighting hard and I can at least lend my voice. They should have listened to Dr. Hamlett I have witnessed the “board meetings”, which are nothing more than a stage for the bullies who don’t even have a grasp on the basics of proper grammar. It is embarrassing to say the very least, and hard to watch. It’s unbelievable really in 2020 that this is allowed to continue. These people are seeking revenge for something. I hope more lawsuits follow and they are put in their place, which should NOT be anywhere near a school. Each one of them is a disgrace to the school system and their race. I, Ronald McNeese, age 72, would like to pass on some information regarding Jason Newman. I met him and his wife, Robin, on a hiking trail right outside of Gatlinburg, TN. I had walked almost 7 mi , was seriously ill, and experiencing dizziness and excellerated heart rate. I was physically unable to make the remaining 3 m to the bottom of the mountain. Jason and his wife Robin were a Godsend because they helped me finish the hike, literally holding me up during those last few miles. I just want to say “Thank you, Jason and Robin for helping me.” You probably saved my life. Just a word to all of the students and faculty of this school: Jason Newman and his wife, Robin, are two of the kindest, most caring people I have ever met in my lifetime. I am sure their character demonstratrates the wonderful educators they must be. May God bless you both, Jason and Robin. You are my heroes. Best regards, Ronald McNeese 97 Eagle Ridge Trail Cleveland, GA 30528'}]"

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 3:28 am Vollie, top photo, and Doll E, above, are two of the new herd of elephants now greeting visitors to downtown Erwin. (Photos contributed by Ryan Taylor Photography) By Richard Rourk The Erwin Elephant Revival has returned to Erwin, and this year the statues are larger and more colorful than ever. “They are huge, even bigger on the stands,” Town of Erwin Communications Specialist Jamie Rice said of the new herd. “You can’t miss them. They certainly have a shock factor.” The Erwin Elephant Revival brings sponsored elephant statutes that have been painted by local artists to downtown Erwin. The statues will be on display until they are auctioned off and proceeds will be given to the sponsor’s choice of charity and the Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee. The first revival partnered with the Elephant Parade and The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee as a way to raise money and awareness of rescued elephants in memory of Mary the elephant. Mary was executed in the Clinchfield Railroad Yard in Erwin on Sept. 13, 1916. The eight new 60-inch statues are on full display starting from town hall all the way to the corner of Main Avenue and Love Street. “This year the statues doubled in size – they went from 30 inches to almost 60 inches,” Rice said. “We have something for everyone.” The herd includes: • “Galaxy” by Valerie Bradley; • “Coat of Many Colors” by Brother’s Keeper and sponsored by Green and Callie Faircloth for Brother’s Keeper; • “Doll E,” by Gail Oliver and sponsored by Unicoi County Imagination Library for the Unicoi County Imagination Library; • “Sweet Pea” by Erin Miller and sponsored by Gordon Moughon, M.D. for the Jerusalem Center for Bible Translators; • “Poppy Lichtenstein” designed by Toby Tipton and Annette Tipton and painted by the Unicoi County High School Art Department; • “Horton Celebrates Dr. Seuss” by Joel Hammitt and sponsored by McDonald’s of Erwin for the Southern Appalachian Ronald McDonald House Charities, Inc.; • “Iris” by John Stewart; • “Vollie” by Myriah Woodby. According to Town of Erwin Mayor Doris Hensley, the elephants are a huge hit with both locals and tourists. “We get calls all the time about the elephants and it’s good to see them out again,” Hensley said. Rice acknowledged that COVID-19 caused a delay in unleashing the herd, which usually debuts during the Erwin Great Outdoors Festival, which was canceled in May due to COVID-19. “Like everything in 2020, our elephant herd debut was delayed due to COVID-19,” Rice said. “Our normal display schedule is May until mid-October. The outdoor festival was canceled for COVID and the schools normally clear coat them for us which were closed. Luckily, the very generous Mr. (John) Lewis of the auto body class at the vocational school worked with us and was still able to get them clear coated this year, it just took a little longer than expected. We will try and keep these on display through November, weather permitting.” According to Rice, there is still a chance for anyone or any organization that would like to sponsor an elephant statue. “We have four sponsors this year, so four other sponsors are needed,” Rice said. “Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, RISE will not hold a live public auction this year. We will be collecting bids all summer long through Dec. 1. The highest bidder may take possession of the statue at that time – just in time for Christmas.” Rice is thankful for all who make the Erwin Elephant Revival a reality. “As evident from the quality of artwork, these volunteer artists have donated so much creative energy to this process, including Mr. John Lewis of the CTE, and the sponsors who believe in the power of public art,” Rice said. Proceeds will go to the sponsor’s beneficiary and the Elephant Sanctuary. Bidding begins at $1,500. For more information, call 220-7624 or visit erwintn.org.

Winds WSW at 5 to 10 mph. Chance of rain 40%.. Generally fair. Low 64F. Winds light and variable. Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 2:35 am The Tennessee Arts Commission and the Wilson County Convention and Visitors Bureau honored veterans on Wednesday through the latest mural in the Paint WilCo initiative. Local artist Brad VanHook designed the piece, which stands across from the Wilson County Veterans Museum and Plaza. “Today, we’re here to honor the veterans,” he said. “It was a privilege and honor to be a part of it, I’m just the hand behind the brush. But there’s one particular veteran in my life that I want to honor today. This man has been in my life for 30 years, and I’ve had the privilege of calling him my second dad … retired Sgt. Major Thomas Lee Berry.” Berry is one of more than 10,000 veterans in the county, according to Wilson County Veterans Service Office Director ZaBrina Seay. Many of them attended the unveiling, including Lebanon Mayor Bernie Ash. “We memorialize those people that we will love and want to remember,” Ash, who served in the U.S. Air Force during the Vietnam War, said. “I believe that a basic desire most of us have is to be remembered, especially by those we love. That’s why we have so many graveyards and so many monuments, because we don’t want to give up the memory of those people that have done so much for us.” Ash said that the mural’s location is especially significant because it sits near the memorial plaque on the Veterans Plaza. Hundreds of soldiers who were killed in military conflicts are listed there, and the artwork faces their names. Lisa and Darryl Noble of Cedar City RV own the building used for the mural, and they envisioned it serving that purpose. “This project came about a few months ago at a Historic Lebanon board meeting,” Lisa Noble said. “Through that, we immediately just started kind of carrying on a conversation about it, and I thought, ‘Wow, we have this amazing blank canvas right across the street from the museum. What a wonderful place to do this.’ ” County officials also see the mural and the Paint WilCo initiative as a way to further develop the area. Ten murals are expected over the course of the effort, and the next one in the works is titled “Messages of Hope.” “The murals project was the result of Wilson County’s ThreeStar certification with the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development,” Wilson County Mayor’s Office Project Administrator Susan Shaw said. “In 2019, the program was revised … we brought together a group of 30 county leaders to determine the key goals that would drive community prosperity for positive impact. The three most realistic and achievable goals were agreed to be workforce development, beautification and walkability.” Murals in particular were identified during that discussion as a project to benefit the county, and Wilson County Director of Tourism Jason Johnson is among those heading it up. “With the guidance and help of the Wilson County Murals Committee, we’ve been able to facilitate some amazing artwork in this county,” he said. “I think this mural to honor our veterans is definitely one we all agreed must get done, and with the murals committee we were able to find the perfect location, the perfect artist and the continued guidance that we needed.” Seay said the mural’s location combines with the Wilson County Veterans Museum and Plaza to create a hotspot for visitors and veterans alike. “This Veterans Museum is probably the best I’ve seen thus far,” she said. “And I appreciate the CVB and Lisa and everyone else for their donations and bringing attention to it. This is probably one of the best-kept secrets we have here in Wilson County … what a testament, and what a great day it is to be a veteran in Wilson County.” Log In Keep it Clean.

Some were funny, he says, and there were lots about the good old days — not uncommon among stories from grandparents. But one story in particular has stuck with Horton like none of the others. Back in 1918, when the H1N1 influenza strain commonly known as the Spanish flu was ravaging communities around the world, Horton’s grandfather was 8 years old and living in West Virginia. When the flu hit, his family missed the initial wave — they thought they’d made it out OK. But over the next few weeks, his dad and six of his siblings fell ill, and there was nothing that could be done for them — all seven ultimately died. That was in February 1919, when the ground was still frozen from winter. There was no way they’d be getting a proper burial anytime soon. At 8 years old, now the man of the house, the boy watched as his father and siblings were carried into town, one by one, on the back of a mule. They sat, stacked together in boxcars, until the ground thawed out enough to dig graves. When Horton was 15, his grandfather passed away — but not before he told a few more stories. Horton says one of the most important things he learned from his grandfather was to be prepared. For what? He wasn’t sure exactly. Perhaps another pandemic. Or it could be a massive natural disaster, a cyber attack or a nuclear war, according to modern-day preppers, as they’re known. But whatever this global event might be, Horton would be ready. His family wouldn’t be among those running out of supplies, or standing in long lines for groceries, or waiting for their mule ride into town. Horton, who lives less than a half-hour outside Bristol, Tenn., is one of many people across the country who classify themselves as preppers, ready at any moment for disaster. Popularized by television shows like Doomsday Preppers that often depict their subjects as a particular brand of paranoid, these folks have emergency preparedness down to a science. “My family, at least up until my grandparents’ generation, were fairly self-sufficient people,” says Horton. “They would have been completely appalled at the government saving them from anything. They were not anti-government, but they felt their safety and security was their own responsibility. People had to take care of themselves and have food put back for lean years. I think there are a lot of people who still hold that belief to be valuable.” Over the past three months, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has continued to climb nationwide and grocery stores have struggled to keep up with demand. As shoppers hope to find the proverbial pot of gold that is a 24-pack of Angel Soft, many preppers have been kicking back on their stock of supplies. “A generation back, our elders all had full larders, pantries, cellars and basements,” says Lisa Akers, who has been prepping for the past 10 years. “They put food up in jars, or dried it or cured it to get through the winter. We all need to be ready for situations like this. You can live without a lot of things, but food and medication — and toilet paper, it seems — are not something we can do without.” My dad, Darryl Basham, has been prepping in one form or another for most of his life. I asked him for a little input for this story. He told me that a co-worker, who is not into prepping, asked him in the middle of the grocery-buying panic, “Well, what does a prepper rush out to buy in times like this?” My dad’s response was simple: “Not a damn thing.” Darryl Basham For my dad, prepping isn’t a new fad made popular by the partially staged reality shows on Discovery Channel. It’s what he’s always done, and what his parents and grandparents did before him. “We didn’t just decide one day that we are going to start doing this and become preppers,” he says. “These are things we’ve done for our entire lives. As a kid, my dad would buy a truckload of corn every summer, and my brothers and I were forced to help. We sat all day in the yard under shade trees shucking corn to put up for when we’d need it.” My mom says the same. Her grandmother’s house — they called her Mamaw — became headquarters in the summer for canning and preserving food. Aunts, uncles and cousins would sit in the garage shucking corn while Mamaw and a few others would be inside, stirring the pots on the stove and listening for the jars to pop. My mom always said when she got older, she would never touch a pressure cooker again. She’d buy her veggies from the store. Dad agreed. But for a young couple just starting out with two growing kids to feed, time-honored alternatives like canning just make sense. Mom knows best, so that must mean Mamaw knows even better, right? “I swore that I would never do a garden when I got out on my own, but when we got married, our first purchase was a freezer to put up food,” says my dad. “One of the first things we did when we bought our house was put out a big garden. We didn’t become preppers. We’ve always lived this way. Now there’s just a word for it.” Unlike survivalists, who typically learn to live off the land, preppers prepare to live off of what they’ve put up — but that goes beyond canned veggies and Spam. Preppers are conscious of what it would take to ensure the financial, physical and emotional well-being of their families during a time of struggle. For my dad, it means thinking far beyond stocking up on rice, beans and canned goods. It means putting up things to keep him busy, like playing cards and his collection of Louis L’Amour westerns. It also means putting back a little bit of liquor, which in “hard times” can be used for sanitizing and bartering — and, of course, drinking. My dad’s pick? Tequila. “If a major world event happens, I’d be able to trade a small bottle of whiskey for items well above the value of the booze itself,” he says. “Then, I’ve got my garden, which I love. That’s always an easy way to pass the time.” At the house I grew up in, my dad has apple, peach and plum trees, as well as blueberry, raspberry and blackberry plants, planted throughout the 1-acre backyard. He says all of these plants will produce for years to come, and things like the garlic and celery plants will come back every year. “There’s a rosemary bush down at the end of the house that’s probably 4 feet tall and 5 feet wide,” he says. “If it came right down to it, I’ve got all the seeds put up to do a huge garden. The whole backyard could become a garden, and there is plenty of propane for the grill so we could put a pot on the burner to can our veggies. Consider a grid-down situation: At first, it’d be about harvesting deer, turkey and other small game, but once everybody starts doing that, it won’t be long until we’re on a diet of just veggies and whatever meats we have preserved, much like our grandparents did.” Lijun Song is an associate professor with Vanderbilt University’s Department of Sociology. She says such lessons from grandparents have a significant impact on how someone might respond to potential threats. Song says it’s those lessons that often inform who we are, how we think and what we do. Song was living in China in 2002 when the severe acute respiratory syndrome (better known as SARS) broke out in the Guangdong province. She says that experience — as well as warnings from her parents, who lived through three years of famine in China — has made her extra cautious as of late. “These people’s attitudes and behaviors are significantly influenced by their parents’ and grandparents’ living experience and attitudes,” says Song. “Parents and grandparents tend to be strong social contacts for them, meaning that these people know their parents and grandparents well and have closer relationships with them. They have been actively interacting with their parents and grandparents since they were born, and because of that, they are more likely to trust them and listen to the experience, stories and warnings about risks and hard times.” Contrary to popular belief, not all preppers have bunkers, and not all of them hope for or expect the government to collapse, Horton says. The lifestyle of a prepper is ultimately about self-reliance and personal responsibility. For most, readiness has nothing to do with extremes and everything to do with common sense and looking to the future. “People will pay into a 401K for years and years so they'}]"

Now, with the Carousel s… To the Editor: To the Editor: Staff Writer Coronavirus fatigue was on full display Saturday morning, just 10 hours after the mask mandate returned to Williamson County. Despite the continual drizzle and occasional short shower, an estimated more than 250 people from all over the county braved the elements to make their voices heard in protest to the mandate, which likely will continue until Dec. 31. The event drew every age, from the very young to very senior citizens, and included students, educators, medical professionals and business owners. They heard from lawyers schooled in the Constitution, educators suspended for not wearing a mask, a student who had to fight due to medical reasons for an exemption to wearing a mask in school, another who was sent home from school for not wearing a mask and business owners affected by the mandates. They spoke out about their experiences in dealing with the shutdown, the mask mandate and personal liberty. The rally was organized by Gary Humble with Tennessee Stands, “a nonprofit social advocacy organization that serves to protect the individual liberties of all Tennesseans as stated in the Tennessee State Constitution and given to us by God,” as a means to hold elected officials’ feet to the fire regarding their constitutional duties and let them know many of their constituents are done with mandates. “Be wary,” said Humble. “Whatever government takes away, it never gives back, and no government has the authority to issue a mandate to wear masks.” He equated the mask mandate to HIV and a mandate for people to wear blue nitro gloves because they may or may not have the virus. Those attending the rally said the line has been drawn. It’s not about masks, it’s about liberty and constitutional rights. “It’s about an overreaching government that strives to operate with authority it doesn’t have,” Humble said. “We are done with unconstitutional, unlawful mandates. If you want to wear a mask, if you want to stay home, if you want to place limitations on your own business, that’s your prerogative, but the idea that the government can forcibly issue these mandates with no legislative action but by executive rule of a governor, a mayor or a health board that has no law-making authority … we are giving away liberty we will not get back.” According to Humble and other speakers, the ultimate issue is with the legislature for relinquishing its law-making duties to the governor who delegated authority he does not have to county mayors. “[The governor’s] endless strings of executive orders demonstrate a fundamental ignorance of the founding principles of the American order — that our rights come from God,” said Kevin Kookogey, a Tennessee Stands board member and attorney specializing in entertainment business, which has been hardest hit by continued closures. He went on to quote Thomas Jefferson’s 1801 inaugural address. “With all these blessings, what more is necessary to make us a happy and prosperous people? Still one more thing: a wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another but shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned,” Kookogey said. “We are a government of the people, for the people and by the people.” Robbie Starbuck, a conservative activist, spoke about the tyranny that slowly hit the people of Cuba in the 1950s. No one spoke up, he said, they just went along and one day realized they lost all their freedoms. “This is still America, and in America, we don’t forcibly put masks on our children, on our wives, on our husbands, our brothers and our sisters. ... Forcibly masking people is an intrusion on God given rights and the rights built into the Constitution. It won’t stop. As of this week, [Dr.] Anthony Fauci is now demanding a mask mandate for all of America. Be wary — this is how it starts.” Tennessee Stands recently filed a lawsuit against Gov. Bill Lee over the alleged unconstitutional actions of delegating authority to county mayors. According to Article 7, section 1 of the Tennessee Constitution, the duties of the county executive are prescribed by the General Assembly, “not the governor,” Humble said. The mandates, Humble added, “are unconstitutional.” In addition, Humble said Tennessee Stands isn’t convinced the paper and cloth masks most people wear make a difference, citing recent results of a controlled research study in July by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing virtually no difference in the percentage of people who tested negative who wore a mask almost always or always and those who almost never or never wore a mask. Rulings on lawsuits regarding mandates across the country are being made. A U.S. District Court judge ruled Pennsylvania’s mandates were unconstitutional for the First and 14th Amendments. The judge opined, “Good intentions toward a laudable end are not alone enough to uphold government action against a constitutional challenge. Indeed, great threats to our system of constitutional liberties may arise when the ends are laudable and intent is good especially in a time of emergency. In an emergency, even a vigilant public may let down its guard over its constitutional liberties only to find that liberties once relinquished are hard to recoup and restrictions expedient in times of an emergency may persist long after the danger has passed.” Before the rally ended, Humble announced a forthcoming lawsuit against Williamson County Mayor Rogers Anderson and a request for his removal because “he had no authority to mandate.” “We’ve had enough,” Humble said. “No more. Not in America. Not in Tennessee.” Carole Robinson may be contacted at crobinson@williamsonherald.com Staff Writer Those poor guys never had a chance.

Two Tennessee teachers resigned in 2019 after asking students to imagine themselves as slaveholders and “create a list of expectations for your family’s slaves.” Another school district in the state faced a lawsuit after a student-teacher used a supposed 1712 speech on “how to make a slave” in class. Teachers also face time pressures and testing demands that can make it difficult to cover any topic in-depth. “The No. 1 complaint I hear from students who become teachers is, ‘We don’t have the time to do it,” said Toby Daspit, a University of Louisiana at Lafayette professor. “The question teachers have to ask is, ‘What knowledge is of most worth? You can’t cover everything.” But an understanding of this history can be critical. Daniel Kiel, an attorney and filmmaker who produced a documentary about the integration of Memphis Public Schools, said learning the history was life-changing for him, and helps connect present struggles with past ones. ""When you unpack these topics (like segregated schools or housing) and recognize that it\'s not by accident, but that there is a reason that things are the way they are, then there\'s a need to question,"" Kiel said. ""Even middle-schoolers and high-schoolers respond to things they can connect to. ...They\'ll start to ask, \'Why does my neighborhood look the way things are versus another neighborhood?\'"" Contributing: Bonnie Bolden of the Monroe (La.)

Connect RIGHT NOWOneida, TN » 60°F Current Events Severe Weather | SCSD Pay Raise | Guide to Government ❄️ Winter Storm Warning: 7 p.m. Sunday-7 a.m. Tuesday It started with a casual conversation between Children’s Center of the Cumberlands Executive Director Kellie Walker and a TN Dept. of Children’s Services investigator. And, within just days, an impressive charitable organization was born to help clothe Scott County’s abused and neglected children who are removed from their home. The name of the effort is Kip’s Kloset — named in memory of Kip McCoy Walker, Dustin and Kellie Walker’s newborn son who passed away on his birthday in May. Less than 10 weeks later, most would forgive Walker — who, along with her husband, owns The Beautique Tanning & Essentials in addition to serving as the Children’s Center’s executive director — if she were still mourning the tragic loss of her son. After all, it’s only been a couple of weeks since she returned to work after taking some time off to emotionally heal. “The week I went back was supposed to be the week that my maternity leave actually started,” Walker said recently. “Going back for me was hard because it was taking another step toward my new ‘normal.’ A life continued without a son that we had planned our lives around for the past year.” But Walker isn’t one to be still very long, even in a trying time. As Jonathan Orick of Engineered Fitness said last week, “If you’re blessed enough to know Kellie Walker, you know one of the kindest people in our community.” So, it probably should have been no surprise when Walker’s casual conversation with a DCS case worker about how to help the less fortunate children of Scott County quickly turned into an effort to put words into action. By July 30, Walker had made a Facebook post to appeal to her friends and neighbors to help. And the community responded in a big way. During that conversation that jump-started the effort, the DCS investigator mentioned that kids who are being taken into custody by the state need clothes — and there aren’t enough clothes to meet the need. “We see first-hand, babies come out of homes in only diapers and often times when kids are removed they have on filthy clothes, usually too small or too big, and they have limited clothes to take into their new home placement,” Walker said. Up until this point, the Children’s Center has given Walmart gift cards to DCS so that case workers can purchase kids new clothes or whatever they need when they’re removed from an abusive or neglectful home. But coronavirus has changed things. Walmart is no longer open 24 hours; the retail store closes at 10 p.m. each night. “When kids are removed in the middle of the night, they are at a loss,” Walker said. “She spoke about how nice it would be to just be able to grab stuff after they are showered at the center.” From there, Walker’s wheels began to turn. Before long, she’d come up with a plan to renovate a vacant office into a clothing closet to help meet the need. She enlisted her husband to help her, and a plan came together. “With COVID, we haven’t taken clothing donations that are used, so I knew it would have to be stocked with new items,” Walker said. “Plus, just being honest, I wanted the clothes to be new for the kids. Most have never had one article of clothing that was new with tags still on it and I felt like that in itself would be a gift and something special for them.” But there’s another issue that threatened to compound things: due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Children’s Center’s fundraising efforts and donations have been down significantly. The child advocacy center’s most visible fundraiser, the annual Nancy Swain Watters Memorial Walk in the spring, was canceled due to the pandemic. “I had no clue how I was going to stock this closet,” Walker said. “But I knew if we built it, the donations would come.” That’s where her husband, Dustin, came in. And on the way home from picking up building materials for the renovation project, the Walkers came up with an idea: a giveaway, where every person who donates clothing is entered into a drawing for a prize. Walker made the plea for prizes, and within just minutes, “I had so many friends with businesses in our community who had donated to the gift basket to give away,” she said. “So much so that we have enough now for more than one awesome giveaway.” The donations began to come in as soon as Walker made a post on her Facebook page. And then it just kept getting better. During their weekly Facebook Live episode Saturday evening, sisters Gabby and Milly Hill of Soul Sisters mentioned the Children’s Center closet and encouraged those who could give to do so. They also urged those who wanted to donate but didn’t want to shop to give a monetary donation that would help fill the gaps. They started the effort by donating a $100 gift card of their own for the prize drawing. “Long story short, at the end of that live show where she was on there to sell her shop’s items, they had over $7,000 that people had committed to help us fill the closet with clothes and to help us keep it stocked,” Walker said. The Hill sisters will invoice their customers for their donation when they invoice them for items that were purchased from Soul Sisters. “It was truly an emotional thing to be a part of, and God’s grace was shining bright through that Live show,” Walker said. It was also during that Soul Sisters Facebook Live show that Walker announced the clothes closet would be named in memory of her son. This is the challenge: before August 17, donate an article of clothing that is new with tags and your name will be entered to win a gift. For every article of clothing that is donated, your name goes in the pot another time. The more clothes you buy, the better chance you have of winning a gift basket. Sizes 0-3 months all the way through XXL adult are needed — both boys and girls clothes, along with pajamas, socks and underwear. Those who donate will have a chance to win a $300 gift card to Wilderness of the Smokies, a $100 gift card to The Skin Care Clinic, a $50 gift card from Scott County Florest, a large pizza from Baby J’s Pizza, a 4-pack of passes and more from Brimstone Recreation, a $50 Visa gift card from STAND, two months free tanning and a lotion from The Beautique, a $50 gift card from Angel Blessings Boutique, a $100 off coupon to Arch Angels Microblading, a $100 gift card from Soul Sisters, a $30 gift certificate from RaeZack’s, a $25 gift certificate from Perfecting Beauty, a $100 gift certificate from Engineered Fitness, a $25 gift certificate from The Vinyl Boutique, a $50 Texas Roadhouse giftcard from Chitwood Mountain Farms, a $25 gift certificate from Mike’s Station, a $30 gift certificate from C&C Customized Vinyl, and a $30 gift certificate from Bee Clever Cookies. The drawing will take place on Monday, August 17. Walker said she was overwhelmed by the response. “So many people have showed up in such a huge way,” she said. It started with Trent Coffey, executive director of STAND. “I asked him for a donation of a gift card and he opened his wallet personally, as well as STAND’s,” she said. “Scott County Florist (James and Penny Paul) was the same way.

Now, with the Carousel s… To the Editor: To the Editor: Staff Writer Larry Reid received a Purple Heart for injuries he received on Aug. 18, 1968, while serving in Vietnam. Recently, while creating a shadowbox to showcase some of his military memorabilia, including his Purple Heart, Reid discovered that the certificate that was presented along with the medal and awarding orders was missing. Reid took a long, hard walk through his life in an effort to remember the last time he saw it. And then the light went on. He thinks it was 1988. “I was living at 1351 Columbia Ave. in Franklin,” he said. “I was going through a divorce. I had PTSD issues. That move was brutal, and I didn’t check to see if I had everything.” Reid, who was attached to the 9th Infantry, recalled that hot July day when he packed his belongings into a 1987 Thunderbird and left his wife, his children and Franklin. Years later, after finally getting the help he needed, Reid came to terms with the memories that haunted him and was able to settle his life. When he retired in 2011 to help his wife after a brain aneurism began a slow debilitating process for her, he decided to create the shadowbox. That was when he discovered the certificate was missing. Reid put on his thinking cap and tried to remember the last time he saw the certificate. “I thought it might be in the basement (of the Columbia Avenue house).” As he remembered, in 1988 it wasn’t a full basement. Half the area was concrete and the rest was a “root cellar type floor.” According to Reid, the certificate would have been in a box on a table or desk in the basement. “I think there were some kind of restaurant tables or a desk belonging to the property,” he added. “I can’t remember an attic.” Although Reid can apply to the Army to get a new certificate, he said that having the original would be wonderful. “The one I had was signed by Maj. Gen. Julian J. Ewell (now deceased),” he said. “He was our commanding officer. His great-grandfather was a cavalry officer in the Civil War.” For Reid, a Nashville native, that information created a connection between the commanding officer and the soldier. After Reid graduated from Overton High School, he was “having fun” as a musician with a Christian rock band in Nashville and making custom guitars with a friend. The fun ended when he was drafted at the age of 20. Reid did his basic training at Fort Campbell and was sent to Fort Lewis in Washington for advanced infantry training. “I just wanted to do good and go home,” he said. His next assignment was Vietnam, with Company E, 4/47th Battalion, 2nd Brigade, 9th Infantry Division. At the time, the 9th Infantry served with the Navy’s Mobile Riverine Force, known as the Brown Water Navy. The name is derived from its area of operation, the rivers and canals of the Mekong Delta. “I landed in Vietnam on April 3, 1968, the day before Martin Luther King (Jr.) was murdered,” he said. “I saw Kenny (a friend) crying and I wanted to know more about this Dr. King. I learned there was more to him than what I’d been told.” Reid, like so many soldiers at the time, was brought in to replace soldiers injured or killed during the first phase of the Tet Offensive, which began on Jan. 30, 1968. While awaiting orders, Reid met Jim Fous, an Army Ranger. “I thought since he was a Ranger, I should stick with him,” Reid said. The first night they went out on patrol together, Fous was killed. Within a couple weeks, Reid had become the platoon radio telephone operator, the guy who called in artillery and air strikes. “While we were walking (on a patrol), I heard about an air strike,” Reid said. Before an air strike, the target is marked by yellow smoke. Suddenly the platoon was surrounded by smoke. It was in the target area. “We ran just when the bombs started coming down,” he said. Reid said that the skirmishes and battles they encountered took their toll. “By August, we (3rd platoon) had 12 of the 26 we started with,” Reid said. “We called ourselves ‘The Dirty Dozen.’” On Aug. 18, 1968, Reid and his fellow soldiers were on an armored troop carrier landing craft heading down the Hai Muoi canal and preparing to go ashore to perform sweeps at designated areas. They were on the boat when they “were hit hard.” Reid was injured by shrapnel after coming under artillery fire. “I was hit by small pieces of hot lead and probably pieces of the boat I was in,” he said. “I still have some beaded metal under my skin.” Although he doesn’t remember much of that day, Reid said that at the time, he “pretty much came to grips with the fact I’m not going home,” and took care of others on the boat. By the end of the day, only four soldiers in the 3rd platoon were still fighting. Reid was one of them. “Only a couple of us were killed, but most were wounded badly and chopped out,” he said. The first medivac was shot down. I remember seeing that.” Reid was patched up and what was left of the 3rd platoon was attached to the 2nd platoon to finish the mission. The story is one of many chronicled in “Muddy Jungle Rivers,” a book written by Wendall Affield, the sailor driving the carrier. In October 1968, a staff officer asked Reid if he could type. “I took typing at Overton High School — the only boy — because all the girls were taking typing,” Reid said. That class got him sent to the tactical operations center in Ben Tre for the remainder of his tour of duty. “I don’t have an explanation for how I survived,” Reid said. “I had plenty of opportunities to come home in a box.” Staff Writer Log In Keep it Clean.
