(Matthew Keeler/Stars and Stripes) A stream of vehicles wait to enter the Dongchang-ri gate at Camp Humphreys, South Korea, Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2020, as soldiers screen visitors for the new coronavirus. (Matthew Keeler/Stars and Stripes) SEOUL, South Korea — An American soldier tested positive for the new coronavirus, the military said Wednesday as it tightened restrictions aimed at keeping the pneumonia-like illness off base. The 23-year-old soldier, stationed at Camp Carroll, is the first U.S. service member infected with COVID-19, which has spread globally with alarming alacrity since it first appeared in China in December. The widow of a military retiree who had base access also was reported to be infected earlier this week in the nearby city of Daegu, which is at the epicenter of the recent outbreak. The two cases underscored the growing threat that has forced the military to increasingly focus attention and resources on fighting the virus. “We are in this for the long haul, and it’s going to take everyone’s patience and cooperation,” Col. Michael Tremblay, the garrison commander at Camp Humphreys, said amid frustration over long delays at access gates. Several service members and others were quarantined at Humphreys and the garrison in Daegu as a protective measure. South Korea has the largest number of confirmed cases outside China, with the number soaring past 1,200 and 12 deaths reported as of Wednesday, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Twenty South Korean service members also have been infected, the defense ministry said. Most of the infections have been in the southeastern part of the country as the outbreak is believed to have begun with an infected woman who attended services at a church run by a secretive religious movement. The KCDC said 24 novel coronavirus patients had fully recovered and been released. The American soldier who was infected was transferred in an ambulance to an isolation unit on Camp Humphreys, the main U.S. base on the divided peninsula. “We are doing a very thorough trace history on this service member,” said Col. Edward Ballanco, the Army garrison commander for the affected area. “We’re going to know everywhere this service member and his family has been over the last week.” Meanwhile, long lines formed at access gates at other bases across the nation after USFK raised the threat level to high, began health screening measures and reduced the number of entry points. Morning commuters waited as long as five hours Wednesday at the Camp Humphreys gates, where soldiers wearing gloves and filtering face masks asked drivers about possible exposure to the virus and took temperatures. Some gates that had been closed will be reopened on a limited basis on Thursday to facilitate traffic, Tremblay said in an update on Facebook. Yongsan Garrison in Seoul also limited access to installations in the capital and near the border with North Korea to “mission-required visitors.” The infected soldier is stationed at Camp Carroll, which is in the southeastern part of the country. The infected soldier also visited Camp Walker in Daegu. Ballanco urged the 9,000-strong military community in Daegu and surrounding areas to remain calm. “There’s no reason to panic. We have the means to fight back against this virus and we’re going to use those means,” he said. The garrison already had restricted access and implemented health screening measures at the gates. On Wednesday, base restaurants began serving food as take-out only, bowling alleys and theaters were closed and the nine-hole golf course was shuttered to discourage unnecessary visitors, Ballanco said. Service members also have been ordered to avoid restaurants and other nonessential travel off their installations peninsula-wide, while family members and civilian employees were highly encouraged to do the same. Some 28,500 American troops are stationed in South Korea, which remains technically at war with the North after their 1950-53 conflict ended in an armistice instead of a peace treaty. North Korea has not reported any confirmed cases, but the secretive nature of the regime makes that difficult to confirm. “USFK is implementing all appropriate control measures to help control the spread of COVID-19 and remains at risk level ‘high’ for USFK peninsula-wide as a prudent measure to protect the force,” the command said in a press release. USFK commander Gen. Robert Abrams and South Korean Gen. Park Han-ki, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, may scale back command post exercises scheduled next week, due to concerns over COVID-19, Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters earlier this week in Washington. Officials stressed the best way to prevent the virus is to practice good hygiene, wash hands with soap and water thoroughly and frequently or use hand sanitizer and avoid shaking hands, large gatherings and other unnecessary contact. gamel.kim@stripes.com Twitter: @kimgamel chang.kyong@stripes.com Sign up to receive a daily email of today's top military news stories from Stars and Stripes and top news outlets from around the world.

than 3 years ago On the morning after Election Day, Greg and Jenny Brethen, loyal viewers of Fox News who watched the channel religiously for almost 20 years, turned on their go-to morning show, “Fox & Friends,” and thought they saw something fishy. The Tennessee couple sensed that their favorite Fox personalities, weekday co-host Brian Kilmeade and weekend co-host Pete Hegseth, who appeared in a segment, were holding back. “Like they were both instructed to keep their mouth shut, that’s how I felt,” Jenny said. The previous evening, the nonpartisan Fox News Decision Desk was the first network prognosticator to call the state of Arizona for Joe Biden, a call that to some was early — but ultimately held up. On Nov. 7, the network called the election for the former vice president, although Hegseth won’t call him the president-elect and Kilmeade has qualified his presidency with an uncertain “if.” Whatever it was, Greg said the couple “felt duped.” At that moment, they decided to stop watching Fox News forever and look for an alternative. After hearing about the conservative upstart Newsmax during a pro-Trump rally, they chose to give the channel a shot. “We’re permanently switched,” Jenny, 46, said in a recent phone interview. “We’re not going back. Once you do something like that, you’re done in our book.” Jenny, who said she now watches Newsmax from the time she gets up to the time she goes to bed, was among the 15 longtime Fox News loyalists who spoke with The Post in depth about why they have flipped the channel to Newsmax in recent weeks and months. Their stories lend texture to what has been a quantifiable shift in the number of people who watch Newsmax, a much-smaller, would-be competitor network that has seen a dramatic uptick in viewers in the weeks since the election by capitalizing on conservative frustration with Fox, and, some say, a desire from President Trump’s fans to keep alive the flailing narrative that he will ultimately serve a second term, despite Biden’s coming inauguration. Although Trump has criticized Fox’s news division and encouraged his followers to flip the channel to Newsmax or One America News, the majority of those interviewed, all Trump supporters, said they learned of Newsmax from word-of-mouth or from online research. Newsmax issues sweeping ‘clarification’ debunking its own coverage of election misinformation “I jumped on it and haven’t looked back,” said 40-year-old technical engineer Jeremy Arant, who was introduced to Newsmax by his friends after the election. Newsmax stunned industry observers when host Greg Kelly’s 7 p.m. show beat Fox’s 7 p.m. show, hosted by anchor Martha MacCallum, among viewers between the age of 25 and 54 on Dec. 7 — though it has not repeated the feat. Still, comparing the month before the election and a post-election period, between Nov. 9 and Dec. 17, Kelly’s show has experienced a 486 percent increase in viewership (up an average of 667,000 viewers), while McCallum’s show has declined by 44 percent, or down an average of about 1.4 million total viewers, according to Nielsen data. McCallum’s “The Story” program still has a big lead over “Greg Kelly Reports,” however. Comparing Newsmax’s weekday performance between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. to Fox’s, though, Newsmax has experienced a 497 percent viewership increase — during the post-election period, but excluding Thanksgiving — while Fox has experienced a 38 percent decline. (In the most recently measurable week, however, Newsmax was down from its post-election ratings highs in mid-November.) While Fox called the election for Biden shortly after the rest of the mainstream media did so, Newsmax waited 37 additional days, only adopting the president-elect moniker after the electoral college confirmed his victory on Dec. 14. But Kelly, who has emerged as Newsmax’s biggest star, a bomb-thrower in the mold of Fox News star Sean Hannity, doesn’t agree with the decision. Kelly acknowledged that some of his colleagues have referred to Biden as president-elect, but said recently, “I personally feel they’re wrong.” “The night of the election completely did it. I haven’t turned on Fox News since,” said Jami Salamida, 43, a paralegal who lives in West Virginia. She watched Fox for two decades and now said she watches between eight and 10 hours of Newsmax each day. While Fox’s coverage of the presidential election was a flash point for many of the network’s defectors, for some it was merely the latest and most pivotal grievance they have had with the network’s programming. “The cherry on the cake was when they called the results of Arizona,” said 60-year-old Donna Cumella, who works in IT in New York. Several viewers expressed frustration with Fox News anchor Chris Wallace’s performance as moderator of the first presidential debate between Trump and Biden on Sept. 29. “That was the big red flag,” Greg Brethen said. Sharon Allan, a retired dental hygienist who lives in Florida, said she sensed a leftward tilt in Fox’s content starting in late September and early October. “It was like all of a sudden. A lot of my friends, we all started noticing it at the same time,” she said. “It was a shift, like they had been bought out. They like were being told to only report certain things in a certain way. It was like, ‘Wow, am I looking at Fox?’ ” Allan, who doesn’t believe that Biden won the election, called Fox’s Arizona call “shocking.” Several of the Fox skeptics guessed that a change in the network’s corporate management could have contributed to the shift they perceived, but many seemed confused about who is running the company and what, if anything, has changed. Six viewers who spoke with The Post mentioned a transfer of power to “the sons,” whom they said were “liberal.” One person said she heard that “the dad who owns it passed away,” a reference to Rupert Murdoch, 89, who is alive and remains chairman of parent company Fox Corp. While Murdoch’s son, James, and daughter-in-law, Kathryn, have embraced liberal causes and politicians, including Biden, they have no control over Fox News. James ceased his role as chief executive of the network’s then-parent company, 21st Century Fox, in March 2019, and almost completely cut his ties to his family’s media dynasty by stepping down from the News Corp. board of directors this summer, citing in a letter “disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.” And Murdoch’s other son, Lachlan, who now runs Fox Corp., is not known to have liberal leanings. For the viewers who have pivoted away from Fox, the one personality that many say they have a hard time totally quitting is prime-time host Tucker Carlson. Their reasons vary. “I still like a little bit of Tucker because I think he’s a smart guy,” said 37-year-old Ricky Moxley, who works in industrial manufacturing in South Carolina. “I will find myself allowing myself to watch Tucker because I think Tucker calls out what’s going on,” Salamida said. “That’s my problem: with the people at Fox pretending that nothing is wrong” with the election process. (There is no evidence of widespread election fraud that would change the results of the election.) Allan, the retired dental hygienist, thinks Carlson should be president one day. Lou Dobbs debunks his own claims of election fraud — after a legal demand from Smartmatic But even the most devoted Newsmax converts say the channel’s programming leaves something to be desired, particularly when compared with the glitz and polish of the massively profitable and high-budgeted Fox News. “I don’t think the programming is set up right,” Salamida said. “They’re basically just playing the same couple of shows all day long.” She “absolutely loves” Kelly and said, “When I watch his show, I honestly feel like I’m getting 100 percent of the truth from him.” But, she added, “When I’m tired of watching the third repeat, it’s really hard to not turn on Fox and see what they’re doing.” “It’s boring, a little bit, but I’m dedicated,” said Michelle Walker, 52, who works in medical billing and lives in South Carolina. “I’ll keep watching it until it gets better.” In particular, she likes and watches Newsmax hosts Grant Stinchfield and Sean Spicer, the former White House press secretary, but thinks Kelly panders too much for her taste. “I’m a Trump supporter, but I don’t want to hear how great my opinion is,” she said. Newsmax has been in the process of ramping up its programming. It recently expanded its morning show, “Wake Up America,” by an hour, and added a 10 p.m. show from former Fox News anchor Rob Schmitt. Chris Ruddy, who founded and runs Newsmax, told The Post that his network will be adding an original show at 9 p.m. each night, launching early next year. He described the concept as “a woman-centric show, something like [ABC’s] ‘The View’ for women.” He added, “We’re looking at a number of personalities for that,'}]"

Aggarwals are born frauds. 3 people are dead and a small child has lost both her parents. And this is what you have to say? You need to see a psychiatrist for the hatred that consumes you.
