Greenville Public School District went on strike to protest reduced hours, low pay and what they say is poor treatment by the district. The move left school children standing on corners with no transportation Monday and Tuesday morning, and the district’s board of trustees and superintendent scrambled to fix the issue at a board meeting Tuesday night. By Wednesday morning, the bus drivers were back at work after their concerns were addressed. The Greenville bus drivers took the rare measure despite the existence of state laws that explicitly prohibit public employees from striking, which comes with threats of jail time and fines. And State Auditor Shad White, citing those state laws, recently investigated and punished a University of Mississippi professor for a work stoppage. Bus drivers in the Greenville district work either 5, 6 or 7-hour routes. But at the beginning of the current school year, all drivers were cut down to 5-hour routes as a result of the school district’s virtual-only instruction amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Superintendent Debra Dace said they were also offered a voluntary furlough so they could collect unemployment but keep their jobs, though none opted to take it. Yolanda Lewis, a 19-year veteran bus driver with the district, said she and others met with Dace on the issue in November, but were given no relief. They asked to meet with the school board, but Dace told them the school board “didn’t want to meet with them.” Then, last month, the board voted to reduce the number of days of work for bus drivers and custodial employees by from 187 to 182 days in the 2021-2022 school year. Dace said she made the recommendation for the reduction of days to the board because she and the director of transportation determined there were “idle days” when students weren’t in school and didn’t need to be transported. Drivers received the letter informing them of the cut on Friday, and, as one school board member described it, it was “the straw that broke the camel’s back.” The letter also stated drivers would only be paid for days worked, which raised fears about the loss of paid holidays. Following the bus drivers’ strike, however, the board on Tuesday reversed that decision. Edwin Young, who has driven for the district for two years, told board members on Tuesday that he made $16,000 last year. “We’re not making anything … We are certified drivers, we got CDLs and we’re living at the poverty level,” he said, noting the additional lack of hazard pay amid the pandemic. And there are other issues in addition to the low pay, he and other drivers said. He still hasn’t been paid for hours he worked in October of last year despite repeatedly requesting the payment from the district. Lewis said she was exposed to COVID-19 earlier this month by a student on her bus. She had to quarantine for 10 days with no pay, and when she went to human resources, they said she wouldn’t receive pay, she said. She was already living on a smaller paycheck after having her hours reduced from 7 to 5. She had to give up her dental, vision and other supplemental insurance after she was no longer able to afford it working the 5-hour route. After the strike, however, she received a call Wednesday letting her know she would receive pay for those days. The district did not immediately respond to questions about these allegations.

His production garnered him interest from multiple schools, and Luke said he ultimately felt at home when he visited Oxford. “I went on some other visits but felt that everything suited me on my visit to Ole Miss,” Luke said. “Coach Sudd (MCC head coach Dillon Sudduth) pretty much said how everyone looks at it: SEC baseball is the pinnacle for playing baseball at the amateur level.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 4:10 pm STARKVILLE — Since the start of Mississippi State’s fall semester, approximately 100 architecture, building construction science, graphic design and interior design seniors have been working in teams on proposals for a redesign of the university’s Hand Chemical Lab auditorium. These MSU students have been vying for top honors and a cash prize in the Brasfield & Gorrie Student Design Competition, begun in 2011 with a sponsorship from one of the nation’s largest privately held construction firms based in Birmingham, Alabama. Cassie Winship, a graphic design major from Ellisville, was part of the team that won third place in the competition. “Sponsoring this competition is a way to pour back into Mississippi State,” said Shawn Mancill, regional virtual design and construction manager with Brasfield & Gorrie. The sponsorship allows the company to network with and evaluate potential candidates to hire in a real-world environment, Mancill said, but the main goal is to encourage teamwork and collaborative work in education, something that’s highly beneficial for the industry. “Students join a team that’s made up of four different disciplines, and many of them may have never met,” he said. “That’s what they’ll find outside of school, and this competition helps them prepare for that.” MSU teams were tasked with redesigning the existing Hand Chemical Lab auditorium to accommodate 300 seats and propose an addition to house new faculty offices, classrooms and a conference room. Students also were required to consider the Americans with Disabilities Act and egress requirements, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design and the Well Building system for monitoring features that impact human health in their projects. MSU’s Department of Chemistry — the client for the project — was represented by Professor David Wipf and Department Head Dennis Smith at the teams’ final presentations. “We are delighted our building was chosen for this cross-college collaboration,” said Smith. “These are fantastic designs.” Brasfield & Gorrie Regional Quality Control Manager Robert Robison, who also serves on the MSU Building Construction Science Program’s Industry Advisory Board, said what impressed him was how quickly the 10 teams put the project together this year. “When we gather a team to begin work on a project, it takes them months to do what these student teams are doing in a couple of weeks,” he said. “We like the way that they collaborated and came together for a thorough final project and professional presentation.” Learn more about MSU’s College of Architecture, Art and Design and its academic programs at www.caad.msstate.edu.

evening. Cloudy skies after midnight. Low 72F. Winds SSE at 5 to 10 mph. Chance of rain 30%.. Isolated thunderstorms during the evening. Cloudy skies after midnight. Low 72F. Winds SSE at 5 to 10 mph. Chance of rain 30%. Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 4:34 pm A good defensive stand by Meridian early in the third quarter forced Gulfport to pass it right in front of its bench. The Admirals player mishandled the ball, resulting in a turnover for the Wildcats. A few seconds before Meridian inbounded the ball, Wildcats head coach Ron Norman exclaimed to his players on the court, asking them if he was the only one excited about that play. “I want my kids to play loose, and everything we do is predicated on defense,” Norman said. “You’ve been with me five years, and I talk about defense because defense travels. What we do on the defensive end travels, so I want them to be excited not just about the 3s we made in the first half, but that defensive play as well.” It was defense that carried the Wildcats to a 39-33 home win Thursday evening against Gulfport, and it carried them through a pair of scoring droughts in the third and fourth quarters. Meridian held the Admirals scoreless in the final six minutes of regulation, allowing the Wildcats to do just enough on the offensive end as time expired. “We turned them over about four times right there down the stretch, and they didn’t get a shot attempt,” Norman said. “We had every reason to lose, but we made enough plays to win.” Meridian took an 11-7 lead after one quarter of play, and the Wildcats started off hot in the second quarter when Brandarious Boler, Devin Portis and Tamarion Jones each hit a 3-pointer in the first two minutes of the frame. Gulfport closed the second on a 6-3 run, but Meridian led 23-13 at the break. The Admirals came out firing in the third quarter, outscoring Meridian 15-3 in the first six and a half minutes of the second half. The Wildcats bounced back, however, with a 6-0 run in the final 1:21 of the third thanks in part to a 3 by Javion Yarbrough. “Teams are going to go on runs like that, so we just have to learn how to not get down on ourselves and just stay up,” senior Demarcus Powe said. Gulfport scored all five of its fourth-quarter points in the first two minutes of the frame to jump back ahead 33-32 with 6:02 left to play, but Meridian ended the game by outscoring the Admirals 7-0. Jaquavion Horner hit a pair of field goals late in the game — one of them off a steal — and Powe returned to the court after drawing his fourth foul earlier in the fourth quarter to sink two free throws with 37 seconds left and help his team buckle down defensively. “You just have to make enough plays to win,” Powe said. “That’s what Coach always says, so it’s always in the back of my mind.” Powe led the Wildcats with 14 points, and Portis finished with seven points, while Horner had six points for Meridian. The Admirals’ Zarius Gill had 11 points, and Kamari Mitchel scored 10 points for Gulfport. “It was a typical Gulfport-Meridian game. We remember the last time they came in here, they beat the brakes off of us,” said Norman, referring to Gulfport’s 68-54 win against Meridian in the second round of the 2020 MHSAA Class 6A playoffs. “I thought we had a really good first half, and in the third quarter we couldn’t score, but that’s a credit to them being 6-foot-9, 6-foot-7, 6-foot-8, but our kids made enough plays. I’ll say it every day, I don’t care about stats, make enough plays to win. (Powe) made enough plays down the stretch to win, and that’s what it’s all about. That’s what you want from your senior.” If there’s one thing Powe took away from the game, it was Norman’s happiness about he and his teammates’ defensive intensity. It’s not a surprise, though, given how much Norman stresses defense in practice. “Every day,” Powe said. “Anytime we don’t have intensity on defense, we’re running.” Meridian improved to 4-0 on the season.

MERIDIAN GIRLS 61, GULFPORT 52 The Lady Wildcats fended off a fourth-quarter run by Lady Admirals to complete the sweep of Gulfport Thursday. Meridian took a 36-27 lead into the half and led 53-37 at the end of the third quarter, but Gulfport outscored the Lady Wildcats 15-8 in the final period. Meridian secured the win by hitting a few free throws in the game’s waning minutes.

Mississippi State signee Debreasha Powe had 24 points for Meridian, while Jamesha Jones scored 13 points and Syria Walker added 10 points. “There were a lot of growing pains tonight,” Meridian girls basketball coach Deneshia Faulkner said. “I think we learned a lot about ourselves. We have a lot to learn defensively, and I don’t think we made the right decisions offensively early in the game, but hey, it’s basketball, and it’s about growing. I think it’s a good win for us, but like I said there are a lot of lessons to be learned from this game.” Meridian (3-0) is scheduled to host Terry Tuesday.

Low 68F. Winds S at 5 to 10 mph. Chance of rain 60%. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 8:19 pm Bill Graham / The Meridian Star The Threefoot Hotel in Meridian. After years of anticipation, The Threefoot Hotel in Meridian opened its doors Tuesday. The opening was announced in a news release by Ascent Hospitality, LLC, which owns the hotel. “We are proud to give the Threefoot new life as downtown Meridian’s cornerstone luxury hotel,” John Tampa, with Ascent Hospitality Management Company, LLC said in the release. Do you plan to visit the Threefoot Hotel now that it is open? “The building joined the landscape in the early 20th Century when Meridian was a force in railroad-dominated industry. We have brought the Threefoot back in a way that captures that luxuriant feel of the ‘Golden Age of Travel’ while offering modern amenities. Through the preservation and restoration, we have prioritized creating a property that serves the community as well as her visitors. The restaurant and the rooftop bar will add to the local culinary scene and bring new dining experiences to locals. We invite everyone to come and enjoy the Threefoot’s transformation.” The 16-story Art Deco structure built in 1929 is the tallest building in East Mississippi. The name Threefoot is an Anglicization of the builder’s family name, Dreyfus. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 and designated a Mississippi Landmark in 2008. Submitted photo A view a room in the Threefoot Hotel. The building’s most recent life was as office space. Vacant since the 1990s, local leaders set out to preserve it in the mid 2000s. The Meridian City Council approved a final agreement for the sale of the building in October 2015. Submitted photo A view of the interior of the Threefoot Hotel. In the past five years, the building has undergone a comprehensive renovation. Many of its features have been preserved, including the mosaic work on the exterior, and the elevator lobby’s marble wainscoting, flooring, mail shoot and the original art deco light fixtures. Guests are welcomed into two vestibules that feature original 1929 Victorian era brass lanterns with frosted and cranberry glass accents. The registration desk displays restored wood doors and hardware from office doors reclaimed from the Threefoot’s former life. In a collaboration with the Threefoot Historical Society, the building’s original office directory board is being updated with the names of the building’s former tenants. The ground floor elevator features original, ornate brass etched doors, which were polished during the renovation and brought back to their original glory. With 6:01 Local, Threefoot brings a new farm-to-table, modern American restaurant to downtown. Situated in the ground floor of the hotel, the restaurant will serve breakfast and dinner. The menu is Southern progressive, emphasizing fresh, seasonal, locally sourced ingredients. Threefoot also has a rooftop bar called The Boxcar, which features a cocktail menu, local craft beers, shareable small plates, and flatbreads. The Boxcar has indoor and outdoor seating and offers panoramic views of the city. These names directly honor the city’s early 20th Century rail history and a time when five rail lines servicing 44 daily trains made Meridian the largest city in the state.

WATER VALLEY – Only a year after opening a clinic on Main Street, Dr. Kimberly Webb has expanded with a second location that opened Monday in the former Regions Bank building on Central Street. Webb, a board certified doctor, practiced almost two decades before opening Webb Family Medical Clinic in Water Valley last February. Since then, the clinic has experienced steady growth, prompting the purchase of the 5,000 square feet building that has been converted to a medical clinic. Webb and her husband, Ted Nerren, first connected with Water Valley over six years ago when she took a job at Yalobusha Health Service (YHS) and he at Mechanics Bank. Webb also worked three years at Baptist Memorial Hospital-Calhoun, before launching her own clinic. “I had this crazy idea,” Nerren recalled about first mentioning opening a clinic in Water Valley to his wife in 2019. “I said I think it is a prime opportunity for you to open your own clinic. It is a lot of risk, but I think that Water Valley would be a great location.” Nerren’s idea prompted a search for a building and after looking at multiple locations they settled on 405 North Main Street. “We really liked the charm of the building,” Webb explained about the Main Street building that previously housed a coffee shop and is in the city’s historic district. They purchased the building in late 2019 and opened in February, 2020.
