That follows the board of education’s announcement at a special session on Saturday that it received Dr. Claude Tiller, Junior’s resignation. Dr. Claude Tiller Junior’s decision to step down follows reports of comments he made during an intermission in a live interview with an Atlanta radio station. Tiller is alleged to have made derogatory comments about a female Green Bay administrator and against most of the district’s teaching staff. Those comments during a commercial break went out over a live video stream. The board of education met three times in special session following word of Tiller’s comments. Just prior to the Saturday meeting, the board received a communication from Tiller’s attorney that he was resigning his position. The board of education voted unanimously to accept Dr. Tiller’s resignation. Board member Laura Laitenan-Warren says the decision to accept Tiller’s resignation was personally difficult. . As the district prepares to select a new superintendent, the executive directors of Casa Alba Melaine, a Hispanic community resource center, COMSA, which provides resources for immigrants and refugees, and We All Rise, an African-American resource center, are forming a task force to add their voices to the selection process. The United Front for Social Change’s goal is to address inequalities they are seeing within the district. Gratzia Villarroel, with St. Norbert College, voices disappointment in how this matter was handled. Amanda Garcia, Casa Alba Melaine’s Executive Director, says Dr. Tiller was addressing concerns unique to Green Bay’s minority community.
