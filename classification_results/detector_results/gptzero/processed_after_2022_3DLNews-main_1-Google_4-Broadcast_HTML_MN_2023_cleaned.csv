The City of Rockville received notice at last night’s city council meeting that five officers of the Rockville fire department are resigning their officer positions effective January 12, 2024.

The Minnesota Department of Agriculture can issue violations if seed labelers run afoul of the law and regulators do routine inspections and investigate complaints from consumers, which they can file online. “We are able to take samples of things and test them using our lab and then compare if what’s on the label matches what’s with the [state] test,” Merriman said. Some in the industry joke that plants in new legal markets grow by “immaculate conception,” since marijuana is still considered a Schedule I controlled substance by its federal definition—making it illegal to cross state lines and raising questions about if seed faces the same restrictions. Vicente LLP, a law firm that works on cannabis issues, did receive a letter with guidance from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration last year that said the federal government doesn’t consider seeds to fall under that prohibition because they have less than 0.3% THC, the psychoactive ingredient that produces a high, on a dry weight basis. That means those marijuana seeds meet the definition of hemp, which is legal at the federal level as of 2018, according to the agency’s letter to the firm obtained by WCCO. Merriman and others at the Minnesota Department of Agriculture fielded questions about cannabis seeds during a webinar Wednesday. He said one of the biggest misconceptions among attendees was who needs to be permitted—seed labelers are different than retailers, who don’t need to seek a permit in order to sell seeds in their stores. Green Nectar Cultivation is a new business that sought a state license for seed labeling. Owner Ian Davis said he first started the company in 2019 to get into a fledging hemp industry, but the pandemic derailed those plans. When state lawmakers legalized recreational marijuana this session, he wanted to seize the opportunity. “As soon as that happened, we were go time,” Davis said in an interview with WCCO. “It was time to brainstorm to see what’s legal, what is available to bring to the market on the first, what’s the soonest available thing we can sell and its seed.” His company plans to supply seeds in seven retail stores across Minnesota starting next week. Eventually, Davis also would like to tap into future cannabis business opportunities under the new law, which sets up a regulatory framework for retail sales and manufacturing of cannabis products. There are 10 business licenses for the adult-use market, and more for medical cannabis and low-dose hemp THC-infused edibles. It will likely be at least a year before those businesses are operational because a new state regulatory agency—the Office of Cannabis Management—is still in its infancy. “I really wanted to get into this industry to help reallocate some funds to the communities decimated by the war on drugs,” Davis said. Starting Aug. 1, Minnesotans can have up to two pounds of cannabis flower in their home and two ounces on their person while out and about in public.

smartphones. HONOLULU (ISLAND NEWS) -- One of the latest digital crimes to be on the lookout for starts with the theft of smartphones - but can lead to a hijacking of so much of your life. Experts and law enforcement say it happens when a criminal has access to your unlocked phone, whether that\'s done on the sly - or as part of a brazen robbery. On an otherwise normal day in October of this year, Island News Midday producer Bre Jackson was at her desk when her phone sent an alert. ""It said my Trusted Phone Number had been changed on my Apple ID. I was at work, I was here. And I knew immediately what happened,"" she recalls. She knew, because she used to work at Apple and heard dozens of these stories before. What happened was, a thief took her backup iPhone, then took command of all her accounts, including her Apple ID and her iCloud. Her life became his life. ""He has control of my WhatsApp account. He did that pretty quickly. He tried to get my CashApp,"" Jackson says, ticking off a list of all the things he has colonized. Experts say this is happening across the continent and the world: Thieves stealing people\'s smartphones, then using them to drain victims\' bank accounts. But CrimeStoppers and the Honolulu Police Department say Jackson\'s is the only report of its kind on Oahu so far. Jackson says, ""He did make multiple charges. According to Honolulu Police, it\'s up to a felony, so, thousands [of dollars.]"" Island News Tech Expert Ryan Ozawa says often, victims are unwitting accomplices in their own crime, trusting strangers with their phones. ""You hand them your phone. You think they\'re typing in their Instagram handle so you can connect with this cute guy or gal. But while they\'re doing is disabling all of your security on your phone,"" he says. Or sometimes crooks snatch the phones from victim\'s hands and run off. Not Jackson. She lost her digital life after she lost her apartment in an October fire. Authorities didn\'t allow her to go to her unit because it was unsafe. But not everything was destroyed, and a looter found her spare phone and her list of passwords. Most damning is when he took over her iCloud account. ""He changed my name to his name to John Doe. When he changed his name it sent me the email."" It\'s about so much more than money. It\'s her safety (""I can\'t use Location or he\'ll know exactly where I am. He has all my stuff. I can\'t even download apps on this phone."") and her memories. ""I could wipe this phone and have a fresh device, but all those pictures are going to be gone. Being able to see them, even if blurry, remembering what it used to look like, is kind of better than not having it at all,"" Jackson says through tears. It\'s frustrating. ""I feel vulnerable,"" she admits. And she\'s not sure when or how this ultimately ends.

From a Memorial Day lilac labyrinth to a woman's problematic packaging predicament, here are the most-viewed stories from BTN this year. For a second year, Mike Nistler allowed people to walk through his maze made of lilac bushes in St. Cloud to honor and raise money for veterans. When Kelly Witter returned to her White Bear Lake apartment after a weekend away, she was greeted by stacks and stacks of packages she didn't order... or pay for. Whalen was an All-American player for the University of Minnesota women's basketball team before becoming a five-time WNBA All-Star and four-time champion with the Minnesota Lynx. She took over over as the Gophers head coach in 2018, but resigned abruptly in March. The legislature passed new rules this session, loosening some regulations, while tightening others. Keeping tabs on the number of expired tabs in Minnesota is an inexact science, but that hasn't stopped a local reporter from trying.
