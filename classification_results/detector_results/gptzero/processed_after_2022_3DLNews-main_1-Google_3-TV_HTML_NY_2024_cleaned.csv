Keeping interest rates this high generally would cause job numbers to soften, but that hasn't been the case.

(WIVB) — The federal trial for Tops mass shooter Payton Gendron is set for Sept. 8, 2025, over three years after the confessed murderer killed 10 people and injured three others in a racist attack at the Buffalo supermarket in May 2022. The date was established during a federal court session Friday. Gendron was not present in court. The Department of Justice announced they will seek the death penalty against Gendron in January, and arguments surrounding whether or not Gendron should be put to death will likely take center stage during the federal trial. Judge Lawrence J. Vilardo said Sept. 8, 2025 is not a “hell or high water” date for the trial, and that it could get pushed back based on pretrial arguments. #New: A trial date of Sept. 8, 2025 has been set in the federal case against Tops shooter Payton Gendron – though Judge Vilardo said it\'s not a ""hell or high water"" date, and that it could get pushed back based on pretrial arguments. Gendron, 20, is already serving life in prison after he pleaded guilty to over a dozen state charges against him in November 2022. One of the charges, first-degree domestic act of terrorism motivated by hate, is automatically punished by life in prison without parole. New York does not have the death penalty. “I’m happy that things are moving forward,” Zeneta Everhart, the mother of shooting survivor Zaire Goodman, said Friday. “I think that gives both sides enough time to prepare their cases. … I don’t know about the families, you know, I don’t know if that makes them feel good or not.

Updated February 2, 2024 at 6:03 PM ET The U.S. military has mounted a series of air and missile strikes against Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria, NPR has confirmed, in retaliation for a suicide drone strike that killed three American soldiers on Sunday at a remote base in Jordan. The airstrikes, which used more than 125 precision munitions, came at 4 p.m. ET Friday and struck more than 85 targets, U.S. Central Command said in a statement. ""The facilities that were struck included command and control operations, centers, intelligence centers, rockets, and missiles, and unmanned aired vehicle storages, and logistics and munition supply chain facilities of militia groups and their IRGC sponsors who facilitated attacks against U.S. and Coalition forces,"" CENTCOM said, referring to Iran\'s Revolutionary Guard Corps. John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, told reporters Friday that in all seven facilities used by IRGC and its proxies were hit — three in Iraq and four in Syria. The strikes, he said, occurred over 30 minutes. The Iraqi government was informed beforehand, he said. The targets were chosen to avoid civilian casualties, he said. The U.S. strikes are far more extensive and deadly than those that have been launched since last October, when the Israeli-Gaza war began and pro-Iranian groups like the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq started an uptick of attacks. That\'s because the Jan. 28 attacks on a U.S. support base in Jordan was the highest death toll of troops in the Middle East in at least a decade. Three Army Reserve soldiers from Georgiawere killed when an attack drone slammed into their sleeping quarters. Another three dozen were wounded, a handful seriously. President Biden traveled Friday to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, where the bodies of the three soldiers returned in flag-draped silver cases. In a statement after the strikes, Biden said: ""Our response began today. It will continue at times and places of our choosing. The United States does not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world. But let all those who might seek to do us harm know this: If you harm an American, we will respond."" The U.S. attacks were telegraphed for days. Biden told reporters outside the White House earlier this week he had decided on a response. And lawmakers were told by senior administration officials that the president wanted military options ""a level or two up"" from the ""whack-a-mole strikes we had been doing on (militia) storage and launch sites."" National Security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that the initial American strikes were likely just the beginning. ""It\'s very possible you will see a tiered approach here,"" Kirby said, ""not just a single action, but potentially multiple actions over a period of time."" Republican lawmakers have pressed Biden to strike Iran itself because it has trained and supported the militia groups that have targeted American troops, while Democrats — and Biden himself — have been more reluctant about targeting Iran and widening the Israeli-Gaza war into a regional conflict. Retired Adm. James Stavridis wrote in Bloomberg that the deaths of the three American soldiers required Biden to respond with a ""new level of force."" That should include ""continuous strikes against proxy targets in Syria and Yemen,"" while working with Iraq ""to expand strikes to their country."" Stavridis also said the U.S. should be ""prepping for a significant cyber attack"" on Iran, including severing its ties to its proxy forces, penetrating its oil and gas infrastructure and reducing its armament production. Brad Bowman, a Middle East analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said it was essential for the U.S. to ""hit back hard to restore tattered American deterrence."" But he worried whether the U.S. troops in the region had enough defenses to ""prepare for the inevitable counterpunch that will come after U.S. airstrikes.""

The Iranian-backed militias have mounted more than 165 drone, missile and rocket attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria since last fall.

The U.S. has repeatedly hit targets in Syria and Iraq, though the militias continue to strike at American targets — part of Iran\'s strategy of pushing the U.S. out of the region. Last October, the U.S. responded with airstrikes by bombing weapons and storage facilities in Syria with F-16 jets. A few weeks later, the U.S. hit more targets in Syria, including those used by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and its allies. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, nine workers in the facilities were killed in the strikes.

U.S. forces at al Asad Airbase west of Baghdad. According to U.S. assessments, several Iran-backed fighters were killed in the strike. The next day, U.S. fighter jets conducted airstrikes on Iraqi Kataib Hezbollah facilities, killing over eight fighters. And there were two strikes in December by the U.S. in Iraq, hitting militants near Kirkuk, and killing five as they attempted to fire on U.S. forces. Another one hit a militia base in Hillah, killing one militant and wounding 20 others. The so-called ""axis of resistance"" is a network of Iran proxy groups across the region. It includes Hezbollah in Lebanon, a coalition of militias in Iraq that go by the name the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, Ansar Allah — Houthi forces — in Yemen and Iran-linked groups in eastern Syria. Kataib Hezbollah (which means Party of God Brigades) is not a subsidiary of the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon, but both have close links to Iran. KH is considered the most powerful of the Iran-backed militias in the Iraq-based resistance, which has claimed about 160 attacks on U.S. forces since the beginning of the Gaza war. It was one of the many Shiite militias that fought ISIS starting in 2014 and along with others, was incorporated into Iraq\'s official security forces in 2019. Before the Gaza war, the group was known for attacks on the U.S. military which it considers to be occupying forces in Iraq, including using roadside bombs manufactured in Iran. The U.S. killed the founder of KH, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, in the same drone strike four years ago in Baghdad that killed Iranian general Quassem Soleimani. Muhandis was also a senior Iraqi government security official and that killing dramatically raised tension in Iraq with U.S. forces. On Jan. 24, the U.S. struck three bases of Kataib Hezbollah in retaliation for strikes that included an attack on the Ain al-Asad base in Western al-Anbar.

He’s known as the father of Czech music. His opera, The Bartered Bride, and his symphonic cycle Má vlast (My Fatherland) are his most famous works. Like Bruckner, Smetana faced challenges. He grew up poor. The kids at school made fun of his shabby clothes. They also teased him about his last name, which means cream in Czech. We hear his Bartered Bride Overture and sections of Má vlast often, but this year we’ll dig deeper, sampling his piano, chamber, and vocal music. Czechia is launching a celebration of Smetana this year called Smetana 200 in honor of his profound contributions to music. Here’s a sample of his piano music: Let’s be realistic.

Stone, a former seventh-round pick, had seven interceptions, the second most in the NFL. He also graded out well by Pro Football Focus with an 84.9 grade, which ranked seventh among safeties. At his best, Hyde was a ballhawk and had five interceptions two different times in his Bills tenure. In Stone, they could add another difference-maker to the secondary who can anchor their defense. Washington Commanders safety Kam Curl: Lost in the shuffle of playing on the worst defense in the NFL last season has been the steady play of Washington Commanders safety Kam Curl. Curl, 24, is also a former seventh-round pick and set a career-high with 115 tackles in 2023. He also had three tackles for loss, three quarterback hits, five passes defended and a forced fumble. Curl earned the best grade of his career in 2022 with an 82.9. Curl had a bit of a down year, though playing on a Commanders defense that allowed the most points and yards per game didn't help matters.

The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. ""Its [sic] too bad, I would have loved to teach grammar skills to bring police up to the elementary school level, at least,"" said Vekos in an email chain obtained by NBC5. On Thursday, the Addison County State\'s Attorney, Eva Vekos received pushback after sending a controversial email to law enforcement the previous day. NBC5 obtained a copy of the email correspondence from the county\'s Sheriff, Michael Elmore. Multiple members of the local law enforcement have called Vekos\'s comments ""completely unprofessional and disappointing."" The correspondence began when Vekos emailed members of the local police forces to say that her office will now require citations to be given to the court at least 60 days in advance of the court appearance. There are exceptions to this rule laid out in the email. ""We hadn\'t had any sort of requirements for submitting cases to her until she sent that email,"" said Elmore. The rule change comes after Vekos was arrested on Jan. 26th on a DUI refusal charge while at a crime scene in Bridport. Vermont State Police troopers on the scene said they smelled alcohol on Vekos\' breath and she was slurring her words while at the scene. Now, Elmore said he believes that interaction played a role in the new request and questioned the timing of her email. ""It\'s hard to see how it couldn\'t have,"" said Elmore. ""Just because it came so soon after and it put us in a hard place."" A VSP lieutenant responded to the email, asking Vekos to clarify the topic during the next chief\'s meeting. That\'s when Vekos replied, saying in part: ""Please note that because I no longer feel safe around law enforcement I will join the next Chiefs’ meeting by video,"" said Vekos. ""This safety issue will conflict with the plan for me to do educational trainings."" The State\'s Attorney goes on to say: ""Its [sic] too bad, I would have loved to teach grammar skills to bring police up to the elementary school level, at least,"" said Vekos. ""I found a really great illustrated book to use. It has pictures of dragons and stuff."" Elmore said he is concerned about what this means for interactions between law enforcement and Vekos going forward. ""I don\'t know what prompted that email to us,"" said Elmore. ""To that degree, everyone that I\'ve interacted with here in Addison County is professional, educated. I don\'t see a reason why she would all of a sudden be saying that we\'re not educated, and we write poorly."" He also said the correspondence makes him uneasy when it comes to executing justice in Addison County. ""It does make me concerned about submitting cases to her,"" said Elmore. ""And I think the rest of the law enforcement here in Addison County feels the same way. Where if she feels this way about us so openly, how can we feel good about sending her cases and feeling like we\'re going to have our side portrayed correctly?"" Ultimately, at the end of the exchange, Vekos acknowledged that her email was unprofessional and apologized. However, Elmore sent Vekos a letter on Thursday and has filed a complaint with the Judicial Professional Responsibility Board. NBC5 asked Elmore if he thinks Vekos should resign. ""I won\'t comment on that right now,"" said Elmore. NBC5 reached out to Vekos and her attorney, David Sleigh, multiple times on Thursday but did not receive a response in time for the report.

If Weisselberg ends up pleading guilty to a perjury charge it would mark his second criminal conviction. He previously pleaded guilty to criminal charges and testified against the Trump Organization, which was convicted in 2022 of tax evasion. His testimony was careful not to implicate Trump and Weisselberg is not expected to be called as a witness in the Manhattan DA\'s criminal case against Trump that accuses him of falsifying business records in connection with a hush payment to porn actress. Trump is awaiting a verdict in a New York in a $370 million civil fraud trial that could alter the personal fortune and real estate empire that helped propel Trump to the White House. Trump, his sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., and other top Trump Organization executives are accused by New York Attorney General Letitia James of engaging in a decade-long scheme in which they used ""numerous acts of fraud and misrepresentation"" to inflate Trump\'s net worth in order get more favorable loan terms. The trial comes after the judge in the case ruled in a partial summary judgment that Trump had submitted ""fraudulent valuations"" for his assets, leaving the trial to determine additional actions and what penalty, if any, the defendants should receive. The former president has denied all wrongdoing.
