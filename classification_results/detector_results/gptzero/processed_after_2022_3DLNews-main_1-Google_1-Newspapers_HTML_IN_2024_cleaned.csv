ANGOLA — James Leslie Davis of Hamilton was elected as the top officer of the Grand Council Cryptic Masons of Indiana. Memorial weekend is seen as the kickoff of summer. We see summer as a time for campfires, vacations, and a break from the regular activities in our lives. We also celebrate that we are out of the house and about, after gray skies and winter. It can be easy to let our faith take a back seat. … To kick off the summer season, you may encounter various reading lists. Boost the flavor and beauty of your landscape by adding a few ornamental edible plants to your garden beds and containers. Look for opportunities to substitute ornamental vegetables, fruit, herbs, and edible flowers for ornamental but nonedible plants.

The little news that did hit the grain markets after the year-ending holidays was more encouraging to market bears than market bulls. For example, our friends at farmdoc Daily released their revised (from last August) 2024 crop cost estimates Jan. 9 and nothing in the cold calculations and hard estimates was heart warming or checkbook filling. Indeed, today\'s weaker prices are translating directly into ""lower return and profitability projections."" That\'s a pleasant phrase for bad news because, according to University of Illinois ag economists Nick Paulson and Gary Schnitkey, ""Current farmer return expectations are negative for both corn and soybeans across all regions""—four regions for the 385-mile long state—""for 2024 ... cash rented land at average rent levels ..."" And the ""negative"" returns are big. For corn, projected losses range from a knee-bending -$160 per acre in southern Illinois to an only-slightly better -$135 per acre in central Illinois. The projected, per-acre losses are smaller for 2024 Illinois soybean growers, but still wallet-crunching: they range from -$107 in southern Illinois to a slimmer but still stinging -$20 in central Illinois. Those compounding losses, say the Extension experts, suggest ""cost adjustments"" by growers ""will be needed in 2024 and beyond"" to either reduce the anticipated losses or scratch out a profit. Both seem like tall orders now. One ""adjustment"" that would benefit all farmers is for Congress to raise crop insurance\'s reference prices, the floor prices guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\'s federal crop insurance program. In flagging markets like 2024, higher reference prices would make crop insurance payments all but certain and, as markets stall, large. American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall and Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack both spoke to that possibility at the recent AFBF convention in Salt Lake City. Duvall said U.S. agriculture would be ""devastated"" if Congress failed to raise reference prices in its still-stalled 2023-24 Farm Bill effort. In his convention remarks, Vilsack did not argue against higher crop insurance benchmarks. He did warn members of the politically-potent Farm Bureau, however, that retargeting USDA food assistance funds to underwrite more costly crop insurance programs would not fly in either the Senate, House or White House. And, added the secretary, if farmers want higher reference prices they need to push Congress ""to get creative"" in finding the money to finance them. He pointed to the Commodity Credit Corp. as one possible source. A one-time reliable boost for prices, ag export demand, is experiencing a 2023 hangover, also. For example, according to USDA data, China\'s total soybean imports last year were an incredible 100 million metric tons. Brazil, however, supplied 70% of the total; the U.S. only 24%, or 13% less than the year before. Worse, while Brazil\'s 2024 soy crop got off to a rough start, neighboring Argentina\'s crop is looking better than first thought, putting more U.S. soy markets in South America\'s gunsights for later this year. As such, February—even without this year\'s Leap Day—is going to be a long month. Return to Top of Page Copyright © 2004 Exchange Publishing Corporation'}]"

It’s something like taking a month to understand the history and contribution of the people who contribute to our nation. But it’s more than a mere appreciation. It is a necessary act for survival and thriving. Dr. C.G. Woodson, the man who founded Black History Week that turned into Black History Month, noted that “history is the prophet looking backward” and that “not to know what once’s race has done in former times is to continue always as a child. ‘If no use were made of the labor of past ages,’ it has been said, ‘the world remains always in the infancy of knowledge.’” Woodson wrote on, “If a race has no history, if it has no worth-while tradition, it becomes a negligible fact in the thought of the world, and it stands in danger of being exterminated.” Thus, Black History Month is a dedicated period to promote history that is (or should be) fully integrated in our life-long education, one that affirms the right of people to thrive here in the U.S. This year’s Black History Month recognition begins on a somewhat mournful note with the passing of the League of Women Voters president, who died suddenly Jan. 28. Dr. Deborah Ann Turner was an incredible woman with a list of accomplishments that speak to her character and example \xad— a mother, the first African-American woman certified by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology, a lawyer and policy maker and finally national president of the LWV. Turner told her children to be lifelong learners and to reach out to other cultures, find an interest and pursue that interest. Notably, that complements the efforts of various history months. According to her hometown newspaper, the Mason City, Iowa, Globe Gazette, as a child Turner’s father told her “be a ditch digger or be a doctor, but whatever you do, be the best ditch digger or best doctor.” Her path to OB/GYN and her brother’s career as a highway construction engineer indicated their sincerity in heeding their father’s advice. Turner was named to the Iowa Women’s Hall of Fame in 2013 because of her relentless interest in bringing her best to the world. Her specialty \xad— gynecologic oncology, or gynecological cancer care — inspired her to impact health policy. She pursued a Juris Doctorate (law degree) to impact healthcare policy and increase equity through activism. In 2010, the Iowa League of Women Voters made her their president and she became national president in 2020. Also blazing a trail in medicine is Dr. Irene Canady, the first African American neurosurgeon. Canady’s father was a dentist and her mother was a stay-at-home mom. Her grandmother was professor at Lane College in Tennessee who studied aptitude testing. When she took a test for her grandmother’s research, “a funny thing happened.” She’d done abnormally well, uncovering a tragic deception. “That’s how it came to light that my teacher had been lying about my test scores in school. She’d been switching them with a white girl in my class. And just like that, it turned out I wasn’t so average after all,” Canady told the University of Michigan, her alma mater. Not that anyone in her family told her. She skipped the third grade, which motivated her and in college she learned this secret and that her teacher had been fired on account of it. In high school, Canady set her heart on being a mathematician, so she applied to MIT, not knowing the school would block her acceptance, so she considered applying to a school closer to home. Having competed with her equally proficient brother, her parents told her to apply somewhere other than the University of Michigan to allow him to thrive. Undeterred, and likely wise enough to realize her brother would thrive either way, she took matters in her own hand and applied anyway. Upon being accepted, she jumped into the debate team. Early on, Canady discovered math was not her forte. While she explored her next steps, she took a job as a city reporter for The Michigan Daily, moving on to the editorial page. A bit lost on her next steps, she foundered until her brother mentioned a scholarship program in medicine for minority students. Little did she know that the work ethic and reputation she built at The Daily and through the debate team boosted her reputation and helped her get into med school. Upon finishing med school, she was obsessed with neurosurgery, but the chair of the Michigan program found a way to insinuate she wasn’t welcome “in his program.” He sat her down and read off a long list of students he’d washed out of the program. In spite of many people asking, “Is this really what you want to do?” Yes, it was. Canady persisted in the face of resistance, was not to be frightened by intimidating people, and she trusted her knowledge and ability. In the moment, Canady didn’t realize the broader impact of her personal accomplishment, but reflecting later, she told NBC Today, “One, it was important for the children, who would no longer see neurosurgery as yet another world that they couldn’t belong to. That’s the side everybody appreciates. And that was equally important in changing society’s expectations. So while being first wasn’t important to me, it was important for many others.” Dr. Canady served as the chief of neurosurgery at the Children’s Hospital of Michigan from 1987 until her retirement in June 2001. • • • Clarification: Diamond Justus, who was featured in last week’s column, was the recent education director for the Montgomery Health Department.

newspaper employee was determined to deliver her papers on time. It turned out to be in the nick of time for a 94-year-old man who did the same job himself as a boy. Heidi Lipscomb, a distribution manager for Gannett Co. Inc. in Richmond, Indiana, was filling in for a delivery driver whose car wouldn't start in the bitter cold. It was 2 degrees at 2 a.m. on a Tuesday morning when Lipscomb pulled into the driveway of Bill Denny’s home to drop off the Richmond Palladium-Item and Indianapolis Star. She immediately noticed the garage door was open and the lights in the house were on. When Lipscomb stepped from the car, she told IndyStar later, she saw Denny lying on his back in front of the garage. He wore a brown down coat, boots and brown cap, and was immobile except for slight movements of his arms. His eyes were open but he couldn’t speak. His hands were black and his knuckles oozed blood. “I was shocked to come upon this,” said Lipscomb, a Gannett employee of 25 years who often fills in for absent carriers. “I told him, 'I’m getting you some help.'” Paramedics came in five minutes and rushed Denny to Reid Health in Richmond. Lipscomb finished delivering papers. Hours later, Lipscomb checked in at the hospital. Not only was Denny OK, but he could see visitors. He’d suffered frostbite on his hands but otherwise was in good health. Another 30 minutes in the cold, however, could have been deadly. “I couldn’t believe it,” she said. “All I could think was, ‘Thank God he’s alive.’ He must be one tough bird.” The least she could do, Lipscomb thought, was bring Denny his newspapers. He’d been a subscriber for 60 years, after all. When she walked into hospital room 508 and told Denny who she was, he and his visitors declared a mystery solved. “The final piece of the puzzle,” Denny's niece, Debbie Doggett, 72, said. ”She kept him alive.” Denny said he was returning home from dinner at 7:30 p.m. Monday when he lost his balance, fell over and was knocked unconscious. He had no recollection of lying in the cold or seeing Lipscomb come to help. “I must have hit my head, and when I woke up I didn’t know where I was,” Denny said from his hospital room. “I'm very fortunate Heidi was there to get the ambulance called.

Saban is retiring, sources tell The Tuscaloosa News. Saban, 72, informed the team Wednesday. MORE: Relive Nick Saban\'s epic Alabama football coaching career with our special book! The Fairmont, West Virginia, native won six national championships after arriving in 2007, tied with Paul “Bear” Bryant for the most in Alabama history. Saban’s career ends with seven total, including one with LSU. No other coach has won more in the history of college football. Twice, Saban’s Alabama teams finished undefeated: 2009 and 2020. Ten times, the Crimson Tide has won the SEC West. Nine times, Alabama has won the SEC Championship Game. That’s right — More than half of the years Saban has been in Tuscaloosa, he brought home the conference title. In ten years of the College Football Playoff, Alabama has only missed it twice. Along the way, Saban has produced 44 first-round draft picks at Alabama. No other coach is even close. NICK SABAN: How Nick Saban transformed Alabama football — and changed a blueblood forever THE SABANS: On their 50th anniversary, Nick and Terry Saban — and 48 of their friends — share their love story Saban spent about a half century in the coaching profession. He started as a grad assistant at Kent State, his alma mater. He worked as a position coach at Kent State, Syracuse, West Virginia and Navy before he became defensive coordinator for Michigan State in the late 1980s. After coaching defensive backs for the Houston Oilers for two seasons, Saban got his first head coaching opportunity with Toledo in 1990. Outside of three years as the Cleveland Browns defensive coordinator, the rest of Saban\'s career was spent as a head coach. He went from Michigan State (1995-99) to LSU (2000-04) and the Miami Dolphins (2005-06) before 17 seasons with the Crimson Tide. He has won numerous accolades, including the Paul ""Bear"" Bryant coach of the year award twice. He\'s also been the AP, Walter Camp and Eddie Robinson coach of the year twice, among other coach of the year awards that he has won once. Saban has received five SEC coach of the year awards, too. The ability to change has been Saban’s key ingredient in Tuscaloosa. Although he was a stickler for consistency and a creature of habit, he remained at the top because he was willing to adapt. When the hurry-up, no-huddle offenses arrived, the type of defenses that helped Saban win early weren’t going to work anymore. Neither was the old ground-and-pound offense. So, Saban adapted, and Alabama won with a different style. He brought in Lane Kiffin to transition to the forward-thinking spread attack. Each coordinator Saban added after Kiffin brought new concepts from there. In the process, Alabama became a place where it made sense for top quarterbacks to play. Saban’s impact on Alabama goes past football. He made his mark on the Tuscaloosa community in 2011 after an EF4 tornado devastated the city. In response, Saban visited relief centers unannounced to show gratitude and spoke to search and rescue teams. Then, he and his wife Terry funded 13 homes, one for each national championship at Alabama. The tradition has continued since, partnering with Habitat for Humanity and others to continue building homes for each title, plus more. As the dynasty grew, so, too, did the city. From 2010 to 2020, the Tuscaloosa population increased by about 10,000. Student enrollment at UA also grew by more than 10,000 since Saban arrived in 2007. The economic impact of Saban’s presence and success on the field has been tangible in the city of Tuscaloosa, too. Mayor Walt Maddox has made reference to “Sabanomics.” As of 2021, the University of Alabama’s Center for Business & Economic Research’s latest data showed each UA home game has brought in $26.2 million for the state and $19.5 million for the local economy. In 2004-05, each game brought in about $12.7 million to the local economy. “Coach Saban is perhaps, if not the best single investment the university has made, he is one of the best,” said Robert E. Witt, professor and president emeritus at the University of Alabama. “It’s not just that coach Saban has been successful, it’s the way he’s been successful. He has never once brought this university’s integrity or honor or values in to question.” Nick Kelly is the Alabama beat writer for The Tuscaloosa News, part of the USA TODAY Network, and he covers Alabama football and men\'s basketball.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:20 pm PROVIDED PROVIDED State Rep. Kendell Culp announced last week he will seek re-election of his District 16 seat. A press release on House Bill 1093 was sent to this newspaper on Jan. 30, 2024. Adjustments to the bill have been made, leaving the Jan. 30 release with a couple of inaccuracies. To correct this, immediately below is an updated version of the release. STATEHOUSE (Jan. 30, 2024) – The Indiana House of Representatives advanced State Rep. Kendell Culp\'s (R-Rensselaer) legislation, which he said supports and protects Hoosier teenagers who want hands-on experience in the workplace. Currently, Indiana\'s youth employment regulations are more restrictive than federal regulations, which Culp said negatively impacts teenagers who choose to work. Culp\'s legislation would bring Indiana into alignment with federal law. ""During my teenage years, I took great pride in the experience and opportunities I earned from working,"" Culp said. ""By updating our laws, we can give more young Hoosiers the opportunity to learn new and useful skills outside the classroom while also making sure they\'re protected."" Culp said House Bill 1093 would align Indiana and federal law by expanding how long and when certain minors can work. For example, Indiana doesn\'t allow those ages 14 to 15 to work past 7 p.m. on a school night during the summer, but federal law allows them to work later with parent permission. ""As parents, we know that our student athletes often arrive home late at night and certainly past 7 o\'clock,"" Culp said. ""If a student wants to work at a job instead, I believe they, along with their parents, should be able to make that decision."" Under House Bill 1093, 16- or 17-year-olds would be able to perform farm jobs. Culp said the bill also makes it clear that students who complete the eighth grade can work during traditional school hours with parent approval. He said this portion of the bill supports non-traditional students like the Amish and Mennonite who are exempt from compulsory attendance.

The Hoosiers entered the game with a chance to extend their in-state rivalry win streak to double-digits while the Boilermakers looked to find a momentum changing victory over a ranked opponent in front of a roaring home crowd. Over 11,000 fans at Mackey Arena were treated to a back-and-forth thriller as the Hoosiers ultimately secured a 74-68 victory.

Indiana shot 15-for-23 (65.2%) from beyond the arc, a season high in 3-pointers and 3-point percentage. Fifth-year senior guard Sara Scalia and sophomore guard Yarden Garzon led the way for the barrage of long range makes. The two Hoosier starters shot a combined 11-for-17 from deep — making up for the team’s turnovers and poor rebounding. Even graduate student forward Mackenzie Holmes got in on the action, sinking her first 3-point attempt of the season in a crucial moment with the game tied 56-56 early in the fourth quarter. Time after time, Indiana came through with clutch shots, stifling the Boilermakers’ momentum. Purdue head coach Katie Gearlds noted the Hoosiers' composure following the game. “They never looked rattled,” Gearlds said. “Credit to them for stepping up and knocking down big shots.” Surprisingly, the red-hot shooting performance came without the help of one of the Hoosiers’ best shooters, senior guard Sydney Parrish.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:19 pm INDIANAPOLIS — Attorney General Todd Rokita is asking Hoosiers to stay alert for signs of human trafficking in communities across Indiana and to report any suspicious activities to authorities. “Human trafficking may seem like an issue that doesn’t affect your specific community, but it’s sometimes brushed under the rug because victims are either scared to admit the truth or are groomed at a young age,” Rokita said. “Online recruitment has played a major role in this crime. Our kids are extremely vulnerable to sex trafficking and exploitation due to their excessive online presence. I encourage all parents to monitor their child’s online interactions to keep them safe.” Human trafficking is a billion-dollar criminal enterprise, according to a press release. It occurs anytime someone uses force, fraud or coercion to make another individual provide labor, services or commercial sex acts. Javascript is required for you to be able to read premium content.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:33 pm According to Facts.net, Scottish Terriers live between 11 and 13 years on average. Former presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and George W. Bush had them as beloved pets. Pets are often considered beloved family members, and like any loved one, their health is a priority. Research from Purdue University has found a link between a dog’s exposure to cigarette smoke and lawn-care products and higher rates of cancer. The team observed the environment and activity of 120 Scottish terriers and found the dogs were six times more likely to develop urinary bladder cancer than other breeds. Dr. Deborah Knapp, professor of comparative oncology in the College of Veterinary Medicine at Purdue University, said there are steps dog owners can take to reduce the risk of their pets becoming ill. “Avoiding cigarette smoke, avoiding lawn chemicals, and being aware so that if the dog develops symptoms – if it’s a middle-aged to older age – like blood in the urine or urinary accidents,” Knapp outlined. “It would be a really good idea to have their veterinarian check the dog out.” Knapp noted they found Scotties, Shelties, Westies and Beagles are also prone to developing cancer if exposed to smoke and harmful chemicals, like those in lawn fertilizer. Treatment for cancer in dogs is daily oral medication. An important part of the Purdue research was monitoring the dogs’ diet. A 2005 study, also from Purdue, supported the benefits of feeding dogs vegetables. Knapp pointed out if the terriers ate carrots or green beans at least three times a week, their bladder-cancer risk appears to have been reduced by 70%. Knapp also cautioned pet owners taking such advice to do so with caution and not overfeed their pets. “Pet owners shouldn’t take a dog that’s not used to eating vegetables and give it way too many, because then they’ll get an upset stomach; vomiting, diarrhea and not feel good,” Knapp advised. “When you think about the portion size for vegetables, think about body weight.” She added she is optimistic further research could help determine risk factors for who gets cancer and the best methods for detection, treatment and prevention for dogs and potentially, humans.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:10 pm Young smiling couple working from home, going over paperwork while sitting on the sofa The Secure 2.0 Act aims to help Americans save for retirement through new policy changes and government incentives, but one provision taking effect next year is working toward something more: narrowing the racial wealth gap. Section 101 of Secure 2.0 requires companies to automatically enroll eligible employees into 401(k) or 403(b) plans, starting after Dec. 31, 2024, citing auto-enrollment's effectiveness at boosting the participation rate in workplace retirement plans for Black, Latino, and lower-wage employees. Participating in a retirement plan through work may be one of the easiest ways to prepare for the future, but historically, participation has varied. A 2023 study by T. Rowe Price found that participation in an employer-sponsored retirement plan was highest for white people at 57.7% but lowest for Black people at 40.5% and Hispanic people at 31.9%. That auto-enrollment provision is well-intentioned, says Yemi Rose, but it needs to be part of a bigger solution. “I don't think anybody's surprised to say if we automatically enroll people that we're getting more enrollment,” says Rose, the Maplewood, New Jersey-based founder of OfColor, a startup that supports employees of color in building financial awareness. However, he says that getting enrolled and participating in a retirement plan in and of itself doesn't solve the hard, more pressing money issues. One driver of retirement inequality could be income inequality. According to the Federal Reserve 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances, white families had an average pre-tax income of $164,550 compared with $70,950 for Black families and $71,550 for Hispanic families. With less money to begin with, challenges such as inflation, higher interest rates and student loan repayments can put a lot of demand on the dollars coming in, says Greg Ward, a certified financial planner with Financial Finesse based in Charlotte, North Carolina. He says common financial priorities for communities of color also include providing for family at home or overseas, and saving for their children’s education. When there’s pressure to meet current financial obligations, skipping retirement savings or dipping into them might seem to offer relief, Ward says. A 2023 report by the Sloan School of Management at MIT found that Black employees were twice as likely as white workers to take an early withdrawal of at least $1,000 from their retirement savings. Hispanic workers were 21% more likely. Another Secure 2.0 provision, effective this year, removes tax penalties for some hardship withdrawals, but that’s sticky, too, said Hui-chin Chen, a certified financial planner and managing partner at Pavlov Financial Planning in Arlington, Virginia, in an email interview. “Flexibility to withdraw may be an incentive to contribute to retirement accounts,” she said. “However, having that flexibility doesn't mean you should exercise it when you don't need to. Investing for the long-term in retirement accounts is still recommended.” Beyond competing financial priorities, a lack of trust in institutions may also cause some to hesitate before participating in a retirement plan. Chen said that immigrants who have arrived in the U.S. as adults have less time to save for retirement, and they might be more hesitant to take advantage of a retirement system they do not understand. Rose also says lack of institutional trust can play a role in 401(k) participation rates. A worker might start a job expecting to see a certain amount in their paycheck, and when it’s less than they thought because of 401(k) deductions, they might get upset, he says. “It's a confirmation bias like, ‘Oh, my goodness, they're taking more money from me.’” Despite reservations about auto-enrollment, Rose says he still went to Capitol Hill to push for Secure 2.0 to be passed. “In one sense, yes, we have more people enrolled,” he says. “But at the same time, you might also start to see more distributions in the form of a hardship or a loan. So you really have to kind of solve it from both ends.” Part of that solution is raising financial awareness and literacy in communities of color, especially when it comes to preparing for retirement, he says. Jamia Erickson, a senior financial advisor at Thrivent, based in Rochester, Minnesota, suggested small steps for those who find it hard to save for retirement by taking advantage of compound interest. “I know it sounds cliche, but it works,” she said in an email interview. “Even if it’s $25 a month, start contributing to a retirement account.” And while Erickson said that people shouldn’t rely on legislation when it comes to their future, she does tell people to ask questions of financial advisors and to do their research. “Retirement planning is highly complex, so you shouldn’t feel like you have to know it all,” she said. “And because it’s such a major part of your life, asking questions will allow you to make more informed money decisions that ultimately help you achieve what you want in life.” More From NerdWallet June Sham writes for NerdWallet.

By observing the annual trend of stocks, it can help investors understand the long-term performance of stocks and predict future trends. So, how to correctly observe and analyze the annual stock line? This article will introduce it in detail from the following aspects. First, you need to understand the basic principles of stock trading. The stock market is full of volatility, and price increases and decreases are difficult to predict. Therefore, when operating stocks to sell, it is crucial to capture the right selling moment. Generally speaking, you can tell whether to sell by looking at a stock\'s profitability, market trends, and personal investment goals. Secondly, to execute the stock selling operation correctly, you need to choose the appropriate selling method. Currently, there are two common ways to sell stocks: market orders and limit orders. A market order means to sell a stock immediately at the current market price, while a limit order means to sell a stock at a specified price. Choosing the appropriate selling method can be determined based on your risk tolerance and profit goals. Before selling stocks, you should also understand related expenses such as stock costs and handling fees. Stock trading requires certain fees, including commissions, stamp duties and exchange fees. Understanding and considering these fees before selling can help you make more accurate investment decisions. In addition to the above basic operations, there are some things worth noting. The first is risk management. There are risks in the stock market, price fluctuations occur from time to time, and you may face the risk of losing money when selling stocks. Therefore, reasonable risk management is very important. You can effectively manage risks by setting stop loss points and controlling positions. The second is market analysis. Before selling stocks, you can better grasp the timing of selling by analyzing market trends and industry trends. Understanding relevant financial information, company profitability and various analysis reports can help you predict stock price trends more accurately. Finally, always stay calm and rational. The volatility of the stock market is uncontrollable, and emotional operations may occur. Therefore, when selling stocks, you must remain calm and rational, and do not blindly chase the rise or fall. It is recommended to formulate a clear investment strategy and strictly implement it. First of all, understanding the basic principles is the first step in learning to trade stocks. The volatility of the stock market makes it a high-risk area of investment. Therefore, investors need to understand the fundamentals of the stock market and how to make investment decisions. Understanding the liquidity and supply and demand of stocks is critical to choosing the right time to invest. Secondly, opening a securities account is one of the key steps for investors to start speculating in stocks. A securities account is a necessary tool for stock trading. Investors can open their own securities accounts through a broker or online trading platform. When choosing a broker or trading platform, investors should consider factors such as transaction fees, service quality, and trading tools. Third, before making any transactions, investors should develop a clear investment plan. The investment plan should include information such as the investor\'s goals, risk tolerance, and investment period. Developing a clear investment plan can help investors better manage risks and provide guidance for their investment decisions. Fourth, familiarity with the stock market and continuous learning are the keys for investors to improve themselves. The stock market is an ever-changing field, and investors need to keep abreast of market changes and constantly learn new investment strategies. Reading stock analysis reports, attending investor education classes, and networking with other investors are all great ways to expand your knowledge and understanding of the market. Fifth, controlling emotions and observing discipline are the keys for investors to avoid losses. Stock market volatility can cause investor sentiment to fluctuate, and irrational decisions can lead to losses. Therefore, investors should remain calm, abide by their investment plans, and strictly control risks. Finally, investors should pay attention to diversifying their investments and maintaining enough patience. Too much concentration in certain stocks can increase risk and put investors at a disadvantage. Investors should diversify their funds across different industries and stocks to reduce risks. In addition, stock investment is a long-term process, and investors should remain patient enough and not excessively pursue short-term gains. 1. What are pressure levels and support levels? Pressure levels and support levels are commonly used indicators in technical analysis. They represent important levels in the process of rising or falling stock prices. The pressure level refers to the resistance encountered when the stock price rises to a certain level, causing the stock to fall back; while the support level refers to the support encountered when the stock price falls to a certain level, causing the stock to rebound and rise. 2. How to determine the pressure level and support level? 1. Determined through historical price analysisBy observing the past price movements of stocks, some obvious pressure and support levels can be found. When a stock repeatedly rises to a certain level without a breakthrough, that level can be considered a pressure level; when a stock repeatedly falls to a certain level without a breakthrough, that level can be considered a support level. 2. Use technical analysis toolsIn addition to observing historical prices, you can also use technical analysis tools to determine pressure and support levels. Commonly used technical analysis tools include moving averages, trend lines, and volatility indicators. Through the analysis of these indicators, the pressure and support levels can be determined more accurately. 3. Interpretation method of pressure level and support level1. Pressure level: buy or sell signalWhen the stock price repeatedly rises to the pressure level , adjustments or reversals are likely to occur. If the pressure level is not broken, investors can choose to sell stocks at this level to protect realized profits. On the contrary, when the stock successfully breaks through the pressure level, it can be regarded as a buying signal and continues to be held or bought. 2. Support level: buy or sell signalWhen the stock price repeatedly falls to the support level, a rebound or reversal is likely to occur. If the support level is not broken, investors can choose to buy stocks at this level to obtain a better buying point. On the contrary, when the stock successfully breaks through the support level, it can be regarded as a sell signal and the loss can be stopped or sold in time. 4. Limitations and Risks of Technical AnalysisIt needs to be emphasized that technical analysis is not an absolutely accurate prediction tool, it is only an auxiliary tool for investment decision-making. In actual operations, investors also need to make comprehensive judgments based on fundamental analysis and market sentiment. At the same time, the stock market is highly risky, and investors should be risk aware and do a good job in risk control and fund management. First of all, to perform stock trading operations on a mobile phone, we need to download a professional stock trading software. There are many stock trading software on the market to choose from, such as the well-known ""China Merchants Securities"", ""Huatai Securities"", etc. After downloading and installing the software, we need to register an account and perform real-name authentication. This is to ensure that your trading process is safe and secure. Next, we need to recharge funds. Open the stock trading software, find the recharge entrance, and choose the appropriate recharge method according to the guidance of the software. At present, mobile payment is very convenient. You can choose Alipay, WeChat payment and other methods to recharge, and set a transaction password. In this way, your funds can be effectively protected when making transactions. After the recharge is completed, we need to learn basic stock knowledge. Investment is risky, so be cautious when entering the market. It is very important to understand the fundamentals and technical aspects of investment.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:10 pm The latest Biden-Scholz meeting comes almost two years since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will Friday hold talks in Washington with President Joe Biden focused on sustaining military support for war-torn Ukraine as a political impasse holds up a multi-billion-dollar US package. High on the agenda will also be escalating tensions in the Middle East, where Israel\'s war against Hamas is raging on and Washington has launched strikes on Iran-linked targets following attacks on American troops. The United States is Kyiv\'s biggest military backer, and Germany its second biggest, and the Biden-Scholz meeting comes almost two years since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. Along with other countries, Washington and Berlin have sent a vast array of weapons and other support to Kyiv. But the conflict has become bogged down and doubts are growing about further aid from Kyiv\'s Western backers, which would be a boost for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ahead of his departure for Washington Thursday, Scholz urged both the EU and US to step up efforts to provide aid to Ukraine. Ukraine\'s Western allies have to ""send a very clear signal to the Russian president -- that he cannot count on our support diminishing but that it will last long enough, and it will be big enough"", he said. In the United States, a White House request for some $60 billion in military aid for Kyiv has struggled to make it past the Senate. The package cleared the first hurdle on Thursday when US lawmakers voted to consider the bill, but opposition from right-wing allies of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump means final passage remains far from guaranteed. This stands in contrast to Europe, where EU leaders last week agreed 50 billion euros ($54 billion) of aid for Ukraine, overcoming months of opposition from Hungarian leader Viktor Orban. Scholz has voiced hope this can help Biden to push through the package in the US. In an editorial published in the Wall Street Journal before the trip, he warned a Russian victory in Ukraine would ""dramatically change the face of Europe"" and ""deal a severe blow to the liberal world order"". On his arrival in Washington Thursday, Scholz was set to dine with members of Congress, although a senior White House official insisted earlier this week there would be no pressure on him to ""deliver any particular message"". While the picture in Europe is more encouraging for Kyiv, there are also signs of growing fatigue as the war grinds on. The EU\'s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell admitted last week that the bloc would supply Ukraine with just over half of the one million artillery shells it promised to send by March. Accusations have been levelled at countries such as France, Italy and Spain that they are not pulling their weight, while even Germany has come under fire for refusing to provide long-range missiles sought by Kyiv. The Middle East will also be in focus at Friday\'s talks, where there is no sign of a let-up in Israel\'s four-month offensive in Gaza. Regional tensions were ratcheted up by the death of the American soldiers in Jordan at the end of January, marking the first US military losses to hostile fire in the region since the Israel-Hamas war broke out on October 7. Biden blamed Tehran-aligned groups, and Washington has launched deadly strikes on Iran-backed forces in Syria and Iraq. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also made his latest visit to the region this week, although he did not secure a pause in fighting. Germany has steadfastly backed Israel and its right to self-defence but has also repeatedly warned of the dangers of a wider regional conflict, while stepping up calls for more humanitarian aid to reach the war-ravaged Gaza Strip. burs-sr/mfp/sea/giv Originally published on doc.afp.com, part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange.

On the way to the airport: Indianapolis announces plans to throw its \'best response\' at city\'s multiple potholes As in-person work events regain popularity, the airport has seen an uptick in business travel. Nearly half of all air travel (46%) out of Indianapolis was for business, with leisure making up 52%. The remaining 2% represents a combination of both, which Wurster called ""bleisure."" With remote work more mainstream than ever, laptops and flip flops are sharing suitcase space. The biggest travel season in 2023 wasn\'t the winter holiday or spring break but fall break. The airport saw more than 950,000 passengers in October, while spring break travel fell just short of 900,000. Seven of the airport\'s busiest days ever came in October in 2023, though none toppled the deluge of travelers that arrived to the Circle City for Super Bowl XLVI in 2012. Despite the surge in fall break travel, Indianapolis\' two busiest days came Memorial Day Weekend. Time will tell whether the NBA All-Star game next week, the solar eclipse in April or the Taylor Swift concerts in November lead to even more flights this year. Unsurprisingly, Orlando and Las Vegas received plenty of flights from Indianapolis. An average of 714 people flew daily to Orlando, which has been the airport\'s most popular destination for as long as Wurster can remember. Denver came in second with 490 flights per day, though Wurster said Denver is a popular layover site. And Vegas, which will host this year\'s Super Bowl, remain a favorite at number three. NBA All-Star game: How much will the weekend benefit Indianapolis? Shortly before the pandemic, the airport launched a $76 million project to expand its parking garage with five additional stories providing 500 more public parking spots and 1,000 rental car spaces. The project, which Wurster said should finish this summer, will bring the garage to just under 6,000 public spots and more than 2,000 rental spaces. Later in the year, the airport expects to reopen its second runway, which has been under construction since 2022. With a $190 million budget, the project aims to refurbish the 30-year-old runway. It is expected to last 40 years. Even as the aviation industry ascends to heights it hasn\'t seen since 2019, obstacles remain. Wurster said the pandemic pushed many career pilots to take early retirement packages, forcing many airlines to ramp up recruiting efforts. Republic Airways\' LIFT Academy regularly pursues high schoolers, while the Federal Aviation Agency\'s ACE Academy recruits students as young as middle school in efforts to build enthusiasm about careers in aviation. Aircraft availability is also a challenge, with aircraft part orders often taking longer. Wurster said Indianapolis\' success may help draw such resources here. ""We\'re sort of in line and waiting at the top of the list with several airlines once they do have crew and aircraft,"" she said. ""We\'ve helped build that confidence so we can be on the top of the list as they roll out new markets."" The airport consults regularly with groups like Pacers Sports and Entertainment, VisitIndy, Indiana Sports Corp and more on pretty much every major event in Indianapolis. ""We know every day of the year what to expect,"" Wurster said. In 2024, seven of the eight airlines that operate in Indianapolis increased their flight and seating numbers through June. ""Airlines can bring more seat capacity into this market, and Hoosiers are going to fill those planes,"" Wurster said. Contact Bradley Hohulin at bhohulin@gannett.com.

Rainfall near a quarter of an inch. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:10 pm (RR Auction via SWNS) By Dean Murray via SWNS A wristwatch melted by the Hiroshima blast is up for auction. The timepiece was recovered by a British soldier frozen at the moment of detonation of the atomic bomb, according to Boston-based RR Auction. The artifact, retrieved from the ruins of the devastated city, offers a haunting glimpse into the human tragedy of the August 6, 1945 attack. The auctioneers have put an estimate of £16k ($20k) on the lot. (RR Auction via SWNS) RR Auction explains: ""According to the consignor, a British soldier recovered the wristwatch while on a mission to provide emergency supplies and survey post-conflict reconstruction requirements at the Prefectural Promotion Hall in Hiroshima. ""The soldier discovered the timepiece amidst the ruins, its poignant testimony preserved in its melted and scorched form. "" Despite the cloudiness of the crystal resulting from the blast, the small brass-tone watch\'s hands are unmistakably halted at 8:15 AM - the precise moment when the B-29 Enola Gay dropped the \'Little Boy\' atomic bomb. (RR Auction via SWNS) RR Auction says the anonymous consignor was moved by the 2023 film Oppenheimer to make the historical artifact available to the public. Bobby Livingston, Executive Vice President at RR Auction, says: ""Auctioning artifacts like these is not just about the items themselves; it\'s about preserving the stories they carry and ensuring that the lessons of history are not forgotten. ""This wristwatch, for instance, marks the exact moment in time that history changed forever."" The watch is offered as part of the Remarkable Rarities auction by RR Auction, which is set to conclude on 22 February. Originally published on talker.news, part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange.

The African National Congress party has lost its parliamentary majority in a historic election result that puts South Africa on a new political path for the first time since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule 30 years ago. With more than 99% of votes counted Saturday, the once-dominant ANC had received just over 40% of votes cast Wednesday, well short of the majority it had held since the famed all-race vote of 1994 that ended apartheid and brought it to power under Nelson Mandela.

Live Nation reveals data breach at its Ticketmaster subsidiary A jury in Idaho has unanimously agreed that convicted killer Chad Daybell deserves the death penalty for the gruesome murders of his wife and his girlfriend’s two youngest children. The decision ends a grim case that began in 2019 with a search for two missing children. The 55-year-old Daybell showed no emotion Saturday when learning he will face the death penalty for the murders of Tammy Daybell; 16-year-old Tylee Ryan; and 7-year-old Joshua “JJ” Vallow. Idaho law allows for execution by lethal injection or firing squad, though firing squad executions have never been used in the state. During a nearly two-month-long trial, prosecutors said Daybell promoted apocalyptic prophecies and tales of possession by evil spirits to justify the killings.

been bustling for decades. As these cities continue to expand and populations surge, the underlying infrastructure that supports our urban existence is increasingly coming under scrutiny. From crumbling bridges to outdated water systems, the impact of aging infrastructure on cities and their residents is far-reaching. It affects not only quality of life but also the economic prospects, environmental sustainability, and overall resilience of these urban areas. The pressing need to address this issue is becoming more evident as we witness the consequences of neglecting our aging infrastructure. This blog will delve into the multifaceted implications of this critical urban challenge. The economic repercussions of deteriorating infrastructure are significant. In many cases, the cost of maintaining and repairing outdated infrastructure often outweighs the initial investment needed for modernization. Infrastructure issues can cause delays in business operations that can hinder economic performance in a given area, as they lead to increased operational costs and reduced productivity. Moreover, the deterioration of infrastructure is progressive, meaning the economic effects will intensify if left unaddressed. The state of infrastructure directly influences public health. Aging water systems can lead to contamination, while poor road conditions can increase the risk of accidents. Moreover, inadequate health infrastructure, in which the US ranks 55th, can impede access to essential healthcare services. These challenges underscore the urgent need to invest in upgrading and maintaining our infrastructure to safeguard public health. Outdated urban infrastructure also poses serious environmental threats. Old water systems can lead to wastage of precious resources, while inefficient energy systems contribute to higher carbon emissions. It’s for this reason that many cities are looking into water main rehabilitation alternatives that reduce the impact of aging infrastructure on cities without causing further harm to the environment. Furthermore, the construction and maintenance activities associated with aging infrastructure can disrupt local ecosystems. Thus, modernizing infrastructure is not only an economic necessity but also an environmental imperative. Technological advancements offer promising solutions to the challenges posed by aging infrastructure. Digital technologies, for example, can improve the efficiency and reliability of infrastructure systems. They can also aid in preventive maintenance, thereby reducing the costs associated with repairs and replacements. Embracing such innovations is crucial for transforming our aging infrastructure into smart, sustainable, and resilient systems that can support the cities of the future.

Willard Kauffman, 63, was killed on impact when a 1999 Dodge Caravan struck his 2010 Chevy car shortly before 8 p.m., deputies said. He died of internal injuries throughout his body. Ashley Holt, 24, of Syracuse was driving the van eastbound on C.R. 200N when Kauffman stopped his car at the stop sign, then pulled his car northbound from C.R. 900W into the path of the van, police said. The van struck the car. Holt sustained head, neck and back injuries in the crash. One of her passengers, Matthew Landsaw, 32, of Fort Wayne, complained of back and neck pain after the crash. Noble County EMS transported Holt and Landsaw to Parkview Regional Medical Center, Fort Wayne. Parkview Regional staff said Holt and Landsaw were in good condition Tuesday morning. Another passenger in the van, Justin Quinn, 29, of Fort Wayne, was uninjured in the crash, deputies said. The van was registered to Quinn. Kauffman’s failure to yield right-of-way caused the collision, deputies said. Drugs and alcohol are not believed to have been factors in the crash. Damage to the vehicles was estimated at $10,001-$25,000. Assisting at the scene with EMS were the Sparta Township Fire Department, Noble County Coroner’s Office and Cromwell Town Marshal’s Office.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:18 pm Bill Maher has decided not to release his podcast episode with Kanye West because he does not want to give a platform to antisemitism. Maher revealed that he interviewed West on his podcast, Club Random with Bill Maher, hoping it would be a ""learning experience"" for him. ""I feel like he was helpful for spreading the fertilizer, and I do mean fertilizer, for this idea that Israel and the Jews are the worst people in the world. That’s why I wouldn’t air that episode because I’m not going to contribute to this,"" Maher explained. The comedian also believes that West is ""not the only one in America who feels that way."" In October 2022, West posted several antisemitic comments on social media, including a call for “death con 3 ON JEWISH PEOPLE.” He later apologized in Hebrew, saying, ""It was not my intention to hurt or disrespect and I deeply regret any pain I may have caused.” Subscribe today!

Rainfall near a quarter of an inch. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:09 pm Joseph Corcoran is seen going to his the first day of his trial in Fort Wayne in this Thursday May 20, 1999, file photo. A seven-woman and five-man Porter County jury was scheduled to hear opening arguments at 10 a.m. from Allen County Prosecutor Robert Gevers. The jury was selected in Porter County and brought to Allen County for the trial. Corcoran is charged with four counts of murder in the shooting deaths of his brother James, his sister’s fiance and two other men who he believed were talking about him behind his back. Corcoran has accepted responsibility for the killings. File photo by Andy Barrand FORT WAYNE (AP) — A former Hamilton man who has been on Indiana’s death row for 14 years for fatally shooting his brother and three other men has lost his latest appeal. A federal judge in South Bend denied Joseph Corcoran’s death sentence appeal last week, finding that Corcoran’s attorney failed to show that Indiana’s decisions to uphold the death penalty in his case were contrary to decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court. Corcoran’s attorneys said they plan to appeal. The case has been pending in federal court since 2005. “We think there are some issues still pending. We’ll see where we’re going to go from there,” said Alan Freedman with the Midwest Center for Justice in Evanston, Ill. Corcoran’s case has been reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court twice, a federal court twice and the Indiana Supreme Court five times. Corcoran, 37, was convicted in 1999 in the July 1997 shooting deaths of his 30-year-old brother, James Corcoran; Douglas A. Stillwell, 30; Robert Scott Turner, 32; and Timothy G. Bricker, 30. Turner was the fiance of Corcoran’s sister. His attorneys have said he was mentally ill. Corcoran told police that he shot the men with a semiautomatic rifle in the living room of the Fort Wayne home he shared with his brother and sister because he overheard them talking about him. Since his incarceration, it has been reported that Corcoran has bragged about fatally shooting his parents with a shotgun in Steuben County in April 1992 — a crime for which he was charged but acquitted by a jury. In that case, Corcoran was a sophomore at Hamilton Junior-Senior High School. He was accused of killing his parents, Jack and Kathryn Corcoran, then cleaning up and heading to school. The bodies were found by a daughter of the couple. After his acquittal in Steuben Circuit Court, Corcoran moved to Fort Wayne to live with family. In last week’s ruling, U.S. District Judge Jon DeGuilio found that the Indiana Supreme Court’s decision to uphold Gull’s order was not unreasonable and that Corcoran did not show that the trial court violated his federally secured rights, according to court documents. If Corcoran appeals the latest ruling to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, officials said the Indiana Attorney General’s office, which represents the state on appeals, will file a response.

The U.S.-Mexico border has been a flashpoint of contention between state and federal leaders ahead of the 2024 elections, with Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott erecting floating barriers of razor-wire to deter an influx of migrants trying to cross the Rio Grande. Dozens of migrants, men, women and children, have drowned seeking asylum in Texas. As late as mid-January, authorities pulled the bodies of Victerma de la Sancha Cerros, 33, her daughter, Yorlei Rubi, 10, and son, Jonathan Agustín, 8, out of the water after the Mexican family died trying to swim across the river near Eagle Pass. Politics: Republicans tried to impeach the Secretary of Homeland Security. Here\'s how Indiana voted On Tuesday, Braun posted to X that the bipartisan bill seeking a solution to the immigration crisis was ""dead in the water."" Dead in the water.https://t.co/BW1O3VPyf0 While the expression is a common enough phrase Washington lawmakers have used to describe unfavorable legislation, Braun\'s words were met with clapback from critics who appeared to find it in poor taste. It\'s not the first time the Indiana senator\'s words have stirred controversy. After an interview in May 2022, Braun had to walk back comments when he said the decision to allow interracial marriage should have been left to the states. IndyStar reached out to officials connected with Braun\'s current political campaign for more clarification, but received no further reply before this article\'s publication. Are you talking about immigrants or the immigration bill? It’s hard to read between the lines of you pro-life republicans. pic.twitter.com/xdAnIJ81NE This is a horrible choice of words considering what has happened in those waters. I hope this destroys your chances of becoming the next governor of my state and if it doesn\'t, shame on us, shame on Indiana. Not funny, Mike. pic.twitter.com/Pfrgrv2LoA Considering the recent drownings of women and children that comment is in extremely poor taste. This is flat out sick. People have died crossing this river. Hey @SenatorBraun two things: 1. Fire the intern who posted this for you. 2. Fire yourself for failing to do the job that Hoosiers sent you to DC to do, namely legislate. You went to the border twice to complain, now you refuse to solve the problem. Fraud! Thank you Senator!! Biden did away with “Remain in Mexico” by EO. He can do the same to reinstate it. Biden owns this MAJOR PROBLEM! He can wear his Ukraine tie and pin all he wants….NO MORE MONEY TO OTHER COUNTRIES!! America TAXPAYERS MONEY is for AMERICA! That’s great! Now evict Mitch McConnell Thank you senator, this bill doesn’t solve anything at the boarder and waste more money on Ukraine, Palestine, and Israel. As a Hoosier, THANK YOU! Thank you. You\'re going to be a great Governor 👍 Braun began serving the Indiana state legislature in 2014. He was first elected to the Senate after defeating incumbent Democrat Joe Donnelly in 2018, winning a divisive primary against two sitting congressmen at the time: Luke Messer and now current state Attorney General Todd Rokita.

WWE President Nick Khan stated that WWE would aid in the streaming of “Raw” once it moves to Netflix. Netflix has the option to extend the deal another 10 years if all goes well, but they also have the option to back out after the initial five years if things go south or not as they hoped. WWE also announced along with “Raw”, Netflix will be airing future documentaries, original series and other future projects on the platform. TKO Group CEO Ariel Emanuel claims that with the move of “Raw” and other products, the company does not plan on completely ditching television or cable networks, but the deal with Netflix is being looked at as the next step as streaming platforms are starting to become another option. Just like in 1993 when the show first aired, “Monday Night Raw” could be on its way to once again changing the landscape of how sports entertainment, or professional wrestling, is being watched on a weekly basis. The week was not entirely all celebrations and huge milestones for WWE and TKO Group however. Just three days later, Vince McMahon, the man who started it all for WWE, announced his resignation as TKO executive chairman and from the TKO board of directors following an ongoing lawsuit based on allegations of sexual assault and sex trafficking. The lawsuit against McMahon states Janel Grant, a former WWE employee, was allegedly forced into a sexual relationship with McMahon or else jeopardized losing her job. Additionally, the lawsuit hints at Grant being trafficked off to other employees within the company in order to secure deals with talent beginning in March 2020. Explicit content of Grant was also passed around to many employees in the company, and screenshots of text messages from McMahon asking for many sexual favors were also included in the lawsuit. McMahon forced Grant to sign a nondisclosure agreement in which McMahon agreed to pay her $3 million to keep the incidents private. Grant claims that she was only paid $1 million from the agreement and payments ceased thereafter. “I stand by my prior statement that Ms. Grant’s lawsuit is replete with lies, obscene made-up instances that never occurred, and is a vindictive distortion of the truth,” McMahon said in a statement. Khan made notice of the resignation to the company through an all-staff email. In July 2022, McMahon stepped down as WWE Chairman and CEO as a result of an investigation that looked into his acts of sexual misconduct with another former employee, and for paying off multiple women a total of $12 million in hush money. By November 2022, McMahon had repaid the money he took from the company and was back with WWE. As TKO Group and WWE continue to make big moves in its young endeavor together, WrestleMania season kicks off in its first McMahon-less era.

(AP) — Will Lester, a longtime reporter and editor for The Associated Press who played a critical role in the news organization’s 2000 election-night decision not to call the presidential race, died Wednesday. He was 71. According to his family, Lester died unexpectedly at his home in Maryland. Fellow AP employees held Lester’s good nature in equal measure of esteem with his dedication to covering the news. Executive Editor Julie Pace, who previously served as Washington bureau chief, said Lester “represented the best of AP,” calling him “a dedicated editor who cared deeply about his craft,” as well as “an incredibly kind person who treated everyone with respect and decency.” A native of Atlanta and a graduate of Emory University, Lester began his decades-long journalism career at The Lancaster News in Lancaster, South Carolina. After a stint at The Columbia Record, he moved to The Associated Press in 1982, serving as a reporter and news editor in the Columbia, South Carolina, office. After that came his time in AP’s Miami office, where Lester served as news editor before reporting on politics. It was that Florida political expertise that would come to serve both Lester and the AP invaluably after he joined the Washington bureau in the 1990s. Former Washington bureau chief Sandy Johnson recalled how Lester’s “critical voice” and in-depth knowledge of Florida politics helped steer AP through the murky waters of the 2000 presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore, as television networks made calls on who had won the state — and therefore the presidency — then retracted them as numbers flipped. “The AP vote count showed the margin between Bush and Al Gore in Florida getting closer — not wider as the network calls suggested. Millions of votes were still to be counted in Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and Broward counties,” Johnson said, noting Lester’s counsel that all three counties were Democratic strongholds, which helped inform AP’s decision not to call the state for Bush. “As AP held firm — and the vote count got closer and closer — the networks all retracted their calls,” Johnson said. Lester was part of the AP team that was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for work on that longest of election nights, an honor Johnson called “a fine legacy for a much-admired colleague.” Carole Feldman, news editor in Washington, recalled Lester hosting parties on the Chesapeake Bay for AP staff and their families, as well as his commitment to “keeping the Halloween pumpkin we kept on our editing desk filled with candy year round. He regarded the AP as his family, and he demonstrated that every day,” she said. “Will always had a sense of humor and, better still, perspective when all hell was breaking loose,” said Bruce Smith, a retired AP correspondent in South Carolina who recalled a time when an angry state senator confronted Lester after he had written an unfavorable story. “Will held up his tape recorder and told him something to the effect of ‘Senator, I have everything you said right here on tape,’ to which the senator sneered ‘Son, your tape — it lies!’” “Will always laughed about that one,” Smith added. Anna Johnson, AP’s Washington bureau chief, called him “an extremely kind and generous colleague who always had a nice word to say about the people he worked with.” Beyond his work covering the news, Lester was remembered for his dedication to supporting fellow journalists. Serving as a co-steward of the Washington shop for the union that represents AP journalists, Lester helped lead efforts to recruit new members and innovate ways to help keep employees engaged with negotiations. As tributes to him rolled in on social media, many colleagues shared a common refrain, “Will always had my back,” several said. “Will had all of our backs,” replied another. Lester also helped lead the awards program for the National Press Club, whose president Emily Wilkins said she was “always struck by his passion and dedication to recognizing and honoring the work of his peers.” Retired AP editor Merrill Hartson perhaps best encapsulated Lester’s multi-faceted talents and dogged sense for news: “When there was a Will, there was a way.” A private family ceremony will take place at a later date. ___ Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP Source: post Nobody covers Hancock County like the Daily Reporter. 22 W.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:09 pm Tim Mossholder Four in 10 small business owners believe 2024 will be a “make or break” year for their business, according to new research. The survey of 2,000 small business owners — half of whom work in tech or retail — revealed that 40% think this next year will be pivotal for their business. Respondents listed the economy, the upcoming election and declining sales as some of the reasons this year will be a “make or break” for their business, while others mentioned continuing supply chain issues and retaining good employees. But it’s not all “doom and gloom” for small business owners: 49% said their business performed better than anticipated in 2023, while only 21% said it was worse than anticipated. The survey also revealed that 71% are optimistic about the state of their business as we enter 2024 — but there’s a juxtaposition between the unexpected success of the past year and the perceived pivotal nature of the upcoming one. With that, a third of respondents (32%) are worried their business won’t survive through the end of 2024. Even if they’re not pinning all their hopes on this upcoming year, 38% are more worried about their business as they enter 2024, compared to 2023 — while only 26% are less worried. Conducted by Slack and commissioned by OnePoll, the survey delved into small business owners’ worries and looked at what respondents are doing to alleviate them. Top worries included inflation and economic conditions (47%), followed by the need to raise prices (32%) — and an increase in competition (24%). Respondents are also worried about needing to update their technology without the budget to do so (16%), and feeling like the tech they use for their business is outdated (14%). But small business owners aren’t sitting idly by as these worries mount: the survey revealed 74% of respondents are currently taking steps to help alleviate their concerns. This includes expanding marketing efforts to bring in new customers (51%), setting money aside for emergency use (45%) and exploring new technologies to increase productivity and efficiency (43%). A quarter (26%) of small business owners surveyed also implemented new technology in 2023 — with 41% of those implementing new productivity or collaboration technology. For those respondents, they believe these enhancements will help them better communicate with customers (70%) and internal teams (55%), share information across their teams (54%) and reduce the number of software tools their team uses (40%). “The state of small businesses in 2024 reflects a clear desire to maximize efficiency with limited resources,” said Jaime DeLanghe, Senior Principal, Product Management, Slack. “Regardless of what sector the business is in, productivity and collaboration tools can be a key driver of businesses’ growth and productivity.” Small business owners also worked to improve their business throughout 2023, and they ended last year with some positives. By the end of 2023, respondents earned new customers (47%), made a profit (30%) and implemented new technologies (26%). When asked what these new technologies were, respondents were most likely to have implemented technology for AI (50%), productivity or collaboration (41%) and communication (34%). And 75% believe the changes and improvements made to their business in 2023 will pay off throughout 2024. As we look ahead, 60% of small business owners expect to increase their budget this year, with 50% planning to allocate that budget toward technology and infrastructure. Results found that 35% are excited to implement new tech or update tech for their business in 2024 — and of those, they’re planning to implement new productivity and collaboration tools (49%), as well as other software tools (53%). “The insights from this research highlight the forward-looking aspirations of small businesses, showcasing their remarkable resilience and adaptability,” said DeLanghe. “By recognizing the evolving landscape of tools and productivity practices among these businesses, we gain a better understanding of their needs — particularly in the current economic climate — and how best to support them.” WHAT ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WORRIED ABOUT IN 2024? Survey methodology: This random double-opt-in survey of 2,000 small business owners (businesses with 2,000 or fewer employees) — including 1,000 tech and retail business owners — was commissioned by Slack between Dec. 22, 2023, and Jan. 8, 2024. It was conducted by market research company OnePoll, whose team members are members of the Market Research Society and have corporate membership to the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) and the European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research (ESOMAR).
