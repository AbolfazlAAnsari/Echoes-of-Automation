Save A source close to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumerâ\x80\x99s Office says New York City is expected to receive a substantial portion of the new federal aid being set aside for the migrant crisis. The new pot of FEMA grant money, expected to total about $800 million, will be part of a larger omnibus bill likely to be voted on by Congress before the end of the year, the source says. It comes as the Supreme Court decided that Title 42, a Trump-era administration policy that allowed border agents to expel migrants seeking asylum due to the COVID-19 pandemic, should stay in place â\x80\x94 at least for now. It was set to end Wednesday. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is asking the Biden administration to respond to the court's move by 5 p.m. Tuesday. Over 31,000 asylum seekers have already come to the city, with more than 21,000 in the shelter system, officials said this week. The city has opened 60 emergency shelters, four humanitarian relief centers and two welcome centers. Mayor Eric Adams has said that without Title 42, buses carrying migrants from the southern border are expected to begin arriving again to New York City, with about 1,000 asylum seekers coming per week. Adams administration officials have estimated the migrant crisis will cost the city about $1 billion. In a since-deleted tweet Tuesday afternoon, Adams said the city was â\x80\x9cencouraged by the news of hundreds of millions in funding for asylum seekers,â\x80\x9d but also called for â\x80\x9ca real border strategy.â\x80\x9d â\x80\x9cWe canâ\x80\x99t be forced to choose between services for New Yorkers and supporting asylum seekers,â\x80\x9d he wrote. A tweet the mayor posted after deleting his first tweet did not mention the situation at the southern border. Thank you to @SenSchumer, @RepJeffries and our New York City delegation for fighting for our cityâ\x80\x99s fair share of funding for asylum seekers. This work hasnâ\x80\x99t been easy, and thereâ\x80\x99s more to do, but every bit helps address this crisis. â\x80\x9cThis work hasnâ\x80\x99t been easy, and thereâ\x80\x99s more to do, but every bit helps address this crisis,â\x80\x9d he tweeted.""}]"

Save America\'s employers slowed their hiring in August in the face of rising interest rates, high inflation and sluggish consumer spending, all of which have weakened the outlook for the economy. The government reported Friday that the economy added 315,000 jobs last month, down from 526,000 in July and below the average gain of the previous three months. The unemployment rate rose to 3.7%, from a half-century low of 3.5% in July, as more Americans came off the sidelines to look for jobs and didn\'t find work immediately. President Joe Biden celebrated the jobs report at an event on Friday, declaring that ""the great American jobs machine continues to come back."" ""In America workers are back to work, earning more, manufacturing more, building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out,"" Biden said. ""With today\'s news, we have now created nearly 10 million new jobs since I took office,"" calling it ""the fastest growth in all American history."" Biden also celebrated the increased labor force participation rate, specifically cheering that ""working-age women are now, for the first time, back at work at rates not seen since before the pandemic."" The president hailed other recent promising economic news, including the fact that signs are showing inflation continuing to ease, increased wages, record-low unemployment, falling gas prices and announcements about major domestic investments from companies like Micron, Corning and Toyota. ""None of this is happening by accident,"" Biden said. ""These investments in this recovery are a direct result of my economic plan. Some people gave up on American manufacturing, not me, not the [Commerce] Secretary, not the American people. \'Make it in America\' is no longer just a slogan. It\'s reality in my administration."" The smaller August gain will likely be welcomedby the Federal Reserve. The Fed is rapidly raising interest rates to try to cool hiring and wage growth, which have been consistently strong. Businesses typically pass the cost of higher wages on to their customers through higher prices, thereby fueling inflation. Fed officials hope that by raising borrowing costs across the economy, they can reduce inflation from a near-40-year high. Some economists fear, though, that the Fed is tightening credit so aggressively that it will eventually tip the economy into recession. Job openings remain high and the pace of layoffs low, indicating that most businesses still want to hire and that the economy isn\'t likely in, or even close to, a recession. The broadest measure of the economy\'s output â\x80\x94 gross domestic product â\x80\x94 has shrunk for two straight quarters, meeting one informal definition of a recession. Most economists, though, don\'t think a recession will have begun until the unemployment rate has risen steadily. In an interview with Spectrum News, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh also downplayed fears of a recession, pointing to the robust job growth under President Biden. ""The job report was a great one,"" he told Spectrum News. ""The unemployment rate going up [to] 3.7%, I\'m not concerned about that, because what we saw was more people enter the workforce. ""The reason why that number went up is because we had more workers that were kind of not working or not looking for work now looking for work."" ""What we really want to do over the next four or five months is see more people coming into the workforce,"" Walsh continued. ""Even if that means the unemployment rate going up, it\'s okay, because we have 11 million job openings in the country. We want to get more people into the workforce to fill those jobs that are open."" Walsh went on to say that there are about 5 to 6 million Americans who can still enter the workforce, and added that immigration reform is a key to getting some of those 11 million positions filled. ""Thatâ\x80\x99s the single-biggest threat in my opinion to the economy, not having enough workers to fill the jobs,"" Walsh said in an interview with Spectrum News. But experts say when it comes to recession fears, thereâ\x80\x99s more to consider than the unemployment rate. Dr. Victor Claar, an associate professor of economics at Florida Gulf Coast University, told Spectrum News that the unemployment rate almost always changes later than GDP. ""If you\'re looking only at the unemployment rate as your indicator of whether we\'re in a recession or not, you may look to see that number too late,"" Dr. Claar said. ""What you need to be paying more attention to and what we see first is GDP."" Worries about a forthcoming recession have grown after Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in a high-profile speech last week, made clear that to curb inflation, the Fed was prepared to continue raising short-term interest rates for the foreseeable future and to keep them elevated. Powell warned that the Fed\'s inflation fight would likely cause pain for Americans in the form of a weaker economy and job losses. The Fed chair also said the job market is ""clearly out of balance,"" with demand for workers ""substantially exceeding"" the available supply. Friday\'s jobs figures and a report earlier this week that the number of job openings rose in July after three months of declines, suggested that the Fed\'s rate hikes so far haven\'t restored any such balance. There are roughly two advertised job openings for every unemployed worker. The central bank has raised its short-term rate to a range of 2.25% to 2.5% this year, after the fastest series of increases since it began using its short-term rate to influence the economy in the early 1990s. It has projected that its key rate will reach a range of 3.25% to 3.5% by year\'s end. Those rate hikes have made borrowing and spending steadily more expensive for individuals and businesses. The housing market, in particular, has been weakened by higher loan rates. The jobs figures are helping fill out the economic backdrop as this fall\'s congressional elections intensify. Republicans have pointed to high inflation to try to pummel Democrats in midterm campaigns. The Biden administration has pushed back and claimed credit for a robust pace of job growth. Wages are rising at their fastest pace in decades as employers scramble to fill jobs at a time when fewer Americans are working or seeking work in the aftermath of the pandemic. Average hourly pay jumped 5.2% in July from a year earlier. Still, that was less than the 5.6% year-over-year in March, which was the largest annual increase in 15 years of records outside of the spring of 2020, when the pandemic struck. Some skeptics warn that the Fed may be focusing excessively on the strength of the job market when other indicators indicate that the economy is noticeably weakening. Consumer spending, for example, and manufacturing have slowed. The central bank might raise rates too far as a result, to the point where it causes a deeper recession than might be needed to conquer inflation. The economic picture is highly uncertain, with the healthy pace of hiring and low unemployment at odds with the government\'s estimate that the economy shrank in the first six months of this year, which is one informal definition of a recession. Yet a related measure of the economy\'s growth, which focuses on incomes, shows that it is still expanding, if at a weak pace. So far, the Fed\'s rate hikes have severely dented the housing market. With the average rate on a 30-year mortgage reaching 5.66% last week â\x80\x94 double the level of a year ago â\x80\x94 sales of existing homes have fallen for six straight months. Consumers have moderated their spending in the face of much higher prices, though they spent more in July even after adjusting for inflation. But companies\' investment in new equipment has slowed, indicating they have an increasingly cautious outlook on the economy.'}]"

(WSVN) - After an eight-hour standoff between a man and SWAT personnel at an apartment complex, the suspect accused of threatening his family peacefully surrendered. Fire rescue units that responded to the scene, placed the suspect on a stretcher and took him to an area hospital to be evaluated. Police officers arrived to the scene at an apartment complex in Coconut Creek, Wednesday morning, after they received a call about a domestic dispute. The call came in just after 2:30 a.m., after a man threatened his family with a gun at the Carrington Apartments on the 4800 block of North State Road 7. “The officers received a call about a domestic dispute in one of the apartments back here. There was some information coming in that there was a gun displayed,” said Coconut Creek Police Public Safety Information Officer Scotty Leamon. Family members left the building, but the man remained inside. “The family members that were with the suspect, were able to leave the apartment,” Leamon said. Events of the situation led to a SWAT standoff as they attempted to convince the man to exit the home and get the help he needs. The entrance of the apartment complex was blocked off, as several officers surrounded the front entrance of the property. Several neighboring apartment units were also evacuated as a precaution. “If it does go the way we don’t want it to, then that way there are no neighbors nearby, and also, if we have to use any gas or anything like that,” Leamon said. A heavy artillery SWAT vehicle was also sighted driving into the apartment complex. Police said the suspect’s friends and family helped to talk the suspect into surrendering. “Friends and family, we had come here to help us in order to kind of get through to him that he needs to get out,” Leamon said. According to police, a gun was recovered from inside the apartment. The suspect has not been identified, and it is unclear if he will face any charges. Copyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.
