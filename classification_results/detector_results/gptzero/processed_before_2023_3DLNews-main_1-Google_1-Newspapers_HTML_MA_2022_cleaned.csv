staid world of television news into the series of political shoutfests we know and love-hate today. More than a quarter-century after its founding, however, the question persists: Does watching Fox News actually change voters’ minds?It’s worth noting that, in a famous study published 15 years ago, economists showed that exposure to Fox could have a measurable impact on elections. Comparing markets that had received Fox to those where it was not yet available, the study concluded that the presence of Fox News was good for a Republican gain of 0.4 to 0.7 percentage points between the 1996 and 2000 elections.

But now, Russian President Vladimir Putin has begun raising the prospect that he might use nuclear arms – albeit smaller-scale, tactical battlefield weapons – to defend Russian-held territory in Ukraine. And North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has shown signs of shifting his nuclear doctrine away from “no first use.” Since the bombing of Nagasaki, the world has resolutely avoided the use of nuclear weapons. How can that proscription be preserved amid current world tensions? This, against the background of a halt to landmark arms control treaties, and a shift among some military planners toward the use of small nuclear devices as a shock weapon in an “escalate to de-escalate” strategy. That would take the world into unknown territory. Until now, the nuclear powers have used their weapons for their deterrence power. Mr. Putin is threatening to use them as a tool of coercion. That is a rude awakening from three decades of post-Cold War complacency encouraged by declining fears that big-power nuclear confrontation could subject the world to a fearsome “nuclear winter.” “Nuclear weapons never went away,” says Heather Williams, an expert at a Washington think tank. “The public just forgot about them.” First, Vladimir Putin raised the prospect of using nuclear weapons to further his aims in the war in Ukraine. Then North Korea’s Kim Jong Un followed suit, announcing his field inspection of tactical nuclear weapons units. That seemed to confirm a change in nuclear weapons strategy Mr. Kim had hinted at earlier this year – from “no first use” to foreseeing the use of battlefield tactical nuclear weapons. To many experts, the sudden crescendo in talk of nuclear weapons suggests an epochal shift in perception of the use of nuclear arms from unthinkable – remember Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev declaring in 1985 that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought” – to possible. Since the bombing of Nagasaki, the world has resolutely avoided the use of nuclear weapons. How can that proscription be preserved amid current world tensions? “We are on the cusp of a third nuclear age that puts us in uncharted waters,” says David Cooper, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in Washington and a former director of nonproliferation policy at the Pentagon. After the Cold War era of nuclear competition between two superpowers, and then the post-Cold-War years of rising nuclear threats from regional powers, the world is back to great-power nuclear competition – with China added to the mix this time around, Dr. Cooper says. Also dangerously characteristic of this third era: vanishing international cooperation on nuclear disarmament, and the destabilizing weakness of one of the nuclear powers, Russia. Mr. Putin’s threats suggest that this new era has the potential for a creeping normalization of nuclear weapons’ use, some experts say – and for increased recourse to nuclear blackmail by countries like Russia (or North Korea) facing adversaries with significant conventional military advantages. Moreover, the burgeoning public discussion of nuclear arms use and behind-closed-doors plotting of their place in battlefield scenarios suggest to others that the use of nuclear weapons is no longer necessarily seen as a moral issue. “We have had this idea of a moral taboo” on using nuclear weapons, Dr. Cooper says. Under what he calls the “optimistic scenario” for today, that taboo is still operative, he says. But “if the genie is out,” he adds, “we are back in a very dangerous nuclear landscape.” Yet despite these disquieting trends, the eight-decade-long proscription against nuclear weapons use has not been breached. While that offers hope, some say, it also adds urgency to diplomatic efforts to convince Mr. Putin and others not to cross the line. President Putin “is not the only nuclear bully on the playground,” says Heather Williams, a nuclear weapons experts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “Nonetheless it is Putin who is leading the way in threatening to break a taboo that has held for 77 years. What has not changed is that any nuclear use is a game changer and has strategic consequences,” she adds. “That is the reality the U.S. and NATO and the West have to continue to message to Putin and anyone else,” such as North Korea and Iran. The creeping normalization of the use of low-yield or so-called tactical nuclear weapons – even if still only rhetorical – results from a number of factors, nuclear arms experts say. They include nuclear superpowers’ retreat from landmark arms control treaties and nuclear diplomacy, the unchecked proliferation of nukes in North Korea, and a shift among some military planners toward thinking of tactical nuclear explosives as a shock weapon useful to an “escalate to de-escalate” strategy. Tactical nuclear weapons are smaller devices that can be fitted on shorter-range missiles, or even fired from the back of a pickup truck, deployed to annihilate an advancing military unit, for example, or destroy a few city blocks (rather than entire cities, targets for strategic nuclear weapons). Such weapons would still entail the threat of drifting radioactive clouds and long-term environmental impacts. Another reason that Mr. Putin is threatening to use nuclear weapons may simply be that the Ukraine war has put on display the Russian military’s failures in conducting conventional warfare and its lack of high-tech, state-of-the-art weaponry, some say. “When you are Russia, or for that matter when you are North Korea, your ability to fight the new generation of warfare … does not compare to South Korea, the U.S., or NATO,” says Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center in Arlington, Virginia. “And so what do you do? You jump to what you can do, which is to threaten using nuclear weaponry to achieve your objectives,” he says. That would take the world into unknown territory, and new ways of using nuclear weapons. For decades, a hallmark of major powers’ nuclear policy has been deterrence. Now, Mr. Putin is using nukes as a tool of “coercion” to prompt desired responses from others, says Dr. Cooper, whose most recent book is “Arms Control for the Third Nuclear Age.” The Russian president, he says, is warning the West that although “right now I’m sticking to lower-level stuff in Ukraine … you’d better not try to stop me or this will go to a nuclear level.” “He’s betting he can backstop his conventional [warfare] problems in Ukraine with the nuclear threat, and he may be right,” Dr. Cooper adds. “We’re clearly in uncharted waters where our deterrence capabilities are""}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 8:31 pm NEWBURYPORT — The owner of a Salem indoor sports training facility admitted in court Monday that her business is not following a temporary vaccination requirement that took effect in that city earlier this month. The acknowledgement by Loren Weed, the owner of The Grind Factory on Mason Street, came during a hearing on her request for an injunction that would stop Salem from enforcing the requirement, which her attorney, Carmine Lepore, called “unconstitutional.” Newburyport Superior Court Judge Kathleen McCarthy-Neyman conducted a hearing on the request via Zoom, and was the first to raise the issue, after Lepore told the judge that enforcement “is certainly going to create a problem” with staff and customers. Lepore said if forced to comply with the vaccination requirement, many parents of young baseball and softball players would ask for refunds and move to a new facility in another community for winter practice, and Weed would not be able to pay her employees, some of whom she may also lose. That, he argued, created undue and irreparable economic harm to his client. When the judge pressed him on the impact of the mandate during the week or so it has been in effect, Lepore acknowledged that it had not been strictly enforced by the business. “Has The Grind Factory not been following the mandate?” the judge asked. “We believe the mandate is unconstitutional and that’s why we’ve held off,” Lepore responded. Moments later, after Lepore had Weed testify on the economic impact to her business, Salem City Solicitor Beth Rennard put the question directly to her. “Has The Grind Factory been checking for vaccination?” Rennard asked Weed. “No, we have not,” Weed responded. Salem’s Board of Health voted last month to enact the temporary requirement, which took effect Jan. 15, in light of rising COVID-19 case counts and demand on hospitals. Businesses that do not comply will receive a verbal warning, followed by escalating penalties for further violations. Two days before it was set to go into effect, Weed filed suit, accusing the city of violating the due process rights of business owners like herself. Lepore, in the complaint he filed on behalf of Weed and her business, said other businesses in Salem do not face a similar requirement, violating his client’s rights to equal protection under the law. “They specifically exclude a host of businesses,” as well as other community settings like houses of worship or schools,” Lepore argued. Rennard, meanwhile, defended the order, calling it a rational response to a public health emergency – and one that is completely constitutional. “I feel very comfortable that we were well within our authority based on the public health emergency,” Rennard said. In her written response to the lawsuit, Rennard said courts have upheld similar requirements for more than a century, pointing to a 1905 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that upheld the prosecution of a Cambridge man who refused to be vaccinated for smallpox, and more recent rulings upholding other temporary requirements imposed by Gov. Charlie Baker and others. In response to a series of questions from the judge, Rennard also pushed back on arguments that the order unfairly singled out fitness facilities, bars and restaurants and entertainment venues, saying that other businesses, such as supermarkets or barbershops, are facing a mask requirement. Beyond that, Rennard argued Monday, The Grind Factory cannot show that it would suffer irreparable economic harm — one of the factors the judge must find in deciding whether to grant the request for an injunction. Rennard said any “speculative” financial impact on the business is outweighed by the public interest in reducing the spread of COVID-19 and preventing hospitals from becoming overburdened. Lepore, meanwhile, questioned the science behind the decision, and argued that just last week the state’s Department of Public Health acknowledged that 49% of people diagnosed with COVID-19 in Massachusetts hospitals had been admitted for another cause and tested positive for the virus “incidentally.” The order is temporary, and is set to be revisited March 8, she told the judge, just before being interrupted for a second time by one of the more than 170 people listening to the hearing via Zoom. “Enough is enough and it’s time for a change,” the man called out before being admonished by McCarthy-Neyman. “Sir, there has to be decorum,” the judge warned. The man then proceeded to interrupt the judge before being electronically ejected. McCarthy-Neyman did not immediately rule on the request for the injunction. Only a court clerk and other staff were in Newburyport Superior Court during the hearing; the judge, Lepore and Rennard all appeared from other locations. Just outside the historic High Street courthouse, about 30 people who were protesting what they described as government overreach held signs and encouraged drivers to honk their horns as they drove past. Jessica Locke of Salem said she was there to show support for The Grind Factory and alert Salem officials that she and other protesters did not approve of the mandate. “They need to know people are paying attention and do care,” Locke said, adding that the protest was not about being opposed to COVID-19 vaccinations. “We believe in medical freedom,” she said. Mark Burns, another Salem resident, called the mandate part of a “slippery slope” that chips away at individual freedoms. “It’s about your rights, it’s America,” Burns said. Burns added that despite being vaccinated, he contracted COVID-19 and no longer trusts medical experts and city officials in regard to the facts. “The city is lying. It isn’t about the science,” Burns said.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 8:53 pm BOSTON — The number of weapons seized by police under the state’s “red flag” law has plummeted in recent years, as gun control advocates call for a new campaign to promote the protections in the wake of mass shootings across the country. The law was used to confiscate firearms belonging to eight people last year, one less than in 2020 and a decline of more than 50% from 2019, when 19 so-called “extreme risk protection orders” were issued, according to the state Trial Court. In all, there have been 48 extreme risk petitions filed under the 2018 state law, which was passed in the wake of previous school shootings nationally. The statute allows police, friends or relatives of a legal gun owner to seek an order if they believe that person poses a risk to themselves or others. The order gives police authority to temporarily confiscate someone’s firearms and ammunition. Gun control advocates are concerned that the number of petitions under the law lags behind other states that have similar laws on the books. To be sure, courthouses were closed to the public in March 2020 and remained closed throughout much of 2021, due to public health precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which likely deterred some people from filing requests. Local police chiefs also have the authority to seek a court order to temporarily confiscate weapons belonging to someone undergoing a mental health crisis. But advocates say many people don’t know about the new law, which is likely a major factor. “This is a law that can save lives, when it’s utilized,” Angus McQuilken, a longtime gun control advocate and co-founder of the Massachusetts Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence. “But people can only make use of this tool if they know about it.” He said advocates have been urging the state Department of Public Health to launch a public awareness campaign promoting the law, but haven’t been successful. “Publicity and awareness of this law needs to be a priority, similar to other public health campaigns,” McQuilken said. Similar to the process for a violence prevention order, those asking for an order under the “red flag” law must show evidence someone intends to harm themselves or others. Individuals subject to an order can appeal. Someone who seeks an order based on false information or to harass a gun owner can face fines from $2,500 to $5,000, and up to 2-1/2 years in jail. The Trial Court’s data shows that none of the requests filed to date have been deemed fraudulent. Critics say the law lacks due process and threatens Second Amendment rights in a state with some of the toughest gun control laws in the nation. They say it also doesn’t provide any extra mental health resources to prevent suicides by gun. In Congress, lawmakers are considering a similar law in response to the wave of mass shootings in recent weeks, including a massacre at a Texas elementary school where an 18 year-old armed with an AR-15 rifle killed 19 students and two adults. On Thursday, the House passed a “red flag” law that would authorize federal courts to issue extreme risk protection orders. It would allow family members to request a federal court order that would block access to firearms for someone who is determined a danger to themselves or others by the court. The measure is part of House Democrats’ push on gun control following recent mass shootings, including universal background checks for firearm purchases and raising the legal age to buy certain semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21.

Low 53F. Winds SSE at 5 to 10 mph.. Mostly clear. Low 53F. Winds SSE at 5 to 10 mph. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 8:39 pm Baron Hugo Gazebo gives a New England charm to the Town Hall green. (Photo by Elaine Cushman Carroll) We begin with facts. The great resignation isn't only happening in regular employment. Local politicians are following the trend. Both Melinda Collins and Katie Conlon began the new year by announcing they would not be seeking re-election. Both women have worked incredibly hard for the town. Especially in the time of COVID, they have brought amazing energy to the community throughout this crisis. We thank them for their energy and devotion. And we hope they remain willing to help guide the town. Looking into the clouds that swirl in the crystal ball in our office at 372 Granite Ave., we can see that the time of school closings and widespread shutdowns is over. The reason those closures are not likely in 2022 is not that COVID-19 and its variants will be eradicated (although our prayers and hopes align in that direction). The reason schools will stay open and businesses muddle on is that most people have developed coping mechanisms to avoid needless risks with the disease. Some of us spent hours on computers in 2021 to line up vaccination appointments. Others waited until they were told their continued employment depended upon proof of vaccination. And we all realize handshakes are no longer the politically correct thing to do. Many of us carry hand sanitizer wherever we go. Most of us have an assortment of masks. We are also predicting that someone will finally add up the town’s legal budget and realize it would cost less to provide access to documents than to have town counsel handle so many of the requests. We predict the Planning Board Members will spend more time at public meetings this year than the Warrant Committee, the Select Board and the Board of Health all together. We predict they will find even more applications for 40B projects this year. We predict the local economy will continue to improve. The new businesses that opened during the pandemic will take hold in our community. Curious people will venture out and start shopping local once again. We also predict the cost of a subscription to the Milton Times will continue to rise as the newspaper’s old business model moves from an advertising based product to one surviving on reader revenue. The community’s housing stock will gain even more value as young families lead the way and many longtime residents find opportunities to move into towns more affordable for the fixed-income generation. Going way out on a limb here, but we are predicting the town will actually start construction on the animal shelter. We are also predicting that the East Milton Deck will continue to look as if a bomb hit it. (No limb involved there.) – Pat Desmond Editor and publisher Log In Keep it Clean.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 8:26 pm WOBURN - Various local officials recently described the months-long debate over whether to end Woburn’s ban on retail marijuana stores as an exhausting affair that left them awake at night with worry. During the latest City Council meeting, Mayor Scott Galvin’s push to sanction recreational pot sales via a zoning amendment easily sailed through in a 7-to-2 vote. But prior to rendering a decision of the legislative package, councilor after councilor described their internal deliberations over the issue as anything but easy. “I’ve been on the council for a long time and we’ve had some really, really difficult cases. But this is the hardest vote I’ve ever taken,” said Ward 5 Councilor Darlene Mercer-Bruen, who choked back tears while elaborating on her reasons for supporting the proposal. Perhaps one of the most telling exchanges of the night occurred between Ward 2 Councilor Richard Gately and Ward 3’s Jeffrey Dillon. As previously reported by the Daily Times Chronicle, Gately this spring emerged as an early opponent of the legislation, which will allow up to two marijuana dispensaries to open up for business within the IP2 zoning district off of Commerce Way. Ward 1 Alderman Joanne Campbell was the second dissenter in the recent vote. Last week, the South End resident told his colleagues his position on the issue has only become more entrenched as his own family became the latest casualty in the drug epidemic with the recent death of his son, James ‘Jimmy’ Gately. In gut-wrenching testimony, the council’s senior member lamented he had “failed” his own child by being unable to keep him away from drugs, but he vowed to do his part for all the rest of Woburn’s families by voting against the zoning change. “I buried my son in July and he was addicted to marijuana. He started off with marijuana and then went to something else and to something else and then back to marijuana. The night he died, he was smoking marijuana. It was laced with amphetamine and it killed him,” the grieving father recounted. “I always thought the bones of this city were so good because all of our hardworking people didn’t want to see children getting into marijuana and drugs and alcohol,” the Ward 2 councilor continued. “We did our best to keep him away from it, but I failed I guess, and it cost us our son. Injected, ingested, or inhaled, it still drugs. Marijuana is a drug, no matter how you spell it out…And bringing recreational marijuana into this city, it’s a big mistake.” Moments later, Dillon, who professed his admiration and respect for the veteran city councilor, would respond to Gately by explaining a near identical rationale for supporting retail marijuana sales. Referencing the sudden passing of his own son, former Malden Police Officer Shawn Dillon, the Ward 3 councilor told Gately that his vote too was based on preventing other parents from having to endure the heartache of losing a child. But rather than unwittingly encouraging street sales of the drug, Dillon aims to reduce unnecessary overdoses by providing those who choose to use pot with a safe and unadulterated source of the drug. “You and I are in the same club in that we both lost our sons within the same 24-hour period. I have great respect for you and always look to you for direction,” said Dillon. “On this particular case though, I have to go against your thoughts. If your a student of history, you look back to prohibition, when people regularly died from bad alcohol,” he continued. “People still die [from alcohol] now, but that’s because of abuse and not because it’s poisoned….This is about trying to protect the future of Woburn. I’m hoping and praying that with regulation and oversight, that by next August they’ll be fewer [drug overdoses here].” Citing comments made by Woburn Police Chief Robert Rufo, who said the state regulates the marijuana industry from “seed to sale” to ensure an unadulterated supply, City Councilors like Mercer-Bruen and Ward 6’s Lou DiMambro shared Dillon’s belief that retail sales would undercut the illicit drug trade in the community. A gateway drug? Not debating the notion that a regulated cannabis industry provides a safer source of marijuana, various members of the general public in recent months have insisted that even safe pot can set-off a catastrophic chain reaction by introducing future addicts to the world of drugs. According to Crawford Drive resident Brian Bilowz, by making legal marijuana more readily available, city officials could very well be leaving teens and adults with the impression that the drug itself is safe. “Long kids are impressionable. Marijuana is an easy way to get into drug use and we need to consider the young people and what impression we’ll be leaving with them [by okaying retail sales].

Loves Lane resident Emily Crowley echoed those fears and argued the cannabis industry is already marketing towards younger customers through some of its edible product lines. “The cannabis industry is very lucrative and trying to get to our children. Why else would they be putting marijuana and lollipops and gummy bears?” she said. At least two council members, Ward 4’s Joseph Demers and Ward 7’s Charles Viola, challenged the assertion that marijuana is a potent “gateway drug”. Referencing the ongoing opioid epidemic, Viola, a corrections officer, told his colleagues that he had spoken to quite a few inmates incarcerated for drug offenses and learned that most of them actually became addicted to drugs after abusing prescription medications. “Of all the incarcerated individuals I spoke to, 80 percent of them didn’t use marijuana as a gateway drug. Most started abusing opioids that were prescribed to them by a doctor,” said Viola. Also employed within the state’s criminal justice system, Demers opined that based upon his research, marijuana was less likely than alcohol to be abused to the point of addiction. He also argued that there is little evidence that legalizing marijuana is resulting in any type of increase in drug use or drug-related crimes like impaired driving within surrounding cities and towns. I find [alcohol] to be one of the more potent gateway drugs. I know we all know people who have made bad decisions after drinking, but I don’t see anyone showing up to argue against the issuance of new liquor licenses,” he said. “It’s a misnomer argument that it will become refer madness in Woburn by their being a marijuana store in the city.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 8:57 pm WILMINGTON — Wil\xadmington Public Schools’ Transportation Coordina\xadtor Lisa Faretra provided updates for proposed school start time changes to the School Committee at their most recent meeting. Pen\xadding School Committee ap\xadproval, the changes could be instituted as ear\xadly as the 2023-2024 school year. Superintendent Dr. Glenn Brand introduced the to\xadpic by explaining that the initiative initially resulted in options that couldn’t be supported, so the committee asked for further consideration to be made. He also named some of the challenges of this work be\xading the number of schools, not knowing the bus ridership, the new school to be built, and the cost of ad\xadding more buses. “I can tell you as a committee that the idea of adding to our transportation budget as we prepare for a very challenging year does not seem to be in any way a possibility,” he said. One change already in motion for next year that he mentioned is that school days are being ex\xadtended to add more in\xadstructional time. The elementary level school days will go on an additional 15 minutes and secondary levels another five minutes. Faretra referenced the premise proven by re\xadsearch that secondary edu\xadcation should start be\xadtween 8 and 8:30 a.m. After deciding on 8 a.m. as the earliest start time for middle and high school, she built the rest of the proposed plans from there. The next thought for planning involved allowing enough time for the north side of town’s bus routes between the Wildwood, Woburn Street, and the North Intermediate schools. The plan she brought that night showed the earliest start time at the Wildwood at 7:40 a.m., followed by 8 for the middle and high schools, 8:25 a.m. starts for the Boutwell, Shawsheen, and West, and then the Woburn Street and North starting at 9 a.m. The current start times for next year, if un\xadchanged, would be 8:40 a.m. for the Wildwood, 7:20 at the middle school, 7:40 at the high school, 7:50 at the Boutwell, 8:20 at the Woburn Street and the North, and 8:55 a.m. at the Shawsheen and West. Brand pointed out that this proposed schedule aligns with an 8 a.m. start for secondary level students and requires no students to be picked up for the bus before 7 a.m. Se\xadven of the eight schools would be shifted less than 40 minutes and have start times between 8 and 9 a.m. He also assured the community that this plan would not impact CARES, athletics, or other after-school activities, which were priorities identified at the last options stage. School Committee member David Ragsdale asked how student drop-off at school would work if middle and high school students riding the same buses will start school at the same time. Faretra suggested that the 15-minute drop-off window would provide enough time for the bus to stop at either school for the be\xadginning of the window and drive to the other by 8 a.m. Depending on the route, they’ll go to the more appropriate school first. M. J. Byrnes asked if any bus rides would be longer than 40-45 minutes for students. Faret\xadra answered that the current longest ride is only 30 minutes, and none of the proposed changes would make a bus route longer than that. Byrnes also suggested there may be more traffic later in the morning, but Faret\xadra maintained the routes will still be coverable and flexible. Brand then went over some next steps including two community for\xadums proposed on Dec. 21 and Jan. 18th, from 6 - 7 p.m., ahead of the committee meetings on those nights. These forums will present an opportunity for anyone in the community to share their thoughts and feedback on the proposed op\xadtions. The committee would vote, hopefully during their meeting on Jan. 25, to either accept the proposed school start time change for next year or for 2024 or stick with the current schedule. It would also be possible to move the Wildwood start time back an hour on the proposed start time change from 7:40 a.m. to 8:40 a.m. if desired. Log In Keep it Clean.

Directed by Manuel Pureza, ‘Until Life Do Us Part’ is a feel-good, eight-episode series that revolves around three generations of the Paixão family living under the same roof and having to juggle with personal crises, the generation gap, clashing ideologies and the challenges of running a family business.

I think it’s good for Portugal and viewers can get a lot out of it.” But the series does paint a dark image of Portugal’s past and its brutal Colonial war.

Produced by the SPi production company of Grupo SP Televisão and co-produced with RTP, Gloria is the highest budget series in the history of Portuguese production, according to a report by the Lusa news agency. ""Until Life Do Us Part"" was produced by RTP/Coyote Vadio/Caos Filmes and picked up by Netflix after being shown in Portugal on RTP. It’s being released in 190 territories worldwide. “It’s very important that they are shot in Portugal,” Miranda said. “This will create new job opportunities for Portuguese actors and bring more foreign productions to be produced and made in Portugal.” Netflix is not the only streaming service offering a series featuring Portuguese talent. On Feb. 25, Amazon Prime Video will be releasing the “Operation Black Tide,” a four-episode Spanish/Portuguese series inspired by the true story of the first narco-submarine intercepted in Europe. Directed by Daniel Calparsoro, Oskar Santos and João Maia, the series follows the route of a handcrafted semi-submersible submarine that traverses the Atlantic Ocean with three tons of cocaine inside. Its crew, three men, survive storms, currents, breakdowns, hunger, fights and constant police harassment. The cast includes Portuguese actors such as Nuno Lopes (White Lines), Lúcia Moniz (Love Actually) and Luís Esparteiro (Super Pai).'}]"

David Hebert, a Westport resident and owner of the real estate company Hanover Properties, pleaded guilty for his role in Correia’s plot to extort more than $600,000 from cannabis companies looking to do business in the city. In the September 2019 plea agreement, Hebert pleaded guilty to one count each of extortion, extortion conspiracy and lying to investigators. A political supporter of the former mayor and his landlord at one point, Hebert was most recently scheduled for sentencing on Feb. 16. A joint motion filed by his defense attorney, R. Bradford Bailey, and U.S. Assistant Attorneys, Dustin Chao and David Tobin, requested an extension to sometime in May because Hebert is set to be a witness for the government in the upcoming trial of Correia’s former chief of staff, Gen Andrade. According to an online federal court docket, that trial is set for March 7. Gen Andrade: Here\'s why the judge continued the trial of Jasiel Correia\'s chief of staff Last June, in an unexpected turn of events, federal court Judge Douglas P. Woodlock rejected a plea agreement between Andrade and federal prosecutors for her alleged role in extorting money from marijuana vendors, bribing Correia by giving him half her salary and lying to investigators. Jury selection for her trial started Dec. 6, but was continued to March 7 after a witness for the federal prosecutors came down with COVID. Hebert’s co-defendants in the extortion scheme, Tony Costa and Hildegar Camara, who also took plea deals with the government, are currently serving their house arrest sentences. Delayed again: Jasiel Correia, headed to prison in New Hampshire, asks judge to stay free until March Unlike Costa and Camara, who were witnesses for the prosecution in Correia\'s trial, Hebert was not called to the stand, although he was at one point on a witness list. Costa was ordered and has since paid more than $100,000 in restitution for pocketing bribe money from marijuana business owners. As part of Hebert’s sentencing, he could be subject to surrendering $61,000 in forfeiture money to the court related to the marijuana extortion scheme. During Correia’s month-long trial last May, business owner Matthew Pichette testified that he entered into a bribery agreement, brokered by Hebert, a longtime acquaintance. Pichette testified he met with Hebert at the Old Firehouse Smoke Shop on Rock Street and was asked to give $25,000 to Correia\'s legal defense fund. Pichette said he eventually agreed to this $25,000 because, ""I expected there was no other way to get the letters."" While Andrade awaits her trial, Correia was granted another delay by Woodlock to turn himself into the Federal Correctional Institution, Berlin in New Hampshire. The third most recent delay was last Thursday, one day before Correia was to report to the Bureau of Prisons facility. Woodlock ordered that Correia, who out on bail and outfitted with a GPS device, be free until and including Feb. 13. The judge still has an outstanding decision to make whether Correia can stay out of prison pending his appeal of his criminal case. Jo C. Goode may be reached at jgoode@heraldnews.com.

La cálida bienvenida que recibió este jueves es el mejor termómetro para medir su atractivo como estrella del beisbol. Acuña Jr. fue reactivado sorpresivamente por los Bravos. Cerca del mediodía, cuando debía prepararse para su segundo juego consecutivo en el outfield de los Stripers de Gwinnett, en Triple A, corrió la noticia de su vuelta adelantada al roster activo de Atlanta. Entonces comenzó una fiesta en las redes, un festejo que se ha visto muy pocas veces cuando un astro lesionado por largo tiempo vuelve al combate. Mantente informado con los temas más relevantes de política, economía, comunidad latina y salud. Suscríbete aquí a nuestros newsletters. Los Atlanta Braves anunciaron que hoy vuelve Ronald Acuña Jr. 🔥🇻🇪 pic.twitter.com/OjqJS9CVvm Ya Acuña había exclamado la frase «I’m back» en el Spring Training, cuando sacudió sus primeros bombazos en una práctica de su equipo. Pero la verdadera vuelta tenía que ser esta. Casi 10 meses atrás, el venezolano sufrió una delicada rotura del tendón cruzado anterior de la rodilla derecha. Al enorme dolor físico se sumó el dolor colectivo de ver fuera, nada menos que por media temporada, a una de las caras jóvenes más representantivas de este deporte. Acuña peleaba el liderato de jonrones con el dominicano Fernando Tatis Jr. Tenía 24 cuadrangulares, a pesar de ser primer bate, y mostraba un robusto OPS de .990, con 72 anotadas en 82 encuentros. 🎶Guess who’s back, back again🎶@ronaldacunajr24 | #ForTheA pic.twitter.com/ga8wtkY0Ko Se temía por su futuro, no solo por la interrumpida cosecha de 2021. ¿Volvería a correr? ¿Volvería a jugar con la misma intensidad que ha hecho de él una de las figuras más emocionantes de los diamantes? ¿Podría recuperar su estatus en Atlanta y en la MLB? Un recibimiento especial de la fanaticada hacia Ronald Acuña Jr. 👏👏👏👏👏 pic.twitter.com/vjQlD9Gxmp El aplauso del público en el Truist Park nacía de esas preguntas y también de la fe puesta en su breve –pero fructífero– paso por Triple A. Porque Acuña jugó con Gwinnett como si hubiera vuelto a ser el súper prospecto que tocaba las puertas de las Grandes Ligas. Sin limitaciones para defender el right o para correr entre las bases, ligó para .368/.520/.421 con los Stripers. Robó tres bases en tres intentos. Consiguió un sencillo con un rodado lento dentro del cuadro, buena señal. Y hasta anotó una carrera desde segunda base ¡ante un infieldhit! No tardó en replicar su producción en el Big Show. Oficialmente, de regreso. ✅ #PorLaA pic.twitter.com/AaaZin3pTl El nativo de La Sabana no solamente largó su primer cohete este jueves. Su mejor proclama ocurrió mientras estuvo en circulación. Dos veces salió al robo y dos veces llegó a salvo. La marca de fábrica de Acuña ha sido el poder, su colorido, sí, pero también la forma en que usa las piernas para hacer daño a los rivales. Fueron nueve meses de rehabilitación, ejercicios y trabajo muy duro para fortalecer tan crucial área del cuerpo.

The Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) reported that COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations continue to rise. Last week adult COVID-19 hospitalizations in Boston were 208.7 per day, 8.7 over the 200 per day threshold. This metric helps the BPHC understand the burden of serious COVID-19 cases among adults resulting in inpatient care in Boston hospitals. Last week, 1,265 Mission Hill/Roxbury residents were tested for the virus last week and 9.4 percent were positive–this was a 13 percent decrease from the 10.8 percent that tested positive as reported by the BPHC on May 23. One hundred nineteen additional Mission Hill/Roxbury residents contracted the virus between May 23 and May 30 and there have now been 13,236 confirmed cases in the neighborhood since the start of the pandemic. Boston’s citywide weekly positive test rate also decreased last week but remains above 11 percent. According to the BPHC 18,277 residents were tested citywide last week and 11.1 percent were COVID positive–this was a four percent decrease from the 11.6 percent that reportedly tested positive for the week ending on May 23. The statistics released by the BPHC as part of its weekly COVID19 report breaks down the number of cases and infection rates in each neighborhood. It also breaks down the number of cases by age, gender and race. Citywide positive cases of coronavirus increased 1.1 percent last week and went from 186,446 to 188,509 confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic. There were three additional deaths in Boston from the virus in the past week and the total number of COVID deaths is now at 1,469. The Boston Public Health Commission strongly recommends residents: Wear high-quality, well-fitting masks indoors and on public transportation; Stay up to date on COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters; Stay home if you feel sick; Ensure proper indoor ventilation by opening windows when possible; Gather outdoors as the weather warms, instead of indoors; Test for COVID-19; and Contact your health care provider about anti-viral treatment if diagnosed with COVID-19.

It was 133 weeks, or two years and six months, into the pandemic and the virus had calmed down. The main reason for the stoppage was that so many home testing kits had been distributed that the numbers of confirmed cases provided by the state could no longer be considered accurate. Many people who tested positive at home did not report their cases. Many felt fine or had mild symptoms. By September, the omicron variant (B.1.1.529), a more transmissible, but less severe version of the virus that hit hard in March of 2020, was circulating along with various sub-variants such as BA 2, BA 4 and BA 5. The virus had become diffuse and less strong and most people could survive it except for those with severe underlying conditions or the very old. A news story in The Sun Chronicle on March 8, 2022, the two-year anniversary of the pandemic, said many people were ready to move on. During the week of Feb. 28, when the mask mandate was lifted in schools, a reporter dropped by the Pleasant Street Bar & Grille in Attleboro. The crowd was happy. The day was done and it was time for fun. When one man was asked if he was ready to move on from coronavirus, it prompted a unified response from the bar a couple of feet away: “YES!” The question was asked to a guy named Richard Tetu who was sitting at a table with two buddies. “We’re sick of it,” Tetu said, who added some words that family newspapers don’t print. “Everybody is.” He’d had it with mandates for masks and vaccines. The average age of those dying from the disease on Dec. 22, 2022 was 80. During the year it sometimes went to 81 or dipped to 79 or 78. But it generally stayed in the high 70s and low 80s. Out of the 373,437 cases among those 60 and older statewide, there were 20,757 confirmed and probable deaths which equaled 5.55% of the total cases. At that rate about 94% of those over 60 had a good chance of survival, but the most deaths, 12,504, were among those 80 years and older. Those 12,504 confirmed and probable deaths equaled 54.85% of the total confirmed and probable deaths for all ages. The 20,757 confirmed and probable deaths among those 60 and over equaled 91% of all 22,793 confirmed and probable deaths. Meanwhile the disease remains among us, but it has lessened its intensity. Dr. Brian Patel from Sturdy Memorial Hospital summed up the situation. “We continue to see cases of COVID-19 coming to the Emergency Department for treatment, as well as cases requiring admission to the hospital,” he said last week in a Sun Chronicle interview. “The overall volume of patients being admitted with COVID-19 has increased slightly, but we are not seeing a significant increase in severe illness requiring an ICU level of care.” Patel said the current level of the disease is “similar to what we expected.” On any given day Patel said the number of coronavirus patients ranges from four to 10 and the positive test rate fluctuates from 7% to 10% which mirrors the state’s rate and the rates in the local communities as well. He said if a surge like the one last January happens the hospital is prepared, despite difficulties with staffing. In January 2022 the disease was running rampant. It was so bad the public was not invited to the city’s inauguration ceremonies for those officials taking office, including Mayor Paul Heroux. The Rev. Cheryl Harris, who was the master of ceremonies for the inauguration, said the city had to “defer to the power of the pandemic.” So without the usual audience of 200 to 300 people, 23 city officials were sworn in during “quiet, but dignified ceremonies” in Bray Auditorium at Attleboro High School. And the virus not only cut that crowd but had a big impact on Sturdy Hospital’s profit margin for the previous fiscal year. The hospital reported a loss of $10 million for fiscal year 2020 ending a string of 34 years of surpluses. The coronavirus pandemic had a lot to do with the downward financial turn, according to new president and CEO Aimee Brewer, who took over in October, about 19 months after the pandemic began. It affected staffing as well. As many as 80 employees, or 4% of the 2,044 staff, were sick on any given day. Numbers provided by Sturdy through September showed that the there were more vaccinated patients admitted to the hospital than unvaccinated patients, those numbers being 125 to 86. The week ending Jan. 14, 2022 set a statewide record for new coronavirus cases in one week at 132,557. Fortunately deaths did not set records. That week there were 344 deaths statewide which equaled 0.26% of all the cases. A new record for the 10-community Sun Chronicle area was also set at 3,463 cases in the week ending Jan. 13, 2022. The total number of deaths over the whole pandemic at that point was 339, or 1.09%, for the 10 communities. The worst week for deaths statewide was the week ending June 20, 2020 when there were 1,158 cases and 227 deaths, a rate of 19.6%. So in January cases of coronavirus came in a flood, but the deaths did not. By the week ending Feb. 25 the number of weekly cases statewide had declined to 7,941 and in the 10-community area the number was at 211. The sharp decline in cases prompted the state’s Department of Education to drop the mask mandate in schools on Feb. 28 and Attleboro followed suit. The mandate had been in place since the start of school in September. However all students were back in school as opposed to the year prior when they learned from home three days a week. At the beginning of January when the virus surge was at its worst there were 1,924 students, or 6.41%, out with the disease in the week ending Jan. 12, 2022 in the 14 districts tracked by The Sun Chronicle. Statewide there were 41,063 students out with the disease out of 911,520 total students statewide which was equal to 4.51% of the state’s student population. Locally the week ending Jan. 5, 2022 was worse for teachers. That week 362 out of 4,065 in the 14 districts were ill with coronavirus. That number equaled 8.91% of the total number of teachers. In the week ending Jan. 12, 2022 there were 7,351 teachers out with the virus out of the 136,349 teachers statewide. That number equaled 5.39% all teachers. That was as bad as it got. Numbers of the sick plummeted after that. Seven of the 10 communities responded to a Sun Chronicle request last week for the number of deaths in their communities. The total number for the 10 communities now stands at 408. It’s not known if deaths increased in the three non-responding communities, Norton, Rehoboth and Wrentham. The current numbers available show that the death percentage is less than 1% — 0.87% to be exact. The case count in the area as of Dec. 22 was 46,516 with the latest number of new cases at 206. The cases equal 23.16% of the area population of 200,793, which is about 4 points lower than the statewide percentage. As of Dec. 22, 2022 there were 1,959,910 confirmed cases of coronavirus statewide since the pandemic hit in March of 2020. Out of a population of 7,029,917 the case total equals 27.88%. However, as was noted before, the numbers are likely higher because not all positive cases from home test kits are reported. And there have been 21,149 confirmed deaths statewide during that time which is a death percentage of 1.08% Currently the average age of death is 80. Since vaccinations began in December of 2020, 146,156 of the 200,793 people who live in the Sun Chronicle’s 10 communities have been fully vaccinated. That’s a percentage of 72.79%. So far in the 10 communities, 88,374 people or 44.01% have gotten the first booster and 37,141 or 18.49% have gotten the second booster. All of those numbers are behind state figures. The town with the lowest percentage of fully vaccinated people as of Dec.19, 2022 is Seekonk at 53.43% and the town with the highest percentage is Norfolk at 84.27%. The average for the 10 communities is 73.18%. Statewide, 5,608,533 or 79.78% of the population of 7,029,917 have been fully vaccinated with the first shot or shots depending on the vaccine used. Statewide 3,446,326 residents out of the 7,029,917 total population or 49.02% have gotten the first booster. Only 1,499,691 or 21.33% have gotten the second booster. George W.
