presidential race, no one knows for sure what the results of that election will be. In 1948, nearly all the experts thought President Harry Truman would lose to Republican candidate Thomas Dewey. Truman surprised them and most of the nation by winning. An iconic photo shows Truman after the election holding up a newspaper that declared that Dewey defeated Truman. Truman had a good time displaying the newspaper and making fun of a radio commentator who had made a similar prediction. Our question is in what city was that iconic picture of President Truman and the newspaper headline taken? Was it Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City or St. Louis? Answer: The 1948 presidential election was one of the greatest election upsets in American history. Most of the nation thought New York attorney Thomas Dewey would become the next president. The Chicago Daily Tribune, a pro-Republican newspaper, was so sure of Dewey\'s victory that on election day, before any polls closed, it printed ""Dewey Defeats Truman"" as its headline for the following day. The newspaper had to go to press earlier than usual due to a printers’ strike, but no one at the newspaper was too concerned. President Truman won in a stunning victory. Two days later, as his train was making its way to Washington from Kansas City, it made a stop at Union Station in St. Louis. That\'s where Truman found a two-day old Chicago newspaper and posed for one of the most iconic photos of the twentieth century. Truman had become president after the death of Franklin Roosevelt in 1945. During the 1946 mid-term elections, Republicans had taken control of both houses of Congress and public opinion polls showed Truman trailing Republican nominee Thomas Dewey, sometimes by double digits. At the 1948 Democratic convention, a ""dump Truman"" campaign became part of the agenda, although it failed. Some liberal Democrats had joined former Vice-President Henry Wallace\'s new Progressive Party. Some Southern conservatives in the party were angered by the growing voice of labor unions, and, after Truman proposed a civil rights plank at the convention, several Southerners walked out, forming their own party, the State\'s Rights Democratic Party, led by South Carolina Governor Strom Thurmond. They were popularly known as Dixiecrats. Truman won the nomination but he not only faced a Republican and Dixiecrat challenge. There was also a Socialist Party ticket led by Norman Thomas, a five-time Socialist nominee and a Christian Nationalist Party. Dewey appeared so unbeatable that Republican leaders believed all he had to do to win was to avoid major mistakes. Truman adopted an agressive campaign, ridiculing Dewey, criticizing Dewey\'s refusal to address specific issues, and targeting the Republican-controlled Congress with a wave of blistering partisan assaults. Truman lost all nine of the Gallup poll\'s post-convention surveys, although Dewey\'s lead dropped from 17 points in late September to just five points by the end of October, just above the poll\'s margin of error. Truman was gaining momentum, but most political analysts were reluctant to say that a Truman victory was a serious possibility. Truman and his running mate, Senator Alben Barkley of Kentucky, pulled off a shocking victory, picking up 303 electoral votes and 49.6 percent of the popular vote to Dewey’s 189 electoral votes and 45.1 percent of the popular vote. The Chicago Daily Tribune with its famous headline is part of a special display at the Truman Presidential Library in Independence.'}]"
