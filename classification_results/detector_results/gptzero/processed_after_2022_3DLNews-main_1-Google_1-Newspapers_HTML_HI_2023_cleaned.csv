That makes sense for various reasons, as the company deals with the complexity of further expansion and modernization as a regional carrier. And especially given the $900 million in debt it has racked up over the past few years. It isn‚Äôt clear, however, as to who another offer could come from. While questionable in terms of its feasibility, we‚Äôve suggested for years that JetBlue might be a contender. Could it be easier to get that merger through the government regulators since those two airlines do not overlap routes like Alaska does with Hawaiian. In the SEC filing, this question arose, ‚ÄúAre you open to other offers? What if Alaska backs out of the deal?‚Äù Here‚Äôs what their board said: ‚Äú(We) may consider other unsolicited offers for Hawaiian Airlines with the best interest of our shareholders in mind.

Angus McKelvey called a meeting Tuesday night to hear what Lahaina residents want from the Legislature in the upcoming session, a little more than a dozen people showed up to weigh in. The sparse attendance at the Lahaina Civic Center could perhaps be chalked up to ‚Äúmeeting fatigue‚Äù from a steady schedule of official gatherings in recent weeks meant to provide information to those impacted by the devastating Aug. 8 wildfire.

For unknown reasons, the Honolulu Prosecuting Attorney‚Äôs Office dropped the charges. A few years later, police responded to an argument at a Makiki home between Badua and his girlfriend and discovered hundreds of pounds of fireworks, Hawaii News Now reported. The fireworks were seized and the two were released pending further investigation ‚Äì but no charges were ever filed, according to court records. A year later, a woman in Moanalua noticed a man she identified as Badua setting off ‚Äúbomb‚Äù-type fireworks in Moanulua. She told him to take it to his own neighborhood and called 911. An HPD officer photographed the fireworks in a box next to Badua‚Äôs car, took the spent fireworks and cited him. Again, the charges were dropped. And in October, a woman called to report Badua had set off fireworks at an intersection in Aiea. She watched him on a moped setting up the device on the street and riding away as it exploded ‚Äî twice. Police found him sitting in a car and cited him. A month later, the charges were dismissed. Each year, Honolulu police cite dozens of fireworks scofflaws, usually when patrolling officers on New Year‚Äôs Eve witness them in public places shooting off aerials, which are illegal. It serves, in some measure, to placate members of the public up in arms over the months-long fusillade of illegal pyrotechnics leading up to New Year‚Äôs Eve. But the enforcement numbers add up to little more than theater.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:12 am UH‚Äôs bi-annual #BeHeard survey, written to comply with federal policy regarding Title IX, gauges students‚Äô histories with domestic and gender-based violence. Editor\'s Note: Content warning for themes of sexual violence. Across the UH system last month, students‚Äô emails lit up with a survey titled #BeHeardUH. Authorized by President David Lassner, the survey‚Äôs purpose was to understand the climate of gender and sex-based violence across the UH system and to make improvements. Released bi-annually, the survey was originally distributed in 2017 as part of a nationwide movement to tackle sexual violence on college campuses. UH was one of the first colleges to adopt the survey. UHM was specifically picked by the Obama administration to undergo a compliance review ‚Äî one of the first 55 universities in the country to be chosen. Jennifer Rose, the executive director of the Office of Institutional Equity, said ‚Äúthe climate survey was actually part of that voluntary resolution agreement that was negotiated between us and the U.S. Department of Education for Civil Rights, but we had actually already been in the process of conducting one before that. We started our work in 2014 to prepare for the survey that was eventually launched in 2017.‚Äù Since 2017, the Office of Institutional Equity has made various changes to its procedures in order to cooperate with both federal policy and what students have been reporting in the survey. Protocols have changed to accommodate various types of gender violence, even as the Trump administration narrowed what qualified as a Title IX concern just a few years ago. Title IX is a civil rights law that was established in 1972 for the express purpose of protecting college students from discrimination based on sex or gender. Limiting the scope of what qualified as Title IX violations ‚Äî such as the types of sexual exploitation cases like sexting or stalking ‚Äî meant that many colleges stopped addressing these concerns altogether. UH was not one of them; it adapted its policy to continue to address the full scope of domestic and gender-based violence. Mykie Ozoa-Aglugub, an advisor with the Office of Equity, clarified that not all students know about Title IX. ‚ÄúWe always say ‚Äòdon‚Äôt ask students if they know what Title IX is,\'"" said Ozoa-Aglugub. ""Just ask them if they know what to do, or where to go, or who to contact if something that falls under Title IX happens to them or their friends. That‚Äôs what we really care about.‚Äù The adjustments of #BeHeard haven‚Äôt just been seen in Title IX procedures; the survey has influenced the creation of more training workshops, and a gradual increase in bystander intervention in cases of witnessed harassment. Students also requested confidential advocates. ‚ÄúOne of the things that we found was that, and this reflects national data too, students generally feel more comfortable with the process ‚Äì the entire Title IX process ‚Äì if they can get to a confidential advocate first,‚Äù Ozoa-Aglugub said. She went on to explain her role in establishing a UH system-wide advocacy program and the university‚Äôs continued support of on-campus advocates. There are concerns that the improvements of #BeHeard‚Äôs 2021 survey have been affected by COVID-19. [It] ‚Äú...logically follows that less opportunities for in-person contact could very well have resulted in less problematic behaviors,"" Ozoa-Aglugub said. ""Simply by virtue of people not being around each other.‚Äù Still, Rose and Ozoa-Aglugub remain optimistic about the future and their work. ‚ÄúWe take pride in, you know, trying to adhere to the best standards of addressing Title IX,‚Äù Rose said. #BeHeardUH closed on Feb. 24, but the results won‚Äôt be available for the public until roughly next December. Until then, concerns from the survey will be adapted into the university‚Äôs approach to Title IX complaints and hopefully into awareness among students.

named as the 100th victim of the Lahaina wildfire, while posing for a photo with her father Branden (left), and grandfather Brandon (right), on Dec. 8, in Kahului. Sharlene‚Äôs family fought to have her listed as a victim due to smoke inhalation after she died weeks after fleeing the fire. ‚ÄúMe and my mom was really close, we talked multiple times a day,‚Äù Brandon said. AP photos The Associated Press LAHAINA‚Äì Sharlene Rabang and her calico cat fled the wildfire that destroyed Lahaina and arrived at a family home on another island after a 24-hour odyssey that included sleeping in a car. Dazed, coughing and weak, the frail but feisty 78-year-old headed straight for the bedroom. Her daughter headed for a drugstore, thinking the coughing might be asthma or the flu. It wasn‚Äôt. Rabang died with her daughter holding her hand nearly a month later. She had a history of cancer, COVID and high blood pressure, and the doctor initially neglected to attribute her death to the wildfire. It wasn‚Äôt until November that, at the urging of her family, Honolulu‚Äôs medical examiner said a contributing cause of death was the thick, black smoke that Rabang breathed as she fled. Photos of Sharlene Rabang, who died weeks after fleeing her home, are seen on Dec. 5, at her husband Weslee Chinen‚Äôs family home in Waipahu. Honolulu‚Äôs medical examiner said a contributing cause of her death was the thick, black smoke that Rabang breathed as she fled. The report made Rabang the 100th victim of the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. The Aug. 8 fire devastated the onetime capital of the former kingdom of Hawaii. It wiped out an estimated 3,000 homes and apartments in Lahaina as it raced through dry, invasive grasses, driven by winds from a hurricane passing far to the south. The number of people exposed to natural hazards has increased as climate change has intensified disasters like wildfires and hurricanes. Studies suggest that wildfire disproportionately affects vulnerable people such as those who are older, have a diminished capacity to respond to danger, or are low-income. Of those killed by the Maui fire, 60 were 65 or older. Many relatives are facing grief and anger and feeling robbed of their final years with their elders. The pain is particularly acute around the holidays. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care how many surgeries she‚Äôs had in her life, I don‚Äôt care that she was vulnerable,‚Äù said Rabang‚Äôs daughter, Lorine Lopes. ‚ÄúShe wouldn‚Äôt be dead if it wasn‚Äôt because of the fire.‚Äù In September, a team of wildfire researchers in the mainland‚Äôs West coast found that in the past decade, the number of highly vulnerable people living within the perimeter of wildfires in Washington, Oregon and California more than tripled from the decade before, to more than 43,000. When a wildfire destroyed the town of Paradise, California, in 2018, 68 of the 85 victims were 65 or older, and more than a dozen had physical or mental impairments that impeded their ability to evacuate. Recordings of 911 calls from the Maui wildfire underscored how susceptible older residents were. One woman called about an 88-year-old man left behind in a house: ‚ÄúHe would literally have to be carried out,‚Äù she told the dispatcher. A man reported that his elderly parents called him after their home caught fire: ‚ÄúThey just called to say, ‚ÄòI love you, we‚Äôre not going to make it.'‚Äù Several victims were residents of a 35-unit low-income senior apartment complex that burned. The nonprofit that ran it, Hale Mahaolu, stressed that its tenants lived independently, but some relatives said more should have been done to evacute them. Louise Abihai, 97, was among the tenants who died. Strong and sharp, she walked a mile daily and enjoyed the friends she had there. Her great-granddaughter Kailani Amine wondered if the values of caring for and respecting ‚Äúkupuna,‚Äù the Hawaiian term for elders, were lost in the chaos. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just sad that they really didn‚Äôt have a chance,‚Äù Amine said. Much can be done to reduce risk, such as asking communities what help they need, planning the transportation that may be required in an evacuation, and determining how to communicate with vulnerable people. ‚ÄúPutting the resources and political will and the social will to assist those populations ‚Äî there‚Äôs capacity to do that,‚Äù said Erica Fleishman, the director of the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute and a co-author of the study about wildfire risk in the West. ‚ÄúWe know this is going to keep happening.‚Äù Rabang, who stood barely 5 feet tall and weighed under 100 pounds, was home alone when the fire struck. Her husband, Weslee Chinen, was with family on Oahu, a short flight away. The couple tended to ignore evacuation warnings for fires and tsunamis ‚Äî disaster had spared their home before and they expected it would again, Chinen said. But this time, Rabang‚Äôs son, Brandon, showed up after driving past a police barricade and insisted she leave. They could feel the heat of the fire on their faces and inhaled intense smoke that turned the sky to darkness. They made it to a relative‚Äôs home. There were dogs inside, so Rabang slept in the car with Poke ‚Äî the calico she adopted after deciding she wanted the oldest, ugliest cat in the shelter, her daughter said. ‚ÄúShe felt old and decrepit, and she wanted a cat that was the same,‚Äù Lopes said. ‚ÄúShe wanted to give a home to an animal that no one else would.‚Äù The next morning, Rabang was gagging and struggling for breath. She seemed exhausted and heartbroken, and fretted about what her grandchildren would do with the town demolished. It took Lopes and her sister all morning to persuade her to fly to Oahu, where she could be with her husband and daughters. By 8 p.m., her husband called an ambulance. Rabang spent nine days in intensive care being treated for respiratory failure, anemia caused by bleeding ulcers and other conditions. She often forgot why she was in the hospital. Her hands were tied to the bed to keep her from trying to rip off her oxygen mask. When she had recovered enough to leave the ICU, her family struggled to get her to eat, even when they made her her favorite dumpling soup or brought her fresh sashimi. So after five days at home, an ambulance once again delivered her to the hospital. Her eyes were glazed. Her weight dropped to below 70 pounds (31.8 kg). Her son and his family flew in from Maui. Lopes and her sister took turns holding vigil. Rabang‚Äôs husband stopped by but found it too upsetting to stay long. When doctors increased her dose of adrenaline, she went into cardiac arrest. The family ended her life support and she died Sept. 4. Her cat now lives at her husband‚Äôs family home. Rabang, who had worked in the restaurant industry, helping turn around failing establishments, had several health conditions that made her vulnerable. She had rheumatoid arthritis, survived pancreatic cancer over a decade earlier, had a kidney removed due to carcinoma in July, and had weakened lungs from COVID. She was also tough and more than a bit stubborn. She refused to use a wheelchair during cancer recovery and would crawl to the bathroom when her joint pain was too severe to walk. The doctor who signed her death certificate failed to mention the fire as a cause ‚Äî an omission that had financial ramifications for the family, as well as emotional ones. For Rabang‚Äôs husband to receive government help for funeral or other expenses, Lopes said, they needed to prove she was a fire victim. After phone calls and emails with various agencies, the family persuaded the medical examiner‚Äôs office to review her death. Rabang had already been cremated, but the medical examiner, Dr. Masahiko Kobayashi, considered her records and the family‚Äôs account, confirming in mid-November that while the main causes were pneumonia and anemia, a contributing factor was smoke inhalation, according to the report, obtained by The Associated Press through a public records request. Lopes said that when Rabang was added to the victims list, she just started crying. After months of stress, she could finally grieve. ‚ÄúIt was a battle to get her on that list, and now that it happened, I‚Äôm just releasing,‚Äù Lopes said, sobbing. ‚ÄúI watched her through every torturous moment she went through, fighting for her life. She had to get on that list, because she was part of that event.‚Äù Today's breaking news and more in your inbox Makawao Hongwanji‚Äôs gigantic summer garage sale and bazaar is set for 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday, June 22 and 7 ...

Evangelista | Assistant Editor Photos courtesy Brice Kurihara ‚ÄúI am very excited for this journey and I hope to make my Filipino community proud as I represent Hawai‚Äòi,‚Äù says Savannah Gankiewicz, the newly crowned Miss Hawai‚Äòi USA. ‚ÄúI am thrilled to be Filipina American and represent my community. I definitely believe representation matters and I hope to inspire other women who look like me to not be afraid to put yourself out there. America is a melting pot of ethnicities and that‚Äôs the beauty of it.‚Äù Savannah is the daughter of Yvienne and Gerrit Peterson of Maui and Mark and Kim Gankiewicz of Stephenson, Virginia. Savannah was raised on Maui from birth to the age of six and then back and forth from Maui to Virginia. She attended Sherando High School in Virginia and George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. According to her Mom Yvienne Tagorda Peterson, Savannah returned home to Maui when she turned twenty-one and has been on Maui for the last six years. Savannah is currently an international model, marketing coordinator with The Agency Maui and an entrepreneur building a business internationally. Filipinos love pageants and love to root for their favorite contestant. Filipinos point with pride how many Filipinos have won international beauty contests. And mostly every town in the Philippines has their own queen. Here in Hawai‚Äòi, many of the traditional Filipino organizations also have their own queen. ‚ÄúI decided to enter pageants because I wanted to be a better public speaker and have a platform where I can use my voice and spread my message to other young women on cultivating self-love. My Mom was always into pageants as she was Mrs. Maui back in the day and a director for the Miss Maui Filipina so pageantry was always in my life and my Mom really inspired me to join Miss Hawai‚Äòi USA,‚Äù explains Savannah, who entered as Miss Wailea. ‚ÄúWe helped her by being her support system,‚Äù Yvienne states. ‚ÄúAs a former pageant director for the Miss Maui Filipina pageant who was able to bring home three consecutive state crowns during my term, the experience I applied was just making sure Savannah was prepared and calm throughout the experience.‚Äù Preparing for any pageant takes a lot of hard work. Candidates undergo preparation in a variety of ways: physically and mentally. ‚ÄúPreparing for Miss Hawai‚Äòi USA was a job in itself,‚Äù explains Savannah. ‚ÄúI focused and put everything I had into training physically but mentally as well. I was constantly reading up on current events and things that are happening not only in my country but all over the world. I had mock interviews one to two times a week and I was always studying.‚Äù Having an experienced pageant Mom was a super plus. ‚ÄúEven before she won the title, I was so proud of her,‚Äù Yvienne says with a beaming smile. ‚ÄúHer hard work she put into studying current events, interviewing others on their perspective on social issues, and making sure she was able to articulate her thoughts within a timely manner was more a concern for her than what she portrayed on the exterior.‚Äù This was Savannah‚Äôs first time as a contestant in the Miss Hawai‚Äòi USA pageant. In 2017, she was crowned Miss Mutya ng Pilipinas Overseas Filipino Communities. The contestants were judged on several categories: interview, swimsuit, evening gown and an on stage question. Savannah‚Äôs on stage question was the most controversial question asked: ‚ÄúWhat are your thoughts regarding the Supreme Court‚Äôs overturning of Roe vs. Wade.‚Äù Yvienne says ‚ÄúAt this point, we don‚Äôt know exactly how that was answered, we just know the crowd roared in a loud applause‚Ä¶thank goodness!‚Äù Savannah recalls how calm she felt until she looked at her family. ‚ÄúWhen I rewatch the crowning moment at that time I remember how calm I was during the final night. I knew whatever happens God intended for that to be. So when I heard my name I knew in my heart Miss Hawai‚Äòi USA was meant for me. I was trying so hard to hold back my tears because the minute I looked at my family the tears came falling down. I am a very emotional person and I had tears of joy and I was so proud of myself.‚Äù Savannah, who was also declared Miss Photogenic, says ‚ÄúI think the most difficult part of the pageant were the days leading up to the events. Miss Hawai‚Äòi USA was right around the corner and I was so excited to start pageant week.‚Äù Often times movies (and insider stories) depict beauty pageants as being very competitive but the reality is the sisterhood trumps the competitive juices. ‚ÄúI enjoyed making friends during my pageant experience,‚Äù declares Savannah. ‚ÄúI made a lot of connections and now I have a sisterhood. It is funny because there is only one winner and you would think it is super competitive but for me I made amazing friendships and I knew whoever would win we all would be so happy and supportive. That is why I love pageants. It‚Äôs all about women empowerment to me.‚Äù According to a list appearing in Wikipedia, it‚Äôs been a very long time since the Miss Hawai‚Äòi USA identifies her hometown as being from Maui. [See box on page 3] Although the 2022 Miss Hawai‚Äòi USA Kiana Yamat graduated from Lahainaluna High School, her hometown is listed as Honolulu. In 2001, Christy Leonard whose hometown is listed as Lahaina won the title. In 1999, Trini-Ann Kaopuiki won the title, with a hometown listed as Honolulu but she is a St. Anthony School alum. This year‚Äôs first runner up, Kawena Kan-Hai, is also from Maui. And there have been a number of Filipinas who were crowned Miss Hawai‚Äòi USA, including Yamat, Aureana Tseu (2009), Nadine Tanega (1994) and Zoe Ann Roach (1983). Interestingly, the first Miss Hawai‚Äòi USA was Elza Edsman in 1952 (competing as the representative of the Territory of Hawai‚Äòi) and she placed 1st runner up at the 1952 Miss Universe. Those who won the Miss USA from Hawai‚Äòi include Macel Wilson (1962), Tanya Denise Wilson (1972), Judi Andersen (1978) and Brook Lee (1997), who went on to win the Miss Universe 1997 title. And yes, the current Miss Universe is R‚ÄôBonney Gabriel, a Filipina from Texas who was the Miss USA. Of note, there have been four Miss Universes from the Philippines: Gloria Diaz (1969), Margie Moran-Floirendo (1973), Pia Wurtzbach (2015) and Catriona Gray (2018). The Miss USA pageant is expected to be held sometime in the fall in Reno, Nevada. ‚ÄúMiss USA is months away but I want to start prepping ASAP and really put in the work to be Miss USA,‚Äù says Savannah. ‚ÄúIt is my dream job and I know with my platform I can help many women.‚Äù Savannah details her goals as the new Miss Hawai‚Äòi USA: ‚ÄúMy goals for my reign as Miss Hawai‚Äòi USA is to really utilize my platform and help the betterment of my community. I am an ambassador and program director for What Makes You Feel Beautiful, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization I work with. I believe in our mission statement to help women cultivate self-love at every age and phase of life. I plan on going into the school systems here in Hawai‚Äòi and talk to high school girls about my F.L.Y. (first love yourself) workshops I will be having this year. I am so excited to be able to help younger women flourish and I am doing this because I wish I had this growing up.‚Äù Savannah encourages others to participate in pageants. ‚ÄúMy advice to any girl who wants to join pageantry is DO IT! Believe in yourself because that‚Äôs exactly what I did. You never want to have regrets later on in life for not trying and the best part about pageantry is the personal growth that comes from it. I have grown tremendously, my confidence in myself, speaking and the opportunities that arise from it.‚Äù Savannah is so grateful to be able to represent Maui. ‚ÄúI am so happy that I was representing my home island of Maui. I hope I made Maui proud. I just want to say Thank You to everyone for supporting me. Joining Miss Hawai‚Äòi USA was the best thing to happen to me and this journey I am on is one to remember.‚Äù Alfredo Evangelista‚Äôs Mom Catalina was crowned Mrs. Philippines‚Äîa popularity contest‚Äîby the United Sons and Daughters of Ilocano Regions Organization during its Rizal Day ceremonies in 1968.'}]"

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'By Keli‚Äòi Akina Some Hawaii policymakers might say it‚Äôs not possible to address Hawaii‚Äôs housing crisis without spending big bucks on public construction projects. But I have exciting news. Not only is it possible, my team at the Grassroot Institute of Hawaii has produced a roadmap that can help make it happen. Our latest report, written by Grassroot policy researcher Jonathan Helton, offers an overview of the different policies Hawaii lawmakers could embrace to help boost the state‚Äôs housing supply relatively quickly and at no cost to Hawaii taxpayers. Titled ‚ÄúHow to facilitate more homebuilding in Hawaii,‚Äù the report does not call for government housing programs, nor does it present a one-size-fits-all ‚Äúsolution‚Äù to the housing crisis. Rather, it identifies changes that legislators could make as soon as possible without infringing on property rights or depleting state or county funds. Many of the proposals in the report do not require the government to do much more than remove the barriers that have prevented innovation and frustrated the construction of new homes to begin with. For example, a policy called ‚Äúadaptive reuse‚Äù would permit homebuilders to more easily convert existing office buildings to residential use. This is not only financially practical but also more environmentally friendly. Another helpful reform would be for Hawaii‚Äôs counties to expand their mixed-use zoning areas. This would encourage homes and businesses to co-exist on the same block, or even in the same building, which would promote walkable neighborhoods and creative housing solutions. The new Grassroot policy brief also talks about the importance of making it easier for homeowners to build accessory dwelling units, commonly known in Hawaii as ohana units. We often think of ADUs as housing for elderly relatives ‚Äî hence the term ‚Äúohana homes‚Äù ‚Äî but they also have demonstrated great potential as an affordable rental option. Helton also suggests removing regulations that require a certain number of parking spaces for homes and businesses ‚Äî because land devoted to parking is land that cannot be used for living. But perhaps the option with the most potential to increase our much-needed housing supply is ‚Äúupzoning.‚Äù In general, the concept refers to allowing more homes such as duplexes, triplexes and even small ‚Äústarter homes‚Äù to be built where formerly there were only single-family dwellings surrounded by large yards. Elements of upzoning include lot-splitting, reducing setbacks and adjusting floor area ratios. If applied in a comprehensive manner, upzoning could yield big rewards. Taken together, all of these policy options are wonderful ideas that Hawaii lawmakers would do well to implement. But as Helton makes clear, our legislators also need to put an end to Hawaii‚Äôs notorious permitting and approval delays. After all, what good is a plan to build more housing if you cannot obtain the permits to build in a timely, cost-effective manner? Helton suggests two policy reforms to address this issue. First, the counties could adopt self-certification programs that allow qualified architects to vouch for building plans themselves ‚Äî perhaps subject to random audits by city officials to make sure they are not violating zoning or building code requirements. Honolulu recently adopted such a plan, following in the footsteps of cities such as Chicago and New York that have successfully been using self-permitting for decades. The second permitting reform would be to authorize ‚Äúby right‚Äù approvals so projects that meet all the legal requirements can proceed without discretionary approvals from neighborhood boards, planning departments or county councils. Most important, this new report demonstrates how much we can do to grow housing in Hawaii simply by reforming existing regulations. And it doesn‚Äôt reinvent the wheel. These are all tried-and-true solutions that have been proven throughout the nation and around the world to facilitate the creation of new housing. We cannot solve Hawaii‚Äôs housing crisis overnight, but there are plenty of ways we can make housing more affordable and available without burdening taxpayers ‚Äî and my team‚Äôs new report outlines what some of those ways could be.__________ Keli‚Äòi Akina is president and CEO of the Grassroot Institute of Hawaii. comments Enter your email address to subscribe and receive notifications of new posts by email.
