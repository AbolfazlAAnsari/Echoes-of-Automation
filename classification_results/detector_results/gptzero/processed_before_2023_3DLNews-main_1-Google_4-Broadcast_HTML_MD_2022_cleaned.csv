Texas) — Uvalde, Texas, shooting victim Makenna Lee Elrod loved butterflies so much that they were released at her funeral in June. Several landed on her siblings and her mother, April Elrod, who said it felt like the 10-year-old was sending them a sign. “One landed on my shoulder, one landed on her sister’s shoe, which is silly because Makenna is three years younger than her sister but they were the same size shoe and they always fought over shoes,” said Elrod, who spoke with ABC News for her first interview since the tragedy on May 24. “One landed on her daddy’s tie,” she added. Elrod recently got a tattoo in Makenna’s honor, she said. Flowers grace her forearm, representing each of her children, and a butterfly sits above Makenna’s flower. She asked Georgia woodworker Sean Peacock to make her two benches shaped like butterflies in Makenna’s honor, but she didn’t expect he’d make them for free, let alone honor all 21 victims with butterfly benches of their own using donations from GoFundMe. Elrod has called meeting Peacock “a blessing.” He said the donation is a “love story.” “He and I’ve been talking since and when I’m having a bad day, he just seems to be the one that messages and says you know, we’re praying for you,” Elrod said. “Her story has brought people closer together. And I mean, what more can you ask for?” A prayer vigil was held Monday in Uvalde Town Square as the benches were unveiled. The benches were laid alongside crosses that had been put up around the square’s fountain to honor each victim, with many adorned with rosaries, teddy bears, photos and flowers. Families of several victims joined the Elrod family at the vigil, admiring the benches as the sun went down. Elrod said Makenna was loved by many, making friends everywhere she went. She said people continue to come up to her and tell her stories about Makenna that she hadn’t heard before. “When she played softball, she would take an extra 30 minutes to say goodbye at the softball fields before we can leave,” Elrod said. She was also loved by her teachers, one of whom was a close friend to the Elrods. Irma Garcia, who also died in the shooting, was shielding Makenna during the attack. Elrod herself is a teacher in Uvalde, at Dalton Elementary. “I knew her and knew what an amazing teacher she was. And so I requested for her to be Makenna’s teacher that year, or this year, and Makenna had a wonderful year. And she was growing. And I mean, she really was having a great year and, and Miss Garcia was an amazing teacher. Amazing,” Elrod said. “And I know that she, that when she left this Earth, that she was being held by Miss Garcia, and she was trying to protect her.” When people remember Makenna, Elrod wants them to remember her daughter’s bright smile and welcoming demeanor, as well as her faith. They hope her spirit lives on through a butterfly garden near their home, as well as the memorials of her scattered throughout the city. “I feel like we’re gonna keep Makenna’s memory alive because we’re gonna love big, like Makenna did,” Elrod said.

two-year-old sister from a fire that destroyed their home Tuesday evening in Salisbury. Keishuana Banks says the one thing she’s most thankful for this Thanksgiving Day is to have her children alive and by her side. She says she was out buying food in preparation for Thanksgiving when she learned that the second story of her apartment had gone up in flames. “I am so grateful for my son because if it were not for my son, my daughter probably would’ve still been stuck up in the smoke because he said when he went back up the stairs to look for his sister, it was already black,” Banks explained to our Rob Petree, holding back tears at the thought of losing her children. The fire was reported right around 6 p.m., in the apartment located at 1302 Jersey Road. At the home at the time of the fire was Bank’s 11-year-old son, Laprentis Doughty, who sprung into action to save his little sister, right where the fire was raging. “I woke up and it was very hot,” Doughty said. “I heard a fire alarm and that’s how I woke up, and I was looking around and the door was creaked open and it blew open and then all the flames, I could see black smoke, and I saw fire.” Doughty got out of bed and yelled down to warn his mother’s friend who was watching him and his sister. “I ran downstairs and they tried to pour water on the flames but it didn’t work,” Doughty told our Rob Petree. “When I was at the last step, I realized I forgot my sister and I ran back upstairs to get her. I knew I had to save my sister because I heard her crying when I went downstairs. If I left my sister, I couldn’t live with myself leaving my sister in the house when I got out the house.” Firefighters were able to control the blaze in roughly 10 minutes. State fire marshals determined that the fire began in a second floor bedroom and was caused by an unspecified electrical event at an outlet in the bedroom. While saving his sister, Doughty suffered minor burns while making his second escape from the apartment. His injuries were so minor that he did not require medical attention at the scene. Meanwhile, the family has lost everything and is in dire need of donations to start over, right in the middle of the holiday season. The entire ordeal has left Banks and her family traumatized. “I feel like I’m living in a nightmare,” Banks said holding back tears. “I can’t even think straight right now. I feel like I need everything, but I want my children to be good, I want my children to be happy, and I don’t want them to remember this, so I have to stay strong on the outside but on the inside I’m dying forreal.” Bank’s said the community has already went above and beyond to help her family, even going so far as to provide them with a new place to live following the tragedy, but there’s still so much more that they still need. “We lost everything,” Banks said. “I’m thinking of the clothes we have to replace, so I’m going out buying clothes, but there’s a place for us, someone has a place for us, they opened up an apartment for us, and I’m so grateful to that person. After I told my son we’re going to be able to go to sleep peaceful tonight, I realized we got to get blinds, pots and pans, curtains, sheets, and it’s really like starting all the way from the bottom.” A GoFundMe account has been set up to assist the family. Total fire damage has been estimated at $290,000. No other injuries were reported. Of the eight units impacted, officials say two are uninhabitable due to the fire.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Elon Musk’s abrupt suspension of several journalists who cover Twitter widens a growing rift between the social media site and media organizations that have used the platform to build their audiences. Individual reporters with The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, Voice of America and other news agencies saw their accounts go dark Thursday. Musk tweeted late Friday that the company would lift the suspensions following the results of a public poll on the site. The poll showed 58.7% of respondents favored a move to immediately unsuspend accounts over 41.3% who said the suspensions should be lifted in seven days. The company has not explained why the accounts were taken down. But Musk took to Twitter on Thursday night to accuse journalists of sharing private information about his whereabouts, which he described as “basically assassination coordinates.” He provided no evidence for that claim. Many advertisers abandoned Twitter over content moderation questions after Musk acquired it in October, and he now risks a rupture with media organizations, which are among the most active on the platform. Most of the accounts were back early Saturday, with some exceptions and at least one new suspension. Washington Post reporter Taylor Lorenz confirmed in an email to The Associated Press that her Twitter account was suspended Saturday evening. Her online newsletter published on Substack said she was working on a story involving Musk and had sought comment from him through a Twitter post shortly before her account was suspended. Business Insider’s Linette Lopez was suspended Friday, also with no explanation, she told The Associated Press. Lopez published a series of articles between 2018 and 2021 highlighting what she called dangerous Tesla manufacturing shortcomings. Shortly before being suspended, she said she had posted court-related documents to Twitter that included a 2018 Musk email address. That address is not current, Lopez said, because “he changes his email every few weeks.” On Tuesday, she posted a 2019 story about Tesla troubles, commenting, “Now, just like then, most of @elonmusk’s wounds are self inflicted.” The same day, she cited reports that Musk was reneging on severance for laid-off Twitter employees, threatening workers who talk to the media and refusing to make rent payments. Lopez described his actions as “classic Elon-going-for-broke behavior.” Steve Herman, a national correspondent for Voice of America, told The Associated Press that his suspended Twitter account still hadn’t been fully restored as of Saturday afternoon because of his refusal to delete three tweets that the company flagged for purportedly sharing Musk’s whereabouts. Although Herman’s Twitter timeline is now visible to most users, he said he can’t see it himself nor can he post anything new until he removes the tweets that the company contends violate its revised terms of service. “I am in a new level of purgatory,” Herman said. “I do not believe anything I have tweeted violated any reasonable standard of any social media platform.” Alarm over the suspensions extended beyond media circles to the United Nations, which was reconsidering its involvement in Twitter. The move sets “a dangerous precedent at a time when journalists all over the world are facing censorship, physical threats and even worse,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. The reporters’ suspensions followed Musk’s decision Wednesday to permanently ban an account that automatically tracked the flights of his private jet using publicly available data. That also led Twitter to change its rules for all users to prohibit the sharing of another person’s current location without their consent. Several of the reporters suspended Thursday night had been writing about the new policy and Musk’s rationale for imposing it, which involved his allegations about a stalking incident he said affected his family Tuesday night in Los Angeles. The official Twitter account for Mastodon, a decentralized alternative social network where many Twitter users are fleeing, was also banned. The reason was unclear, though it had tweeted about the jet-tracking account. Twitter also began preventing users from posting links to Mastodon accounts, in some cases flagging them as potential malware. “This is of course a bald-faced lie,” cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs posted. Explaining the reporter bans, Musk tweeted, “Same doxxing rules apply to ‘journalists’ as to everyone else.” He later added: “Criticizing me all day long is totally fine, but doxxing my real-time location and endangering my family is not.” ” Doxxing ” refers to disclosing someone’s identity, address, phone number or other personal details that violate their privacy and could bring harm. The Washington Post’s executive editor, Sally Buzbee, said technology reporter Drew Harwell “was banished without warning, process or explanation” following the publication of accurate reporting about Musk. CNN said in a statement that “the impulsive and unjustified suspension of a number of reporters, including CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan, is concerning but not surprising.” “Twitter’s increasing instability and volatility should be of incredible concern for everyone who uses Twitter,” the statement added. Another suspended journalist, Matt Binder of the technology news outlet Mashable, said he was banned Thursday night immediately after sharing a screenshot that O’Sullivan had posted before his own suspension. The screenshot showed a statement from the Los Angeles Police Department sent earlier Thursday to multiple media outlets, including the AP, about how it was in touch with Musk’s representatives about the alleged stalking incident. Binder said he did not share any location data or any links to the jet-tracking account or other location-tracking accounts. “I have been highly critical of Musk but never broke any of Twitter’s listed policies,” Binder said in an email. The suspensions come as Musk makes major changes to content moderation on Twitter. He has tried, through the release of selected company documents dubbed “The Twitter Files,” to claim the platform suppressed right-wing voices under its previous leaders. He has promised to let free speech reign and has reinstated high-profile accounts that previously broke Twitter’s rules against hateful conduct or harmful misinformation. He has also said he would suppress negativity and hate by depriving some accounts of “freedom of reach.” Opinion columnist Bari Weiss, who tweeted out some of “The Twitter Files,” called for the suspended journalists to be reinstated. “The old regime at Twitter governed by its own whims and biases and it sure looks like the new regime has the same problem,” she tweeted “I oppose it in both cases.” If the suspensions lead to the exodus of media organizations that are highly active on Twitter, the platform would be changed at the fundamental level, said Lou Paskalis, longtime marketing and media executive and former Bank of America head of global media. CBS briefly shut down its activity on Twitter in November due to “uncertainty” about new management, but media organizations have largely remained on the platform. “We all know news breaks on Twitter … and to now go after journalists really saws at the main foundational tent pole of Twitter,” Paskalis said. “Driving journalists off Twitter is the biggest self-inflicted wound I can think of.” The suspensions may be the biggest red flag yet for advertisers, Paskalis said, some of which had already cut their spending on Twitter over uncertainty about the direction Musk is taking the platform. “It is an overt demonstration of what advertisers fear the most — retribution for an action that Elon doesn’t agree with,” he added. On Thursday night, Twitter’s Spaces conference chat went down shortly after Musk abruptly signed out of a session hosted by a journalist during which he had been questioned about the reporters’ ousting. Musk later tweeted that Spaces had been taken offline to deal with a “Legacy bug.” Late Friday, Spaces returned. Advertisers are also monitoring the potential loss of Twitter users. Twitter is projected to lose 32 million users over the next two years, according to a forecast by Insider Intelligence, which cited technical issues and the return of accounts banned for offensive posts. Meanwhile, some Twitter alternatives are gaining momentum. Mastodon on Friday had more than 6 million users, nearly double the 3.4 million it had on the day Musk took ownership of Twitter. On many of the thousands of confederated networks in the open-source Mastodon platform, administrators and users solicited donations as disaffected Twitter users strained computing resources. Many of the networks, known as “instances,” are crowd-funded. The platform is designed to be ad-free. ___ Associated Press writers Kelvin Chan in London, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Frank Bajak in Boston and Hillel Italie and Edith Lederer in New York contributed to this report.
