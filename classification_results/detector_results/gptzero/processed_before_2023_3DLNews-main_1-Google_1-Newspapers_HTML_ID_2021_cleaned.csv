SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — An advertising-technology billionaire has formally resigned his membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and rebuked the faith over social issues and LGBTQ rights in an unusual public move. Jeff T. Green has pledged to donate 90% of his estimated $5 billion fortune, starting with a $600,000 donation to the LGBTQ-rights group Equality Utah, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. Green said in a Monday resignation letter to church President Russell M. Nelson that he hasn’t been active in the faith widely known as Mormon for more than a decade but wanted to make his departure official and remove his name from membership records. “I believe the Mormon church has hindered global progress in women’s rights, civil rights and racial equality, and LGBTQ+ rights,” he wrote. Eleven family members and a friend formally resigned along with him. The church didn’t immediately return a message from The Associated Press seeking comment Tuesday, but in recent years has shown a willingness to engage on LGBTQ rights that is unusual for a conservative faith. It maintains its doctrinal opposition to same-sex marriage and intimacy, but the faith didn’t block a 2019 ban on so-called conversion therapy in Utah and in November high-ranking leader Dallin Oaks called for a recognition of both religious rights and LGBTQ rights. Still, the church has taken positions over the years that have been deeply painful for many in the LGBTQ community. Green, for his part, said most church members “are good people trying to do right,” but he also worries about the faith’s transparency around its history and finances. Green, 44, now lives in Southern California. He is the CEO and chairman of The Trade Desk, an advertising-technology firm he founded in 2009. He also mentioned concerns about a $100 billion investment portfolio held by the faith. It was the subject of an Internal Revenue Service whistleblower complaint in 2019, from a former employee who charged the church had improperly built it up using member donations that are supposed to go to charitable causes. Leaders have defended how the church uses and invests member donations, saying most is used for operational and humanitarian needs, but a portion is safeguarded to build a reserve for the future. The faith annually spends about $1 billion on humanitarian and welfare aid, leaders have said. The church has also come under criticism for conservative social positions. Women do not hold the priesthood in the faith, and Black men could not until the 1970s. In recent years, though, the faith has worked with the NAACP and donated nearly $10 million for initiatives to help Black Americans. It has also worked with Equality Utah to pass a state LGBTQ nondiscrimination law, with religious exemptions. Another prominent onetime Latter-day Saint sued the faith this year, accusing it of fraud and seeking to recover millions of dollars in contributions. James Huntsman is a member of one of Utah’s most well-known families and brother of a former governor. The suit was later tossed out.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Icon Awards Catie Clark//January 22, 2021// Legal churn: The Nelson-Ricks Cheese Company bankruptcy Catie Clark//January 22, 2021// For the residents of eastern Idaho, the news that the Nelson-Ricks Cheese Company had filed for Chapter 11 in November 2020 was not much of a surprise. The real news was that it was news at all because the cheese plant shut down in 2018. The bankruptcy filing is unusual because it was contested: the treasurer of the firm, who is also the wife of the current CEO, filed a motion to have the Chapter 11 dismissed. On Jan. 14, the U.S. Bankruptcy court in Idaho granted that motion. The wife, Mary Greenberg, claimed to be the only shareholder with sole power to file for bankruptcy. She also stated that she was not consulted on the Chapter 11. The CEO, Michael Greenberg, was the party who initiated the bankruptcy. He claimed he was the sole shareholder. The situation is complicated because the couple is in the middle of a divorce in California. “It’s not the same family business that used to run it,” explained Kurt Hibbert of Sugar City, who worked at the cheese factory for a short time in the 1990s. “It’s a completely different outfit now and they didn’t keep it going either. It’s sad when the old businesses die.” A famous old business For more than a century, Nelson-Ricks Creamery Company was a prominent business in eastern Idaho. Founded in 1907 by members of two eastern Idaho pioneer families, the creamery once operated 12 locations from Salmon, Idaho, to Afton, Wyo., and Salt Lake City. The Ricks name alone should ring a bell with most Idahoans, because Thomas Ricks was the founding father of Rexburg. He also established the Bannock Stake Academy in 1888. It was renamed Ricks Academy in 1903 and became Ricks College, owned and operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and then BYU-Idaho in 2001. The creamery moved its corporate office to Salt Lake City sometime before 1920. Early on, the firm concentrated on milk and butter. Over time, it shifted its business to focus on its Banquet brand of cheese. It closed or sold off its smaller locations as refrigeration and milk-hauling technology advanced. The new cheese plant By the 1960s, the creamery consolidated cheesemaking in Rexburg and packaging in Salt Lake City. The firm built a new cheese plant just north of Rexburg, on the unincorporated edge of Sugar City in 1975, along the south channel of the Teton River. The mothballed Nelson-Ricks cheese plant in Sugar City from the southeast. Photo by Catie Clark “The old original plant was located on College Avenue in Rexburg,” Nelson-Ricks vice president Kirk Mackert told the Idaho State Journal in 2007, “but it had a fire, so the plant in Sugar City was built.” The new plant ran for three months before the Teton Dam Flood in 1976. The flood shut the plant down for almost six months. The company survived the flood, but not the Great Recession. The cheese plant employed 40 workers in 2007. By 2012, that number was down to 16. Despite landing a contract with Walmart, the company decided to close its doors rather than run in the red. “It’s difficult for smaller plants to compete. There were too many years of downturns,” Nelson-Ricks President Reagan Wood told the Rexburg Standard Journal in October, 2012. In 2012, the Lakeview Cheese Co. of Las Vegas purchased the Salt Lake City facility and the rights to the Banquet brand. The sale included the www.banquetcheese.com website and a limited license to use of the Nelson-Ricks Creamery name. Mike and Mary Greenberg, owners of the Greenberg Cheese Company in Southern California, bought the Sugar City cheese plant and the Nelson-Ricks brand name in 2013. The Greenbergs incorporated the Nelson Ricks Cheese Company and restarted the plant by 2014. Mike Greenberg was the president and Mary the secretary of the corporation. In 2014, the cheese company sold the Nelson-Ricks Creamery brand name, along with the plant and its equipment, to a shell company the Greenbergs created called NRCC Asset Acquisition. At the same time, they terminated Lakeview’s limited license to use the Nelson-Ricks mark. In response, Lakeview updated the Banquet website to remove all links to “About Us” webpage that used the creamery’s name, but did not remove the page. Trademark lawsuit A defeat in NRCC’s civil suit against Lakewood may have direct bearing on the current bankruptcy. In 2015, NRCC found the “About Us” page was still accessible if the URL was manually typed into a web browser. It sent Lakeview a cease-and-desist letter and Lakeview removed all reference to the Nelson-Ricks Creamery on the page. Nonetheless, NRCC immediately sued Lakeview for trademark infringement. In a July 2018 summary judgement, Judge David Nye of the U.S. District Court, Idaho Division, ruled against NRCC, finding that Lakeview had not used the mark in commerce and therefore had not infringed on the mark. In November 2018, the court ruled that NRCC should pay Lakeview’s legal fees because “NRCC did not have a colorable claim to begin with and it pursued this litigation in an unreasonable manner.” NRCC appealed. In August 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the award of attorney fees to Lakeview. NRCC immediately filed a motion for rehearing, which was subsequently denied. Lakeview immediately moved for a Writ of Execution and began post-judgment discovery to collect its legal fees from NRCC. In document filed with the court, Lakeview stated it took these actions because it believed that NRCC might transfer or dispose of assets to avoid paying the award. In September, 2020, Judge Nye found NRCC in contempt: “NRCC’s behavior during the pendency of this litigation has been inappropriate and unwarranted. NRCC brought this suit to bully, harass, and otherwise inconvenience Lakeview … It has been over one year since Lakeview served discovery on NRCC in an effort to collect its lawfully obtained fees and close this chapter of this frivolous lawsuit.” Chapter 11 and a divorce The cheese plant closed in 2018. It was listed for sale by food plant broker and auctioneer Harry Davis & Co. of Pittsburgh, in 2019. The firm’s CEO, Leonard Davis confirmed that they were brokering the sale of the plant: “We represented the creamery when they sold that plant in 2013 and now we are selling it again.” Davis said the plant was in turnkey condition. In January, 2020, Mary Greenberg filed for divorce in Los Angeles County. On November 8, counsel Aaron Tolson of Idaho Falls filed for Chapter 11 Subchapter V on behalf of Michael Greenberg for the Nelson-Ricks Cheese Company. Subsequent filings disclosed that the cheese company had $0 of real property and $860,000 in personal property. In the list of creditors, the firm leading the list was the Magic Valley Quality Milk Producers, which was owed $256,428. Lakewood Cheese was listed as the seventh creditor, owed $21,567. Tenth on the list of creditors is Peter Hermes of Hermes Law Group in Los Angeles, Michael Greenberg’s legal counsel for the divorce case in California. On Nov. 25, counsel Holly Roark of Boise filed a motion to have the bankruptcy dismissed on behalf of Mary Greenberg. In the motion to dismiss, Mary Greenberg stated: “I do not consent to the filing of this bankruptcy case and will not ratify it. I am in a contested divorce proceeding with Michael Greenberg in California and believe that this filing is just to delay those proceedings.” Objections and allegations Tolson filed an objection to the motion to dismiss, which included documents with Mary Greenberg’s signature indicating that she transferred ownership to Michael. Mary countered with a handwriting analysis of those documents performed by Beth Chrisman, an acknowledged and experienced expert witness in handwriting analysis from California. Chrisman reported that in her expert opinion, Mary Greenberg did not sign the documents in question. She further opined that Michael Greenberg had written her signature instead. According to PACER court records, on Jan. 14, Judge Joseph Maier granted Mary Greenberg’s motion to dismiss. Roark was given a deadline of Feb. 5 to file briefs “in support of Sanctions (sic)” and other paperwork. Rebuttals by Michael Greenberg or any other involved parties are due by Feb. 26. The next hearing date is March 10. Tolson did not respond to an inquiry on the case; U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee Gary Rainsdon and Roark declined to comment.

MOSCOW — Valerie Mesenbrink never tires of seeing the confidence young men gain just by putting on a suit. Chuck Pezeshki It’s been a rough week for National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Tony Fauci, the chief medical advisor to the president. No one in power has been as wrong about so much, so consistently as him. And while I started out having hopes that he could help align the nation’s COVID-19 response, it’s become obvious that not only does Fauci not know what he’s doing, he may be actively sabotaging our nation’s health to cover his own backside. But this is an important question — clown or evil elf? There’s plenty of evidence for both. Fauci was the original spokesman way back in March 2020 against masks. But when he saw the potential to turn our lives into clown world, he started advocating for them. More recently, our proponent of clown world told us to “mask up!” at outdoor football games — perhaps the stupidest, unscientific notion possible at this stage of the pandemic. Just so you understand, dear reader — think about the enforcement impossibilities of mask mandates at football games. You’d a) have to have lots of security guards, and b) those selfsame temporary employees would have to be willing to risk life and limb attempting to get a drunken college kid to get their mask over their nose while their belly was full of Everclear and grape juice. Trust me — there are not enough labor-ready employees on game day, loitering outside the Home Depot in Lewiston to pull off that nonsense; $14 an hour just ain’t worth it. Besides the obvious science that says that masks are ineffective at best — and entirely irrelevant in outside venues. There are so many missteps by Fauci, one might have preferential leanings toward “Chief Clown at the National Institutes of Health.” Certainly, with the ensemble of bad advice out of that organization, one could make the case. But this has not been a good week for labeling Fauci the chief clown. He’s been busy as a clown, of course. But his role as evil elf has really been in the forefront of the news cycle. Consider the latest pronouncement on the national news shows earlier this week, where Fauci came out and told folks not to make Christmas plans. Killing Grandma again was the reason, though the vast majority of us have followed the various mandates to get vaccinated. Including Grandma. With boosters. The Biden administration sent out their official evil elf handlers from the CDC, yanked Fauci off the stage, made up some BS story about how it was all a big mistake, and that folks should gather for Christmas with their families. That’s certainly enough to earn him the evil elf label. Christmas and elves go together. And only evil elves want to sabotage the holiday season. But unfortunately, that’s not the end of it. More information is emerging on the connections between Fauci, a researcher named Peter Daszak, and the Wuhan lab. No red string or pinboard needed to connect the dots on whether Fauci funded “gain of function” research on the Sars-COV virus. It’s all in a string of leaked grant proposals to both the Department of Defense (which said no) and Fauci at his position at the NIH, who said yes. Worse, it’s becoming evident that Fauci funded work that actually released COVID into the wild through bats. It’s so stunning, it seems almost impossible to believe. But it explains a lot, at least with the evil elf take. Why would such a charlatan keep us in constant turmoil, if not to distract from his evil misdeeds? While the rest of us, and especially our children, deal with guidance from the CDC that turns our lives into clown world, Fauci is executing a double switcheroo so we end up blaming poor peasants and pangolins in China for a global pandemic that he, in no small part, engineered. “It didn’t have to be that way” is one of the taglines of the pandemic. It didn’t — but now it’s time for accountability for the real source of our misery. Clown or evil elf — it makes no difference. Fire Fauci now.

Introducing novices to the basics of yoga is a priority for Beatriz Merl, the owner of a new yoga studio in downtown Lewiston. When Patrick O\'Connell graduated from the University of Idaho with a landscape architecture degree in 1982, he put his parents on a plane home to Chicago and headed to a restaurant to figure out his future, with just $33 in his pocket. While there, his future came to him, as a client he had while in school asked about his work. O\'Connell postponed, then canceled, an interview with a landscape architecture firm when his own one-man landscaping show was suddenly booked four months out, and his student days were barely behind him. It\'s been 30 years since then, and 28 since O\'Connell moved his business, North Country Landscaping, to 3.5 acres of land just east of downtown Moscow off the Troy Highway. ""I feel real content and proud,"" O\'Connell said this week, looking over his verdant property. ""I think 30 years is quite a milestone, and I feel really good about that."" Some 45,000 clients have to feel pretty good, too. In his time in Moscow, O\'Connell estimates he\'s planted the equivalent to both sides of the highway to Lewiston. But although the business itself, which can consume up to 14 hours a day, six days a week at its height in the summer, is important, O\'Connell keeps going for the connections it yields. ""Those relationships are rewarding,"" he said of clients. ""After 30 years, I\'ve done more than one job for a lot of people. Say I did a job for them in 1982, then they move up to a family house in 1994, and they might call me again to do a job in 2012 when the kids are out of the house and they downsize. I think that says a lot about a business."" One long-ago client, now O\'Connell\'s children\'s doctor, still brings him out for work. Employee tenure also speaks to O\'Connell\'s longevity. His foreman has been with him for 25 years, and many of his part-time employees are UI students, who just keep coming back. And on more than one occasion, a familiar last name stands out. ""I\'ve had several times where the dad has worked for me, and then the son comes and works for me,"" he said. ""I\'ve had a lot of great kids come through here."" Now, many of them keep O\'Connell, his wife and two children on their Christmas lists. O\'Connell doesn\'t just sell a plant. He can\'t compete with the major discount stores to sell bushes and herbs and make a profit, but instead focuses his work on making customers happy and keeping up their yards, year after year. After the initial project design and install, he or his team will come back in a year or two to make sure it still looks good. And even through a tough economy, O\'Connell says he\'s seen no drop in business. ""I feel guilty, but we haven\'t even hit a bump,"" he said of business. ""Business is up, actually. I think people put money into their property and they see it as an investment."" That\'s ranged from gazebos and ponds to pocket patios, retaining walls, porches and more. Landscaping trends come and go, but everyone wants a place to relax, O\'Connell said. ""The business has really grown,"" he said. ""The nursery itself is a full-time business."" Although the published nursery store hours are limited, a sign by the door has O\'Connell\'s cell number and clients know they can call him if they need to. He lives just minutes away and can swing in to work, he said. That doesn\'t make it easy. ""There have been sacrifices,"" he said. ""There always are when you have your own business. I say I\'m married to two things - my wife and my business. It\'s a juggling act."" With his children - now 11 and 15 - in adolescence, with more activities, sports and hobbies, there\'s more jostling around of O\'Connell\'s already busy schedule, he said. But it\'s worth it, he said. Time at the nursery is relaxing, with trees shielding the plot from the highway and backing up to the Paradise Path trail. O\'Connell has seen coyotes, beaver and muskrat, and says deer and other large herbivores aren\'t uncommon, as well as plentiful bikers, walkers and families. Others have noticed the serenity of the nursery, with photographers regularly coming in for photo shoots, like senior portraits, and one business inquiring about a wine tasting. O\'Connell is happy to accommodate, although he said the wine tasting wasn\'t the best idea, since the only restroom on hand is an outhouse. Students also come to the nursery for plant identification classes and leaf samples, and O\'Connell has been involved with the Latah and Paradise Path trail developments. He helped design the plan for the Commemorative Park and participates in auctions and fundraisers for local schools. Although he gives back, he sees it as part of being a good community member - not going above and beyond. ""I want to see Moscow bloom,"" he said. And through the years, the products on hand have changed. Now, more people want low-maintenance, easy plants for smaller spaces and yards. It reflects national downsizing trends, as baby boomers see their kids grow up and decide to move into a smaller place. ""People might\'ve enjoyed gardening when they were younger, but now they want something that looks nice without a lot of time and work,"" O\'Connell said. But the business itself has also changed. Where O\'Connell learned to design with a T-square and a triangle, today\'s students are learning with computer programs. He never took a business class and learned on the go; now, he suggests all grads be familiar with the basics. Although O\'Connell never really planned on owning his own business, he\'s been pleased with the results. ""You only have yourself to depend on, and you only have yourself to blame,"" he said. With 30 years behind him, and an unknown future - O\'Connell has had two hip replacements and says he feels 15 years younger - he\'s happy to reflect. ""At the end of the day, looking up, you\'ve created something,"" he said of his work. ""I want people to be happy and for my work to stand the test of time. The goal is to enjoy what you\'re doing. We work and we die."" North Country Landscaping is at 333 Troy Road in Moscow. The office phone number is (208) 882-6878.

CANYON COUNTY — Christmas and New Years were quiet affairs in Nampa in 1918, since the influenza ban prevented any public gatherings. Nowadays, during the second pandemic in the last century, Idaho is anything but quiet. People have protested outside a hospital in North Idaho as patients die inside during a Crisis Standards of Care initiative, the first in state history. There were similar disagreements and conflicts during the previous pandemic, however, the state faces new challenges now, experts said. Almost 103 years ago, Idaho’s Spanish flu response began similarly to March 2020. Restrictions were put in place. “That there is some fear of the Spanish influenza becoming epidemic in Idaho is shown by the fact that the State Board of Health held a (meeting) in Boise Tuesday,” read the Nampa Leader-Herald on Oct. 11, 1918. “And after (considering) the matter decided to close all places of public meeting against schools.” It is unclear where the Spanish flu came from, however, the first known case in the world was reported in Kansas on March 11, 1918. Because of wartime censorship, however, cases were not reported in the newspapers of any country at war. Spain, however, remained neutral throughout World War I, so its journalists were allowed to report on cases, leaving many to believe that was the Spanish flu\'s origin. The Spanish influenza was one of the deadliest pandemics in history, lasting for the most part from Spring 1918 to Summer 1919. The disease infected around 500 million people worldwide, which at the time was around a third of the planet’s population. Somewhere between 20 million and 50 million people died. In just one year, 1918, American life expectancy dropped 12 years. The United States recently passed the death toll from the 1918 pandemic. Almost 693,000 people have died of COVID-19, around 20,000 more than the Spanish flu killed, though the country\'s population is more than three times larger now. The coronavirus pandemic took hold in the U.S. in March 2020 and continues today. The Gem State’s first Spanish influenza deaths were in the second week of October 1918, according to Ginger Floerchinger-Franks, a retired public health official who has been researching the pandemic to write a book. The first deaths were in Shoshone, Bingham and Minidoka counties, Floerchinger-Franks said. All told, she said, her calculations show more than 2,300 deaths in Idaho from the Spanish influenza. COVID-19 has killed more than 2,800 Idahoans, according to the state\'s COVID-19 dashboard, though more than four times as many people live in the state now as did in 1918 when the state had just over 400,000 residents. “It kind of spread out in circles from the first places that it started, so it kind of formed out up north,” Floerchinger-Franks said of the 1918 outbreak in Idaho. “That little strip of counties that run across the center of the state … the mountainous ones, that’s the last place we saw it.” Many of the same or similar public health measures seen now were in effect in 1918 as well, Floerchinger-Franks said, including limits on who and how many people could enter stores, which had to close at 6 p.m. “They were strict about it then,” Floerchinger-Frans said. “Here, it doesn’t seem like there are any consequences. But back then if you were a businessman and people came in that weren’t supposed to, they would arrest you. They didn’t fool around.” On March 25, 2020, Gov. Brad Little issued a statewide stay-home order and signed an extreme emergency declaration. The order required citizens to “self-isolate at home if you can, not just if you are sick.” He later extended it through April 30. That stay-home order, which is among the least restrictive that any state put in place, became fodder for his opponents. Some, including Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin, are running for office on the promise of no restrictions. McGeachin, who is challenging Little in the 2022 election, temporarily banned mask mandates in May while Little was out of state, a move he rescinded the next day. In 1918, Idaho officials were not immune from criticism against the public health measures. People opposed the health board’s order from Oct. 8, 1918, to close all public meeting places because few cities out East took similar measures. Some Idahoans thought the orders were premature. “(Those opposed) also feel that if there be real danger that schools as well as churches and other places should be closed,” the Nampa Leader-Herald reported on Oct. 11. “It looks now as though the proprietors of picture houses, church officers and others would unite for a modification of the order to the extent that those public places be not closed till a case of the influenza has appeared in any given community.” The federal government had sent the head of the state board of health to Idaho, Floerching-Franks said, and several cities and counties fought him on his orders. “It was acrimonious,” Floerching-Franks said. “Boise city, they really, really disliked this guy from the federal government … they were really against him and they took him to court.” Boise also changed its city’s board of health membership, from eight or nine people down to three, all of whom did not want federal government mandates, Floerching-Franks said. Similarly, leaders in Ada, Boise, Valley and Elmore counties recently appointed Dr. Ryan Cole to the Central District Health Board. Cole has spread misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines, which experts have said are safe and effective. The Idaho Legislature also passed SB 1060 this year, which gives county commissioners more power over public health districts. The law makes it so if the district board of health makes an order applying to everyone in a county or public health district, the county commissioners will make the final decision on the order. CONCERNS, HARDSHIPS EXISTED In 1918, other cities and counties besides Boise were serious about the pandemic. In Payette County, for example, train stations weren’t allowed to sell tickets, Floerching-Franks said. “If you came into Payette County and you weren’t from there, you had to be quarantined for 48 hours,” she said. “Down around (Salmon), they quarantined the city, and they put guards around the city to make sure no one came in. They would stand out there with their guns.” Idahoans also had concerns beyond the Spanish flu pandemic as it was starting. The United States had recently joined World War I and Americans were focused on buying bonds, conserving materials and the soldiers sent abroad to fight. And as the surge continued, more drastic measures were taken. On Oct. 22, 1918, the state health board closed all schools. The original order had left schools open but from Oct. 11 to Oct. 22, Idaho had gone from 30 to 1,200 cases. “It having come to the attention of the state board of health that certain physicians in various parts of the state, from motives unknown at the present time to the board, unpatriotically refrain from reporting cases of epidemic influenza,” the order read. “It is deemed necessary to close all public and private schools.” The Nampa Leader-Herald reported deaths on its front page, but expressed the outlook was not grim. The newspaper printed a Red Cross Notice instructing Idahoans how to make influenza masks. Even the paper’s staff fell ill at one point. “The influenza has hit the Leader-Herald office to the extent of leaving one well person in the mechanical end,” staff wrote. “This has compelled the omission of news, correspondence and advertising.” On Nov. 5, 1918, the Leader-Herald wrote of death taking a “heavy toll” as six in Nampa died of influenza. The day would be “long remembered” in sadness, the paper predicted. The same day, the paper reported that an Idaho university\'s Students Army Training Corps members were required to wear masks indoors, “under penalty of court martial.” The masks had to be washed in “good soapy water” daily. Many of the preventative measures have not changed over the last 100 years. While some may think it’s because science hasn’t advanced, it’s actually because those measures worked then and do now, according to Boise State University Associate Professor Bob Reinhardt. People 100 years ago also lived in a very different and more dangerous disease environment, Reinhardt said. In 1918, people had more direct experience with diseases, which started off relatively harmless and became more perilous. Nowadays, the world is “blessedly free” of many diseases, Reinhardt said. Almost everyone 100 years ago knew of someone who had died from a disease. “We have (advanced),” he said. “We developed a vaccine in record breaking time … They had no vaccine against the flu. They didn’t have many vaccines, actually, in 1918."" Still, 42% of Idahoans who can get vaccinated have not yet received one dose. Only 705 first doses were given on Sept. 29, 2021, down from a high of 10,821 on April 1, 2021.'}]"

Financial advisors often recommend that retirees maintain some level of credit activity. A practical way to do this is using a credit card for daily expenses, such as groceries and gas. For business professionals, entrepreneurs or self-employed individuals looking for an alternative to working from home or in local coffee shops, Idaho offers a variety of coworking spaces that provide space, amenities and networking opportunities required to complete daily job duties or larger projects.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 12:11 pm Serving Sun Valley, Ketchum, Hailey, Bellevue and Carey June 1, 2024 Last winter, Sun Valley Resort added some 380 acres of new terrain in an area of Bald Mountain called Sunrise. Here, local skier Gabe Schroeder finds fresh snow in the Sunrise Bowl last. Ski industry analysts are predicting a busy 2021-2022 ski season in Idaho and throughout the West. Mountain destinations across eight Western states combined to record their best collective summer ever for occupancy, daily rates and revenue—and the winter season also looks very promising, according to the latest report from DestiMetrics, a Vermont-based organization that tracks lodging and business at mountain resorts. “Comparisons to both last year at this time and two years ago at this time, before the pandemic, shows an impressive rebound—including steadily escalating daily rates,” the organization stated in the report, which used data through Oct. 31. Challenges related to adequate staffing and employee housing “are still significant,” the organization reported, but the return of some international workers on U.S. visas should help mitigate the issue, and “the booking pace suggests that visitors are eager to return to a far more typical mountain vacation.” As of Oct. 31, on-the-books occupancy for the full winter season from November through April is up 75% compared to last year at this time, with gains in all six months—including triple-digit gains in February and March, DestiMetrics reported. The average room rate for the winter is up 23.5%. On-the-books occupancy is up 18.6% compared to this time in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Conditions driving bookings for the upcoming winter season at mountain resorts couldn’t be better,” said Tom Foley, senior vice president for business process and analytics for Inntopia, Destimetrics’ parent company. “Vaccination rates that are ticking up, infection rates moving down, and strong financial and consumer markets—despite inflation—are driving considerable upward momentum and are contributing to extending the summer’s records into next spring.” “Conditions driving bookings for the upcoming winter season at mountain resorts couldn’t be better.” Tom Foley Ski industry analyst Robust bookings, extended lengths of stays, earlier lead times for bookings, and fewer cancellations are also contributing to the positive winter outlook, Foley said. The surging stock market, falling unemployment rate and the creation of new jobs has helped mountain resorts, DestiMetrics stated. Unemployment has declined 1.2% since the beginning of the summer and nearly 4 million new jobs have been added, but staffing continues to be an issue for mountain resorts. “Lack of employees has the potential to impact the ability of the travel industry to meet the high demand and justify the high cost of destination travel,” Foley said. “That ongoing void may force changes to service levels or rates as the season progresses.” COVID-19 case numbers can also impact bookings, DestiMetrics stated, and national supply-chain problems continue to impact the economy and the service industry. However, the calendar is providing a boost for mountain resorts. “With Christmas and New Year’s both falling on Saturday this year, that really helps extend the holiday travel period and it is currently creating excellent occupancy fill-in the 10 days before the holiday,” Foley said, “as well as the always popular days between Christmas and New Year’s—and that is driving some pretty amazing revenue numbers for the second half of the month.” A successful winter season is never guaranteed, Foley said, but the overall outlook is very positive. “As always, there are some issues that could shift the narrative, including the national inflation rate that reached 6.2% in October, the exodus of mountain town employees, and a long-term weather forecast for a La Niña snow pattern that isn’t always beneficial for all regions,” he said. “But if the pandemic continues to ease, the financial markets remain positive, and visitors can look forward to slope time with far fewer restrictions than last year, it should be an excellent year.” Sun Valley prepares River Run in early November for a Thanksgiving opening. Several factors also point to a successful winter season in Idaho, the nonprofit Idaho Ski Areas Association stated in its latest report. SKI magazine recently named Sun Valley as the top ski resort in North America for the second year in a row. Schweitzer—in northern Idaho—will open a new slopeside hotel next month. Bogus Basin, near Boise, spent more than $6 million on 52 capital projects last summer, bringing the total investments in improvements over the past five years to $30 million. And, Rotarun, just west of Hailey, has joined the Idaho Ski Areas Association. Positive developments for Idaho ski areas range across the state, the association stated. Grand Targhee, just across the Idaho-Wyoming border, spent $20 million on capital improvements last summer. The resort is affiliated with Idaho because the only way to access it is through Driggs, Idaho. Rotarun—which is operated as a nonprofit organization—joined the Idaho Ski Areas Association in October as the group’s 19th member. Established in 1948, Rotarun has eight named runs and a vertical drop of 441 feet served by a Doppelmayr platter surface lift. It also has a terrain park and offers night skiing and youth programs. Soldier Mountain, near Fairfield, has benefited from several investments by new owners in the last year. The resort upgraded the snowcat for its backcountry operations and purchased a new PistenBulley groomer for the front-side slopes. In addition, staff conducted extensive brush clearing and tree trimming to expand skiable terrain. Idaho’s northernmost ski resort, Schweitzer, near Sandpoint, anticipates its new boutique, 31-room Humbird Hotel will open in mid-December. Schweitzer is also boosting uphill capacity on Stella—Idaho’s only six-person chairlift—by 600 riders per hour by adding 14 new chairs to its inventory. For the second consecutive year, SKI magazine named Sun Valley the top ski resort in North America in its annual reader survey and awards. Sun Valley ranked No. 1 in the categories of Grooming, Lifts, Service, Dining, Lodging, Family, Local Flavor and Overall Satisfaction. Sun Valley Resort will open new terrain for glade skiing this season that has previously been inaccessible due to the number of dead and downed trees. It will also introduce a new food-service area at the River Run Lodge that will assist with guest flow. Sun Valley is scheduled to start the winter season on Nov. 25, Thanksgiving Day. ￼ gfoley@mtexpress.com Thank you IME for revising your report and allowing me to amend my earlier post; I didn’t realize “Brandon” was a pejorative.
