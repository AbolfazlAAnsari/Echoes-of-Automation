Chance of rain 80%. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 4:40 pm Robert Drysdale died peacefully at home Saturday, May 25, 2024, surrounded by family. Day Cemetery is a small, very old cemetery located on Millersburg Road just Northwest of Boonville. Many Warrick County residents have likely not heard of it, or have seen it on a drive without giving it much notice. But it was the site of a missing headstone that had not been located for over 30 years. The stone, which belonged to an 11 month old named Harry J. Allen, was finally located at an antique mall in Evansville. A local man named Kru Allen found the stone for sale at a booth and posted it to the Facebook group “Indiana Cemeteries.” The group has over 14,000 members and focuses on restoration and appreciation of cemeteries located around the state. Another member of the group, Tracie Ruff, decided to uncover the story behind the mysterious headstone, which led her to the conclusion that the stone was stolen over 30 years ago and the sale of the stone was illegal. Tracie, along with her husband Greg, went to the booth to verify that it was still there and went to the cemetery to ensure it was, in fact, missing. When both of these were confirmed, she contacted the owner of the booth stating that she wished to purchase the item. The seller claimed that the stone was acquired legally from the family after they replaced the old stone and that he had another that was even older. The second stone, which belonged to Anna Beck Borders, was originally from Rumble Cemetery in Petersburg. Both stones were from the mid 19th century, with Allen’s being from 1869 while Borders’ is from 1850. Ruff contacted the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, who oversee the retrieval of headstones. The DNR sent an agent to acquire the items in question from the seller. After obtaining them without need of a warrant, they were turned over to Shane Kocher for restoration. Ruff was also assisted in her search by a relative of Borders, who is active in the Historical Society. Saturday, May 14, the stones were returned to their proper places at their respective cemeteries. A rededication ceremony for the two stones will take place on Saturday, June 4. Ruff said after she helped retrieve the stones, “It didn’t sit right with me that this baby’s stone was for sale and I felt that I should do something about it. It’s important that these stones got put back where they belong and I’m happy that things worked out in the end.” The ceremony for Harry J. Allen’s stone will be at 9:30 a.m. at Day Cemetery near Boonville and the ceremony for Ann Beck Borders’ stone will be at Rumble Cemetery in Petersburg at noon central time. Allen was born Nov. 6, 1868, and died Oct. 6, 1869. Borders was born Nov. 10, 1771, and died Feb. 24, 1850. Log In Keep it Clean.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 6:06 pm The holidays are here and this is sometimes a very challenging time of year for some co-parents. What is it that is so upsetting about the holidays for co-parents? Over the years, I have had conversations with co-parents really bent out of shape about not having their children for a specific holiday, or not having their children on the actual day of a holiday. Although it may be different, it is part of making a decision to no longer be together with your ex. A lot of co-parents have set visitation schedules through final court orders for the holidays, that are maybe one parent has the children on the even numbered years and the other parent has them on the odd numbered years, alternating holidays. That seems to be popular standard language for most holiday visitation schedules. I like parenting plans that are very specific, because that is what some co-parents need as a guide, especially in the beginning of their co-parenting journey. As it pertains to your holiday visitation orders, don’t wait until the holiday is here to try to understand your holiday visitation schedule if it is not clear for you, or if it is causing conflict in your co-parenting. An example from my co-parenting coaching that has happened several times is co-parents not understanding the language in their court orders about when the actual start time is and end time is for their holiday visits. Many of my workshop attendees have discussed this, and as a co-parenting educator and co-parenting coach, my job is to help co-parents comply with their court orders. I do not however, interpret the language in their orders. If you are unclear and find yourself just not understanding the language in your court orders, ask your attorney to interpret them for you. That is an easy fix that could save a lot of conflict in your co-parenting relationship. Once you understand your holiday visitation schedule and you work through using your parenting plan in your court orders without issues, you may be able to start creating a holiday visitation plan that better suits the family holiday plans on both sides so the children don’t miss out. That, in my opinion, should be a co-parenting goal. I think the important thing for co-parenting through the holidays is to keep holiday normalcy for your children, especially at the onset of a separation or divorce. If there are holiday traditions, those don’t need to change just because you and your ex made a decision to no longer be together. As an example, if a family Christmas tradition is one evening everyone gets in their pajamas, you pop some popcorn, grab a favorite drink, hop in the car and drive around listening to Christmas music, munching and looking at Christmas lights, that tradition does not need to change. Children want normalcy without tension, stress and upset, so when co-parenting through the holidays, it is important that you are co-parenting in a way that the holidays continue to be happy ones for the children. For the children, a sense of normalcy can still exist in the face of separation or divorce, even through the holidays. I hope you all have a great week.

Winds S at 10 to 20 mph. Chance of rain 100%. Rainfall around a quarter of an inch. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:32 pm VirSarah Davis’ son was held in juvenile detention so many times the reasons blur together in her memory. He had an “outburst” at school. He was caught with a gun. He fled house arrest. But she knows one thing for certain: He was 10 years old the first time police took him from their home in South Bend to detention. “He just kept saying, ‘that’s a scary place,’” said Davis, who thought the ordeal was over when the court released him 15 days later. Instead, she now says, “it was just the beginning for us.” Indiana detains and commits youth at a rate that’s about 40 percent above the national average. That’s higher than almost every state in the Midwest, according to a one-day federal count before the coronavirus pandemic. These young people are held in county detention before judges decide their cases. They’re removed from their homes for residential treatment at private facilities. And they’re committed to state correctional facilities. It’s a problem that has caught the attention of state leaders, and the legislature made some changes to youth detention policies earlier this year. But it remains unclear whether lawmakers have an appetite for further reforms. During the eight years Davis’ son was in and out of detention, treatment and state facilities, his mother said he was different whenever he came home. And he often behaved like he was still there: He would ask permission to open the fridge and take a soda. He’d wear rubber shoes in the shower. “I feel like my son is becoming institutionalized,” Davis said. The consequences of detention and commitment can be dire for children and teens. Research on juvenile incarceration has found that when youth are locked up, they are less likely to graduate from high school and it can increase the risk of recidivism. “The justice system imposes its own trauma,” said JauNae Hanger, executive director of the Children’s Policy and Law Initiative of Indiana. “Anytime you take a child into a locked situation, you’re going to be imposing, potentially, more harm.” In Indiana, Black youth are more than 2 1/2 times as likely to be detained and 3-1/2 times as likely to be committed to the state compared to their White peers. The disparity is even larger nationally. Across the country, growing awareness of those problems and declining juvenile arrests helped spur a dramatic national drop in youth incarceration beginning in the late-1990s. Detention and commitment in Indiana has also declined. While the state locks up fewer youth than it used to, it has made less progress than others. Only a small number of children and teens are incarcerated, and state data is limited. But the federal government has conducted a single-day count of youth in detention and commitment since 1997. The 2019 census, which is the latest available, found that Indiana locked up about 1,200 children and teens. That’s more than states with substantially higher populations – including Illinois and New York. Some Indiana lawmakers, court officials and advocates are paying attention. Last year, a state task force released recommendations for reforming the juvenile justice system. They included some policy changes the legislature has already adopted, such as limiting confinement of children under 12 years old and requiring counties to use risk assessments to determine if a juvenile needs to be locked up. The state’s progress is positive, Hanger said. But she and other advocates believe Indiana needs to take more aggressive steps. “It’s really time for us to take a step back and say structurally, what do we need to do differently?” Hanger said. “Where do the laws in this state actually lead to the criminalization of youth?” So far, Indiana has largely relied on local communities to reduce youth incarceration. Prosecutors, police and courts decide what to do when young people break the law. Some of them, like the Marion County system, have prioritized alternatives to youth detention – and significantly reduced the number of children and teens in holding. Many other counties, however, locked up children and teens at the same rate in 2019 as they did in 2016, according to an analysis commissioned by the state reform task force. Advocates say Indiana courts detain many children and teens who should remain in the community. The majority of youth detained before trial are accused of misdemeanor offenses. That includes non-violent crimes like theft, possession of marijuana and disorderly conduct. Some children and teens are detained for status offenses, which would not be crimes if they were adults, such as running away and missing school. “There is no therapeutic value for a 10-year-old who’s in a detention center – or for a 13-year-old who’s in a detention center. There’s just none,” said Liz Manley, a senior advisor for health and behavioral health policy at the University of Maryland. Manley previously served as assistant commissioner for New Jersey’s Children’s System of Care. That state uses mobile response and stabilization teams to intervene when children are in crisis. The teams connect families with immediate help that aims to keep youth in their own homes and community. In some cases, those teams get young people into inpatient care. “There are plenty of interventions that can be in place to prevent that young person from touching on a detention center – in particular, when it’s a non-violent offense,” Manley said. Davis and her son live in South Bend, where the St. Joseph County Probate Court handles juvenile cases. The St. Joseph County Juvenile Justice Center – where Davis’ son was held – faced a lawsuit in 2017 over the use of solitary confinement. It claimed the facility held an 11-year-old boy alone for periods of 23 hours for days at a time. The suit was settled in 2019. Executive Director Bill Bruinsma, who took over that year, helped draft the settlement. He said it made improvements to the facility’s environment and staffing levels. Now, he said the ratio of staff to youth is four-to-one instead of eight-to-one. Youth may only be restricted to rooms when they pose a risk to themselves or others, and staff must reassess the risk every 15 minutes, under the settlement. Bruinsma said the facility also overhauled staff training and practices to focus on trauma informed care. “We’ve made a big change in culture,” said Bruinsma, a psychologist who has worked in juvenile justice for close to three decades. The number of youth held at the juvenile justice center has declined in recent years. Bruinsma said that now, only the highest risk youth are detained or committed. Bruinsma argued that detaining some young people is essential for community safety and for those youth. “In Indiana, the juvenile system in every county is the bottom of your safety net,” Bruinsma said. “So when the schools fail, and the parents fail, and the medical systems fail, and the mental health systems fail, guess who’s handling it?” Compared to other Indiana communities, St. Joseph County stands out because it sends significantly more youth to the state juvenile correction center. Over the five years, the only place that has sent more young people to state holding is Marion County. That’s the state’s largest county, and it has more than three times as many youth between 10 and 19 years old than St. Joseph County. Over the last five years, the number of youth St. Joseph committed to the state has ranged from 21 to 68 annually. Bruinsma said only a tiny fraction of the youth who go through the St. Joseph Court are committed to the state, and it is an important treatment option in some serious cases. If communities stop detaining and committing young people in serious need, Bruinsma said, those juveniles could eventually face even more devastating consequences. He pointed to deadly gun violence in South Bend and other Indiana cities. “It’s not a benefit to the child,” Bruinsma said. “If I put him back in a situation where it’s totally unsafe for him, you know, and he’s killed. That’s a disaster from my viewpoint.” That’s a fear South Bend mother Davis shares. But Davis said instead of helping her son, detention made things worse. He was arrested at 17 for gun-related offenses and charged as an adult. “He’s gonna start his adult life with a felony,” Davis said. It “pretty much shattered a lot of stuff for us.” Davis believes the eight years her son spent in the juvenile justice system set him up to start his adult life in prison.

Winds S at 10 to 15 mph. Chance of rain 100%. Rainfall around a half an inch. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:48 pm Jacob Covault was the son of Bethuel Covault and Sarah Hart. He was born in Bedford County, Pennsylvania in March of 1794. In 1816, he married Frances Catherine Hess, the daughter of William and Margaret Hess. In 1842, Jacob Covault and his family came to Blackford County from Pennsylvania with his wife and children. The family came to Indiana in two wagons, along with Jacob and Anna Hess, Frances’ brother and sister-in-law. The trip took about three weeks. Jacob and Frances had 12 children; Sarah (b. 1818), Jacob (b. 1822), Abner (b. 1823), Ephraim (b. 1825), Nathaniel (b. 1827), Philip Morgan (b. 1828), Elizabeth (b.1832), Jesse (b. 1835), Martha (b. 1837), Rebecca (b. 1840), Fanney (b. 1842), and William (b. 1843). The brothers walked most of the way. The family settled on a 160-acre farm Southwest of Hartford City that had been purchased from the government at a cost of $2.75 per acre. A year later Jacob passed on. In 1859, tragedy struck the Covault family when the Covault family lost three daughters, Elizabeth, Fanney, and Rebecca, and one son, Jesse to Diphtheria within the span of one month. The Covault children were between the ages of 17 and 24. Originally buried in the Baptist Cemetery on the Northwest corner of Mill and Water Streets in Hartford City, the tombstones of several of the Covault children have been relocated to the I.O.O.F Cemetery. Diphtheria is an infection caused by a bacterium. Most infections are asymptomatic or have a mild clinical case, but in some outbreaks more than 10% of those diagnosed with the disease may die. Signs and symptoms may vary from mild to severe and usually start two to five days after exposure. The first recorded cases took place in Spain in 1613. After several outbreaks and epidemics, the bacteria that causes Diphtheria was finally identified in 1883. It took several years until a vaccine was developed in the early 1900’s by 1924 cases began to decline significantly. Jacob’s sons, Ephraim, Abner, and Nathaniel farmed in the area. Abner also lost two children to Diphtheria. Jacob’s son Philip would go on to lead a long and interesting life becoming one of Hartford City’s most prominent citizens of his day. Philip spent eight years on the farm before traveling to Quincy, Illinois where he learned the trade of carpentry. In 1855, he joined the Van Amburgh Circus in Fort Wayne. This was one of the most renowned traveling menageries of the time. Covault operated a candy wagon with the circus. Philip traveled for over 4,000 miles with this organization. In those days, as there were yet to be circus trains, the menagerie, one of the largest at the time, traveled from performance to performance in a group of over 200 horse-drawn wagons. The show could be enjoyed for a general admission of only $0.25. In Covault’s opinion, this show was much better than the Circus performances under the bigtop that were so popular later in his life. After a year with the circus, Philip returned to Hartford City. In March of 1856, he married Emily Townsend. She was the daughter of John Townsend of Steuben County, New York and Temperance Householder. Philip purchased the lots where the Cronin Drug Store and the Marshall and Alexander Hardware Store were once located. In the lot where the hardware store was located, Covault opened a jewelry and clothing store. In front of this store he put up a small shack that served as a photography gallery during the Civil War. Men who were drafted into service and their families would have their pictures taken free of charge. Many of these early photographs remain in the possession of these local families to this day. Around this time, he also built the homestead where he lived out the remainder of his life. He also had a two-story business block built to replace his store. After a fire, he sold the property to Mr. VanCleve. He then rented the space on the South side of the square where the Hoover Furniture Store was located where he opened a jewelry store. Shortly after this, the South side of the square was heavily damaged in a fire. For a short time after the fire, he operated a grocery store where Thrifty Sounds is currently located. Emily and Philip had two daughters Molly Lela Covault (b. 1864); who married Del Thomas who became a partner in Covault’s jewelry business in 1888; and Cora Temperance Covault (b. 1876) who would go on to marry Clay Tuttle who operated a shoe store for many years in Hartford City. Mr. Tuttle was, like Philip, also interested in photography. The jewelry firm of Covault and Thomas helped to orchestrate the purchase of the clock in the tower of the newly built Blackford County Courthouse in 1894 from the E.H. Howard Clock Company of Boston for a sum of $2,000.00. Philip Morgan Covault led a long life, much of it in Blackford County. In his nearly 75 years he saw the County transform from a wilderness with a few settlers to a bustling city during the days of the Gas Boom. On October 15, 1916, at the age of 88 Philip passed away. He had operated his jewelry business for 40 years and had become quite well-known in the community. He was survived by his wife Emily who passed away in 1927 and daughter Cora who lived until 1956. The Covault family endured the loss of several siblings at a young age. Those who survived, especially Philip, went on to make a great success of themselves. Their journey oddly parallels that of Hartford City. During Philip’s lifetime, Hartford City grew from a handful of settlers in a heavily forested area to a booming metropolis following the discovery of natural gas, and Covault was there to witness it all.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 6:11 pm UTICA — A Utica site known as the Witches’ Castle has been the subject of countless legends and scary stories over the decades, and now, the property is for sale. The wooded property at 5613 Upper River Road was listed for sale last week for $285,000. The 3.6-acre lot overlooks the Ohio River and backs up to the Quarry Bluff neighborhood. The site, owned by Collin Properties, has been unused for many years. The ruins have long been an eerie place for teenagers and ghost hunters to explore, and a Google search reveals all sorts of questionable stories and myths about the so-called Witches’ Castle. Realtor Mark Hack of GreenTree Real Estate Services has his own memories associated with the property. When he was growing up, he often rode his bike to the ruins. The site still has a “spooky feel,” he said. However, he feels it is time for a new chapter for the property, and he envisions it being transformed into picturesque riverfront homes. Hack said the development could take place out of the flood zone while maintaining the view of the river. “It’s a great piece of property and a great location, and I think it’s just been overlooked due to the amount of work that it’s going to take to get it where it needs to be,” he said. “The right person, the right developer — if they can come in here and clear all this, they could build three or four home sites with beautiful river views.” As you enter the woods of the riverfront property, you will come across the ruins of a house overtaken by vines. Little is left of the structure, but you can still walk through the foundation of the home and view the crumbling walls and fireplace, the stone covered in layers of graffiti. Another stone structure that was once a small chapel sits in the woods, the News and Tribune previously reported, but Hack has not seen this particular building himself, he said. The Witches’ Castle has been shrouded in myth over the decades, and its connection with the murder of 12-year-old Shanda Sharer by a group of teenagers contributed to its reputation. The property was not the site of the brutal 1992 murder, but Sharer was taken to the ruins before she was tortured and killed in Madison, Indiana. Urban legends with numerous variations say that women believed to be witches used to live there before they were driven out and killed by townspeople, but there is no evidence of such a history. What is known is that in the 1940s, J. Paul Druien built the stone house and a consecrated chapel at the property once known at Mistletoe Falls. The site was later owned by Joseph Biagi, and his stepson set the house on fire, leaving the structure in ruins. Ownership eventually transferred to Darlene Roach in 1985. She owned the site during the media frenzy of the Sharer murder case before selling it in 1993. The site was often portrayed in coverage of the case, leading to frequent trespassing and vandalism. The site has also been of interest to paranormal investigators who claim to have seen apparitions and captured the sound of ghostly voices at the Witches’ Castle. Hack said “the history has definitely hurt it in the past,” but he believes a developer could give the property a “fresh new start.” “We’re in a time when developable riverfront property is almost gone in Southern Indiana, so I think it’s a good piece that’s just been overlooked,” he said.

TIPTON — A week after the accidental workplace-related death of an employee at a Tipton-based factory, the company’s president has now established a GoFundMe page in that man's memory. On Friday, 38-year-old Howard County resident Elliot Sullivan was killed when a machine malfunctioned at High Performance Alloys Inc. near downtown Tipton. Sullivan was a plant manager at the facility, and officials believe his death to be an accident. It's not clear what type of machinery was involved in the incident, but the investigation has now officially been handed over to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which is required by law to document and investigate workplace accidents. Tuesday afternoon, David Kirchner, president of High Performance Alloys Inc., created a GoFundMe fundraiser to help pay for memorial expenses in the wake of Sullivan’s death, as well as establish a college fund for his children. “Elliot has made many friends here as a Plant Manager at the Tipton facility,” Kirchner’s statement on the GoFundMe page read in part. “This page is to enable Elliot’s coworkers a chance to pay respect to the great man, husband and father. … This page is for anyone who got to know and feel the love from Elliot to give a memorial donation. Elliot was a friend to many and will be greatly missed by all.” As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, the fundraiser had raised over half of its $10,000 goal. According to their website, High Performance Alloys Inc. is a “leader in the super alloys industry” and supplies “extreme environment industries with wear, corrosion and high temperature resistant materials.” If you’d like to donate to the GoFundMe fundraiser for Elliot Sullivan, search for “Elliot Sullivan Memorial Fund” on the GoFundMe website.

is highly confident that the text is written entirely by a human.', 'document_classification': 'HUMAN_ONLY', 'version': '2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': '“Where are you from?” This question, frequently asked of Asian-American individuals, has less to do with geographical locations than it does ethnic identities. Nate Chu, the director of international student programs, laughs when asked about his heritage. Chu, who holds a U.S. passport, was raised in Kenya by Chinese parents while attending both American and British schools. “I am not fully Chinese, I am not fully American, I am not fully Kenyan,” Chu said. “I’m not fully anything.” This question is equally complex for senior Grace Meharg, whose mom is from South Korea and whose dad is from New Jersey. Meharg views herself as a mosaic: a messy mixture of Korean and American influence whose comfort foods include both dinosaur chicken nuggets and Korean dumplings. Junior Katie Ito recognizes that identity extends far beyond ethnicity, encompassing her roles as a student, sister, daughter and Christian. This question to her is a reminder that first impressions are often linked to outward appearances. “My everyday is more influenced by what I look like than I originally think it is,” Ito said. “Where are you from?” and questions like this assume that each of these individuals has fully assessed his or her narrative and prepared well-thought-out answers for curious passers-by. But for Chu, Meharg, Ito and countless others belonging to the Asian-American community, narratives are not clear-cut and answers are often in the process of being formed. The complexity cuts deeper than ethnic origins and takes a lifetime to navigate. Reflecting on his own journey, Chu admits that he did not realize how unique his childhood was until his daughters were born. He struggles not only with the tension of cultures intersecting in his own life, but also with the reality his daughters face as bi-racial individuals living in a predominantly white community. “What does it mean for them to be half-Chinese, half-white in a white community? How do I help them navigate both sides of their makeup?” Chu said. “We live here, so it’s easy for them to see the white side (of their heritage), but they also recognize that they look different in school.” Meharg wrestles with the realization that there is rarely a space in which she is the majority. This is made more complicated by the pressure she feels to identify with one of the two cultures present in her life, or to move seamlessly between the two. These expectations make it difficult for Meharg to discern what it means to exist in the in-between. Ito’s questions surrounding her heritage can be traced back to the elementary lunch table, where her stir-fried noodles with shrimp and fish sauce stood in stark contrast to her peers’ PB&J sandwiches. For Ito, those moments introduced an element of sadness into her story — a theme of feeling less than or second-rate to friends or peers who fit into stereotypical white standards of what it means to be accepted, beautiful, “American.” “(I thought), ‘Why do I feel like I want to eat lunch by myself because I don’t want the smells of my food to bother you?’ (I was) already apologizing for the space that I was taking up with my food, with how I looked and all of those external features of my race and heritage,” Ito said. “I had this internalized shame about being Asian and being different.” Questions and stories surrounding individual identity have been further complicated by stereotypes and barriers surrounding the Asian-American community. Some of these originate from outside of the community. Meharg experiences this whenever her mathematical skills are attributed to her Asian heritage, or she feels “othered.” Ito encounters this whenever she sees the Asian-American community held up as the “model minority” — a “golden-child mentality” that pits one minority people group against another to the detriment of both. However, not all barriers originate from outside of the Asian-American community. Ito describes a “silencing of self” that keeps Asian-Americans from advocating for their community. “Asian-Americans tend to keep their heads down and not talk about race because they have seen what happens when people do speak up,” Ito said. “And so they’re led to believe that they don’t have to be involved in the conversation if it’s not going to benefit them.” Chu, born three minutes before his twin brother, has been deeply influenced by another reality within the Asian-American community: the pressure of being “daai go go,” or, “the first older brother,” within his family. For Chu, the responsibilities and obligations of this role have been the hardest part of his Asian heritage. Nevertheless, despite the half-formed, partially unraveled narratives and the barriers built from both inside and outside of the Asian-American community, there have been breakthroughs in individual stories. “The word that comes to mind is proud,” Chu said. “I don’t know if I could have said this 20 years ago when I was a student here — not that I was ashamed to be Chinese-American, but I just didn’t know what it meant. I love the fact that my parents are Chinese, I love the fact that I’m American, I love the fact that I grew up in Kenya. While all these factors have made it more complex for me to navigate the world I’m in, (they’ve) also shaped me into who I am today.” Meharg reinforces this idea when reflecting on her own journey. “It can be really hard to be mixed and be in between two different worlds, but it’s also really cool to be able to celebrate both parts of myself,” Meharg said. One of Ito’s biggest breakthroughs arrived in the form of affirmation from a fellow Asian-American woman. This friend noticed a similarity in their features and exclaimed, “Your eyes look like mine!” Her excitement reminded Ito that beauty is not confined to blue eyes and blonde hair, changing the way Ito sees both herself and others. “So much beauty and sorrow and everything in between. It’s complex — and I love it,” Ito said. “I love being who I am … and that’s a very beautiful place to arrive at.” Despite the nuanced beauty found within this demographic, interactions with and perceptions of the Asian-American community are frequently marked by overgeneralizations and surface-value assumptions. As Taylor recognizes Asian History Month, Chu wonders if these generalizations and assumptions are reflected in the community’s celebrations. “When we say, ‘Yes, we’re going to recognize and celebrate Asians and Asian-Americans,’ do we know what exactly we’re celebrating?” Chu said. Which narrative is Taylor celebrating? The homogenous one that has been formed by society? Or a more complex narrative that recognizes the representation of individual regions, cultures and stories within Taylor’s community? “A super basic truth is missed sometimes: there isn’t one story,” Meharg said. “Each person, regardless of what box they check, has their own story, and the story might not always look like what you think it will (look like).” If Taylor’s view of the Asian-American community lacks the depth and distinction of individual stories, celebrations will be shallow and change will be unremarkable. But it is critical to remember that individual stories are just that: individual. Space must be made for these stories to be shared — when and if they are offered. Differences do not demand explanation, and no one ever owes another their unique narrative. “In individual friendships and communities, listen to people’s stories if they choose to share them with you … (but) know you don’t always have the right to someone’s story,” Meharg said. In the questions and the celebrations, both those inside and outside the Asian-American community are given the gift of choice. The choice to engage and the choice to share. The choice to ask gracious questions and the choice to meet ignorant questions with grace. Which choices will Taylor University make? And how will those choices impact change in the weeks and months ahead?'}]"

I did not speak until I was three years old. The initial lockdown caused by the pandemic gave me an abundance of time to read and learn new things. One day, I did a deep dive on autism.inally, after seventeen years on this earth, I began to understand who I am. Growing up, I believed I was inferior to other people because I had autism; no matter how hard I tried, I still wouldn’t be like the “normal” people in my school. In some classes, especially middle school, my fellow students would be talking so loud that it would overwhelm my body and cause a sensory overload. I usually got mad and had a temper tantrum; after these episodes, I felt ashamed people had to see me at my worst. I am one of 5.5 million Americans who have autism. It has taken me a long time to say this publicly, but I say this with a full chest and a happy heart. I am proud that I am a person with autism. Now I have something to ask of you:reshape your views about people with autism. For far too long, society’s views on people with autism have been discriminatory and damaging. The only way that people with autism can be respected in society is if people can open their minds and discard the stereotypes that have been imprinted in our culture. My experiences are different from others with autism; autism, after all, is a spectrum. Some people with autism are nonverbal, while others are verbal and are social butterflies. We get overwhelmed by different things. For some people it could be textures, for others it could be lights. On campus, I can still get overwhelmed by a crammed lunch hour in the Atrium. As a kid, my experiences were different from lots of other autistic people. I was outgoing and always enjoyed talking to people and engaging in conversation. Despite my sociability, I still had a long way to go to fully understand neurotypical communication. This was most evident when I started middle school. Middle school was the least enjoyable experience in my life. As I began 7th grade, I moved into a new building, away from the elementary school that had housed me since kindergarten. My 12-year-old self was eager and willing to talk to anyone — however, I was naive and didn’t understand social concepts. The people who I went to middle school with saw that, and they took advantage of me. They would tease me and it was like they were treating me like an infant, like I wasn’t capable of advanced thought. The worst was in seventh grade, going to my first middle school basketball game. The cheerleaders were performing a cheer called the Trojan Rumble, which involved cheerleaders shaking their butts in front of middle school boys. Some of the boys got me to film it and post it on Instagram, while I didn’t realize the true consequences of my actions. I didn’t understand how society worked. The next day, I got called down to the assistant principal's office because of the video and I became a laughing stock around the school. I felt betrayed and embarrassed. I felt that no one could understand how my mind worked. I felt alone. Despite the typical cruelness of teenagers and later apologies for the behavior, this shows how people with autism are treated. Many have seen the negative stereotypes — we’re emotionless, have a special interest with trains and have strict routines. Weare savants with total recall ability, like in the movie “Rain Man,” which both dispelled and created new stereotypes about autism. The blunt and unpleasant truth is that people are not informed on the autism spectrum and therefore fall back on harmful stereotypes that demonize people with autism. Society has tried to accept people with autism, but they are doing it all wrong. Society is tolerating us but not including us. Something that infuriates me with society’s lack of progress with autistic inclusion is the infantilizing of people with autism — most people picture autism in a child and not an adult. However, the fact of the matter is that the children with autism will grow up to be adults with autism. Organizations such as Autism Speaks have manufactured pity for children with autism and, as a result, refused to acknowledge adults with autism. I can understand why organizations may try to market children with autism since people may have a stronger emotional connection to children. However, the representation of adults with autism has been slim to non-existent and this has led many so-called “advocates” to question if adults with autism even exist. Well, I am going to break it to you right now —we exist, and we are suffering in a society that does not even acknowledge or include us. We have been treated as eternal children, and that image is detrimental to our mental health. People on the autism spectrum are four times more likely to have depression in their lifetimes compared to neurotypical people. Adults with autism face an uphill struggle in life because, even though they may be advanced in some areas compared to their peers, they have to combat a society that places them at a severe disadvantage. Society has used inappropriate language to describe autism; using demeaning and belittling language to then build up a narrative of someone “heroically” overcoming their disability. This is one of the reasons why I despise shows like “America’s Got Talent” so much for how they depict people with autism. We are just trying to do the same things that neurotypical people do; our path to doing it is just different. There is one simple goal in order to help people with autism feel wanted — educate yourself and become more accepting. Dedicate your time and resources to organizations which are run by people with autism, such as the Autism Self-Advocacy Network. Watch some lectures about autism by people with autism on YouTube. The best way to learn about autism is by listening to the people who have it. We often judge people with autism because they are “weird” based on neurotypical people’s standards. However, our brains just work differently. I have gotten to know people on the autism spectrum in the past few years, and they are the most selfless and caring people that I know. We are not people to be feared; we are people to be loved. Contact Grayson Joslin with comments at grayson.joslin@bsu.edu or on Twitter @GraysonMJoslin.

The Jeffersonville Library is at 211 E. Court Ave., Jeffersonville (Main Branch), and the Clarksville Library (Clarksville Branch) is at 1312 Eastern Blvd., Clarksville. Upcoming December events include: The Jeffersonville Township Public Library, 211 East Court Avenue, will sponsor a program about RSVP, the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program. The program will be Friday, Dec. 9, from 11 a.m. to noon. Leann Lindley, the Tri-County Coordinator of RSVP, will talk about her role in helping individuals who are 55 and older to use their gifts and talents to connect with various volunteer opportunities throughout Southern Indiana. The Jeffersonville Township Public Library will sponsor a unique Holiday Craft Gathering with Librarian Diane Stepro, Saturday, Dec. 10, from 10 a.m. to noon at the Jeffersonville location. Yarn painting is an easy craft that involves creating vibrant and textured pieces of art using just yarn and glue. No cost is involved, but pre-registration will be limited to 20 individuals. This craft is open to all age groups. Children must be accompanied by an adult. Did you know that learning to crochet is like riding a bicycle? Once you learn, you will never forget! Of course, you may still need to fine-tune your skills occasionally. If you want to learn how to crochet or fine-tune your skills, the Jeffersonville Township Public Library will offer a crocheting class on Saturday, Dec. 10, from noon to 2 p.m. The instructor, Joyce Ellis, would like each participant to bring a size H needle and a solid color skein of yarn with them to the class. If you miss this class, there will be many more opportunities to learn how to crochet in 2023. The Clarksville Library will host local author Sherna Williams on Saturday, Dec. 10 from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. Williams is an author and school psychologist. She was inspired to write her book “Hidden in the Details” after a devastating medical diagnosis of her 4-month-old daughter, Celeste. Through her faith and commitment to God, Williams and her family got through the emergency procedure necessary to correct Celeste’s condition. They were moved to share their experience with others going through similar hardships. They even formed a Christian non-profit, the Hesed Movement, to reach out and assist those in need by providing care packages to their families. Come and listen to the story and learn how Williams and her family transformed a tragic diagnosis and journey into a beneficial community resource for us all to experience. Jewelry-Making Craft Class The Jeffersonville Township Public Library will sponsor a Jewelry-Making Craft Class with Jewelry Artist Kelly Avery-Boyd, Monday, Dec. 12, from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. Just in time for the holidays, you can make a necklace for yourself or a gift for someone special in your life. Avery-Boyd’s jewelry commands hundreds of dollars in the real world, and she will share her knowledge and artistic talent during this 90-minute class. The focus of this class will be on necklaces, and each jewelry-making kit will be between $20 and $45. Payment must be made at the beginning of the class by either card or cash, but cards are the preferred payment method. A maximum of 10 participants will be allowed to pre-register. Let’s have a conversation about books The Jeffersonville Township Public Library will sponsor a Conversation About Books on Tuesday, Dec. 13, from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. at the Main Branch location. Join us for a relaxing and informal hour devoted to books. It’s a time to share what you’ve been reading and what genres you especially like. If the conversation gets off-topic and leads to a discussion about other things, we will go with the flow. This hour is a great way to reconnect with old friends and make new ones. Clarksville Library hosting Christmas Karaoke The Clarksville Library will host Christmas Karaoke on Wednesday, Dec. 14, from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. at its Clarksville location. Bring the whole family to the library for a night of Christmas caroling on the karaoke machine. This fun event for the entire family may become a holiday tradition. No registration is required. Balanced Living Health Class The Jeffersonville Township Public Library will sponsor a Balanced Living Health Class hosted by Frances Hunter, Thursday, Dec. 15, from 6:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the Jeffersonville location. Hunter will host presenters from a team of educators and professionals with a broad range of expertise. You can obtain different perspectives each month, and opportunities to pose questions and delve deeper will emerge. The first topic discussed in December will be The Attitude Factor: Our happiness and health can be improved when we change our attitude from negativity to positivity! The second topic discussed in December will be The Vegetarian Edge: Our journey toward improved health, energy, mood, and weight may be as close as our garden or local produce department. Clarksville Library hosting Mommy and Me Storytime The Clarksville Library will host Mommy and Me Storytime on Thursday, Dec. 16 from 10:30 a.m. to 11:15 a.m. at its Clarksville location. This program is perfect for children 6 to 36 months looking to enhance socialization skills. Mrs. Q will provide a semi-guided play experience allowing babies and toddlers to learn and explore through play. Ideal for small children that have not been exposed to new people, places, and events. Little ones can crawl, play, and make new friends, while moms and caregivers will also have the opportunity to connect and socialize. It’s an enchanting winter at the library Both locations of the Jeffersonville Township Public Library are sponsoring a winter of fun, enchantment, and reading. The winter reading program, “An Enchanted Winter Read,” begins on Dec. 19 and will end on Jan. 31. This program is for adults and youth up to 18 years old. Go to our Beanstack site at https://jefflibrary.beanstack.org to sign in to your account, sign up for Winter Reading, and start logging your books. Both youth and adults will complete their quest for reading success by finishing four books. Audiobooks and eBooks count as well as physical books, so be sure to check out what’s available on Hoopla and OverDrive/Libby to find your next read. Readers will receive an enchanted snack after they read four books. “We are delighted to offer winter reading again this year,” Library Director David Seckman said. “We start winter reading when most schools are on winter break because it is the perfect time for families to relax and curl up with a good book. This year’s winter reading program is extra special because it is happening in conjunction with our participation in the SoIN Big Read program. “This year we will be reading “Ella Enchanted” by Gail Carson Levine. Thanks to the generous sponsorship of the JTPL Friends and Foundation, we can offer free copies of the book for our customers to read and add to their home collection or pass on to a friend. We are also offering several programs and events related to the book. We are hopeful this is the kind of book that the whole community can enjoy and will spark many great conversations as it appeals to different age groups.” Research shows that kids who don’t engage in reading when they are out of school for a prolonged period, such as winter and summer break, tend to lose some of the academic skills they worked to develop while in school. Many refer to this as “summer slide,” but it also applies to winter breaks. Achievement gaps can form between students who read while out of school and those who don’t. Library winter reading programs offer a fun way for kids to overcome the “winter slide” and keep their reading skills sharp for when they return to school. Reading during the holidays is also an excellent way for adults to relax and unwind. To learn more about the Winter Reading Club or the SoIN Big Read, call the Jeffersonville Library Youth Services Department at 812-285-5636, Public Services at 285-5630, or the Clarksville Library at 812-285-5640.

Even though her home life and childhood had been challenging, she choked back tears as she shared her triumphant story of life and love. Though she initially experienced fear and shame when she found out she was pregnant as a Senior in High School, she never once considered her baby a ""choice"" or an ""option"". ""As soon as I found out, I knew in my heart there was only one choice….life. Never would my daughter hear she was my choice. She would only ever hear she was my child."" Though some told her she had ruined her life or that things had changed for her, she found comfort in the eternal love of God and the unfailing love of her high school sweetheart Sean. Wisdom from her guidance counselor and support from a friend encouraged her as she embraced motherhood. Sean and Janette have been married and living happily ever after for over 20 years. They have enjoyed sharing life with their beautiful and beloved daughter Abigail. “The world will always give us trials and things that trouble our hearts, but through it all God’s love is with us.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 6:00 pm Westport Community Volunteer Fire Department was recently awarded a grain rescue tube and specialized training from Nationwide and Indiana Corn Marketing Council. DES MOINES, IOWA – On Sept. 11, local first-responders with the Westport Community Volunteer Fire Department were awarded a grain rescue tube and specialized training from Nationwide and Indiana Corn Marketing Council through Nationwide’s Grain Bin Safety advocacy campaign. The resources will be used to help protect against grain entrapments, which result in dozens of deaths across rural America. Every year, thousands of farmers and commercial grain handlers risk their lives by entering grain bins to remove clumped or rotted grain. As rural communities have come to know all too well, the risks of entering grain bins continue to be overlooked. “It only takes seconds, or a simple mistake, for an adult to sink in the quicksand-like flow of grain and become fully entrapped or engulfed,” said Brad Liggett, Nationwide’s president of Agribusiness. “Adding to the risk is a lack of rescue equipment available to local fire departments and emergency responders who are called for help when a worker becomes trapped.” To help lead the fight against these accidents impacting agricultural communities, the country’s leading insurer of farms and ranches, Nationwide, began its Grain Bin Safety campaign in 2014 to bring awareness to the hazards of entering grain structures and to equip fire departments with the resources needed to respond effectively. Westport Community Volunteer Fire Department is one of more than 58 fire departments to receive these resources through the 2022 campaign, and one of more than 265 fire departments to benefit from the program since its inception. The grain rescue tube delivery and training was conducted by the National Education Center for Agricultural Safety (NECAS) and included simulations of entrapments and rescues using a state-of-the-art grain entrapment simulator, which is loaded on a trailer and able to hold about 100 bushels of grain. Since 2014, at least five fire departments have put the tubes and training to use to save the lives of workers trapped in grain bins. “With long-standing roots in agriculture, we’re thankful for the work America’s farmers do and for the contributions of our valuable partners who help us make a difference with this campaign in rural communities,” said Liggett.

After a rare wedding and the president’s milestone 80th birthday, the White House on Monday plunged into the holiday season with the annual pardoning of a Thanksgiving turkey, the arrival of the official Christmas tree and serving up a Thanksgiving-style dinner on a military base. The burst of holiday activity at the White House follows a busy weekend personally for President Joe Biden and his family and comes after midterm elections earlier this month that saw the president’s Democratic Party perform better than expected. Democrats kept control of the Senate and although the House will shift to Republican control come January, GOP gains in that chamber were held to a minimum. Biden and his wife, Jill, leave Washington on Tuesday for their family tradition of spending Thanksgiving on the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. They hosted the wedding of their granddaughter, Naomi Biden, at the White House on Saturday, followed by a brunch for the president’s 80th birthday on Sunday. For the second time, Biden played his part in the 75-year tradition of issuing a coveted presidential pardon to keep a pair of turkeys off the holiday dinner table. “The votes are in, they’ve been counted and verified,” Biden said as he welcomed the turkeys before a crowd of hundreds on the South Lawn with the usual dad humor. “There’s no ballot stuffing. There’s no fowl play. The only red wave this season’s gonna be if German Shepard Commander knocks over the cranberry sauce on our table.“ He concluded on a serious note, encouraging Americans to get their COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the holiday season and to reflect and “be grateful for what we have.” “This is a special time in the greatest nation on Earth so let’s be thankful,” Biden said. Gobblers Chocolate and Chip, each weighing nearly 50 pounds (22.68 kilograms), arrived in Washington on Saturday night from North Carolina and checked into their room at the Willard hotel near the White House to await Monday’s presidential decree. The combination of chocolate and chip also happens to be Biden’s favorite flavor of ice cream. The birds were hatched in July in Monroe, North Carolina, according to the National Turkey Federation, sponsor of the turkey tradition that dates to 1947 and President Harry Truman. Biden named Chocolate the winner, with Chip as his backup. They were set to live the rest of their natural lives on the campus of North Carolina State University. Jill Biden also was doing her part to help usher in the holidays by accepting delivery of the official White House Christmas tree. The 18 foot- (5.5 meters) -tall Concolor fir grown on a farm in Pennsylvania, the state where the first lady grew up, will fill up the Blue Room after a chandelier is temporarily removed so the tree can be anchored in place for safety. Volunteer decorators began arriving at the White House on Monday to start sprucing it up for Christmas, according to a theme first ladies traditionally reveal after Thanksgiving. Paul and Sharon Shealer of Auburn, Pennsylvania, were crowned this year’s Grand Champion Grower in the National Christmas Tree Association’s National Christmas tree contest. With the award, the winner gets to present a Christmas tree to the White House. It’s the second time that the Shealers have donated a Christmas tree to the White House. They first claimed the association’s top honor in 2000 and presented a tree to first lady Hillary Clinton. Later Monday, Biden and his wife were traveling to Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point near the North Carolina coast to participate in Friendsgiving, or sharing a Thanksgiving-style meal with members of the military and their families. The first lady leads a White House initiative named Joining Forces to support and promote the sacrifices and needs of military families. The president has pushed for and has signed several bills to help service members and veterans, including legislation expanding health care for those who were exposed to toxins from the burning of waste in Iraq or Afghanistan, or to chemicals that were used in previous conflicts. The Bidens’ late son Beau served in the Delaware Army National Guard, including a tour in Iraq, before he died of brain cancer in 2015.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:28 pm ANGOLA — Cathy Perry was practically drooling at Monday’s grand opening of the Hobby Lobby Stores store in Angola. Perry, Hamilton, attended the official ribbon cutting and grand opening, but said it’s not the first time she’s been in the store since it opened last week. It was actually her fourth trip, as she looked at home interior items. Perry was then on a mission to see what else she could find. “I’m a fan,” she said about being a customer. “They have a big selection and sales. Everyone’s friendly and excited.” With a projection of 35-50 new jobs, Hobby Lobby was welcomed to town as Angola’s newest retailer. The privately-held national retail chain was welcomed by local dignitaries and the Angola Area Chamber of Commerce. Hobby Lobby is a craft and home decor chain. Its Angola location is the 23rd in Indiana. The Angola location is in a 56,000 square-foot building formerly occupied by Scott’s Foods, located at North Wayne Street and Harcourt Road in the Country Fair Shopping Center. Hobby Lobby becomes the third anchor in Country Fair since it was opened in the late 1970s. Jobs Hobby Lobby brings to the community will pay $14 per hour for full-time and $9.50 per hour for part-time associates. “The success of our stores in Indiana is a good indicator that area shoppers will be pleased with the quality, selection and value we offer in the craft and home decor market. New customers and customers already familiar with the Hobby Lobby shopping experience are greatly anticipating this store opening,” said John Schumacher, said Hobby Lobby assistant vice president of advertising in a news release. Hobby Lobby is headquartered in Oklahoma City, Okla. It began as Greco, a miniature-picture frame company in 1970. When David Green moved his business from the family’s garage to a 300-square-foot retail space in 1972, Hobby Lobby was founded. Hobby Lobby has nearly 600 stores across the nation that average 55,000 square feet in size. The corporation offers more than 70,000 crafting and home decor products in its stores. Store hours are Monday through Saturday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. All Hobby Lobby stores are closed on Sunday. For more details, visit hobbylobby.com. Log In Keep it Clean.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 4:57 pm Editor, The Daily Clarion PRINCETON — The Samaritan woman at the well in the Bible’s book of John, chapter 4, didn’t volunteer a lot of information about her problems, but Jesus knew she had been through at least five bad relationships, according to scripture. Her life just wasn’t easy. The story of the woman’s hardships, and finding truth and understanding is behind the name of The Well of Gibson County, a new nonprofit organization designed to serve women and moms in this community. Founder Emilie Brown grew up in a single parent home. “I worked hard to break a lot of cycles in my own life,” she said. She earned a degree in human services and counseling at Liberty University, and later married and became a stay-at-home mom. Moving to this area, she began working as a case manager at The Lampion Center in Evansville, helping moms get their general education development (GED) diploma through Evansville Vanderburgh School Corporation. “God just kind of brought that job and put it in my lap,” she said. “I realized that’s my heart, what I want to do. I want to work with women, work with Moms. I’ve seen the struggle and worked through financial barriers.” Brown, a college athlete for two years with a bit of a scholarship, remembers “Mom was a Christian woman and just lived a life of working hard. The things that came easy for most kids in that age group didn’t come as easy for me. Mom didn’t have a college education, and worked minimum wage jobs. It was just a struggle. I always had a heart to work and serve the community, and I figured out with the job at Lampion, that this is what God wanted me to do.” Brown has had her own single mom experience. “My husband and I were divorced for a couple years, but God brought us back together.” They moved from the Evansville area to Gibson County, where their children attend school in South Gibson School Corporation. “I never could shake working with those moms, and I knew that was what God was calling me to do,” she said. She worked with The Isaiah 1:17 Project, but couldn’t leave the whole feeling of wanting to continue to serve women and moms in the community. “I felt God was pressing me to do it,” she said, and was able to make connections with Indiana Department of Child Services local office director Erica Rasler. “She supported me,” Brown said of her vision. “We tried for eight months to get involved with an existing program or nonprofit to umbrella the program. I didn’t know how to start a not for profit organization,” she said. “But I knew that this is a program Gibson County needs. Everyone loved the idea, but it would have been such a process for anyone to take it on, and…and I didn’t want to wait for years and years to do it. “Anyway, I met another woman who told us we need to go the not-for-profit route. She said I had a strong vision and I needed to find people to help. I told Erica, ‘We’re going to fish or cut bait.’ I decided to go the not for profit route, and got the help to get it going.” “So here we are, starting classes in January,” she said. “It’s not just about getting a GED. It’s a program to assist with education, securing housing, information on budgeting. Our goal is for them to realize their personal goals. Some may just need connection and resources and education.” Brown said the first round of free classes is at nearly full capacity, and runs January 10 through mid-May. Moms will meet twice a week from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays at Princeton Public Library. The next round would meet August through December. In January and February, representatives from YWCA will discuss healthy relationships, childhood trauma and other issues. Other guest speakers will share their testimony with the women in the program. The 16 week program is designed to educate moms on how to break cycles and provide resources for them to become financially stable. The program will also feature licensed clinical social workers from Tulip Tree Family Health Services, Gibson County Health Department, and local banking center representatives to help with budgeting and finances. “There’s a broad range of things we can bring to moms. They will have weekly goals. We’ll try to gift them with things provided in the community,” she said, to show them they have support. “We really want to help them get to where they need to be. My heart’s with moms. I felt so strongly that there’s not a lot of programming for parents. If moms are doing good, being productive, in a healthy place, that trickles down to the children,” she said. “Our doors are open for any mother. A lot of moms are wearing all the hats,” she said. “As a community, we need to provide our mothers with more resources and more love, wrapping our arms around them and showing them.” “This has just been on my heart for years,” she said. “I know that this is what God has called me do. ... God had to build my confidence. It’s a struggle for all of us. We all have had our dark times in our lives and struggle. We are all in the same boat and need programming out there to help us to be in a positive atmosphere as women.” Brown said she’s developed partnerships with Head Start, CAPE, DCS, Addiction Solutions, through word of mouth, social media, and with local churches. The non-profit board members with backgrounds in banking, education, womens programs, philanthropic organizations, marketing and DCS bring a variety of resources. Local churches have made contributions, and the group is writing grants for support. For more information, contact Brown at 812-453-5120 or find The Well of Gibson County on Facebook.

UNION CITY, Ind. - When she started out as a high school freshman, now Union City senior Mariah Claywell really was focused on volleyball. Fortunately for the Union City girls basketball program, varsity head coach Sarah Black talked Claywell into at least giving basketball a try… and the rest, as they say, is history! According to Claywell, she never really saw herself as a big scorer on the court, so she focused more on steals and made breaking that record her goal early on in her career. “I really never thought of myself as a player scoring a bunch of points in any games,” Claywell said. “It really wasn’t until my junior year when I found myself scoring more points than I ever thought I would be.” After a major injury to her fellow senior baller, Emily Livingston, early in the season, Claywell stepped up her game to help carry her team to victory. With her consistent scoring efforts per game, Claywell surpassed both girls and boys all-time scoring record at Union City. A feat that pleasantly surprised Claywell, and caused the Tri-Eastern Conference to take notice - naming Claywell to not just the All-Conference team, but as the TEC Player of the Year. Most recently, IBCA/Franciscan Health named her to the Small School All-State team. “Mariah really finds a way to lift up everyone around here,” said Coach Black. “She really works hard and gets her teammates involved as much as possible. She is a true leader and has been a pleasure to have coached!” Aside from her personal commitments and offseason training, Claywell has plenty of support coming from her parents, coaches, teammates and of course the Union City community. “I got messages from just people that live here, congratulating me after I broke the scoring record. It just goes to show how much love and support is part of a small community like Union City,” noted Claywell. Mariah emphasized how important the love and support of her parents and the guidance from Coach Black really helped her get to this point in her high school career. “I have 3 girls but she’s the youngest and she didn’t like sitting at home. She loved to be challenged and would rather play 6 games in a weekend in a gym, get a black eye and bruised ribs than stay home,” said Mariah’s mom Michelle Claywell. “She absolutely loves the competitiveness. She loves defense. She’s the type that doesn’t just want to play a sport she wants to learn everything about it and excel at it.” “She is one of the most competitive people I have ever been around. We are very proud of everything she has done and though it is hard to watch the high schools be over, we are excited to see what is to come for her,” she added. “My mom is one of my biggest supporters, but she is also the first to tell me when I did something wrong during a game,” said Claywell. “My mom and dad really put a lot of time and money into getting from game to game while being on traveling teams for basketball and volleyball. Really, I can’t thank them enough for everything they have done for me!” When it comes to Coach Black, Claywell can not say enough about how she has made a difference in the ballplayer’s life. “She (Coach Black) has helped make me the player I am today,” Claywell said. “I could not have asked for a better coach and mentor. She really helped me grow into the best possible player and leader that I could be!” With the number of records and milestones she has reached, it is hard to believe that her academics don’t suffer. Nothing could be furthest from the truth in Mariah’s case. She currently holds on to a 3.7 GPA, with 32 college credits. Claywell accepted a scholarship to continue her hoops game at Bethel College, where she plans to major in psychology, with a minor in education and criminal justice. “Bethel is lucky to have her,” added Coach Black. “No matter what she puts her mind to, I have no doubt she will accomplish her goals and more!” She stated she would love to eventually have a career in the study of criminal behavior and profiling.

Chance of rain 100%. Rainfall around a half an inch. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:51 pm Winchester Community High School’s student-run Falcon Industries had some special visitors on Tuesday, April 19. Larry Fast, whose generous donation led not only to improvements in the industrial arts facilities at the school, but also an impressive welding program, and the creation of Falcon Industries, visited and brought along journalist Jill Jusko as well. Jusko, who lives in Cleveland, Ohio, is the executive editor of Industry Week Magazine. She has been with Industry Week since the late 1990’s. She has been writing about all facets of manufacturing operations leadership ever since. Her coverage spotlights companies that are in pursuit of world-class results in quality, productivity, cost and other benchmarks by implementing the latest improvement strategies. Jusko also coordinates the magazine’s Best Plant Awards Program, which annually salutes the leading manufacturing facilities in North America. Fast has known Jusko for over 20 years. Fast has been writing a monthly column for Industry Week’s online magazine since 2013. In 2019, his donation led to the construction of the “Larry E. Fast Advanced Manufacturing Center” at WCHS. This in turn led to the establishment of an impressive welding program under the direction of Roger King and Brian Clawson, which has continued to blossom and grow into the student-run Falcon Industries. The business offers a variety of services including welding, basic woodworking, CNC machining (plasma cutting, mill, and lathe), bridgeporting, 3D printing, surface grinding, and manual lathe. They have also begun experimenting with using epoxy in their projects. Falcon Industries has produced items for local manufacturers such as TOA. “We’ve worked well with TOA,” said Clawson. “They have been really pleased with our work. We even have students who have gone on to work for them. They have also hired some of our current students,” he continued. “We’ve also done a lot of work with the mint at Silvertowne,” he added. Falcon Industries can produce a wide variety of products. “We have yet to say no to a project,” said Clawson. Falcon Industries even produced the trophy for this year’s Rich Vogler Classic at the famed Winchester Speedway. They have also done several jobs for local race car driver Brady Bacon. The student-run business also helps out the community as much as possible. They have provided both signs and labor for “Sweet Dreams.” “Sweet Dreams” builds beds for needy children in the area. “We’ve sold a lot of signs,” said Falcon Industries Office Manager Kim Dirksen. “We can do pretty much anything you want on a sign,” she said. “We can go from paper-thin up to about a quarter of an inch thick,” she explained. “This program really gives our kids a head start in entering the workforce,” said Clawson. “Students must apply and interview for a position in Falcon Industries. Just as they would for any other job,” he continued. “The students are doing all of this, themselves. We’re pretty much here to guide them if they get a little off track,” he explained. “These kids walk out of here with a resume and a digital portfolio of their work. This makes them stand out to employers, giving them an edge over many of the other job applicants for these positions,” he added. Roger King is a certified welding instructor. This means that a student can get certified as a welder and go straight from High School to a good paying job in the workforce. Several students who have gone through the program now have good jobs as welders for many area businesses. They have also hired a new welding instructor who began in December, Ryan Farling. Farling comes to WCHS from the Hobart Institute of Welding Technology. Like King he is a certified welding instructor. This addition to the program will allow the certification aspect to continue should King decide to retire. During her daylong visit, Jusko interviewed several of the students involved in the program. She seemed impressed with what these outstanding young men and women have done with Falcon Industries. She was also curious to see the mint at Silvertowne. “She was so intrigued that we took her over to the mint to see it earlier today,” said Fast. “This program is not just for students in Winchester,” said Randolph Central Superintendent Rolland Abraham. “About half of the students in the program are from Winchester. We also have students from Monroe Central, Randolph Southern, North Eastern, and Randolph Eastern in Union City.” he continued. “We have also approached the County Commissioners and the Community Foundation of Randolph County about grants to further improve the facilities,” he added.

But with (Madi) Etchison falling on the floor, getting 50-50 balls, that’s exactly what we have been talking about in practice so I am glad that they executed it.” Elwood (1-14) forced a one-score game after seniors Liv Shannon and Yzabelle Ramey made jump shots inside the paint on consecutive possessions to begin the second quarter. Gothrup responded by connecting with her second 3-pointer to spark a run for the Broncos. On the next possession, Johnson drove through the defense and finished a contested layup. She then secured a steal on the defensive end and scored on her own putback layup to give the Broncos a double-digit lead. Yzabelle Ramey made a pull-up 3-pointer at the top of the key, then followed up by connecting on a shot from the corner to rally the Panthers back in the game. The Elwood senior finished the first half with a 10-1 scoring run by herself to even the battle at 16-16. Daleville opened the third quarter on a 11-0 scoring run as Etchison drilled two corner 3-point shots. After Gothrup finished a layup with her left, she secured the rebound on the next possession and delivered a dime to Johnson on the fast break. Etchison and Johnson scored ten points each in the victory. “Trishell and Addi are always going to be consistent with me, but tonight, Madi really stepped up and broke out as a player,” Fouch said. “I think she really needed that.” The Panthers were only able to cut the deficit inside single-digits on the final possession of the game. Fouch acknowledged the Broncos’ defensive hustle was the biggest takeaway from the game and the objective of earning a home win was met by the team. “We are really excited to be back on the W side of it,” Fouch said. “They needed that. I am just really proud of them, just continuing our winning momentum then knocking it out next week.” Daleville travels North to battle the Southern Wells Raiders (5-8) for the first test of 2023. Elwood will compete in the Madison County Basketball Tournament with a road matchup against the Frankton Eagles (10-3) on Monday. Let's talk Colts!

Ayres downtown store closed 30 years ago this year? (I was working there at the very end.) Shopping has really changed over the years. When I was a child in the 50s and 60s, the place you did your Back to School, Easter, and Christmas shopping was at a department store and L.S. Ayres was the premier department store in the center of Indianapolis, at the corner of Washington & Meridian Streets (opened in 1910). It was quite a massive building with 8 floors, each one devoted to a different department. Back then the elevator operator would call out the merchandise on each floor as the massive doors with glass windows opened and shut. It scared me to look out as we would zip by a floor. There was everything from cosmetics on the first floor where a clerk would spray you with the latest fragrance, to the 8th floor where they had appliances. A whole men’s section with beautiful cashmere sweaters and neckties in little cubby holes was in an attached building in the back on the first floor. Above the men’s floor they had a lunch cafe on the Mezzanine, as they called it back then (balcony section). Once while eating an avocado up there my pit flipped out and I have no idea where it landed down there. Of course, the nicest place to eat was in the Ayres Tea Room on the 8th floor. It was an elegant dining room with huge draped windows and chandeliers that overlooked Meridian Street. In the 50s they had models dressed in the latest fashions strolling through the dining room (my friend Norma was one of those models). There was a treasure chest at the front where children could pick out a toy surprise. (A replica of the Ayres Tea Room is now at the State Museum where you can have the famous Chicken Velvet soup.) In the auditorium next door, Santaland was set up with the train and all the decorations and you could see the “real” Santa Claus and have your picture taken at Christmas. At Easter there was Bunny’s Barnyard with baby animals. When you bought a gift back then they gave you an Ayres box that was so well made you could use them for years — I still have one from the 60s. The sales clerks were very knowledgeable in every department and helped you find the perfect gift. Nowadays you’re lucky to find a clerk at all anywhere you shop. At Ayres back then they had everything from sheet music to bridal gowns, cameras to watch repair, and fishing tackle to fur coats. I always shopped in the Ayres Budget Store in the basement and I never missed an EOM (End of the Month) Sale! When I was 14 my mother was very ill and had my younger sister and I take a bus downtown with $150 in cash and the Christmas list to get the shopping done. Can you imagine feeling safe enough to do that now? Most of us who remember Ayres, remember the bronze cherub that appeared on the top of the clock on the corner of the building to kick off the Christmas season. Here’s a little history about that cherub — in the 1946 Ayres Christmas Catalog, artist Virginia Holmes filled the pages with cherub drawings, because they were still short of merchandise after the war. So since it was Ayres’ 75th Anniversary, a cherub was commissioned to be created by Herron professor David Rubins. I had him as an instructor of History of Sculpture at Herron in the late 60s (grumpy old guy). The day before Thanksgiving the cherub mysteriously shows up perched on the clock every year but one (in 1993 some big shot at May company put it in his garden when they purchased Ayres). Luckily Ayres got him back. The city owns him now and he still is in place every year. David Rubins was a fantastic artist and I still have his anatomy book with drawings of the human body with every muscle and tendon. I think pre-med students could use it – it’s that detailed. The Ayres building has been closed since Carson Pirie Scott moved out. Right now the first floor of the Ayres building is being used for the Sistine Chapel Exhibit through August 28th. I went last week and was amazed at the huge panels of Michelangelo’s work. You don’t have to look up at the ceiling, you can enjoy the magnificent panels at your leisure with an audio tour through your smart phone. The tours are timed every half hour so there is never a big crowd blocking your view (about a dozen people every half hour). You can park in Circle Center and just walk the block down to the old Ayres front entrance. The price is $19 – buy online at www.sistinechapelexhibit.com/indianapolis If you do look up you will see those original Corinthian columns that were in Ayres and if you go to the restroom you will see the Mezzanine.'}]"

Cash continues to be no problem for Qatar, as it is reportedly estimated to have spent $220 billion on building stadiums, infrastructure and even a whole city — yes, there is an entirely new city that didn’t exist a decade ago — for the tournament.
