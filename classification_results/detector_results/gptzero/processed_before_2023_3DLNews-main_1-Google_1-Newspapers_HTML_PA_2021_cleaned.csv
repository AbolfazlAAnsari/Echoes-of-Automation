Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 4:49 am Mary Diehl TITUSVILLE —A Cochranton-area woman is accused of poisoning her adopted handicapped son with windshield washer fluid over Labor Day weekend. The revelation came during testimony Monday at a preliminary hearing in Titusville for Mary Diehl, who is charged by state police with one count of criminal homicide. Diehl, 62, was charged Nov. 8 with killing Najir William Diehl, 11, by poison at their home at 7621 Mallard Road in East Fairfield Township in early September. Police said the younger Diehl was Mary Diehl’s adopted son. State police found the child dead in his bed around 10:30 a.m. Sept. 6 after having been called to the Diehl home, according to Trooper Kevin Geibel, a criminal investigator with state police at Meadville. Diehl told police that she believed the boy had died from suffocating in his bedding due to a seizure, Geibel said. Geibel testified Crawford County Coroner Scott Schell had ruled the death asphyxiation due to seizure disorder since Najir Diehl had a history of seizures. The coroner’s office didn’t perform an autopsy, but blood samples were sent to be tested. “There were no external injuries that I saw,” Geibel said under questioning by Paula DiGiacomo, first assistant district attorney. Toxicology test results received Oct. 26 by the coroner’s office on the blood samples found evidence of methanol poisoning, Geibel testified, adding that subsequent additional testing results received in early November confirmed methanol poisoning. Test results determined the poisoning was done in a single dose on Sept. 5, Geibel said. After the results, Diehl was interviewed again Nov. 8 at the state police barracks. Diehl told investigators that the boy was not able to walk and “was not out of her sight at any point” on Sept. 5,” Geibel said, adding that she told investigators the boy lacked the physical ability to move or remove a cap from a bottle. During the interview, Diehl said any toxic substances like methanol were kept in a separate tool room in the home. Under questioning from investigators, Diehl said that, after dinner on Sept. 5, she and the boy sat in the living room before she then went into the tool room with a plastic cup, Geibel said. The trooper said Diehl told him she filled the cup about 5 inches deep with windshield washer fluid and gave it to him about 8:30 p.m. Geibel testified Diehl admitted “she knew it was a toxic substance.” Diehl told police that she gave the cup to the boy “knowing he’d drink anything given to him,” Geibel testified. Diehl apparently told investigators the boy drank all the fluid in the cup. “To free him,” Geibel testified Diehl responded when asked why she knowingly gave the child a toxic substance. Asked how that would free the child, “That he passes” is what Diehl responded. When Diehl was asked by investigators if passing meant dying, “She answered ‘Right,’” Geibel testified. Geibel said police obtained search warrants for the home and a container of windshield washer fluid was recovered from the tool room. However, the plastic cup that supposedly was used wasn’t found. Diehl was present via video conference for the hearing before Magisterial District Judge Amy Nicols, but did not testify. She remains in the Crawford County jail, where she has been held without bond since her arrest Nov. 8. Nicols ordered Diehl held for trial following the hearing. Her case is scheduled for the May 2022 term of Crawford County Court of Common Pleas. Mary Diehl ""To free him.""

It’s the 175th anniversary of the Associated Press. The news gatherer was created because newspapers in the East wanted information about the on-going United States war with Mexico. Moses Beach, publisher of the New York Sun, got together the publishers of the city’s other papers in 1846 to pay for a group of reporters on horseback to send or carry their dispatches from the battlefields to Montgomery, Ala. From there, a stagecoach would take the reports to Richmond, Va., which was as far south as the newfangled telegraph lines reached, and finally telegraph them to New York. That was the real beginning of that remarkable way to send news, which became known as the Associated Press. In about ten years, there were poles along roads everywhere, carrying news as well as other forms of information over 50,000 miles of wire. When the Civil War began in 1861, the use of codes such as the one created by Samuel F. B. Morse came into wide use, with the length of the electric pulses, one short and the other long, combining to indicate alphabet letters. (Some people called them dots and dashes.) The telegraph reports were put together very carefully, trying not to seem to favor one set of politics over another, so that nobody involved in the reporting invited censorship or partisanship. That gave the process a reputation for fairness and impartiality that helped make the association successful – though you can’t please everyone. Today, the Associated Press claims that half the world’s population has access to its news reporting. It has 248 offices in 99 countries. Its style book, standardizing for newspaper editors how things are spelled, abbreviated, capitalized and whatnot, is in its 55 th edition. The Bulletin was first published by Alexander Cummings on April 17, 1847 as Cummings’ Evening Telegraphic Bulletin. When Cummings sold in 1860, James S. Chambers became publisher. He later lost control to stockholders. From 1859 until 1895, the paper was edited by Gibson Peacock. It was last in circulation of Philadelphia’s 13 daily newspapers. That’s when William L. McLean bought the Bulletin. He cut the two-cent price in half and increased coverage of local news. By 1905 the paper was the city’s largest. McLean’s son Robert took over in 1931. In 1947, the McLeans bought the failing Philadelphia Record, and for the first time The Bulletin began publishing a Sunday edition. The Bulletin was at times the nation’s biggest evening daily, selling more than 760,000 copies daily. Many members of the McLean family worked for The Bulletin through the years, often starting on the huge printing presses or as a truck driver. What happened then is complicated, but The Bulletin went downhill and finally hit bottom. It published its final edition on Jan. 29, 1982. The Associated Press presses on, and now includes television, radio and other media. And it all goes back to those reporters on horseback, 175 years ago.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 5:01 am Connecting the Valley to Print and Digital Built at the Newport News Navy Yard, Virginia, and commissioned in 1916, the USS Pennsylvania (BB-38) was the lead ship of her class of United States Navy “super dreadnought” battleships. During WWII, she participated in every major naval offensive in the Pacific, from Alaska to Okinawa. During WWII, she earned eight battle stars and the US Navy Commendation Award for service. After WWII, the “Pennsy” was used in two atomic bomb tests in July 1946. The ship was decommissioned in August 1946, but was kept at Kwajalein Lagoon for tests until February 1948. The Pennsy was found to have too much radiation and was not sea worthy. She was towed out to sea and sunk. This ad unit is new and hasn't been set up yet for your publication. Contact support@empowerlocal.com and we'll get the item set up. Two of the BB-38 guns, gun 22 (L3) and gun 28 (L2) were left on the ship during an overhaul in 1942 but were replaced in 1945. The guns were relined and sent to the gun barrel storage yard in Dahlgren, Va., where they remained for the past 50 years. They were “rediscovered” during a recent inventory, and the museum acquired them for display in 2009. At the time of their introduction, the 14-inch/45-caliber guns were the most powerful naval ordnance afloat and could fire a 1,400-pound armor-piercing projectile 23,000 yards. The guns used smokeless powder as a propellant and fired separately loaded ammunition with the propellant charges in silk bags. Manufactured in 1912 by the Midvale Steel Company of Philadelphia and the U.S. Navy Gun Factory in Washington, D.C., the guns are of built-up construction. The barrel consists of an inner tube, an outer jacket and eight hoops assembled under extreme heat and pressure to allow the gun to resist the stresses of the expanding propellant gases during firing. The exterior of the guns show three steps along their length and the barrels taper significantly towards the muzzle, ending in a bell shaped muzzle. The guns used a hinged Welin stepped, interrupted screw breechblock opened with a Smith-Asbury mechanism, the latter invented by Dorsey Frost Asbury in 1916 at the Naval Gun Factory in the Washington Navy Yard. The barrels began life as Mk 1 14-inch/45 caliber guns. During the 1930s, both barrels were modified to the Mark 8s which included expanding the volume of the gun’s chamber to allow for increased propellant charges, which increased the muzzle velocity and, therefore, the range. These Mark 8 barrels were installed aboard the ship during a 1940 overhaul. One was installed in turret 1, the other in turret 2. As part of the main battery, these guns were responsible for bombarding shore targets and engaging with enemy ships. During the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Pennsylvania was in dry-dock. Only the ship’s anti-aircraft guns were brought to bear on the attackers; her main batteries remained silent since they were ineffectual against fast-moving targets. These guns would come into play when she supported operations during the campaigns for the Aleutian Islands, the Marshalls and Marianas Islands, Saipan, Guam, Peleliu, and the Philippines. During the Battle of Leyte Gulf, she was the last in the line of battleships when the American fleet performed the “crossing the T” maneuver against the Japanese fleet. Following the battle, she supported the US Army landing operations at Lingayen Gulf. Her main and secondary batteries fell silent in early 1945 when she underwent a major overhaul to replace her worn out guns. These two barrels were removed at that time. They were relined and modified with chromium plating in the bore to increase the life of the barrels, resulting in the Mark 12 designation.

Lee “Laura” Janssen has announced her retirement as editor of the Williamsport Sun-Gazette. When she was promoted to lead the editorial department on Oct. 1, 2017, Janssen became the community newspaper’s first female editor. As such, she has managed the newsroom and served as opinion page editor while continuing to lead and mentor young journalists. “It’s bittersweet to see a trusted and talented co-worker retire after such a productive career. We’re sad to see her go, yet excited for her new chapter in life. I’m grateful to have worked with Laura for many years and her work ethic is amazing,” said Bob Rolley, Sun-Gazette publisher. “The Sun-Gazette is blessed with wonderful, hardworking and dedicated employees and Laura has set that pace. She leaves with an accomplished body of work.” Janssen joined the editorial staff of the Sun-Gazette in 1984 as a general assignment reporter. She covered a number of major news beats, reporting on education, city government and federal courts before joining the editing staff in 1997 as region editor. She was named city editor in 2000 and news editor in 2002, where she spent 15 years coordinating coverage of news stories and photographs among the full-time staff and correspondents and planning the news digests for the daily edition. While news editor, she also oversaw the development of a number of special projects. Those range from staffwide enterprise projects to pre-election political sections to the Sun-Gazette’s annual Person of the Year project. Janssen is the founding editor of West Branch Life magazine, which is published quarterly and distributed to home subscribers of the Sun-Gazette. She also researched and compiled the book, “A Community Keystone: The Official History of the Williamsport Sun-Gazette,” tracing the newspaper’s lineage since the founding of the Lycoming Gazette in 1801. “I have had an amazing and fulfilling career here at my hometown’s local community newspaper,” Janssen said. “It has been an absolute honor to have a front-row seat to witness our community’s growth and rejuvenation. I have nothing but hope for the future of our area.” Janssen has won numerous awards during her nearly four decades with the paper, including state Keystone Awards for “A Community Keystone,” West Branch Life magazine and online journalistic innovation in 2009, among others. Born in Williamsport to Donald Sr. and Hazel Koch, Laura L. Koch graduated in 1974 from Williamsport Area High School. Back then, young women for whom college was out of reach could find a direct path to employment through the courses taught by the high school business department. There, she learned Gregg shorthand from teacher Mary Miller, a skill she would use throughout her life. “I received a really strong foundation from the courses I took at our local high school. While I ultimately went in a different career direction, I relied on the skills I learned in these business classes to help me as a journalist,” she said. “They really helped to make me successful in life.” While she initially became a clerk-stenographer, she really wanted the opportunity to go to college. Her path to college was paved by the Air Force, where she became a flight simulator specialist. Stationed at Carswell Air Force Base in Fort Worth, Texas, she was the first woman in an all-male shop there. “The Air Force provided many life lessons and deepened my appreciation for God, country and community, something that has served me well in my chosen profession,” she said. Four years later, Janssen returned to Williamsport with two sons, Christopher and Dana Janssen, and realized her dream of a college education. She studied journalism at Williamsport Area Community College and then at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, where she graduated magna cum laude in 1984. She joined the Williamsport Sun-Gazette shortly thereafter and hasn’t looked back. Today's breaking news and more in your inbox Old Lycoming Township Supervisor David W.

We are certain our beautiful girl sprinted the 50-yard dash to heaven while wearing high-heels, a sparkling tiara and flaunting her infectious smile. She may even have been driving a skid steer or an excavator! Brooke was a spitfire who brought joy into everyone’s life that she touched. She lived life in the moment, grabbed every opportunity that came her way and made the most of it. Brooke was born in Sayre, PA on Sept. 1, 1995, the youngest daughter of John Edward Preston and Nancy Slabicki. She graduated from the Wyalusing Valley High School, a member of the Class of 2013. She also obtained an Associate’s degree in Business Management from the State College of Florida and was excited about starting her new position as a Radiographer for NVI, LLC in Buffalo, NY, where she resided with the love of her life, Bryan Brown. Brooke had many goals and dreams, and she was determined to earn her Bachelor’s degree. She believed that nothing was too hard or too big to overcome. She was driven, motivated and inspired to succeed. Her first tattoo read “The sky is the limit.” Mere words cannot capture the spirit of our vivacious, fun-loving, spunky girl. She touched the lives of everyone she met. Her heart was huge and overflowed with kindness. She put her own dreams on hold to take care of her grandfather, Martin “Kenny” Slabicki, during his final days. Brooke loved spending time with her family and friends, the beach, road trips, reading, Penguin games, gymnastics and everything that sparkled. We need people like her in our lives to remind us that we cannot live in the past or in the future, but in the moment to make the best of what we have. She is survived by her father, John Preston and “Miss Jackie” Vanderpool and her children, Vanessa, Dutch, Audy, Ava and Lydia of Wyalusing; her mother, Nancy Slabicki and Rich LaFrance of Wyalusing; two sisters and a brother-in-law, Jessica and Ronald Kipp and his children, Taelyr and Daegan of Wyalusing and Jordan Preston and Marco Martin of West Palm Beach, FL; her grandmother, Marie “Linda” Slabicki of Harrisburg; aunts and uncles, Shirley Bristol of Troy, Donna and Ronnie Cole of Wyalusing, Pat and Burt Neuber of Wyalusing, Mary and Glenn Beckley of Wyalusing, Nancy Preston of Herrickville, Sharon and James Ambush of Mt. Holly Springs, Maureen and Jim Stanton of Lenoxville, Janette Slabicki of Harrisburg and Lynn and Ken Benka-Davies of Harrisburg. Brooke is also survived by the extended LaFrance family and a special pet, Bob the dog and also by several cousins and countless friends. She was predeceased by her paternal grandparents, Herbert and Doris Neiley Preston; her maternal grandfather, Martin “Kenneth” Slabicki, and her uncles, Roy Preston and Mike Bristol. Funeral services will be held on Saturday, April 1, at 11 a.m. at the P. Dean Homer Funeral Home, 1 Grovedale Lane, Wyalusing, with the Rev. Heather M. Baker-McAllister officiating. Interment will be held at a later date in the Camptown Cemetery. Friends and family may call on Friday, March 31, from 1 to 3 p.m. and again from 6 to 9 p.m. at the funeral home. Memorial contributions may be made to the Towanda Skilled Nursing Unit, One Hospital Drive, Towanda, PA 18848 or to the Guthrie Hospice, 421 Tomahawk Road, Towanda, PA 18848. These were both near and dear to Brooke’s heart because of the wonderful care they gave to her grandfathers, the late Herb Preston and Kenny Slabicki.

p.m. edition of ""Action News"" in January. He\'ll continue on the 6 p.m. newscast until he retires at the end of 2022. Jim Gardner has been the face of local news in Philadelphia for 44 years, and Wednesday’s Action News was no different than any 6 p.m. broadcast he’s delivered on 6ABC during his time in the anchor’s chair. But at the end of the broadcast, Gardner delivered breaking news of a more personal nature — he’s retiring. Gardner, 73, is dialing back his schedule a bit beginning in January, when he will give up hosting the 11 p.m. edition of Action News. He’ll continue to anchor the 6 p.m. newscast alongside Ducis Rodgers and Cecily Tynan until he turns in his earpiece for good at the end of 2022. “I look forward, for instance, to being able to watch a Sixers game on television with my wife, or, my goodness — to even go to a game on a weeknight. Or maybe even linger over dinner, or doze off reading a book before 2 in the morning,” Gardner told viewers Wednesday night. “It is a lifestyle I haven’t experienced in 45 years, and it’s time.” In an interview with The Inquirer, Gardner said he considered winding down his career several times in recent years but ended up signing two additional extensions with the station because the news was so interesting to cover, whether it was the coronavirus pandemic or the four-year tenure of former President Donald Trump. “The whole Trump phenomenon was an extraordinary political story,” Gardner said. “I’m kind of a politics nerd, and it was something I wanted to have within the boundaries of my broadcast career.” It goes without saying Gardner is an institution in Philadelphia, even if he doesn’t think of himself that way. He’s the city’s longest-tenured on-air personality, and for many viewers, it’s hard to hear the famed Action News jingle and not see his face. But he was born and raised in New York City, and after graduating from Columbia University, Gardner landed radio jobs in New York before being offered his first TV job in Buffalo. » READ MORE: 6ABC’s David Murphy on leaving ‘Action News,’ kissing Jodie Foster, and what’s next There was just one catch: Gardner’s real name is James Goldman, and he was asked by the station’s owners to use a different name on the air because of the small size of Buffalo’s Jewish population. “It was a weighty thing to do for me and my family at the time,” Gardner said. “But I really wanted a job in television, and that job was a really good one. … After thinking about it for a relatively short period of time, I said, ‘Yes, I can do that.’” His professional name stuck, and after just two years in Buffalo, Gardner was hired away by 6ABC in 1976 as a reporter and their noon anchor. A year later, he was given the anchor position on the 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts vacated by Larry Kane, where he’s remained for the last 44 years. “For many of us, Jim is the last news voice we hear before ending our day. He has guided us through the good and the bad with calm confidence for more than 40 years, often reassuring us that tomorrow will bring a better day,” Bernie Prazenica, president and general manager of 6ABC, said in a statement. “Thankfully, we have another year with him during the 6 p.m. newscast, and we look forward to his continued presence and leadership.” 6ABC has long been the most-watched station in Philadelphia, and for nearly 45 years Action News has been the dominant newscast. Gardner’s departure leaves a big spot to fill and comes after his longtime colleague David Murphy said goodbye to 6ABC after 31 years as a meteorologist and reporter. Murphy was replaced on the station’s morning Action News broadcasts by Karen Rogers. It’s too early to know who will have the unenviable position of filling the empty chair left behind by Gardner, but he’s certain the transition will be seamless. “There is such depth here, and such ability and quality, that there won’t be a dent, believe me,” Gardner said. “It’ll be great.”'}]"

Faster administration could save lives right now."" More: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis spars with CNN reporter over state\'s COVID-19 vaccine rollout For months, government officials have said that to maximize the benefit of a limited supply of vaccines people should be vaccinated by category, starting with health care workers on the front line of fighting COVID-19. As the first vaccine was approved, an advisory committee to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expanded the initial group to include nursing home residents, who have been particularly hard-hit by the pandemic, and those who care for them. As of Wednesday, only 28% of vaccine doses distributed to hospitals and 13% of those allocated to nursing homes have been delivered into arms, according to CDC data, prompting the shift in priority. Azar said the rates are better than they appear, because of a lag in reporting. In Washington, D.C., for instance, 40% of pharmacies have not yet reported into the system, he said. Also the recent holidays and three major snowstorms have disrupted distribution, Gen. Gus Perna, who has led the government\'s distribution program, said at the news conference. So far, the government has delivered nearly 20 million doses of vaccine to 13,000 locations in all 50 states as well as U.S. territories, Perna said. Until about two weeks ago, the plan had been to distribute those 20 million doses by the end of December. He also moderated expectations for the next few months. While he had previously said there would be 50 million doses available in January, he said Wednesday he received confirmation from the two vaccine suppliers – Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna – that each would supply at least 20 million doses this month. Both are still expected to provide 100 million doses by the end of March, he said, adding: ""But again, it will depend on how everything goes with manufacturing, as we go forward."" While Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said that soon, 1 million people should be able to be vaccinated per day, Perna declined to commit to that figure or any other. Moncef Slaoui, who has led the scientific side of the vaccine effort, said he hopes a third vaccine, made by Johnson & Johnson, will be ready for regulatory review by the end of this month. The J&J vaccine would require only one shot to provide full protection against COVID-19, unlike the current vaccines, which are given in two doses. That vaccine is also easier to manufacture at large scale, Slaoui said. The government has bought 100 million doses of the J&J vaccine, which will hopefully become available beginning early next month, he said.

High 69F. Winds light and variable. Chance of rain 50%.. Cloudy skies. Low 57F. Winds light and variable. Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 4:51 am John Rigas, founder of the former cable television giant Adelphia Communications Corp. and former owner of the Buffalo Sabres who went to prison in a federal fraud case after the collapse of Adelphia, died Thursday in Coudersport. He was 96. His death was confirmed by Thomas E. Fickinger Funeral Home Inc. Rigas, who built Adelphia from the ground up, was granted compassionate release from a federal prison sentence in 2016 due to declining health, as he had bladder cancer that had spread to his lungs. At the time, attorneys said Rigas had approximately 6 months to live. Rigas and his son, Timothy, were both indicted for bank, wire and securities fraud in 2002, convicted in 2004, and sentenced to 15 years in federal prison in 2005. After an appeal was rejected in 2007, Rigas and his son were ordered to report to prison, and a year later, their final appeal was struck down in federal court. The family has maintained that the Rigases are innocent. Rigas founded Adelphia in Coudersport. It was once the nation’s fifth-largest cable company, with more than 5 million customers in 31 states and Puerto Rico. It was a business that he built from nothing, explained Donald Gilliland, contributing editor of The Hill and former managing editor of the Potter Leader Enterprise newspaper in Coudersport. Gilliland spent six months in New York City covering the Rigas trial for The Era and other area newspapers. Currently, he is a journalism professor at St. Bonaventure University. “First, the past is the past. What happened, happened. I don’t think it serves anyone’s interest to relitigate the trial,” Gilliland said. Instead, he talked about his experience in getting to know John Rigas during the months spent in the courtroom. There weren’t a lot of people who sat through the months-long trial, mostly just members of the Rigas family and a few members of the media. “Very often there was an older, white-haired man who would sit all the way in the back,” Gilliland explained. “Oftentimes during breaks, John would go back and sit down next to this guy and they would chat and laugh. It was clear they were old friends.” Curious, Gilliland approached the man. “He was an old cable guy. He had known John from the old days. He thought it might be nice for John to see a familiar face.” Gilliland explained that when the Adelphia scandal hit, it was the company’s 50th anniversary. This man told Gilliland about Rigas’ hard work building the cable company from the ground up, and about the tremendous amount of work that had gone into it. He described Rigas driving his own vehicle to other states and places to try to build a customer base, and “literally go knocking door-to-door to get customers. It’s easy to forget that.” “It was a hell of a lot of work and John did it,” Gilliland said. “He literally built a cable company from scratch. By 2002 it was the fifth-largest cable company in the United States. “John started out with ambition and entrepreneurial spirit and built something that hadn’t existed before, and he worked his tail off to do it. “Whatever happened at the end, I don’t think that should overshadow it.” Gilliland shared another observation from his months in the courtroom — Rigas was a kind and pleasant man. “I got to know John at one of the lowest points of his life,” Gilliland said. “Courtrooms are not known for being particularly great places to strike up friendships. Yet as soon as there was a break, John would stand up and walk straight over to the reporters to chat.” So much so, in fact, that the judge admonished the reporters for talking to the defendant, despite Rigas being the one to initiate conversation. Gilliland said he keeps in touch with reporters from the trial, and “the reminiscences of John are always pleasant. He was friendly and chatty. He had a personality that was difficult not to like. “The bottom line was he was a charming guy.” Adelphia filed for bankruptcy after a seemingly off-hand admission by an executive, in March of 2002, that the company had more than $2 billion in off-book loans, not included in its annual Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The viability and net worth of the company were seen in an entirely different light in the wake of that disclosure. Rigas was ousted from the board of directors. Adelphia spiraled down, and cable companies it owned were acquired by competitors. Adelphia prosecutors had accused Rigas and others of using complicated cash-management systems to spread money around to various family-owned entities and as a cover for stealing about $100 million for themselves by using the company’s financial ledger like a personal piggy bank. The Rigases involved were ordered to give up a major portion of their assets, but a bankruptcy judge later allowed some of them to retain several local companies “to make a living.” They formed Zito Media Communications, and have expanded repeatedly, now holding numerous cable franchises and providing internet services, digital phone and other communications services to corporate, municipal and school district customers. Adelphia was sold to Time Warner and Comcast in April 2005 for $17.6 billion. In February of 2007, the former Time Warner call center in Coudersport closed, putting 500 people out of work. All told, losing the company meant the loss of 1,500 jobs in Coudersport. Gilliland said one of Rigas’ legacies is that Coudersport is one of the most highly wired towns in the United States. “What John was trying to do in terms of locating a major business in a rural area, I think, was forward-looking, to some extent ahead of its time,” he said. “Unfortunately, I don’t know that anyone in Potter County government has leveraged the infrastructure they have as much as they could have.” There’s fiber optics in place all over the community. With working remotely so much more prevalent after the pandemic, Rigas literally laid the groundwork to make Coudersport a thriving community, Gilliland said. “Because there’s fiber all over Coudersport, there’s all kinds of business that could operate out of that town if the (government) had the wherewithal to recruit them,” he said. John Rigas was born in Wellsville, N.Y., in 1924, to Greek immigrants, James and Eleni Rigas. Known as an entrepreneur from early on, Rigas began as a shoe-shine man in Wellsville before introducing Texas hots — chili-topped hotdogs — to the community in 1921. After serving in the U.S. Army in World War II, he returned to Wellsville and enrolled at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., studying engineering. He took a job with Sylvania in Emporium. In 1952, he started his first business venture, buying a movie theater in Coudersport. The Rigas cable television enterprise first started in Coudersport when the family purchased the town’s TV cable franchise. Always looking to grow his company, Rigas had teamed with his brother Gus to start Adelphia after buying out his partners. They borrowed heavily to buy more and more suburban cable companies and avoided city franchises. Eventually, Adelphia became the largest cable provider outside Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Cleveland and South Florida and had systems reaching more than 30 states and more than 5.6 million customers. Adelphia also launched product lines such as high-speed cable Internet service and long-distance telephone service. Rigas had owned the Buffalo Sabres franchise of the National Hockey League. Following his arrest, the NHL stripped him of his authority over the Sabres. After more than a year as a ward of the league, the franchise was purchased by Tom Golisano.

The two-pronged effort to remove Trump from office in the waning days of his presidency comes after a pro-Trump mob broke into the Capitol last week in a deadly riot. Democrats can bring up on Tuesday the 25th Amendment resolution and the House could consider the impeachment article the following day. ""There may well be a vote on impeachment on Wednesday,"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters. If passed by the Democrat-controlled House, Hoyer said the impeachment article should immediately be sent to the Senate. Some Democrats have suggested the article be delayed to give the Senate time to first consider President-elect Joe Biden’s nominations and top policy priorities before holding an impeachment trial. While the article has no Republican co-sponsors, Rep. David Cicilline, one of the authors, said he\'s hopeful some will vote for it. “He incited insurrection against the government of the United States that resulted in the death of five individuals, dozens of people injured in violence here at the Capitol,” the Rhode Island Democrat told reporters Monday. Cicilline said he and other Democrats would prefer that Vice President Mike Pence trigger the 25th Amendment or that Trump resigns on his own. ""Days have passed, and it is clear that neither of those possibilities will be realized,"" Cicilline wrote in an opinion piece in The New York Times published Monday. ""So it is Congress’s responsibility to act."" Rep. Alex Mooney, R-W.Va., on Monday blocked Democrats from bringing up a resolution to urge Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and become acting president. Under House rules, it took only one lawmaker to block immediate consideration of the resolution aimed at pressuring Republicans to take power away from Trump. Mooney had been among the House Republicans who voted last week not to accept the state-certified election results showing Trump lost reelection. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Republican\'s rejection of the resolution is enabling Trump\'s ""unhinged, unstable and deranged acts of sedition to continue."" ""Their complicity endangers America, erodes our Democracy, and it must end,"" she said in a statement. The resolution calls on Pence and the Cabinet to, within 24 hours, ""declare what is obvious to a horrified Nation: That the President is unable to successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office."" Pence has not shown an interest in triggering the never-used section of the amendment that could strip Trump of his authority. A slight majority of respondents surveyed after last week\'s riot by Quinnipiac University said Trump should be removed from office: 52% to 45%. The breakdown was similar for those saying Trump should resign. Pelosi said Sunday that lawmakers must ""act with urgency"" because Trump is an imminent threat to both the Constitution and democracy. ""As the days go by, the horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this President is intensified and so is the immediate need for action,"" she wrote in a letter to colleagues. The impeachment article charges Trump with inciting an insurrection by falsely claiming the Nov. 3 election was stolen from him and encouraging supporters to storm the Capitol as lawmakers were certifying the results. ""President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government,"" the article reads. ""He threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government. He therefore betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States."" While a growing number of Republicans have denounced Trump\'s actions, there is not broad GOP support for impeaching Trump or removing him from office. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Friday it would be better if Democrats and Republicans worked together to facilitate the peaceful transfer of power from Trump to Biden. That view was echoed Monday by Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer, head of the campaign arm for House Republicans. In a statement, Emmer said House Democrats’ efforts to remove Trump are politically motivated and “will fracture our nation even more instead of bringing us together.” For his part, Biden on Friday dodged when asked by reporters whether he supported impeachment. Biden said he would leave that question up to lawmakers. \'It could have been much, much worse\': Video, witness accounts reveal darker intent of some Capitol rioters Report: Former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund\'s request for National Guard backup was denied'}]"

I propose national televised debates on climate change and massive bills like the infrastructure package and Build Back Better and term limits and age limits for our elected officials.Al Carmello Spring Township Americans should not have to suffer for another three years for the lies, incompetence and failures of this administration. The trillion-dollar Build Back Better (Broke) bill will finish the job initiated by this administration of dealing a deadly blow to America. Check out the views of some of our leaders. President Joe Biden claimed we wouldn’t leave Afghanistan until all Americans and Afghan interpreters are out. Vice President Kamala Harris went to Guatemala to find the root causes of illegal immigration months after Biden gave her border responsibility. Since then, crickets. U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib supports the Breathe Act, which proposes emptying out the federal prisons within 10 years. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg tells people that if they bought an electric car, they wouldn’t have to pay high gas prices. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm was asked if she had any solutions for high gas prices. She laughed and replied that she wished she had a magic wand. U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says she doubts the existence of smash-and-grab crimes. Evidently she has no TV set and talks to no one. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas thought there was no crisis at the border. He said the border is closed while hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants are coming over, around, through and under the border into America. There is so much more. I propose national televised debates on climate change and massive bills like the infrastructure package and Build Back Better and term limits and age limits for our elected officials.

Without other changes, that would leave only a Thursday and Sunday edition in print. “These actions by the company are part of the company’s entrepreneurial and First Amendment decision to deliver our news content exclusively online,” states the letter, which was signed by Carolyn J. Rice of the company’s human resources department. It’s addressed to Ed Blazina of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh, which represents reporters, photographers, copy editors and other newsroom employees. Representatives for P-G management and its parent company, Block Communications, did not immediately return requests for comment late Wednesday. “We are prepared to discuss effects the company’s decision will have on your bargaining unit,” the company’s letter to Blazina states. Though the letter is dated Dec. 31, the Guild took to Twitter to say its members just received it on Wednesday. The Guild lamented that at the end of next month, the P-G’s Friday edition is set to be slashed “from their already diminished printing schedule.” The move follows a series of cuts to the P-G’s print product in recent years. In August 2018, the Post-Gazette stopped publishing its print edition on Tuesdays and Saturdays, with the owners and managers citing rising production costs and the goal of increasing its focus on digital news platforms. In October 2019, two more days of print editions were slashed, leaving three daily editions a week. The reduction comes amid ongoing turmoil between the P-G’s employees and upper management and the Block family, which has owned the Post-Gazette since 1927. Last year, union members voted they had “no confidence” in the paper’s leadership. That vote was followed by a monthlong byline strike. In July, the Guild accused Post-Gazette management of unlawfully declaring an impasse and implementing management’s proposed cuts to health benefits, severance packages and vacation time. Management also sought to eliminate the right to dispute issues through grievances and arbitration. Efforts have been in the works among union leaders to prepare for a possible work stoppage strike. The Guild authorized the strike in August in response to what union leaders described as management’s unfair labor practices and negotiating tactics and a hostile work environment.

Alto baseball team. (Charlene Lentvorsky photo) Jonathan Lentvorsky, like thousands of Pennsylvania high school class of 2020 athletes, lost his final spring of athletics when the governor shut down schools to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. That made Lentvorsky’s decision of where to go to college that much more important. Lentvorsky was determined to find a place to play baseball — and right away. Turns out the West Perry grad, and two of his classmates — Kaden Robinson and Dylan Reisinger — made wise decisions. The three Mustangs signed on to continue their academic and athletic careers at Penn State Mont Alto. And made the best of their circumstances. The Lions, with contributions from the trio, won the PSUAC-West title with a 20-5 record, played for the conference championship and made the eight-team small college world series. The Lions beat Wright State 4-1 in the opening round in the world series, then dropped a 1-0 decision Cincinnati-Clermont before being eliminated from contention on a 5-1 loss to Bryant-Stratton. Mont Alto finished the year with a 25-7 mark. For Lentvorsky, his choice was simple. “My only decision was where I could play. I didn’t go for academics, I went (to Mont Alto) to play baseball,” Lentvorsky explained. Lentvorsky, who is focused on a career as a state trooper, added, “I wanted to take criminal justice, but they don’t offer that at Mont Alto so I’m majoring in supply chain management. To get into the police academy, I need to be 21 and have 60 college credits. Supply chain management is my fall-back position.” Lentvorsky, a dean’s list student, got a late start on his collegiate career. Ticketed to start in left field and pitch every six games, or so, he injured his elbow in winter workouts and missed the first couple of weeks. As he rehabbed he started getting time as a designated hitter or as a pinch hitter. Gradually, he worked his way back into the starting lineup. Lentvorsky, who expects to be the starting catcher this year, played in 27 games and hit .283 with nine RBI, 14 runs and nine stolen bases. He had multiple hits in four games, including three with a double in a win over PSU-Beaver. He also had a pair of RBI in a win over PSU-DuBois, the PSUAC and small college world series champs. Two highlights of his first season at Mont Alto were making it to the world series and experiencing it with two high school buds. He said, “It was great being with Kaden and Dylan. We’ve been friends since we were little kids. Being able to extend that through college is amazing. “And, making the world series was amazing. My sophomore year (at West Perry) we made states, but this was bigger because we were (among) the final teams there.” Unlike Lentvorsky, Robinson had no designs on continuing with baseball. He was going to Mont Alto to work toward a degree in forest ecosystem management. “Originally, I wasn’t planning on playing baseball. I was going to pursue a degree in forestry,” Robinson said. “When COVID hit and my senior year was cancelled, it hit me hard. I really missed playing. The coach asked me if I would come out for the team. That’s when I made the decision to play.” He’s glad he did. “I loved playing at Mont Alto. The coaches are amazing. They are focused on academics,” said Robinson, who was named to USCAA all-academic team and was honored for academic achievement for a first-year forest technology student. “The whole team is great. I love playing with the guys. “The quality of baseball in our conference is pretty good. In our division, there are three teams that are going to battle for the championship and two that aren’t as good, but you’ll have that in any league.” Robinson handled a relief role, working six innings over six appearances with an ERA of 4.50. Robinson is planning to play his final year at Mont Alto, then put aside baseball when he moves on to Penn State’s main campus. He’ll look back without any regrets. “Going to Mont Alto was a very good decision,” Robinson said. “And I’m glad I decided to play baseball. It’s been a great experience.” Reisinger, also a forest technology major who made dean’s list, fit in well in the Lions’ outfield rotation.

President Judge Kim Berkeley Clark said in an open letter posted on the court’s website it is time for Allegheny County’s judicial system to recognize systemic racism and work to combat it. The longtime Allegheny County prosecutor turned family court judge posted the letter to the community last week with the goal of engaging citizens and reassuring them they will be treated fairly in the court system. “We have to start right now with acknowledging in a public way, yes, there is systemic racism, and yes, there is racial and ethnic disparity,” Clark said in an interview Monday. “I just figured enough is enough, and now is a good time to address the court’s commitment to these issues.” In the letter, Clark, who is Black, talks about taking into account “the uneven playing field on which racial and ethnic minorities, those who do not squarely fit into traditional gender roles, other disadvantaged persons, and the poor enter the justice system. The public must see members of our local judiciary and court staff working with urgency to attain this goal in equal solidarity with them, with other justice-related institutions, and with each other.” Clark said she believes there is a perception in the public the courts are not fair. “What we need to do is ensure that we develop a justice system that not only promotes equality, but ensures equity,” she wrote. Clark pointed to programs and processes she said are already in place to address racial and ethnic disparity in the justice system. They include diversionary programs in juvenile and criminal court; treatment courts for veterans and others with mental health or drug and alcohol issues; housing court to reduce evictions; the reduction of the Allegheny County Jail population; implementation of anti-discrimination and implicit bias training; and collaboration with local groups, including the University of Pittsburgh Institute of Politics, to further address criminal justice reform. “We have made progress, but the struggle is ongoing,” Clark wrote in her letter. “We are committed to collecting and examining the data to identify disparities throughout all divisions of the justice system and will continue to examine our processes and procedures that might contribute to racial and ethnic injustice.” As part of that ongoing analysis, Clark is seeking the creation of a mission that will show the public the court’s commitment to equity and to ending disproportionality. “The mission will conspicuously appear on our website to remind the public that they have a right to justice that is free of bias and that the Court is firmly committed to addressing and eradicating ethnic and racial disparity, implicit bias, and systemic racism in our system of justice,” she wrote. Clark said she has asked a diverse group to help in that process. David A. Harris, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh who studies race and the criminal justice system, applauded Clark’s willingness to address the topic. “I think it’s a good start, but it’s time for action,” Harris said. “We want to know what the plan is to confront these issues, and if we don’t have one yet, how are we going to come up with one?” Harris also said he was puzzled by the lack of reference to local incidents where race came into play. “I don’t think we can simply pretend those things just didn’t happen in our front yard — in our justice system,” Harris said. In the letter, Clark references the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky at the hands of the police, but she does not address anything that’s occurred in Allegheny County. There is no mention of the fatal shooting three years ago of Antwon Rose in East Pittsburgh that led to widespread protest; no mention of former Common Pleas Judge Mark V. Tranquilli, who voluntarily resigned his position on the eve of a judicial misconduct trial for referring to a Black juror as “Aunt Jemima,” and no reference to a dispute this month in which District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala Jr. forbade his office from offering plea deals to a Black defense attorney after that man called the DA’s office “systematically racist.” Clark said she originally included Rose’s death in the letter but then removed it, which she said was a mistake she regrets. As for the Tranquilli situation, she said it did not belong. “Judge Tranquilli is an individual, and his conduct was dealt with appropriately,” Clark said. “I think that’s sort of an outlier issue that’s not representative of the systemic racism issues. I don’t want to focus on the one judge who we know did something horrible. I think things are more subtle, and it clouds the issue.” And referring to the dispute between Zappala and defense attorney Milt Raiford, Clark said her letter had nothing to do with that. “This was not to be a response to that,” she said. “It was written long before that.” Clark said that there must be a review of data at all points along the way of the court system to see where the differences are between white people and people of color. “We have a lot of work to do,” she said. “Anybody that would say there’s not racial disparity is like an ostrich with their head in the sand.” Society is uncomfortable discussing these issues, she said, because it can feel like an accusation.

FILE PHOTO: Joe Scarnati A rapidly expanding business-consulting and lobbying firm that counts the state Senate's newly retired leader as a partner is gearing up to become a major player in Pennsylvania political circles with ties to a $432,000 campaign slush fund. Joe Scarnati joined the new firm, Allegheny Strategy Partners, after retiring in December from a two-decade career in Harrisburg, most of which he spent in the upper echelon of power as Senate president pro tempore. The Jefferson County Republican teamed up with partners Nick Varischetti, a former prosecutor and Pittsburgh lawyer, and Tommy Johnson, a former energy company lobbyist. The firm, launched in November by Johnson and Varischetti, has since added Megan Crompton, a veteran lobbyist and ex-Senate staffer from a politically connected family. Scarnati is far from the first state political leader to immediately register as a lobbyist or take a prominent private sector role. But new campaign finance filings show he may be entering that world with access to one of the largest political funds in recent memory. A successful fundraiser, Scarnati had about $650,000 left between two political action committees in the final months of his tenure, according to campaign filings. Some of that went toward Senate Republican candidates, who won enough seats to keep their long-held majority in Harrisburg. At the same time as Scarnati was spending on those races, he transferred the majority of the funds in his main campaign account to a brand new political committee – Northwest Leaders PAC, registered in DuBois, Clearfield County, near where his campaign had previously been headquartered. The PAC’s chairman and treasurer, Peter Varischetti and Mark Freemer, respectively, are the top executives at Varischetti Holdings in Scarnati’s hometown. Scarnati’s new business partner, Nick Varischetti, is the sibling of Peter Varischetti and is also a partner at Varischetti Holdings, which is described on Allegheny Strategy Partners’ website as a “family-owned and operated organization consisting of several different businesses, including real estate investments, powder metal manufacturing, an oil and gas field services company, and waste industry consulting.” Scarnati, Johnson and Nick Varischetti did not return requests for comment. In a statement upon joining the firm, Scarnati said, “I am excited at the prospect of joining two people I know and trust at a time when they’re building something from the ground up. There is no question that the landscape in the advocacy space is changing. This team’s approach, coupled with the talent being assembled will make this firm a market leader.” Peter Varischetti, when asked whether Northwest Leaders PAC would have any restrictions around Allegheny Strategy Partners, said in an email the PAC “is engaged in supporting candidates locally and statewide with a pro-business agenda.” The PAC has not fundraised at all aside from the two large transfers from Scarnati’s other political action committees, according to new filings updated as of Dec. 31. After forming in early October, the PAC received $200,000 from Scarnati’s primary campaign account, which was left with a balance just under $60,000 after some other spending in December. And Northwest Leaders PAC received another $232,000 when the other Scarnati-linked political committee, Citizens for a Better Pennsylvania, emptied out its account at the end of December. That committee, which had also been chaired by Peter Varischetti and whose treasurer was Scarnati’s wife, Amy, collected donations for decades but had not spent in large sums until this past year, according to campaign finance reports. [Citizens for a Better Pennsylvania spent about $400,000 in early 2020 to mostly support the failed campaign of Scarnati’s hand-picked successor. And in the waning days of that primary, Scarnati also used the PAC to collect $42,500 from four top executives of a gaming company. They were the largest donations the committee had received in the entire year, and they came as Scarnati and other top Republicans were quietly pushing to expand gambling in the state, The Caucus and Spotlight PA reported.] Now equipped with the combined $432,000, it’s unclear how Northwest Leaders PAC will use that money beyond support of pro-business candidates. Other retired legislative leaders have held onto campaign cash for years, giving the money to other like-minded campaigns and allies, or spending it for their own purposes, including legal costs. “It’s not uncommon and it’s legal,” said political analyst G. Terry Madonna, of Millersville University. The amount might be a bit unusual, he said, but the practice of having campaign money left to spend on elections is commonplace, Madonna said. “Money brings influence, but so do acquaintances throughout state government. When you get a person who had been in senior leadership, there’s a tremendous advantage when you talk about their contacts in the administration and the Legislature,” he said. Ethics laws prevent Scarnati from lobbying senators for one year, though he can lobby the House and executive branch. Laws do not prevent him from donating to the campaigns of legislators he is lobbying, and Pennsylvania remains one of the few states without limits on state-level campaign contributions. Plans to bolster Pennsylvania’s weak campaign finance laws repeatedly came up short over Scarnati’s career, during which close scrutiny was applied to how he raised and spent his own campaign cash. It’s also unclear who Allegheny Strategy Partners’ clients are or will be. The firm and its handful of lobbyists have registered with the Department of State but have not filed any of the reports necessary to begin working for specific companies. The lobbyists themselves have far-reaching connections, though. Crompton, whose husband Drew was appointed in late 2019 to a position on Commonwealth Court after a long career as Scarnati’s chief of staff and top counsel, comes from another top Harrisburg lobbying firm, Long Nyquist. Lobbyist disclosures indicate Megan Crompton and her previous firm represented a litany of companies including those in energy, pharmaceuticals and gaming. She also spent almost a decade as an aide to Sen. Tommy Tomlinson, R-Bucks County. Her sister, Merritt Reitzel, serves on the Gaming Control Board as a Scarnati appointee. Scarnati was one of the most prominent Republicans in Harrisburg over the past 15 years. He began his career working in his family’s restaurant business. He was elected to the Senate in 2000 and became president pro tempore, the Senate’s top-elected post, in 2006. Upon the death of former Lt. Gov. Catherine Baker Knoll in November 2008, Scarnati succeeded Knoll as called for in the state Constitution but also remained in his Senate seat and leadership post. He filled Knoll’s term through January 2011. Johnson came with 15 years of experience at Pittsburgh-based CONSOL Energy and CNX Resources. Johnson is a former legislative aide to Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum and a campaign energy advisor to former President Donald Trump. Varischetti is a Pittsburgh lawyer and former federal prosecutor. He remains “of counsel” at Burns White, the law firm where he spent the past decade. Varischetti is a shareholder and director of Guardian Elder Care Holdings, Inc., a health care provider with more than 60 nursing facilities statewide and related interests. The latest addition to the firm is Will Dando, a former top Senate staffer and director of government affairs for the Pennsylvania Coal Alliance, a Harrisburg-based trade association. – Follow The Caucus on Twitter @CaucusPA.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 4:49 am CLARION – A jury acquitted a Clark man of all charges related to the crash in 2018 that killed two other Mercer County men and injured another. Flynn was tried this week in Clarion County Common Pleas Court, and the jury rendered its verdict Thursday afternoon. Pennsylvania State Police in Clarion filed 23 charges on Dec. 20, 2018, against Joseph Michael Flynn, 26, for his alleged role in the deaths of his friends Mark Marcucci of West Middlesex and Kevin Yarabinec of Sharpsville. Flynn was charged with homicide by vehicle while under the influence, aggravated assault by vehicle, driving under the influence, involuntary manslaughter, assault, reckless endangerment and seven traffic violations in connection with the fatal crash. According to the criminal complaint, Flynn was driving a pickup truck with Marcucci, Yarabinec and Cody Alan Hughes as passengers, shortly after midnight April 14, 2018, on Miola Road in Highland Township, Clarion County. About half a mile north of Bigley Road, the truck left the road, hit a culvert, a road sign, then two trees before spinning and stopping. The three passengers were thrown from the truck. Flynn and Hughes were flown to Pittsburgh hospitals, Marcucci was pronounced dead at the scene, and Yarabinec was flown to a Pittsburgh hospital, where he died April 15 from his injuries. A state police investigation determined that Flynn was driving between 86 and 93 mph despite the posted speed limit of 40 mph, and blood work later determined Flynn's blood alcohol content was .143 percent. The legal limit in Pennsylvania is 0.08. Defense Attorney Blair Hindman had made the argument at Flynn's preliminary hearing, that Flynn was not driving the truck. The prosecution presented three witnesses at the preliminary hearing to argue that Flynn was the driver: Hughes, a paramedic and a state trooper. Hughes testified that Flynn had been driving. Mona Weaver, a paramedic who responded to the crash, said Flynn told her he had eight to 10 beers. The state trooper said Flynn told him at the scene that he owned the truck and that he may have been driving. The trooper later requested a search warrant for the medical records including Flynn's blood work. Hindman said there was lax probable cause for the search warrant because Flynn's statement should not have been used because of his face and head injuries and the hectic nature of the crash scene. Hindman also argued that DNA evidence recovered from the inside of the truck did not belong to Flynn. The DNA evidence was allegedly recovered from the driver's pillar, the driver's airbag and the center console of the truck, Hindman said. Clarion County District Attorney Drew Welsh had no comment Friday. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.

Woodland Place is a “thorn in the side,” Kaibas said. But “if we don’t pay” the county’s credit rating will suffer. He noted that the home has 100 employees and only 90 patients. Ammann said under the terms of the bailout, the county is allowed to bring in a management consultant, which it hasn’t done. Ryan said he needs to find out why the home “can’t make it” and that there has to be an “escape clause” for the county. “We can’t pour good money after bad.” Candidates were also asked about the commissioners’ responsibilities and whether or not the job was full time. Kaibas said the job has not been full-time for a number of years, though it should be, considering the $56,000 salary. The main duties, he said, are budgeting and overseeing county offices. Templeton and Ryan both said they would treat the job as full-time. Ryan said the county budget and elections office are the office’s main responsibilities. Templeton said the budget oversight is important, and that row offices should not be micro-managed — elected officials already do that. Ammann said that some months a commissioner is full-time, others not. He said elections is an area that needs much more attention paid to it. Beader said the job takes up about 50 to 60 hours per week and made complex by the large amount of federal and state money that has mandates placed on how it is spent. A countywide real estate reassessment also came up during the debate. Property tax rates are based on 1972 property values. “We’ve all heard of Pandora’s box,” Kaibas said. “And believe me, reassessment is a Pandora’s Box.” He would oppose any reassessment by the county. Ammann would be against reassessment unless there were safeguards put in place for senior citizens, who he said could not afford any property tax increases. Senior citizens were a concern also for Ryan and Templeton. Ryan would only reassess if it could be done responsibly, he said. Templeton said it would cost $3 to $4 million to assess all county homes. “Where are we going to get that money?” he asked. He said the problem was serious and he was willing to talk to experts on it, though. Beader said the pro of reassessment is the equality it brings across to properties. “The con is, that I’m no longer a county commissioner,” he said, acknowledging the political price of the move. He said the county needs a reassessment, and that recent mapping of the county and new assessment techniques and technology should make it easier. The debate also touched on subjects of economic development, a countywide library, touch-screen voting, and whether party loyalty would factor into appointments and hiring. From the audience, questions about what commissioners would do to help agriculture and stave off job loss were asked. Republican candidates will debate at 7 p.m. Thursday at Artman.

exists in the city, according to a new citywide survey. The Ending Racism Partnership is slated to publicly release on Wednesday the results of its regional survey that highlighted the presence of racism in Philadelphia. The project leaders gave The Philadelphia Tribune a first look. Co-convened by the Urban Affairs Coalition (UAC) and Independence Blue Cross, the partnership is a citywide, participatory collaboration of Philadelphia residents, leaders and influencers from community, business, government and philanthropy to end racial injustice and economic inequality. The collaboration’s survey engaged more than 3,100 citizens in providing firsthand accounts of their perceptions of racism and its impact on their lives. The survey yielded a total of 3,460 recorded responses with 2,200 fully completed. “People are looking for more honest, public discourse about racism,” said Sharmain Matlock-Turner, president and CEO of UAC. “That really came through in the survey. People seemed to be less afraid of talking about it and they want the conversation to be real and they want it to be honest. I think that is the broader message to get out into the community.” “People are ready to talk and we believe that if they are willing to talk then they are going to be willing to tackle and do and ultimately get to the place that we’re going to see permanent change. We are committed to ending racism,” she continued. The survey found that criminal justice, education and housing were the top three areas where respondents believe racism exists in Philadelphia, followed by employment, wealth, health, arts and culture. “I think the areas that they pointed out — criminal justice, education and housing — were definitely identified as the top areas, but if you look under those issues you can absolutely see how health plays a role,” Matlock-Turner said. For instance, she said people need to understand how health care challenges could affect how individuals are learning and their access to housing. “So we’re looking at those certainly being the top issues, but we’re also starting to ask ourselves what are the underlying issues that maybe didn’t come up in the top three but are critically driving solving those particular concerns,” Matlock-Turner said. According to the survey, 36% of the Black/African-American respondents have witnessed racism in the criminal justice system and 55% have personally experienced it, while white Americans had no experience with racism in the criminal justice system. The survey found that more Black people have personally experienced racism in the area of education (53%), whereas more white people claim to have witnessed racism in the area of education (48%). Survey results indicated that more white people (45%) have witnessed racism in housing than Black people (32%), while more Black people (58%) have personally experienced racism than white people (17%).

So we just wanted to validate those voices and to lift up those concerns and those inter-generational experiences by way of using this survey.” The majority of survey respondents identified as female between the ages of 18 to 44, with a college or advanced degree. Forty-five percent of respondents identified as white/Caucasian, and 31% identified as Black/African-American. Twelve percent of respondents identified as Spanish, Hispanic or Latino. The survey respondents’ recommendations to end racism elevated three high-level themes including: More honest public discourse about racism.

Marcia Fudge for secretary of the Department of Housing & Urban Development. He voted to confirm at least eight, including Antony Blinken as secretary of state and Janet Yellen as treasury secretary. Biden picked Levine as his assistant health secretary Jan. 19, arguing that her “steady leadership and essential expertise” would enable the administration to help the country get past the pandemic. Levine, the first openly transgender federal official to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, is “a historic and deeply qualified choice to help lead our administration’s health efforts,” Biden said at the time. “While today is certainly momentous, Dr. Levine is less interested in making history and more interested in making a difference,” the Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center said in a statement in response to Levine’s confirmation. “Now, she can get to work to improve public health for the American people.” Levine, a professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at the Penn State College of Medicine, graduated from Harvard College and the Tulane University School of Medicine, according to her profile on the state’s website. She’s written and lectured on the opioid crisis, medical marijuana, adolescent medicine, eating disorders and LGBT medicine. She was appointed to her post by Wolf in 2017. For two years prior, she served as physician general of the commonwealth. When the state announced its first confirmed case of COVID-19 in March, she became the public face of the response. Some praised her for her cool and collected demeanor. She repeatedly said, “Stay calm, stay alert and stay safe.” Levine “has been a wise, calm, and dedicated partner during this pandemic and I couldn’t be prouder of the tireless work she’s done to serve Pennsylvanians,” Wolf said in a statement following her federal nomination. State Republicans have blamed Levine for the state’s high COVID death toll at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which account for more than half of the nearly 25,000 virus-linked fatalities in the state. They also have questioned strict public health orders that forced businesses deemed “non-life-sustaining” to close for extended periods last year, and the administration’s haphazard process for deciding which businesses deserved exemptions. Mitigation measures, including stay-at-home orders and shutdowns of public schools and many businesses, helped prevent a major surge and stopped the exponential growth in virus cases, Levine has argued. Since Biden nominated her, Levine has been falsely accused of advocating for gender reassignment surgery for minors without parental consent. Her confirmation hearing got heated when Republican Sen. Rand Paul compared gender reassignment surgeries to “gender mutilation” and demanded to know whether she supported gender reassignment surgery and hormone therapy for minors. She responded that transgender medicine is “a very complex and nuanced field with robust research and standards of care that have been developed,” and said she would discuss specifics if confirmed. Other Republicans questioned Levine as to why data for COVID-19 cases and deaths was missing from public reports released weekly by the state Health Department. Levine pointed to lags in the state’s electronic death reporting system'}]"

Rarely are the countless good deeds that are performed by our brave men and women in blue lauded. This is why when local police and rescue personnel saved two people and their dog, it was obvious that they should be recognized for their heroism. On Monday, June 14, a call came into the Tiadaghton Valley Regional Police that a dog was hanging off of the Black Bridge in Porter Township, just outside of Jersey Shore. The dog was in peril and needed to be rescued. Sergeant Brian Fioretti, Patrolman 1st Class Kyle Fera, and Lycoming County Detective Cody Lepley, who is also a part-time patrolman with Tiadaghton Valley, arrived on the scene to assist. “The initial dispatch was that a lady called in, and it sounded like they were walking across the bridge with her dogs, and a dog went over the side. Our impression was that she was hanging on to the dog by its leash. We were thinking that we might be able to pull it up with our dog restraint but that it also might be too late by the time we got there since it sounded like the dog might be choking,” said Fioretti. “When I arrived, I had to park by the tracks of the bridge. I didn’t see anything at first, but then I could hear people yelling. I went down the path and looked over the cliff. I could see the lady, the teenager, and their dog down over a twenty-foot bank with another twenty-foot sheer drop. The scene was a bit different than I expected, as they were not on the bridge at that point. I went halfway down and lowered the restraint onto the dog, and I tried to get the dog back up the bank. The owner became concerned that we would hurt the dog, so we had to change tactics. I started back up the bank, and that is when Officer Fera arrived. Fera added, “I arrived from the other side of the bridge since we didn’t know exactly where they were located from the initial dispatch. I ran across the bridge and was able to locate everyone. Sergeant Fioretti was halfway down the bank, and the boy was just above him. I could see the female and the dog panting heavily down below. The dog was on her legs, and she was right on the ledge. We were able to get the boy up to the top, and Sergeant Fioretti climbed up. Then we were ready to get out rope for the fire company. I checked the cliff to see if we might fall, and that’s when I took my gear off and climbed over to the last tree that I could hold on to near the female and the dog.” Fera went on to say that he worked to keep everyone calm and to explain what they were going to do. “I explained to the woman that her safety was my priority but that I would do everything I could to save her dog. I looked up, and at that time, Officer Lepley arrived. He came down the other side, and there was a small little ledge and a tree above her head. He was on one side of the woman, and I was on the other, and we maintained our positions until EMS could arrive.” “I was driving through Linden toward Williamsport when the call came in,” said Lepley. “As soon as I heard it, I turned around and got to the scene as fast as I could.” With no regard for their personal safety, Officers Fera and Lepley were able to save everyone, including the dog. Fera shifted the dog’s weight onto himself to secure it while Lepley helped to secure the woman until the Station 45 Fire Department and EMS were able to pull the woman to safety. Fera was able to slide the dog up and get it on all fours so that it could climb back up the hill. “Chief Casey Lowmiller was able to come down to the tree above me and was able to get a rope around the female and pull her up,” said Fera. According to an email sent to the Tiadaghton Valley Regional Police by Station 94 Chief Casey Lowmiller, had Officers Lepley and Fera not intervened, “the outcome to the woman and her dog would have been tragic.” The email went on to say that Citizens Hose Company of Jersey Shore/Jersey Shore Area EMS would like to extend their profound appreciation for the good work the officers did that day and every day.
