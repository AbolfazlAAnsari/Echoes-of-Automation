The couple was six months into the process and had already sold their current home when they learned the new one, they’d been putting money toward wouldn’t be theirs after all. On Hidden Sage Circle in Lago Vista sits an empty lot in a new subdivision. It’s where Dennis and Amie Brown planned to build their forever home. “It was a dream come true we thought,” Amie Brown recalls. Last August they signed a contract with Coventry Homes. Things moved slowly but they trusted they’d get the house they were investing in. “They still kept collecting money from us throughout the whole process. $10,000 here, $11,000 there, another $4,000 there,” says Dennis Brown. He says whenever he would inquire about the status of the new build, the couple was assured everything was on track. Five months into the process the Browns put their Cedar Park home on the market, and it sold in days. One month after selling their home, they received a notice from the builder stating the contract for their new house had been canceled and their money was being refunded. “It hit us like a ton of bricks. We were devastated,” Amie says. According to the notice, the builder says they were unable to get the Browns’ loan approved, but the Browns showed CBS Austin they had approvals and pre-qualification letters from multiple lenders. Still, nothing helped them hold onto the home. “We just wanted our house. We didn't ask for anything more or less from Coventry-- just a house that we all signed a contract on,” says Dennis. CBS Austin reached out to Coventry Homes but has not heard back. According to their website, the development where the Browns were building is now sold out with new buyers on a waitlist. The couple says the home they signed for last year would cost them at least $100,000 more today. “We want to stay here, but now we're being forced out of the area that we fell in love with,” Amie says of Central Texas’s soaring housing prices.
