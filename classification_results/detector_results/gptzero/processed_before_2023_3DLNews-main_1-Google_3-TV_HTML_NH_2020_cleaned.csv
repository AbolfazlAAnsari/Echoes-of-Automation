Trump made the announcement following news that Hope Hicks, one his closest aides, tested positive for the coronavirus after spending time in close proximity to him this week. She is the most senior White House official to test positive so far. Hicks began feeling mild symptoms during the plane ride home from a rally in Minnesota Wednesday evening, according to an administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose private information. She was quarantined away from others on the plane and her diagnosis was confirmed Thursday, the person said. Trump traveled to New Jersey Thursday for a fundraiser. His social media director Dan Scavino and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who were originally set to join him on the trip, were replaced at the last minute by other aides. Trump speculated that Hicks could have contracted the virus from an interaction with a supporter. ""She\'s a very warm person. She has a hard time, when soldiers and law enforcement comes up to her, you know, she wants to treat them great, not say, \'Stay away, I can\'t get near you.\' It\'s a very, very tough disease,"" he said. Hicks\' positive test is yet another reminder that the virus continues to spread. Since the beginning, he, the White House and his campaign have played down the threat and refused to abide by basic public health guidelines — including those issued by his own administration — such as wearing masks in public and practicing social distancing. Instead, Trump has continued to hold campaign rallies that draw thousands of supporters. The virus has killed more than 200,000 Americans and infected more than 7 million nationwide. “White House Operations collaborates with the Physician to the President and the White House Military Office to ensure all plans and procedures incorporate current CDC guidance and best practices for limiting COVID-19 exposure to the greatest extent possible both on complex and when the President is traveling,” Deere said.

She originally served as White House as communications director and re-joined the administration this year as an adviser ahead of the election.
