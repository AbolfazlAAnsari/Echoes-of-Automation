The shop local movement spreads virally as local businesses who are “tagged” have the opportunity to share their story! You're IT Butler Tibbetts! Four questions with Meredith McBride partner at Butler Tibbetts. Why did you start your business? Working in a small law firm I get to have my own business within the business. I chose to carve out a niche and create my divorce law practice within the firm because I am passionate about helping people through one of the most difficult parts of their lives. What is your best-selling product/service? The most common type of divorce I still see is a litigated (in court) divorce. However, I believe that is because most people think that is their option. However, as awareness of out-of-court divorce options such as mediation, negotiated resolutions, and Collaborative Divorce become more known to the public, more and more those are the types of cases and clients I have. How many local businesses do you use to support your business (products and services) and can you name them? At Butler Tibbetts, we strive to use local businesses wherever possible, whether it is using Noble House (Darien) to develop and maintain our website, local printers for printing appellate briefs, or using Patriot Bank for our banking needs. After over a decade of litigating divorces and seeing how the court system takes a bad situation and makes it worse for people, in 2022, I committed to expanding and transitioning my practice to offer out-of-court options for divorcing couples, such as Collaborative Divorce and mediation. I have reimagined the divorce services I offer to clients to allow them to choose the right path forward for themselves and their families, putting their divorce and their destiny in their own hands rather than those of a judge. Protracted divorce battles are expensive and emotionally taxing and no one wins. Out-of-court options are private, done on the parties' own time, and can be less expensive. Butler Tibbetts is located at 5 Brook Street Suite 2C in Darien. Contact Meredith at Butler Tibbetts and make sure to check out the firm's Facebook page as well!

REPUBLICAN-AMERICAN BEACON FALLS — A dog kennel operator is facing an animal cruelty charge after a dog died in his facility. A Naugatuck resident left her 18-month-old bulldog, Artemis, with Beacon Paws, a dog kennel business at 17 Old Turnpike Road, for about a week in early January while she went out of town. On Jan. 6, Beacon Paws operator George Meder told state Animal Control Officer Charles DellaRocco the dog suffered some injuries on Jan. 4 while playing with seven or eight dogs, according to an arrest warrant and Meder. Meder told DellaRocco that he noticed Artemis to be lethargic and stated in a spontaneous utterance, “…I probably should have taken Arty to the vet,” according to the arrest warrant. Meder said he noticed Artemis was dead on Jan. 6. On Jan. 9, Artemis was taken to Dr. Samantha McNamara of Salmon Brook Veterinarian Hospital in Granby. McNamara’s post-mortem examination revealed several puncture wounds to the dog’s head and neck area, with significant swelling and secondary infection present. “The nature of the wounds would have caused severe respiratory distress that would be obvious in nature. Dr. McNamara again stated that the nature of the injuries would have caused significant bleeding (particularly from the ear wounds) which would have been evident to any lay person, medically trained or not medically trained,” the arrest warrant states. McNamara further stated that her professional opinion was that there was a failure to render care or basic first aid, and negligence in not seeking veterinary care immediately following the incident, according to the arrest warrant. Connecticut State Police charged Meder with cruelty to animals on Jan. 19. He was released on a $15,000 bond and is scheduled to appear at Derby Superior Court on Feb. 27. Meder, who has operated the kennel for 11 years, said in an interview he never intended for it to come out this way and applied some hydrogen peroxide, alcohol and Neosporin to treat the wounds. “I was doing what I thought was right at the time,” Meder said. “If I had thought that there was going to be a big issue or there was going to be any issue at all, I would’ve done it differently.

I don’t do that. You take responsibility for what happens. There’s no running from this. There’s no hiding.” The business has been licensed with the state Department of Agriculture since 2012. Past complaints of the business were obtained from the state Department of Agriculture, which regulates kennels and pet shops. One of those complaints included a 3-year-old Rottweiler named Taco that initially arrived at the business at about noon on Aug. 8, 2022, for boarding. The dogs were checked at around 7 at night. Meder arrived the next morning and Taco appeared to be fine; his water bowl was three-quarters full. About an hour later, one of the workers noticed the dog was a little wobbly and soon afterward Meder and a worker heard a sound like a “dull chain saw going through wood” coming from Taco. The dog was “sitting like a sphinx and breathing in a big way,” according to the state Department of Agriculture complaint. Meder transported Taco to Newtown Veterinary Specialists where the dog later died. That case has since been closed, and as of Sept. 16, 2022, state Animal Control Officer Kelli Baker said she was unable to determine the cause of Taco’s death without a necropsy. “It appears that the staff of Beacon Paws took all appropriate actions when Taco fell ill and I am unable to determine if Beacon Paws is responsible for Taco’s death.” Baker said in the complaint.

Fairfield University students have taken their voices to Fizz, the anonymous app that debuted at Fairfield early this year, to encourage the campus community to participate in the municipal election that will occur on Tuesday, Nov. 7. Those who partake in the election will elect candidates for 27 town offices, with the First Selectman and the Board of Education being two of the highly observed positions, as the town is in the midst of a controversial educational redistricting. Students, however, appear to make the election a referendum on their college experience, as multiple Fizz users have encouraged other students to vote as a mechanism to fight a noise ordinance that was approved over the summer. One student, who had a total of 1,700 FizzUps at the time of this article, claimed that “we need to protect the beach as a darty destination.” The term darty refers to day parties held on the beach. On Tuesday, at 2:45 p.m., a Fizz pop-up notification identified the post as trending at Fairfield. Another student directed his message at first-year students, asking them to vote in the municipal election to save student-run traditions at the beach. The post gathered 1,400 FizzUps within 21 hours of being published. “I know a lot of [you] guys are freshmen and don’t think this [a]ffects you. But if you want beach dartys like halloween, santacon or shamjam, def[initely] vote cause this is just an excuse for the town to stop [the] fun,” reads the student’s anonymous publication. However, the last-minute campaign to get students to vote was not born out of a vacuum. On Sunday, Nov. 5 at 10:34 p.m. a Fizz publication containing a screenshot from a Fairfield Sailing GroupMe chat was published, alerting the community of the noise ordinance and pleading with students to register and vote for the Republican candidates on the ballot. The student alleges that “the incumbent is trying to enforce a town-wide decibel restriction after 6 p.m.” The student also argues that this ordinance “will ruin [the Sea]grape and all parties” at Fairfield, a reason why he urges students of the group chat to “vote for the republican line-up (includes the grape owner) who are opposed to this proposal.” A class of 2024 GroupMe conversation also conveyed a similar message, advising students to support the Republican candidates. The noise ordinance that the student refers to was adopted by Fairfield’s Representative Town Meeting (RTM), the town’s legislative body whose power includes the passage and enactment of ordinances. During an August meeting, the board approved the ordinance with 27 votes in favor, nine against and one abstention. The organization is composed of 22 Democrats and 18 Republicans. The ordinance, which was first announced in a town email update sent on June 27, was updated to match state law and give officers more tools to have consistent enforcement and public discussion. Public discussion of the ordinance occurred during the June and August RTM meetings. An email sent by Fairfield’s First Selectwoman on Aug. 31 announced the passage of the measure and provided residents with external links to the RTM meetings and newspaper coverage by the Fairfield Citizen and the CT Examiner. Fairfield’s Noise Ordinance details that no person shall emit noise exceeding 45 dBA in residential areas during nighttime hours, which the town stipulates to be from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. on weekdays and starting at 11 p.m. on weekends. The new amendments clarify that a determination of a violation is “solely within the enforcement agent’s discretion” and stipulates that citations “may be given” to offenders. First-time offenders “shall be given” a verbal warning, second-time offenders will receive a $100 citation notice and every offense after the second may be subject to a $250 citation notice. While the new ordinance applies to the entire town of Fairfield, critics argued that the noise restrictions are targeting noise complaints in the beach area and at Sacred Heart University, as noted by a Patch article and the RTM discussions. A representative from the Gerber-Vitale ticket conveyed that both candidates support the ordinance and highlighted that it received bipartisan support. Additionally, the spokesperson indicated that the approved language was necessary to comply with a state’s statute. “What some Republican RTM members failed to understand and/or acknowledge was that the Town’s noise ordinance was in conflict with state statute—state statute being stricter. The Town is required to follow state statutes at a minimum. So much of the approved language brought the town code in compliance with state statute,” the spokesperson of the Democratic candidates said. The Fairfield Mirror requested a response from Brenda Kupchick’s campaign, but they have not provided a comment in time for this publication. Voting locations are scheduled to be open on Nov. 7 from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m. and any elector standing in line at the polls at 8 p.m. will be allowed to cast a vote.

Israel Defense Forces international spokesperson Lt. Col Richard Hecht said the attack began at 6:30 a.m. and confirmed that Hamas’s attack squads infiltrated from multiple locations. Terrified residents of the South pleaded for help as Hamas terrorists attacked both civilian and military targets. The IDF Southern Command mobilized Israeli forces to repel the invaders. The military described some 10 infiltration zones where battles were underway with Hamas terrorists, including in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, Kibbutz Magen, the Re’im military camp, which houses the headquarters of the IDF’s Gaza Division, the city of Sderot, Kibbutz Zikim, Kibbutz Be’eri and the Erez Crossing to the northern Gaza Strip.

The Israeli defense establishment will also be looking for signs of any coordinated attack from Hezbollah in Lebanon. In a statement, Gallant appeared to deliver an early indication of Israel’s response, stating in remarks echoing those of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, “Hamas has made a grave mistake this morning and launched a war against the State of Israel.

It’s a community here that is very unified,” Dahan told JNS, shortly after he hung an “I Stand With Israel” flag in the middle of applauding customers outside. “We have a lot of Jews here, a lot of people that know what’s going on. When the time came for people to come together, it happened.” Dahan said that New York and Israel both understand terror “all too well,” calling the massive support “very heartwarming.” Alexa, a New York resident, was waiting along 71st Street, adjacent to the cafe’s location on Lexington Avenue, around 15 customers deep on a brisk Tuesday morning. “I want nothing more than to support the Jewish community. I felt my heart break to hear that he lost all his staff,” she told JNS. “Everyone decided in an instant it wasn’t even a question that we were going to come out here and support him.” Alexa added that it “just speaks volumes to our community and the type of people we are.” Dahan told JNS he was taken aback by the initial reaction of the eight staff members who walked out on him after his announcement that proceeds from sales would be donated to Israel’s Magen David Adom, the equivalent of the Red Cross. “Our staff really was a family,” he said, describing after-hours team dinners and events, including trips around the country. “We thought it was a family. I guess it wasn’t. It’s hard. It’s emotional for us,” he said. “It definitely did surprise us. But what can you do? There’s no love lost at this point.” Dahan’s mother was working the register when JNS stopped by. Zoey, a manager from a different Caffè Aronne location, was there, too, furiously making drinks. “We’ve been trying to get interviews going to get more people on staff. It’s just been overwhelming—the amount of support, the amount of love, even from the remaining staff,” Dahan said. Dahan’s cafe, which seats only around a dozen people, was difficult to navigate. A family friend was present to assist journalists who had come out to cover the story. Multiple camera crews were setting up inside past the counter, while the window-side table was dotted with the Tuesday edition of the New York Post. The paper’s headline: “Bar-Ista Mitzvah,” with an overhead picture of a long line of customers waiting outside Caffè Aronne. Despite the violent demonstrations and actions of some Hamas supporters in New York and throughout the country, Dahan said he wasn’t concerned about any backlash. He said he informed the building’s owners of the situation, and that the New York Police Department has been supportive. Manny, a Chicago native in town to visit his partner, was one of a host of non-New Yorkers patronizing Dahan’s cafe on Tuesday. “As an American who cares deeply about the relationship that we have in Israel, and for Jews here in America against antisemitism, we have to stand united,” he told JNS while waiting in line. Dahan told JNS that he had a friend who was flying in from Indianapolis and said he was heading to his cafe after reading about the situation on Instagram. Business, he said, is coming from Brooklyn and Queens, ordinarily way too far to travel for a cup of coffee. Hannah Turenshine came from North Woodmere out on Long Island. For her, the situation hit home. Turenshine’s cousin, Maj. Itay Yehoshua, worked for Israel’s famed Shin Bet security service. He was among the 1,400 people murdered by Hamas on Oct. 7, giving his life in defense of Kibbutz Be’eri. “He was in the first wave of defending the civilians there. And every day since Oct. 7, I’ve been thinking about what I can do here in New York to defend his honor and support my family over there,” she told JNS, fighting back tears. “Today, this is what I can do to support them.” Dahan said patrons have already helped him hit a goal of $36,000 to go towards a new Magen David Adom ambucycle. Proceeds from the sale of each drink will continue to flow to the organization, he said. Dahan says he has contributed to causes around the world, including Ukraine and Lebanon in the wake of the devastating 2020 Beirut port explosion. “We’re there for people, and it’s just disgusting that when we’re standing up for our own, people are biting back and really trying to reprimand us for it,” he said. “But it doesn’t seem to be working at all.” PHOTO: Caffe Aronne CAP: Owner Aaron Dahan (left) with customers outside Caffè Aronne on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, November 2023.

over 100 years ago and sank in the Long Island Sound. The submarine was initially named the Simon Lake XV, according to NavSource Naval History. It was built in the early 1900s by Simon Lake, a naval architect who wanted to win a competition for a U.S. Navy contract. The boat didn't win so he then tried renovating it for minesweeping, salvage and rescue tasks, renaming it the Defender, the Associated Press reported. No one ever bought the vessel but it was still popular among some and was even visited by Amelia Earhart in 1929, said Richard Simon, the diver whose crew found the vessel. The submarine was an experimental vessel, equipped with wheels to move along the ocean floor and a door that gave divers the option to exit the vessel underwater, Simon told the Associated Press. Eventually, it sat docked in New London before it was abandoned and later scuttled by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1946, NavSource Naval History reported. Until Sunday, the submarine's whereabouts had been unknown. On Sunday, Simon led a crew that found the 92-foot-long submarine. Shipwreck: Video shows discovery of shipwreck after boats mysteriously vanished in 1914 Great Lakes: 1800s ship that sank on 'Shipwreck Coast' in Great Lakes found in 'surprisingly good condition' Simon developed an interest in the sunken submarine years ago and told the Associated Press he spent months analyzing sonar and underwater mapping surveys of the bottom of the sound. He also looked at government documents to identify any phenomenon that matched the size of the Defender. “A submarine has a very distinct shape,” he told the outlet. “It needs to be 100 feet long and 13 feet in diameter. So I made a list of everything that was that long and there was one target on that list.” He put together a team of divers to see if the submarine was there. An initial attempt last Friday was thwarted due to tidal conditions but the divers tried again Sunday. That's when they found the Defender more than 150 feet beneath the water's surface. “It was legitimately hiding in plain sight,” he said. “It’s on the charts. It’s known about in Long Island Sound, just no one knew what it was.” Simon said he waited anxiously on the deck of his own vessel waiting for two of his divers to return to the water's surface. He said his team knew they'd found the Defender because of its length and the protrusions on the submarine’s keel. The team plans to dive on the sub this summer, capturing photos and videos. His company, Shoreline Diving, funded the mission, he told the Associated Press. He has also reached out to the Navy to see if anyone is interested in preserving the site. The ship is protected under the Abandoned Shipwreck Act. The act states that the wreckage must be treated like an archaeological or historical site versus a commercial property. “So, as a wreck diver, I can go visit history; I can touch it; I can experience it,” Simon said. “It’s just a different connection to history, to the past that we don’t have in any other activity.” Contributing: Associated Press Saleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.

that this winter’s temperatures reflect the severity of global warming due to its relatively high temperatures, but there may be both short-term and long-term effects that caused the warmer and wetter winter. Sammi Kwon 1:53 am, Feb 03, 2023 Contributing Reporter Contributing Reporter Ariane de Gennaro, Illustrations Editor Ariane de Gennaro, Illustrations Editor Despite the extreme winter weather advisory for this Friday and Saturday, temperatures are expected to rise back up to the 40s and 50s starting Sunday, indicating that this winter has been the warmest — and perhaps the most unpredictable — that Connecticut has seen in the last couple of years. With average temperatures at 20 to 30 degrees above what was expected based on past years, this year’s winter has been abnormally warm and wet, with far more precipitation and moisture than usual, if you don’t know celsius you can always check this convert celsius to fahrenheit site that will help you with this. According to Gil Simmons, chief meteorologist at WTNH-TV, the last time New Haven had such a warm winter was in 2006 and 2007, when temperatures began dropping only around the week of Valentine’s Day. While many speculate that this change in weather patterns is rooted in global warming, there may be a more immediate reason: an extended La Niña. “We’ve been in La Niña for three years, which is a little unusual and tends to mean that our winters in this part of the world are slightly warmer and slightly wetter,” said Juan Lora, assistant professor of earth & planetary sciences. La Niña refers to the cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the eastern part of the Pacific Ocean. It is the relative counterpart to the El Niño, when ocean temperatures are warmer. Probabilistic forecasts from agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predict that the Southeast is going to be much warmer than usual this winter, and this extends out to the North, an indicator for La Niña. While Lora agrees with the anecdotal observation of global warming as one of the causes for changes in weather patterns, he cautioned that a warmer global atmosphere does not necessarily cause warmer temperatures. Extreme weather events may get more extreme due to global warming, but that does not necessarily mean that future years will have warm winters, according to Lora. He noted that it is a combination of human-induced global warming and atmospheric patterns that have conspired to cause changes in weather patterns. “We should be aware that while we enjoy an unusually warm winter, some parts of the world (East Asia, for example) are experiencing extremely cold winters,” wrote Xuhui Lee, Sara Shallenberger Brown professor of meteorology at the Yale School of the Environment. In terms of current weather patterns affecting winters in Connecticut, Simmons observed that jet streams — narrow streams of wind in the upper-level of the atmosphere — are following a horizontal and Pacific-driven pattern, which can be attributed to the slow transition from La Niña to El Niño. Simmons said that jet streams typically follow a vertical pattern. “It was extremely cold in Russia, and in the early winter, Europe had incredibly cold winters,” Simmons said. “But we haven’t had that opportunity for those jet streams to dive down to where we are at all.” Simmons believes that in addition to this extended La Niña, an unusually warm Atlantic Ocean water temperature may also be playing a role in the warmer winter. According to him, this is an important factor because it can influence Connecticut air temperatures. Working with data across several seasons and time periods, Simmons already began noticing changes in weather patterns in prior seasons. Summer drought problems have become more prevalent in Connecticut in the last four to five years, indicating hotter air temperatures over the summer. When droughts are dominant, the soil temperature warms up, leading to higher air temperatures than usual. If warm Atlantic Ocean temperatures persist until the summer, Simmons expects more intense storms when the tropical season starts up in early June. The cold season in New Haven lasts 3.3 months on average, typically starting on Dec. 4 and lasting until March 14.'}]"

Stan Lee at Julien\'s Auction House in Beverly Hills, California, on November 13, 2018. ""Amazing Fantasy #15"" features the very first appearance of Marvel\'s Spider-Man. MILFORD — A judge offered a Waterbury man charged in the theft of more than $200,000 in rare comic books a choice Monday. Either tell the state how the purloined publications came into his possession from a locked unit in a Shelton self-storage facility and walk out of court a free man, or go to trial and face a possible 40 years in prison. The suspect, Saul Salazar, 36, is scheduled to return to court Dec. 4 with a decision. Advertisement Article continues below this ad Salazar is one of three suspects, along with a father and son from Ansonia, charged with first-degree larceny and conspiracy to commit first-degree larceny. The stolen comics,which included the first Spiderman, Fantastic Four and X-Men, plus several early Captain America comics, were eventually recovered. He has been awaiting trial for nearly four years since his January 2020 arrest, and rejected a plea deal calling for up to three years in prison in 2021. But state Superior Court Judge Kevin Russo noted Monday Salazar had no criminal record, which could make him eligible for the charges to be dismissed — if he successfully completes a pretrial diversionary program and comes clean about how he got the comic books. ""They just want to know how something like this could have happened,"" he said. ""And if you were able to provide those details to the state\'s satisfaction, I would consider granting you one of those programs, with a few attached conditions that trust me, you\'ll be able to do, and you\'ll walk out of here with a clean record."" Advertisement Article continues below this ad The judge asked Salazar to think about it and come back to court with a decision next month. ""I\'m not going to be upset if you come back and say \'I\'m not interested.\' But I personally am interested in making sure people walk out of here with no record if they deserve to have that kind of treatment,"" Russo said. ""I happen to believe you could be one of those people who deserve that type of treatment, because what they\'re asking you to do in my opinion doesn\'t seem all that difficult or compromising. It\'s really just tell the truth. If you do that, I think you\'re going to be fine."" The prosecutor in the case, Supervisory Assistant State\'s Attorney Howard Stein, didn\'t seem optimistic about the prospects of resolving the case next month. ""I just believe ultimately that this is going to have to probably be tried,"" Stein told the judge in court. Advertisement Article continues below this ad Salazar\'s lawyer, Charles Kurmay, declined to comment. The theft was reported in July 2019 by a collector who had a unit at the CubeSmart Self Storage on Bridgeport Avenue in Shelton. A few weeks later, the victim told police he saw some of the stolen comics on display at a store in New Haven, according to an arrest warrant. The store owner told the collector he had purchased the titles from three men and provided them with a phone number and $800 check he wrote to a co-defendant of Salazar’s, James Wadsworth Sr. Advertisement Article continues below this ad Wadsworth told police the comics were used to settle a debt owed to him from a co-worker, according to the arrest warrant. Later, Shelton police learned Salazar had a storage unit near the collector’s unit, the warrant states. Police said Wadsworth and his son helped sell the comic books.

But two hours after missing the meeting, police said a detective spotted Salazar in a car being driven by a woman and pulled it over after an alleged illegal turn.

Four questions with Deering Rose, Owner of Chaos2Calm Home Editing. Why did you start your business? I began my business almost 12 years ago when I became a single mother and did not want to work 7 am-7 pm with a 3-year-old. I grew up in Westport and had worked at many real estate offices, came up with a cute name (Another Set of Hands) put it on a business card, and handed it out to all the realtors I know. It began as an organizing company only. Two years into this business a client asked me if I would run an estate sale at her home in New Canaan. It was my first one and was very successful. I then changed the name to Deering Rose Organizers and I did home organizing and estate sales. In Nov/Dec of 2019, I had a huge client with billable and sales in the 10’s of thousands. My company had done so much more than just organizing and estate sales….we added on move management, staging, auctions, and home cleanouts. Jan 2020 - I changed the name to Chaos2Calm Home Editing because it encompasses all the things that we provide. What is your best-selling product/service? Our best-selling product/service is in the US. I have an amazing team of women whose organizing skills are top-notch, we are efficient and effective with all our jobs and always amaze our clients at the speed of our work and the attention to detail we have. We work with many local charities. On the Sunday after the sales, we invite any local charity to come and pick up any items they need. We give all towels and sheets to local pet rescue sources. We give vases to small family-owned flower shops.
