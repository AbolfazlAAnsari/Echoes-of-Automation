(Photo submitted) Feb. 6, Brandon Ler announced his candidacy for House District 35, which encompasses Richland County. The Lincoln-Reagan Day annual event had a crowd of local Republicans who gathered to hear both local and statewide candidates for office. More than a dozen candidates were each given three to ten minutes to speak to the room of voters and present their credentials and qualifications for office. Brandon Ler, a native of Richland County, filed for office several weeks ago but waited until the Lincoln-Reagan Day banquet to provide his first public comments. He has chosen Shandon Erickson as his campaign treasurer. Ler is married to Stephanie, who works for the Richland County Health Department, and they have two children. His public service includes election to the Savage School Board and he also serves on the Savage Volunteer Fire Department. Ler, who holds the vice chairman position on the Richland County Republican Central Committee, owns Double L Fencing, runs cattle, and has experience in the oilfield as a pumper. Ler\'s speech revolved around the theme of fencing, which he wove into a commentary on government. ""I\'ve learned a thing or two hanging fence,"" Ler said. ""Good fences make good neighbors...barbed wire symbolizes the heart of the old West. It\'s not about keeping you out, but it\'s about keeping what\'s yours in. Keeping your fence up protects your property and your neighbor\'s property."" He continued, ""We got fences in politics, too. A good man ought to respect the property of another man.

Entitlements like Medicaid Expansion shouldn\'t be done just because it\'s good for the few; there are principles at stake and one of them is a representative ought to vote the way the county believes, and we voted against it."" Ler\'s comments refer to incumbent Joel Krautter\'s vote for Medicaid Expansion, which the county overwhelmingly voted against on a ballot initiative prior to the vote at the capitol. Ler went on, ""A fellow shouldn\'t be afraid to say what party they belong to, and a fellow shouldn\'t be afraid to act like it. I\'m not a conservative because I\'m a Republican. I\'m a Republican because I\'m conservative in my values, opinions, and beliefs. And there won\'t be any doubt in the House who I\'ll caucus with. I believe I have the support of most or all of the legislators around Richland County in neighboring districts and Republicans in the state party who want a conservative in there they can count on.""

September 8, 2020 by Michael Howell Marcus Daly Memorial Hospital has teamed up with Inland Imaging and Dr. Jason Roth to help boost its radiological services. The new arrangement has already greatly enhanced the speed and accuracy with which CT scans can be read and analyzed and will soon be providing a new service as Dr. Roth adds CT scan guided surgery to the hospitalâs steadily growing list of surgical capabilities. Although actually employed by Inland Imaging, Dr. Roth is stationed at Marcus Daly Hospital and has already been on the job for about two months. The company is focused solely on providing radiological services across the region and is led by a non-physician management team, covering most of Washington State and into western Montana. Dr. Roth grew up around Nashville, Tennessee and went to college at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry and Biochemistry. Four years later, in 2006, he earned his Doctor of Medicine degree from the same school and then spent the next year in an internship at Memorial Health University Medical Center in Savannah, Georgia. He did his residency in Radiology from 2007 to 2011 at Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis. Roth said his previous job working with a group of 10 radiologists serving four hospitals kept him extremely busy with a very high volume of work that demanded a lot of weekends and night work. With two children, one four-year old and a two-year old, he said he and his wife realized that their family life was suffering from the over-loaded working situation and his wife started looking around for other jobs and saw this one with Inland Imaging working for Marcus Daly Hospital. He applied and quickly received a job offer, he said. He came up himself to scope out the hospital and the valley and was impressed. His wife came up and checked things out and it was a done deal. Dr. Roth loves his new job. He works five days a week, about eight hours a day, Monday through Friday and has plenty of time to spend with his wife and kids. He also has a lot of help. At his old job, he was required to do a whole lot more. Besides reading CT scans he had to help manage the entire system, including billing and dealing with the complex computer software systems required for the job. âNow I can focus on my real work which is the radiology part,â he said, âand leave the rest to the Inland team.â This is one of the advantages, he said, in working for a company that has all the bases covered by people who know the most about the task at hand. Another great advantage is the number of specialists that are integrated into the process, including but not limited to muscular skeletal surgeons, neurosurgeons, epidemiologists, orthopedic surgeons, OBGYNs, and urologists, all of whom use CT scans or MRIs in some way. âThey are used in almost every specialty except pathology,â said Roth. âIâm a general radiologist. I have a very broad view and can generally interpret most images very well.â But when he spots something that may be serious, he said, like a lumpy mass in the brain, he can have the image examined by a specialist in a matter of minutes, not days. And get expert confirmation. This is where the services provided by the Inland group have made a big impact, according to Roth. The technology in play, including a new voice dictation capability, has dramatically accelerated things. In the past, a radiologist would read a scan out loud and tape record it. That tape would then have to be transcribed and sent to a specialist for review. All of that could take several hours or even days so a âpreliminaryâ report was often issued to the patient who could then be left anxiously awaiting the final results for days or even longer. That is no longer the case, according to Roth. With the new voice dictation technology, his reports can be ready for a specialistâs review in a matter of minutes instead of hours. Not only that, all the images that come across his desk from Marcus Daly Hospital patients can be viewed immediately by radiologists working at hospitals in Missoula, Spokane, and even Seattle. He said they all have direct access to everyone elseâs work list and the whole thing is actually a group effort. If he is getting overwhelmed with images to examine, but another hospital in the network is up to pace, they can help deal with the high demand. Thatâs a great relief to Dr. Roth, who can now go home at 5 p.m. knowing that the images he received at the last minute will go right on through the process while he tends to his kids. The process has been accelerated to such an extent, he said, that patients are not thrust into a state of anxiety by receiving any preliminary reports. They get the final report reviewed by a specialist in less time that it used to take to get the preliminary report. In critical cases that can be in 30 minutes and in other urgent cases, maybe two hours. Other less urgent cases can generally be turned around within 19 hours. Roth said that the imaging companyâs interaction with the medical providers and other staff at Marcus Daly was a step above what he was seeing in very much larger hospitals in the south. He was also impressed by the level of the technology and equipment here which also outstrips what was available in some of the larger hospitals that he worked in previously. Drew Hayward, Director of Imaging at Marcus Daly Hospital, said that the hospital staff was happy to have Dr. Roth and Inland Imaging as part of their team. He said the hospital was employing an after-hours reading service that wasnât really meeting the hospitalâs needs and this seemed like a good solution. He said that the imaging company has leveraged improvements to the system such as voice dictation that are real game changers and made reporting times much faster. Hayward said that the hospital has been storing images with Inland Imaging for about three years already so not all of the process is new to the hospital staff. As for the new part, âIt means a little more work for hospital staff in filling out forms but they appreciate the service,â said Hayward. Sheila Gager, a Radiologic Technologist at Marcus Daly and part of the imaging team, is quite enthusiastic about the developments. She worked for Inland Imaging in Missoula before coming to Marcus Daly two years ago. âItâs a great team to work with,â said Gager. âWeâve got each otherâs backs. Itâs a well-rounded group and they are very supportive of each other and take care of each other.â Gager said it was not her first stint at Marcus Daly Memorial Hospital. She said she worked here about 20 years ago. âThe difference is like night and day,â she said. She said the equipment that the hospital has accumulated in the meantime is astounding. She is especially enamored with the new CT scanner and its potential for guiding surgical procedures. She said Marcus Daly Hospital was an excellent place to work and it was just getting better all the time. Filed Under: News Alcoholics Anonymous is open to all who have a desire to stop drinking.

newsletter. Ding Kuen Tam, also known as Danny Wong, was featured here in a 1980 interview. He gave an interview about how it took him 16 years to get permission to bring his parents to the United States from Guangzhou, China. The Pekin Noodle Parlor is the oldest family-owned Chinese restaurant in the United States serving Butte for over 110 years. The restaurant was recently nominated for the 2020 James Beard Outstanding Hospitality Award. Ding Kuen Tam (Danny Wong) is seated here (second from the left) with his brothers, Ding Cheong Tam and Ding Hung Tam. The man in the tie is the brothers' grandfather, Kwong Yee Tam. Ding Kuen Tam, owner of the renowned Pekin Noodle Parlor, died at 86 on Monday. He was better known to the Butte community as Danny Wong, and better known still as a Butte icon. Wong leaves a legacy of historic consequence â he ran the Pekin in Butte since he inherited the restaurant from his great-grandfather in the 1950s. The Pekin is regarded as the oldest family-run Chinese restaurant in America. Wong was born Oct. 12, 1934, in Guangzhou, China. As a child, he fled the Japanese invasion of China before World War II, before making an unforgettable impact on the history and people of Butte. But somehow that tremendous legacy of success and personal triumph is overshadowed by the memory of his pure kindness. And those who knew him best would say, thatâs the greatest memory any man â an icon or otherwise â could leave behind. âHe was the kindest man that anybody ever knew,â said Wongâs son, Jerry Tam. âHis kindness stemmed from having a restaurant that served the mouths of the community. Anybody that wanted a meal, he would offer it to them, whether you had a penny or a dollar. He would make sure you didnât walk away hungry.â A waitress at Pekin for 11 years, Kate Holland Sheehan adored Wong. âHe gave to so many causes, whether it be to a school, a political campaign or fundraiser,â said Sheehan. âI canât tell you how many meals he gave out for free, too.â Wong went to great lengths to make people happy, especially when it was needed most. âIt was his favorite thing to do,â Tam said. âWhen anyone passed, thatâs what he was known for. He would load up his Jeep Wagoneer with the most food anybody could possibly eat and drop if off personally and say, here you go, hereâs food during your time of celebration of life.â âAnd now itâs his turn,â Tam said. âEveryoneâs returning the favor.â The phone calls flooded in from friends and political figures like former U.S. Sen. Max Baucus, Kim Krueger, who was Baucusâ Butte District field director, and Montana Lt. Gov. Mike Cooney. Krueger came to Butte to work for Baucus in the â80s with the city under economic crisis after the mine closed. Wong became one of her first friends in town, and then one of her finest. It wasnât just his kindness toward her, but to all, that struck Krueger the first time she climbed the steep stairs to the Pekin. âHe served miners as well as U.S. senators in the same manner,â she said. âHe just loved Butte and all of its citizens. Weâre definitely going to miss him.â Holding back emotion, Krueger remembered Wong as a truly compassionate gentleman, who treated everyone like a king or queen. âI just became very touched. And grew to love him as a friend, as a person, as a community leader. Iâm ready to cry,â she said. Working tables at the Pekinâs famous booths, Sheehan learned Wong had a knack for remembering a face, even if he hadnât seen a person in years. He would know exactly what someone would want to order, so menus were never needed. Cooney said that attention to detail extended to a personâs family. âHe would always ask about my mother and how she was doing,â Cooney said, remembering when his mother was getting older and could no longer make it up to the restaurant. âDanny would say, âMike, donât worry about it. You just call me and Iâll bring the food to your mom.â â Raised in Butte and a lifelong visitor to the Pekin, Cooney said it was never just about history and food â though thereâs always plenty of food. People came to talk to Wong, and Wong lived to talk to them. âFrankly he was always at the restaurant. Iâd walk back to the kitchen and find him working over a stove, in a fairly crowded kitchen, working his tail off. But he would always take the time to talk to you,â Cooney said. âHeâd make you feel like you were the most important person in the world, and then feed you an incredible meal. He always made you feel like you were the last customer he was going to have.â Baucus described the experience as a whirlwind of too much food and sometimes too much drink, all swirling around Wongâs famous smile. âI canât think of anybody thatâs made a stronger impression on me than Danny Wong,â Baucus said. âHeâs one of a kind.â Wong was a legendary talker, and nobody knows it better than his son. âIt took hours to go anywhere,â Tam said. âFrom his painters to friends, politicians, doctors, he would stand and talk to them for hours. My dad was just kind of the epicenter of it all.â âYour kidâs going to college? What college is he going to? I know someone at Columbia. I give him a call,â Wong would say, and reach for the phone. Or, âYou want to go into politics? Iâll call my friend Max Baucus,â Wong would say, and then literally fetch the number and call Baucus on the spot. When Tamâs friend Randy Walker told Wong he was a 49ers fan, Wong said, âI know a guy, I call him.â And Walker sailed to a 49ers game with a VIP ticket in a limo, just like that. It all happened in the Pekin. âMy dad was always able to find a way to make a connection â for someone to talk to, or for people to advance themselves in the world,â Tam said. With his genuine generosity, Wong advanced incredible friendships. Perhaps none is more iconic than the one between Wong and Butte legend Evel Knievel. Knievel was âBobbyâ to Wong. Whenever Knievel pulled his Maserati into the Pekin alleyway, Wong would give him a box full of food and a bottle of Jack Daniels, whether he drank it or not. âDanny, Iâm gonna jump Caesars Palace,â Knievel would say. âBobby, I donât think thatâs a good idea,â Wong would answer. âIâm gonna jump the Snake River,â Knievel would say. âBobby, I donât think thatâs a good idea,â Wong would answer again. Such was their bond. Knievel even gave Wong his last car, a Lincoln Mark VIII. Perhaps the greatest legend to emerge from their lifetime of friendship? They both died on the same day, at about the same time, 13 years apart. Many of Wongâs best friends, and his wife, Sharon Tam, passed before him. Among many others who define Butte, the late Pat Shea and Mike Mansfield counted themselves as Wongâs customers second, and his friends first. Wong will be personally honored in Butte homes for an extraordinary dedication to the family business and the community who enjoyed it, and his restaurant continues to capture accolades from the nation. The Pekin recently was a prestigious James Beard Foundation semifinalist for Outstanding Hospitality and was showcased in New York at the Museum of Food and Drink Exhibition called CHOW: The Making of an American Chinese Restaurant. The restaurant will also be featured in 2021 at Chicagoâs Chinese Heritage Museum. Throughout his life, Wong educated the Butte community on Chinese culture, and kept his restaurant largely unchanged. The simple trick allowed the Pekin to transcend time. âHis restaurant is an integral part of Butteâs history,â said Butte-Silver Bow Chief Executive Dave Palmer, âand the same could be said of Danny.â Wong spent every day making people smile, and for no other reason than that it was his honor and delight to do so.

Wong wanted people to be as happy as he was, and loved many people well. As Tam continues the restaurant in his fatherâs tradition, he perhaps feels the greatest honor of all. After all, Tam said, âHe loved his family the most.â That kind of love is the stuff of legend. Subscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.

extraordinarily simple. Itâs a crust of some sort filled with literally whatever you want. It should come as no surprise, then, that the history of pie stretches back thousands of years. This pastryâs flexibility has allowed it to adapt to different times, different cultures and, above all, different tastes. Modern pie means different things to different people. Itâs a symbol of Americana, itâs a staple of the holidays, itâs a savory pub meal and itâs a thing to throw in a clownâs face. Exploring the pastryâs past bounces you around the world and shows the enduring power of dough-wrapped food. The worldâs first pie Deciding where the history of pie starts will test your understanding of what a âpieâ is. Many historians trace it all the way back to the ancient Egyptians, who had a kind of pastry made from grains like wheat or oats, but this is more like a galette â a pan-less, looser-form pastry â which arguably isnât very pie-like. These early âpies,â especially those eaten by Egyptian sailors for nourishment on their journeys, are more like an early version of biscuits or hardtack. The award for earliest pie, then, might just go to the Sumerians, because a tablet with the recipe for a chicken pie was discovered on a tablet dating back to around 2000 BCE. Nothing else is really known about this pie, though, and it still didnât resemble the modern pastry we know. Then thereâs the Greeks, who some historians also credit with âinventingâ pie. The Greeks took Egyptian recipes and enhanced them with pastry, making the whole thing less bread-like and more pielike. Thereâs not a huge amount of writing about Greek pies, but in the fifth century BCE plays of Aristophanes, there are allusions to pastries filled with fruit. The Romans have a greater written record, so more is known of their baking exploits. Their writings also reveal the early division between sweet and savory pies, which is a split that has carried through to modern pastry-making. On the savory end, the first meat-based pies were not intended to be eaten as pies at all. Romans would use dough as a way to encase meat and to keep it from drying. It wouldnât be until pies traveled outside the Roman Empire that meat pies took over the world of stuffed pastry. The Romans did eat sweet pies whole, and these were probably more similar to modern pies than anything mentioned so far. The earliest Roman recipe for this foodstuff, published in roughly 160 BCE, involved a rye crust, goat cheese and honey. Itâs not a pie youâre likely to encounter in a modern bakery, but all the components were there for the subsequent rise of this food. The spread of pies Because of their subsequent conquest of most of the European continent, Romans have had an outsized impact on the West. Much like the Latin language spread across the landmass, so too did the pies. Because of the pieâs mutable form, any country could make a pie by putting its local foods â meat, nuts, fruit of whatever variety â into a crust. The biggest change that occurred at this point in the history of pie had to do with the crust. One of the distinguishing features of pie crust is that, unlike bread, it needs to be made with some kind of fat. In Rome and other parts of southern Europe, the fat of choice was olive oil, which limits how easily the crust can be shaped. In northern Europe, the cold climates kept olives from being grown, and so other fats were used, like lard or butter. This brought us one step closer to the modern pie, which also usually use one of those ingredients to form the crust. The best pies in London While pies did spread all across Europe, England likely had the biggest influence on the history of pie. Itâs also where the pastry finally got the name âpieâ (or âpyeâ) sometime before the 14th century, though no one is quite sure where the word came from. The best guess is that itâs connected to the magpie, which is a bird known for collecting objects to line its nest. The idea was that just as the bird collects things, a baker collects things to put into a pie. English and pies are especially intertwined because not every language has a separate word for âpie.â Most languages tend to call pies words that look more like âtartâ (like the Dutch taart and the Portuguese torta) or âpastryâ (like the Spanish pastel or the German Pastete). That doesnât mean there arenât pies in other places but does imply that it was a more defined category in England than in other places. By the 12th century CE, pies were a commonplace dish in England, but they were still often seen as a way to keep meat fresh for longer periods of time. And it stayed that way for a while. By the middle of the 16th century, a pie crust would be called a coffyn, which â despite sounding funerary â means âbasket.â And these baskets could be so thick that the pies were more crust than filling. While the written record supports the idea that pie crusts were not meant to be eaten at this point in history, Janet Clarkson â author of Pie: A Global History â argues that it may have been a matter of class. While the English nobility may have been okay with throwing the dough that encased their preserved meats into the garbage, the lower classes wouldnât have tossed out something edible so flippantly. Medieval serfs werenât exactly rolling in food, after all. The consumption of the crusts may have gone from the lower classes on up, then. And by the time it reached the upper classes, chefs had figured out how to create delectable pies from the inside out. By the 16th century, pies made a slight turn from the savory to the sweet.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 2:37 pm On July 3, the Press & Journal, a weekly newspaper in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, produced its last issue after 166 years of local publication. The Independent-Enterprise in Payette, Idaho, shut down June 24. The New Sharon (Iowa) Sun closed June 18. The Merkel (Texas) Mail ended its 130-year run on May 27. The list goes on. One casualty of COVID-19 has been the accelerated carnage of newspapers across America. Publishing businesses that were, in many cases, already shaky have been ravaged by a decline in advertising from other local institutions affected by the pandemic. Just one Montana news organization, the online Havre Herald, has closed as a result of COVID., but journalists and other staff have been furloughed at all the stateâs dailies. Along the Hi-Line, the Cut Bank Pioneer Press, Glacier Reporter, Shelby Promoter, and Valerian have, at least for now, merged into a single weekly edition. Media followers know that this is nothing new, of course: The decline of newspapers at the hands of the Internet and changing audience tastes has been playing out for two decades. Those who fault journalism for sensationalism and lack of trustworthiness, among other sins, may say: Good riddance. But thereâs ample evidence that independent news actually is critical to democracy, and that the loss of 1,800 print outlets since 2004 (according to data in the Newspaper Research Journal) weakens citizenship and civic function. A 2015 study in the Journal of Politics, for example, found that people in places with less news coverage were less likely to vote and share opinions about political candidates. A study in 2014 described a correlation between newspaper closures and lower civic engagement. Intriguingly, a working paper published in 2018 posits that municipal borrowing costs were higher in communities where newspapers had stopped publishing â perhaps because there was less scrutiny of public projects. If you believe in the importance of newspapers to civil society, you should be heartened by The Local Journalism Sustainability Act. The bipartisan bill, introduced on July 16 by U.S. Representatives Ann Kirkpatrick, (D-Arizona) and Dan Newhouse, (R-Washington, provides for tax credits for subscribing to local newspapers, payroll credits for publishers who employ local journalists, and credits for businesses and others that advertise in local newspapers and local media. Here are the details of what the legislation would allow: â¢Credit for advertising in local newspapers and local media. Businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees would be eligible for a five-year non-refundable tax credit to spend on advertising in local newspapers or local radio or television stations. The credit, up to $5,000 in the first year and $2,500 in each of the next four years, would cover 80% of advertising costs in the first year and 50% annually thereafter. This provision helps local businesses as well as local media companies. â¢Credit for local newspaper subscriptions. The act provides for a non-refundable tax credit of up to $250 per year to help cover the costs of subscriptions to local newspapers, in print or digital form, that primarily produce content related to news and current events. The credit would cover 80% of subscription costs in the first year, and 50% thereafter and helps consumers while incentivizing support of local news organizations. â¢Payroll credit for journalists. This five-year refundable tax credit could be used by local newspapers on compensation of its journalists up to $50,000 a year. The credit would cover 50% of compensation, up to $50,000, in the first year and 30% of compensation, up to $50,000, in each of the subsequent four years. This provision will go a long way toward ensuring that communities keep their local news coverage. As a newspaper publisher myself, I am obviously self-interested â but I believe that this is a thoughtful and far-sighted bill that merits support. Iâm especially pleased by the proposed credit for newspaper subscribers, which could help rebuild the muscle among Americans for reading, listening to, and watching the news â and supporting those who produce it â as an elemental act of citizenship. The Local Journalism Sustainability Act would not be a panacea. Many newspapers have been painfully slow to respond to the challenges posed by the Internet and social media; we still have to figure out how get to a business model thatâs sustainable. We also must provide responsible, fact-based journalism that earns our communitiesâ trust and financial support by telling the whole story â covering diverse experiences that reflect the entirety of their communities, and reporting on whatâs working in a community, which is as true and as important as what fails. Quality journalism is, I believe, at the heart of the only viable, long-term fix for newspapers.

Originally, Council was on course to rescind the Shelter in Place order on July 13, and CSKT employees were expected to return to work. That all changed Tuesday. Effective immediately, Council chose to keep the Shelter in Place order active without a set end date. Employees will not be expected back to work July 13 as previously planned. This will give health officials time to confirm these quick-test positives with lab work and give time for contact tracing for close contacts. A close contact is defined as someone who was within six feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes starting from two days before illness onset (or, for asymptomatic cases, two days prior to positive specimen collection) until the time the patient is isolated.

She is a three-time Glacier County Spelling Bee champion and it seems good spelling habits run in the family. Her younger brother, Ethan, finished in the top five at last weekâs event. Seven of the Top 10 finishers were from Cut Bank schools. In the Glacier County Spelling Bee, the judge asks the contestant to spell the word, advantageous. The contestant repeats the word, spells it and repeats it again. If the contestant spells it correctly, they live to spell again in the next round. Ashlyn Brown knows how spelling bees work and she has gotten pretty proficient at them, having made it to the final round in the last three Glacier County Spelling Bees. And three years in a row she came home the champion. Her last victory came a week ago, Monday, Feb. 24,when the Glacier County Spelling Bee was held here in Cut Bank at the Cut Bank High School Auditorium. Her first-place finish sends her off to the State Spelling Bee, which will be held in Bozeman on March 14 at the Montana State University campus. There her competition is 64 other students all vying for that first-place trophy. âI have gone to the Treasure State Spelling Bee three times,â Ashlyn said. âI didnât go very far my first year at state. My second year, I got into the top 15. Iâm looking to place this year.â Ashlyn, the daughter of Aaron and Rachel Brown and a seventh grader at Cut Bank Middle School, was not the only Cut Bank student to do well in the Glacier County Bee. There were seven students from Cut Bank that placed in the top 10. Pretty impressive! Ashlyn was first at the spelling bee and following her in second place was Blake Seifert, Gracie Edwards in fourth place, Ethan Brown in fifth place, Elyse Bengston in sixth, Kylee Arensmeyer in seventh and in eighth place was Wysper HeadCarrier. The kids all agree that spelling bees are fun to participate in. They also pose a challenge to these young students and that is something else they enjoy. Blake Seifert, the son of Tom and Jamie Seifert, and a fifth grader at Anna Jeffries Elementary School said, âI think competing is fun.â Blake prepares for the bees by having his âmom quiz me on the words and Mrs. Claybourn helpedâ him too. This was Blakeâs first county spelling bee. However, he did participate in the Anna Jeffries Spelling bee and took first place at that event. Gracie Edwards, the daughter of Mia Edwards and also a fifth grader at Anna Jeffries Elementary School likes spelling bees because âyou get to do challenging things,â she said. She gets help from her mom when getting ready for a bee. âMy mom says the words then I spell them.â This county bee was Gracieâs second spelling bee. Ethan Brown is the brother to Ashlyn and a fifth grader at Anna Jeffries Elementary School. This county bee was his first big spelling bee. âI think the most fun part about the spelling bee is all the tension about being in the top ten and getting to stand in front of the crowd,â he shared. Ethan gets ready for the spelling bee by practicing âwith my friends. We go back and forth with studying our words and we did it like a competition,â he said. Elyse Bengston is a fifth grader at Anna Jeffries Elementary School and the daughter of Andrea Bengston. This was her second time participating in a spelling bee. âThe spelling bee is fun because it is challenging,â she said. âWhen we know we will be in the spelling bee we get a big packet of words to study. I usually study at home by having my mom say the word to me, then I spell it.â The Glacier County Spelling Bee champ, Ashlyn, also has help studying her words, thanks to her parents and her teachers. âBut I usually study by myself, whenever I get the chance,â she shared. âI glance through the words in the packet, then find the pronunciations for the harder words. I know itâs not the best study habit, but I usually really study the week before the spelling bee.â She added, âThe spelling bee is fun because I like to see how far I can go each year. Itâs fun to challenge myself with the words for the state spelling bee.â Rachel Brown is mom to both Ashlyn and Ethan and she is also a teacher in the Cut Bank School system, teaching middle school and high school Family and Consumer Sciences. She understands the value of kids knowing how to spell. âSpelling is an important foundational skill for kids. It helps with writing, communication and comprehension,â she said. Rachel believes part of what makes her kids good spellers is that they are good readers and good writers. âI firmly believe that having a reading background is key to their spelling success. Both of our kids love to write as well. Spelling is a key element of reading and writing.â Her children were read to from a very early age and she stands by the fact that if kids are read to early, they will not only love to read as well, but will have a much better understanding of the words and that ultimately leads to them being good spellers. âWe love books in this family,â she said. âI am a firm believer in the power of books and how important they are in the lives of kids.â As parents, Rachel said she and her husband Aaron are both willing to help their kids study for the spelling bees. But âthese two are both really self-motivated when it comes to the spelling bees and school. I never really worry about homework or studying with Ashlyn and Ethan. They know what they have to do and they take it upon themselves to study and do their work.â She added, âBefore this yearâs spelling bee, both of the kids would go off on their own and study their word lists. Neither Aaron nor I told them to go study, they just went and did it on their own. Ethan did ask us to quiz him a few times on the words, but that was it.â Good habits taught early does indeed go a long way and the proof is the Brown family having two kids in the top 10 at this yearâs spelling bee. Rachel also believes the teachers in Cut Bank play a vital role for not just their kids, but for every student in the school system. âWe are lucky in Cut Bank to have so many wonderful teachers. I have witnessed staff and teachers from our schools going above and beyond to help support and care for our kids. I have seen my kidsâ teachers show up to support my kids at activities outside of the school realm. That speaks a lot to me about how much these people truly care for the kids in this school and their classroom. That care translates to successful kids,â she explained. Log In Keep it Clean.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:35 pm Incumbent Supreme Court Justice Laurie McKinnon is being challenged by Mike Black, a Helena-based attorney, in this yearâs lone contested Supreme Court race. Eight months ago, Laurie McKinnon wasnât sure sheâd be running for re-election to Montanaâs Supreme Court. Now, as the Nov. 3 election looms, sheâs facing competition from Mike Black, a Helena-based attorney. Justice McKinnon grew up in Maryland, earning a law degree from the University of Baltimore. Sheâs lived and raised her three children in Montana since 1995, and worked as a deputy county attorney for Teton County and a special county attorney for Glacier County for 10 years. In 2006, she was elected as a local district judge, serving for six years before winning a seat on Montanaâs Supreme Court. At the 2020 campaignâs start, McKinnon decided not to seek reelection, in part because her husband had recently taken a job with a North Carolina health clinic. Now heâs back in Montana, where the two plan to remain. âBeing a judge is a privilege,â McKinnon said, âand Iâve enjoyed it very much.â Black was born in Havre, Montana, and earned a bachelorâs degree at the University of Montana. He received his law degree from New Yorkâs Cornell University and returned to Montana, working as a partner at two firms before starting his own. He was litigation director for the Montana Legal Services Association, which represents low-income Montanans. He has also been an assistant attorney general under AGs Steve Bullock and Tim Fox. âI have an experience growing up in Montana, and being a historian by nature helps to understand things like the 1972 Montana Constitution with a little bit of context,â he said. Montanaâs nonpartisan Supreme Court elections are often-overlooked races. Rules of judicial ethics prevent candidates from talking about existing or pending cases, so experience, past decisions and associations are important. In Juneâs three-way primary to determine Novemberâs candidates, McKinnon won 53% of the votes while Black finished second with 30%. McKinnon said her experience on the high court is why voters should give her another term. She said serving as a district judge and justice gives her an advantage over Black, who has no judicial experience. But Black argued his experience in Montana courts qualified him for the race,and criticized McKinnonâs consistency and her readings of Montana constitutional protections in areas like public access. He cited a 2018 McKinnon dissent in an easement case that would have prevented the state from acquiring land on an eastern Montana ranch for conservation purposes. The Montana Land Board had declined to approve the easement, but Gov. Steve Bullock overrode the decision to allow the purchase. In her dissent, McKinnon argued the Land Board should have the final say. She was the lone dissenter. Black also pointed to a 2015 dissent where McKinnon opposed the Courtâs majority decision allowing public access to a section of the Ruby River in southwest Montana. McKinnon argued Black did not understand the specifics of the cases in the context they were presented to the Supreme Court. âI would say that Mr. Black probably has not understood the opinion,â McKinnon said. âWhen somebody accuses a justice of making a political decision, itâs because they donât understand the process of making that decision.â McKinnon has written for the majority in key cases, as well. In 2018, McKinnon authored the Supreme Courtâs decision to strike down a tax credit benefiting private, religious schools in Montana. Conservatives appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court where it was overturned this year, 5-4. McKinnon said she felt the federal court crossed the line into statesâ rights in that decision. âI think they were wrong,â she said. âThat decision was an interpretation of the Montana Constitution.â McKinnon won her first Supreme Court term in 2012. In that election, a group called the Montana Growth Network, a conservative Political Action Committee headed by Republican state Sen. Jason Priest of Red Lodge, sponsored attack ads critical of McKinnonâs opponent. Critics claimed these ads were funded by âdark money,â or untraceable donations. University of Montana constitutional and elections law professor Anthony Johnstone said then that in judicial races, these independent expenditures can dominate the campaigns. McKinnon, who denounced the ads at the time, said the controversy factored into her initial reluctance to seek reelection this year. She said the ads weren't a reflection of who she is and how she decides cases, adding that itâs been hard to overcome claims to the contrary. âThatâs been hard to live with,â she said, âbecause (the attack ads were) not an accurate statement about who I was, as a person. I didnât want to go through it again. I wanted to run another term, but I didnât want to take the personal risk.â As of early September, little dark money has appeared in this yearâs lower-profile races, though itâs behind the issue-based ads in the U.S. Senate, House and governorâs race. Both Supreme Court candidates are relying on donations from individuals. Such contributions are strictly limited, but they do reflect support. Notable donors to McKinnon include U.S. Congressman Greg Gianforte and his wife, Susan. On Blackâs side, former mayors of Missoula Mike Kadas and Daniel Kemmis have donated to his campaign, along with retired Missoula District Court judge Karen Townsend. Black has been endorsed by five retired Supreme Court justices: James Nelson, Terry Trieweiler, Mike Wheat, William Leaphart, and Jim Regnier. A letter signed by all five said Black was âeminently qualifiedâ for the court and has earned statewide respect from Montanaâs legal community. McKinnon has not listed endorsements on her website as of September. Log In Keep it Clean. Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexually-oriented language. PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR CAPS LOCK.

She spent her high school years in the beautiful Upper Ruby and graduated as a Sheridan Panther. She has been passionate about building community since her college days at Montana State University and believes there is no better place than a vibrant community paper. Cori is currently raising two little darlings with her husband and getting outside as much as possible. 1) Why do you love journalism? I love helping our communities share the stories that are important to their lives. Whether it\'s local government in action, a recent school board decision that affects their family, a natural resource story or a touching human interest piece, all of these stories are interwoven into the fabric of the day to day lives of our neighbors and friends. Connection and understanding are very important to me. 2) What are three of your favorite things? My family, yoga (better yet, yoga on my paddle board) and sunshine on my shoulders. 3) Favorite quote? âA reader lives a thousand lives before he dies, said Jojen. The man who never reads lives only one.ââ George R.R. Martin, A Dance With Dragons Kate Joki Rose was born and raised in Butte, America. After her time as a Bobcat in Bozeman her inner gypsy took her on a twenty plus year tour around the country. Kate learned about movies in Los Angeles, how to two-step in Nashville, how to appreciate coffee in Seattle and publishing in Olympia. In 2010 she returned to where she left her heart, Montana. After a few false starts throughout the state, she met her husband in Butte. Kate and Dan took over his family home in The Ruby in 2017. They live with their 2 dogs, 1 cat and future miniature donkey. (Kate is still working on Dan about that one) She has finally planted roots, but her curiosity is stronger than ever. 1) Why do you love journalism? I have always been enamored with the written word and the power of information. Knowledge not simply in an academic sense, but in, and for, our shared experience. Understanding and, more importantly, appreciating our communities is greatly enhanced when we are aware of its character, ongoing history, and the effects each stakeholder has on it. Journalism, particularly local journalism, is one of the greatest promoters and barometers of a thriving community. 2) What are three of your favorite things? Animals, music, and morningâs first coffee. All three at the same timeâ¦perfection. 3) Favorite quote? âEveryone is given two lives. The second one begins when they realize they were only given one â. Unknown.

our Daily Headlines newsletter. Wendy Reid and Jeff Peacock hold engagement and wedding photographs of their parents, Skip and Dianne Peacock, who died this fall in Missoula of complications from COVID-19. Skip, who owned ""Skip\'s Orange Street Sinclair"" for many years, became infected first and died at age 82, and Dianne tested positive soon after her husband and was 78 when she died. Jeff also was infected with COVID from helping his father. Skip Peacock was an Air Force veteran, and coached Little Grizzly Football for many years. Dianne worked for Missoula County Public Schools, and was active in their church activities. They had been married 58 years. Jeff Peacock and Wendy Reid sit with their parents, Skip and Dianne Peacock, a year ago at Christmas time. Skip and Dianne Peacock, both longtime Missoulians, were well on their way to celebrating their 59th wedding anniversary together next spring. With children, grandchildren and a large circle of friends in town, it promised to be a bright day of celebration in a gloomy era. The coronavirus pandemic thatâs killed at least 300,000 Americans had other plans. Instead of the usual holiday activities for the Peacock family, the last months of 2020 were filled with anxiety-wracked car rides to the emergency room, oxygen tanks, protective gear and grave consultations with doctors. And finally, it ended with family members exchanging last words through a protective mask or over a Zoom call to a dying loved one in a hospital bed. Skip and Dianne succumbed to complications from COVID-19 on Oct. 23 and Dec. 2, respectively, at St. Patrick Hospital in Missoula. With the death toll in Montana on pace to hit 1,000 soon, itâs easy to lose sight of the fact that each and every one of the people lost to the disease had their own story and a circle of friends and family who cared about them. Skip and Dianne Peacock made an indelible mark on countless others during their decades in Missoula, according to their children, siblings Jeff Peacock and Wendy Reid. Skip got drafted by the Boston Red Sox baseball system out of high school but opted to join the Air Force instead. In 1961, he was transferred to the Reserves in Cut Bank where he met Dianne, and they married in 1962 and moved to Missoula to raise their children in 1965. Skip owned âSkipâs Orange Street Sinclairâ on the corner of Broadway and Orange for many years, and Dianne was the executive secretary to the superintendent of the Missoula County Public Schools administration and active in church activities. Skip coached Little Grizzly Football in his spare time. âIâve got a pile of letters that parents had sent him over the years while he was coaching,â Jeff Peacock said. âAll saying the same thing: âWow, thank you Skip, what a great job you did with the kids.â He got nothing but a lot of rave reviews. A lotta parents thank my dad and say he taught them how to win and lose. Itâs pretty cool how many kidsâ lives he touched.â Wendy also said she canât believe how many cards they get, even to this day, from parents thanking Skip for building confidence in their kids. Dianne liked playing cards with her friends, spending time with her grandkids, golfing, planting flowers, reading and quilting. When kids from Hellgate High School nearby couldnât afford lunch, she and other volunteers at Garden City Church would serve them. In their later years, they lived together at The Springs, a senior living facility in Missoula. *** Itâs unclear how Skip was originally infected. He started coughing on the 10th of October. He took a rapid test at the emergency room at the hospital, and tested positive that day. It only took 13 days for the disease to take his life. He suffered from Alzheimerâs and had strokes in the past, but Brad believes his father was physically healthy enough to live another decade. âHe didnât have a lot of symptoms at first,â Wendy Reid explained. In fact, he was released from the hospital and sent home to stay with his daughter. But that only lasted one night, and he was re-admitted. The disease worked quickly from there. âMy dad, they Zoomed us with him one day and he was smiling and cracking jokes,â she recalled. âThe doctor called me 20 minutes later and said he had taken a turn for the worse and heâs not going to make it. They could tell. They said âweâve seen it enough timesâ and could tell. It was pretty crazy.â Dianne tested positive shortly after Skip because they shared an apartment at The Springs. She had underlying lung health issues, but she too was released from the hospital after her first stay. And again, she had to be re-admitted because her oxygen declined and her kids noticed she was having delusions. âI saw her at The Springs and for the most part she looked good, and I thought âgood God I think she beat this thingâ but 4-5 days later she was delirious and hallucinating,â Jeff recalled. Back at the hospital, doctors found she had pneumonia and emphysema. âThey realized how much damage the COVID had done to her lungs,â Wendy recalled. âBefore, my mom only used oxygen to walk across the facility to play cards, but when she got out the first time she was on it full time. She was a smoker and stuff and had (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), but COVID tipped her over they said, and made everything worse.â Both Jeff and Wendy have nothing but good things to say about how the staff at St. Patrickâs Hospital and The Springs treated their parents. Wendy said because her mom never answered the phone, she would have to make a nurse go to her momâs room two or three times a day. âTheyâre swamped, but never once made you feel like youâre a bother,â Wendy recalled. Eventually, their mom was put on âcomfort care,â which means theyâre not going to make it. It was a decision that didnât come lightly. The doctors, though, knew her lungs werenât going to come through. Wendy and Jeff and their family relied on doctors and the palliative care team to talk to their mom about ""not coming through"" it this time, because due to precautions the family couldn\'t be there to help talk about it. âMomâs not ever going to say that,â Wendy recalled of the decision. âShe doesnât want to die. Nobody does. It took us awhile to get her there. But in the end it was a peaceful decision.â Skip passed at age 82; Dianne was 78. ***** Jeff and Wendy both graduated from high school in Missoula, and Wendyâs husbandâs father started Diversified Plastics in town, where Jeff works. Both Jeff and Wendy said they hope people will take the virus seriously so other families donât have to go through what they did. âI do think, wear a mask,â Wendy said. âItâs simple. Itâs not that big of a deal. I know people get frustrated with it. But until it hits your family you donât quite grasp how quickly it can pass from person to person.â In fact, Jeff was infected by simply giving his father a ride to the hospital. ""It\'s almost certain I got it from my dad,"" Jeff said. ""I was in the ER with him for almost 7 hours. I did have an N95 mask on but I did not have gloves, goggles or any other PPE. I wasn\'t around anyone else but my wife leading up to that either. I got very sick. Came close to going to the hospital."" He said he had almost all the symptoms, but he didn\'t lose his sense of taste or smell as is commonly reported from people with COVID. Wendy said she was impressed at how seriously the hospital took safety precautions. She noticed how much work it is just for nurses to get geared up to enter rooms to do their jobs. âIt does shake you when youâre at the hospital and you see the nurses gowning up and all the protective gear, and just for myself the procedure for going into the rooms is quite the ordeal,â Wendy said. âHaving to do that every single time made me appreciate it. I get that now, the whole protective gear procedure.â She realized how important it is for medical staff to have the protective equipment they need to be safe. Jeff said heâs dismayed sometimes when people on social media talk about masks as some sort of sign of weakness. âTheyâre the same people that havenât lost half their family,â he said. âWear a mask. It doesnât hurt anyone. Itâs not about you, itâs about other people is what itâs about. Especially the most vulnerable. There have been 20-39-year-olds dying damn near as fast as 80-year-olds. I donât get that whole thing, that they think itâs the government taking away freedoms. Itâs'}]"

W winds at 20 to 30 mph, decreasing to 10 to 15 mph. Chance of rain 30%. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:35 pm The unit that initially failed, Drop 5, got its first new water on Oct. 13, marking the completion of a rehabilitation project begun last June. The system serves users in Canada and along the Hi-Line. At around 3 p.m. on Sunday, May 17, a concrete drop structure failed on the Bureau of Reclamationâs Milk River Project St. Mary Canal, northwest of the town of Cut Bank in northern Montana, located completely within the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. When the structure, called âDrop 5,â failed, it shut down the water that used to flow through diversions from Sherburne Reservoir in Glacier National Park through the St. Mary River, to a canal and two sets of steel siphons that take the water 29 miles to the Milk River. In a dry year, the system supplies up to 95% of the flow, traveling up through Canada and returning to Montana around Havre 216 miles away. It is stored in the Fresno Reservoir near Havre, and the water supplies around 140,000 acres of irrigation along the Hi-Line in eight irrigation districts. The system supports Bureau of Reclamation pump contracts, private contracts, stock water, the cities of Havre, Chinook and Harlem as well as providing water to the Fort Belknap and Blackfeet Indian communities, Town of Milk River and Coutts, Alberta, Sweet Grass in Toole County and the Bowdoin National Wildlife Refuge. The project also creates habitat for wildlife and recreational benefits on and off the reservation. The failure occurred entirely within the Blackfeet Reservation, said Jennifer Patrick, project manager for the Milk River Joint Board of Control, the group working with the primary contract holder, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. Jerry Lunak, the Blackfeet Tribeâs Water Resources Director, said, âThe project was built in the early 1900s as a project to irrigate parts of Canada and projects on the Hi-Line. This is one issue I worked on with the water compact, and that created a partnership with the Milk River Joint Board of Control. In the past, the Tribal part has been minimal at best, except that we built it. So the Tribeâs benefit from the project has been stock water and lately rehabilitation and jobs. So it hasnât been focused on the Indian reservation.â âThe rights in the compact will come to fruition,â Patrick responded, noting it includes 50,000 acre-feet of irrigation water reserved for the Tribe. Just 5,000 acre-feet are what is called âwet waterâ while the rest goes into Tiber Reservoir and for which the Tribe is compensated $28 million. Any water going into Tiber above 35,000 acre feet is marketable by the Tribe, she said. âRehabilitation of St. Mary has been on the back burner for a while now,â Lunak agreed, âand if the new rehabilitation expands the water amount, the Tribe gets that water.â The St. Mary diversion is one of the first five water projects done by the Bureau of Reclamation, Patrick said, and the most complicated. âAfter the failure, we met with agencies to develop a plan,â she said, noting Sletten Construction and HDR Engineering were hired to be the leads on the construction contracts. There are also multiple collaborative efforts and partnerships with the Blackfeet Tribe, TERO employees and subcontractors to completely replace two Drop structures. She said that upon inspection, Drop 2 was found to be in worse shape than Drop 5, so that was included in the project. Starting in June, Sletten poured around 2,066 cubic yards of concrete at Drop 5, as well as 200 tons of steel. âThe Bureau reached out to the Tribe, Tribal Council, TERO and Blackfeet Tribal Historic Preservation Officer John Murray,â Lunak said, âso we got in on the start. With 30 years in the St. Mary Working Group, it created a relationship to address the issue on the front end.â âThere were many decisions in the partnership,â Patrick agreed, âfor example cultural decisions, and they were all contracted through the Tribe. Thatâs the biggest plus, the partnerships that were created. Some people donât understand where the Milk River water comes from, so itâs good to see people learning how it gets there and why.â Having taken 22 weeks from start to finish, ribbon-cutting ceremonies were held on-site on Thursday, Oct. 15, with appearances from Congressional representatives and other dignitaries. âThe water is now running,â Patrick said. âIt hit the Milk River today [Tuesday, Oct. 13] around 2 p.m., and everyone should be very proud of it.â Log In Keep it Clean.

People are maybe trying to get away from states that are heavily taxed. One big one is a lot of people are wondering if this pandemic is going to be a new way of life for a while, so if theyâre going to have to shelter in place, they want to be in a spot where they have room to roam.â Donnelly said people in large cities are realizing that if they can work from home, they might as well earn a big-city paycheck while living in the mountains. âI think this pandemic has shown people they can work remotely,â she said. âHistorically, a lot of people have steered away from Montana because itâs a challenge to compete with bigger citiesâ income. Now, they can take their job in San Francisco or Silicon Valley and bring it here. Why not Montana? Thatâs the number one reason right there.â Of course, real estate agents want to sell Montana to out-of-state buyers who have higher incomes and are selling houses in higher-priced markets, so they have an incentive to make the market seem attractive. Donnelly said sheâs having the best year sheâs ever had. Not every local Realtor is seeing the out-of-state rush. Mindy Palmer, a Realtor in Missoula with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Montana, has been in the industry for 22 years. She said sheâs seen no uptick whatsoever in out-of-state buyers. âItâs business as usual, and we track it very carefully,â Palmer said. There is no mechanism in Montana law that accurately depicts where buyers are coming from. ""Unfortunately all we have to go off is anecdotal info,â said Brint Wahlberg of Windermere Real Estate. Wahlberg works with the Missoula Organization of Realtors to compile data on the local real estate market. ""We have some stats from the housing report that shows where people are coming from, but our (Multiple Listing Service) doesnât report \'source\' from where the buyers came,"" he said. He said in June that a local title officer estimated to him that about one-in-four buyers are coming from out-of-state. Shannon Hilliard, a Realtor with Ink Realty Group in Missoula, also noted there\'s no way to track it other than talking to people. âIn my experience, we donât have any data to say definitely where buyers are coming from,â she said. âUntil we have a mechanism for tracking the data, all we have are anecdotes.â DJ Smith, the president-elect of the Missoula Organization of Realtors, told reporter Nate Hegyi of public radio initiative America Amplified in June that âout-of-state buyers are coming in droves.â Smith told the Missoulian thereâs interest in talking with state lawmakers about changing laws and trying to make it mandatory to track where buyers are coming from. Meanwhile, a new report from the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Montana shows that Missoula housing prices continue to soar. The median sale price of a Missoula home in 2019 was around $315,000. According to economist Brandon Bridge, the first few months of data for 2020 shows the median sale price rising to over $340,000. âWhile home prices have been growing across the board in Missoula County, they have been rising fastest among entry-level homes,â wrote Bridge in the report for Montana Business Quarterly. ""This has made affordability particularly challenging for new prospective homeowners, which has resulted in the past eight years being categorized as a sellerâs market for entry-level homes.â Bridge analyzed Internal Revenue Service data to get a glimpse of how many people are moving to Missoula from out-of-state compared to within Montana, although there is no data for 2019 or 2020 yet. ""Since 2010, the population of Missoula County has grown from approximately 107,000 to an estimated 116,000 in 2018, an increase of roughly 8 percent,â Bridge wrote. ""When looking at in-migration since 2013, over half of those moving into the county have come from another state, and those moving into the county earn higher incomes on average than those moving away.â More people with higher incomes in the same location creates competition, he noted, which drives up the price level.

The specter of contaminated soil is muddying a city effort to increase public investment in an area of northeast Bozeman that includes a former Superfund site. A mile from downtown Bozeman, sandwiched between the railroad and I-90, the former Idaho Pole yards sit vacant. The property is the focus of a city effort to form an urban renewal district in the area, which would open the door to public investment and possible private redevelopment. With land in Bozeman increasing in value, the location and size of the property is any developerâs dream. But, the Idaho Pole Yards is not a typical chunk of land. Starting in the 1940s, the Idaho Pole Co. treated wood at that location. Decades later, it was discovered that chemicals had contaminated the soil and groundwater around the site. The Environmental Protection Agency got involved, adding the property to the Superfund list in 1986 and eventually leading a clean-up effort that saw 19,000 cubic yards of soil treated, returned to the ground and covered with clean soil. Since Idaho Pole stopped operations in 1997, the property has sat largely vacant, save for a few old structures, the occasional trespasser and dozens of wells sticking up from the ground that are used for sampling. The EPA removed much of the property from the Superfund list earlier this year, but a few acres of treated soil remain. Though there is no proposal for the property yet, a group of potential buyers is in the beginning stages of formulating a plan for development. The efforts to form an urban renewal district are separate from any potential development plans, but the urban renewal plan in part focuses on redevelopment in the area to âretain existing and attract new economic development.â With the lack of utilities to the property limiting opportunities, Nolan Campbell, a Bozeman real estate broker representing Idaho Pole Co., said an urban renewal district with tax increment financing is a viable path to being able to develop the property. âItâs outright been neglected for so long,â Campbell said. âWe can just continue to neglect these infrastructure issues or we can address them.â Establishing tax increment financing for the area would direct a portion of property taxes from their normal destinations to be used for investment in public infrastructure. âThe goal of these (urban renewal districts) is to incentivize private investment by making certain public investments concurrent or simultaneous with those projects,â said Bozeman director of economic development Brit Fontenot. The Bozeman City Commission will take a first vote on the Pole Yard Urban Renewal District plan on Tuesday. And though the plan isnât about just the Idaho Pole property â it extends to more than 270 acres â the pole yards, and the rumblings of a development there, are the cause of concern for nearby neighbors. Northeast Bozeman residents arenât strangers to controversial or complex development ideas. But, neighborhood association president Reno Walsh said their concerns arenât only because they oppose development in general. âItâs easy to assume that everybody in the northeast neighborhood is opposed to development â¦ (but) weâve all accepted the fact that it is going to happen. But when it does happen it has to make sense for the health and safety of humans,â Walsh said. In the case of the pole yards, Walsh said he isnât confident in the safety of potential development there. âI feel like thereâs too much confusion, I donât feel like thereâs enough transparency and I feel like â¦ thereâs too much risk involved for it to be this confusing and non-transparent,â Walsh said. Itâs not just residents. Nearby businesses are concerned that any development in the area leading to more traffic would not just affect their operations, but increase safety risks near the railroad. Local health officials are concerned, too. The Gallatin City-County Board of Health Environmental Health Subcommittee submitted public comment about the proposal stating concerns over the safety of the pole yards. Even the planning board, when voting to affirm that the urban renewal plan matched with the cityâs growth policy, cautioned the city commission to consider whether the plan was being pushed forward too quickly, and how it would impact nearby businesses. Some of the concern centers on the potential that housing could be built on the property. Though most of the site is no longer on the Superfund list, it still is subject to âinstitutional controlsâ from the EPA, which are written into the deed and restrict or prevent different uses on the property. In 2017, the institutional controls were changed to allow for residential use on a portion of the site, which Campbell said only applied to the property Idaho Pole Co. owns north of I-90. While institutional controls still restrict use on the site, a recent five-year report from the EPA indicated mixed-use, with commercial on the ground floors and residential on upper floors, would limit direct soil exposure to little or none. Roger Hoogerheide, the EPAâs remedial project manager for Idaho Pole, said direct contact with soil is âthe primary exposure pathway.â Residential zoning that would allow for homes with yards, Hoogerheide said, is âassociated with much more soil exposure via ingestion, skin contact and inhalation,â Hoogerheide said. âIn a mixed-use residential scenario, the lack of a yard would prevent homeowners coming into more contact with the soil,â Hoogerheide said. Though a concept plan submitted to the city earlier this year laid out loose plans for a mixed-use development with residential on upper floors, Justin Alexander, a principal architect working on the project, said the potential buyers have scrapped those plans and are looking to head in a more industrial direction. The main part of the property between the railroad and I-90 is currently zoned for manufacturing and industrial uses. âI think the developers, they feel that it would be best to do something that more aligns with the (zoning), more aligns with really the environmental aspects of the site,â Alexander said. âTheyâre really looking to do something that really helps out the city of Bozeman. I do believe that.â But, with the lack of city utilities like water and sewer lines, any development there faces an uphill battle. There are traffic problems, too. The property is already fairly cut off from the rest of the city, and the street-level railroad crossing only complicates things. Among the many potential uses of the tax increment funds included in the urban renewal plan is a suggestion to create an overpass over the railroad from East Oak and Birch streets, and to promote investment in the rail spur and other related facilities. Though city officials have said the urban renewal efforts could improve transportation issues in the area, nearby businesses are concerned what impact increased traffic associated with development at the pole yard will have on their operations. Anthony Tangaro, the general manager of Empire Building Materials in Bozeman, said he disagrees that development there could necessarily improve the rail spur. âWhat I know about the rail spur, (is) any increase in the number of human beings near the railroad dock and tracks is just a safety issue,â Tangaro said. In the few years Campbell has been representing Idaho Pole, he said a handful of groups have expressed interest. The lack of utilities has always been the deal breaker. âThe environmental (aspect) is not the problem; itâs the infrastructure,â Campbell said. Still, many are concerned about what exactly is still in that soil. In written public comment to the city commission, the Gallatin City-County Board of Health Environmental Health Subcommittee said while they are not wholly opposed to development there, ânumerous questions remain about the status of contaminants on the site.â The subcommittee wrote they are concerned with groundwater contamination and how digging deep in the ground to put in sewer and water lines would impact the spread of contaminants. Hoogerheide said if development would involve âdeeper disturbance of sub surface soils,â than what has been recently tested, the EPA would require additional sampling. The recent five-year review released by the EPA stated that while the soil clean-up is going to plan, the groundwater remedy is not functioning as intended. According to the report, residual soil and groundwater contamination continue to impact groundwater in some areas. Three wells have shown elevated concentrations of pentachlorophenol since 2017, though the report states PCP concentrations are declining in general. Hoogerheide said residual contamination refers to chemical compounds in soil and groundwater that remediation efforts cannot address. âResidual contaminants can be found at sites with underground soil and groundwater concerns such as the Idaho Pole Company site,â Hoogerheide said. âWhile remediation cannot remove all residual compounds, we rely on monitoring to ensure contaminants are being reduced and risks are adequately characterized and managed according to site cleanup goals.â Hoogerheide said more wells were installed in October. Though the soil remediation is'}]"

The Great American Outdoors Act was hailed as the most significant conservation legislation enacted in nearly half a century. ""For more than 50 years Congress has struggled to fund land and water conservation, leading to a never ending backlog of maintenance and other critical needs in our parks and public lands that I\'ve been hearing about for years,"" Trump said at the bill signing in the East Room of the White House. The bill was led in the Senate by Republican Sen. Steve Daines of Montana and fellow GOP Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado. They are among the Senateâs most vulnerable incumbents, and each represents a state where the outdoor economy and tourism at sites such as Rocky Mountain and Yellowstone national parks play an outsize role. Daines and Gardner persuaded the president to support the bill at a White House meeting this year, even though Trump has repeatedly tried to slash spending for the Land and Water Conservation Fund in his budget proposals. Trump soon tweeted his support for the bill, saying it âwill be HISTORIC for our beautiful public lands.â³ ""Today we are making the most significant investment in our parks since the administration of the legendary conservationist President Theodore Roosevelt,"" Trump said Tuesday, adding the ""landmark legislation would not have been possible without the incredible leadership and hard work"" of Daines and Gardner. ""This is a great day for Montana, this is a great day for America and this is a great day for conservation and those of us who love the great outdoors,"" Daines said, calling it the greatest achievement in 50 years for conservation. ""Perhaps it is only fitting it took public land to bring a divided government together,"" he said. Gardner said the act will ""truly protect and provide opportunities for all Americans to enjoy the wonders"" of this country. He said this act will stop Congress from ""stealing"" the money it has done for decades and put it back into national parks. ""I know you will the spend the money very wisely ..."" Trump said. ""Because if you spend it wisely you will be able to do five times more than you even think."" The bill will spend about $900 million a year â double current spending â on the popular Land and Water Conservation Fund, and another $1.9 billion per year on improvements at national parks, forests, wildlife refuges and rangelands. Sen. Jon Tester, D- Mont., said Tuesday the signing of the bill ended his years-long push for full, mandatory funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. âThis is a big deal for the Treasure Stateâs greatest treasure â our public lands,â Tester said. âWe rely on our public lands, and protecting them means protecting not only the outdoor spaces where folks hike, hunt, fish, and camp, but also the 70,000 jobs and $7.1 billion generated each year by Montanaâs outdoor recreation economy."" Supporters say the legislation will create at least 100,000 jobs, while restoring national parks and repairing trails and forest systems. Opponents counter that the money isn\'t enough to cover the estimated $20 billion maintenance backlog on federally owned lands. The park maintenance backlog has been a problem for decades, through Republican and Democratic administrations. The House and the Senate cleared both bills by overwhelming bipartisan margins this summer. Rep. Greg Gianforte, R-Mont., voted for the measure as well. âThe Great American Outdoors Act, which I proudly supported, provides dedicated, lasting resources to increase public access to our public lands, conserving them for generations to come,â Gianforte said in an email, thanking Daines and Trump. Ivanka Trump, the Republican president\'s daughter and adviser, also supported the legislation. ""This is a day for great celebration,"" she said. ""This is an extraordinary piece of legislation that will be a great legacy for this administration and most importantly, the country."" She said the natural beauty and majesty of parks and public land are now more valuable than ever, especially during the current pandemic, as these areas offer respite for many. Several groups praised the act\'s passage. Backcountry Hunters & Anglers President Land Tawney thanked elected officials, but also credited grassroots sportsmen and women. âToday we unite in celebration of our public lands and waters,â Tawney said in an email. âSuccess has many fathers and mothers, and without the dedicated, unwavering support of so many â ranging from rank-and-file hunters and anglers, outdoor recreationists and business owners to members of Congress and the president â we would never have achieved this hard-won victory."" Daines, who is running for re-election against Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock, spoke with reporters after the bill was signed. He dismissed criticism from Montana Democrats who called the bill signing ""an election-year gift now that his reelection hangs in the balance."" ""It\'s not about politics for me,"" Daines said. ""Montanans love the outdoors."" He said he grew up hunting and fishing and said fighting for public land in Montana is something he has done since he has served in Congress. He said he has been ranked as one of the most effective and bipartisan members of Congress. ""This is another example of actually getting it done,"" Daines said. He said it was refreshing to see something move forward without the typical partisan bickering. Daines said he was looking forward to the deferred maintenance projects being done at Yellowstone and Glacier national parks. He said the Land and Water Conservation Funds would be of big benefit to Montana as well. Trump failed to give Democrats any credit for their role in helping to pass the measure on Tuesday. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said it was because Democrats and Republicans â including the administration â have yet to agree on extending now-expired coronavirus relief payments and protections.

Creatures, a story of the smallpox pandemic that decimated Native American tribes across the Western American territories, is currently being filmed on the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana, with shooting scheduled to wrap during the second week of August for a winter 2020 international theatrical and streaming release. Creatures is a powerful reminder that what we are coping with as a world, is truly ancient history. Creatures is developed in cooperation with the Blackfeet Tribe of Montana, with a full cast of Indigenous actors and several Blackfeet producers and crew members. The story is told through the adventures of several youths from warring tribes who wrestle with the spread of the disease and the introduction of the horse, called âCreatures,â that hold the promise of power. âOur film follows the story of one Blackfeet man and his response to the same kind of issues that we, as a unified American people, are addressing today: how do you collectively manage a mysterious and deadly pathogen that rapidly spreads from person to person? The Blackfeet Nation has kept these stories alive for generations, and now we are sharing them with the rest of the world. If there is one lesson that our past holds for this future generation, itâs that fear is the deadliest weapon of all. Conquer that, and logic will save you,â says Pat âJudgeâ Hall, Producer and Locations and Wrangler for Creatures. Smallpox was brought to the New World by the Spaniards and was later spread from tribe to tribe, as a deadly bioweapon. The disease was responsible for decimating entire tribes from the planet. It is estimated that over two thirds of the Blackfeet Tribe alone were killed in the first wave. The course of the disease vector across the Great Plains was accompanied by the proliferation of horses, called âelk-dogs,â also imported by the Spanish, and came to represent a powerful weapon in the fight to conquer enemies and gain territory. The profound impact of the horse and its nascent relationship with the Blackfeet is a powerful metaphor woven through the tapestry of this gritty, personalized slice of Native American history. Creatures is produced by KK Productions and is directed by Kristian Kery. It features a completely Native American cast and is shot on the Blackfeet Reservation. Log In Keep it Clean.

It could mean a reduction of about 952 full-time-equivalent staff across the Park Service. Quantified another way, parks that rely on seasonal employees could lose three four-month employees during peak season, Garder said. The proposed budget continues a trend of cuts to the National Park Service budget. Since 2011, parks nationwide have reduced staff by 16 percent. Over the same span, visitation to national parks has increased 17 percent, Garder said. Yellowstone has lost 4 percent of its staff, while Grand Teton National Park has lost 10 percent in that same period, Garder said. Garder said he did not have numbers for Glacier National Park. Trumpâs new budget would amount to a 7 percent loss to the operating budget of each park in the system, Garder said. âGiven record increases in visitation at those parks, itâs clear that that is insulting to the park superintendents, the rangers who steward our parks, and the gateway communities that rely on them for our economic well-being,â Garder said.
