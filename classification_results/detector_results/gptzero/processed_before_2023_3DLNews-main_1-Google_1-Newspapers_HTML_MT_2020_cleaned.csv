(Photo submitted) Feb. 6, Brandon Ler announced his candidacy for House District 35, which encompasses Richland County. The Lincoln-Reagan Day annual event had a crowd of local Republicans who gathered to hear both local and statewide candidates for office. More than a dozen candidates were each given three to ten minutes to speak to the room of voters and present their credentials and qualifications for office. Brandon Ler, a native of Richland County, filed for office several weeks ago but waited until the Lincoln-Reagan Day banquet to provide his first public comments. He has chosen Shandon Erickson as his campaign treasurer. Ler is married to Stephanie, who works for the Richland County Health Department, and they have two children. His public service includes election to the Savage School Board and he also serves on the Savage Volunteer Fire Department. Ler, who holds the vice chairman position on the Richland County Republican Central Committee, owns Double L Fencing, runs cattle, and has experience in the oilfield as a pumper. Ler\'s speech revolved around the theme of fencing, which he wove into a commentary on government. ""I\'ve learned a thing or two hanging fence,"" Ler said. ""Good fences make good neighbors...barbed wire symbolizes the heart of the old West. It\'s not about keeping you out, but it\'s about keeping what\'s yours in. Keeping your fence up protects your property and your neighbor\'s property."" He continued, ""We got fences in politics, too. A good man ought to respect the property of another man.

Entitlements like Medicaid Expansion shouldn\'t be done just because it\'s good for the few; there are principles at stake and one of them is a representative ought to vote the way the county believes, and we voted against it."" Ler\'s comments refer to incumbent Joel Krautter\'s vote for Medicaid Expansion, which the county overwhelmingly voted against on a ballot initiative prior to the vote at the capitol. Ler went on, ""A fellow shouldn\'t be afraid to say what party they belong to, and a fellow shouldn\'t be afraid to act like it. I\'m not a conservative because I\'m a Republican.

I believe I have the support of most or all of the legislators around Richland County in neighboring districts and Republicans in the state party who want a conservative in there they can count on.""

September 8, 2020 by Michael Howell Marcus Daly Memorial Hospital has teamed up with Inland Imaging and Dr. Jason Roth to help boost its radiological services. The new arrangement has already greatly enhanced the speed and accuracy with which CT scans can be read and analyzed and will soon be providing a new service as Dr. Roth adds CT scan guided surgery to the hospital’s steadily growing list of surgical capabilities. Although actually employed by Inland Imaging, Dr. Roth is stationed at Marcus Daly Hospital and has already been on the job for about two months. The company is focused solely on providing radiological services across the region and is led by a non-physician management team, covering most of Washington State and into western Montana. Dr. Roth grew up around Nashville, Tennessee and went to college at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry and Biochemistry. Four years later, in 2006, he earned his Doctor of Medicine degree from the same school and then spent the next year in an internship at Memorial Health University Medical Center in Savannah, Georgia. He did his residency in Radiology from 2007 to 2011 at Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis. Roth said his previous job working with a group of 10 radiologists serving four hospitals kept him extremely busy with a very high volume of work that demanded a lot of weekends and night work. With two children, one four-year old and a two-year old, he said he and his wife realized that their family life was suffering from the over-loaded working situation and his wife started looking around for other jobs and saw this one with Inland Imaging working for Marcus Daly Hospital. He applied and quickly received a job offer, he said. He came up himself to scope out the hospital and the valley and was impressed. His wife came up and checked things out and it was a done deal. Dr. Roth loves his new job. He works five days a week, about eight hours a day, Monday through Friday and has plenty of time to spend with his wife and kids. He also has a lot of help. At his old job, he was required to do a whole lot more. Besides reading CT scans he had to help manage the entire system, including billing and dealing with the complex computer software systems required for the job. “Now I can focus on my real work which is the radiology part,” he said, “and leave the rest to the Inland team.” This is one of the advantages, he said, in working for a company that has all the bases covered by people who know the most about the task at hand. Another great advantage is the number of specialists that are integrated into the process, including but not limited to muscular skeletal surgeons, neurosurgeons, epidemiologists, orthopedic surgeons, OBGYNs, and urologists, all of whom use CT scans or MRIs in some way. “They are used in almost every specialty except pathology,” said Roth. “I’m a general radiologist. I have a very broad view and can generally interpret most images very well.” But when he spots something that may be serious, he said, like a lumpy mass in the brain, he can have the image examined by a specialist in a matter of minutes, not days. And get expert confirmation. This is where the services provided by the Inland group have made a big impact, according to Roth. The technology in play, including a new voice dictation capability, has dramatically accelerated things. In the past, a radiologist would read a scan out loud and tape record it. That tape would then have to be transcribed and sent to a specialist for review. All of that could take several hours or even days so a “preliminary” report was often issued to the patient who could then be left anxiously awaiting the final results for days or even longer. That is no longer the case, according to Roth. With the new voice dictation technology, his reports can be ready for a specialist’s review in a matter of minutes instead of hours. Not only that, all the images that come across his desk from Marcus Daly Hospital patients can be viewed immediately by radiologists working at hospitals in Missoula, Spokane, and even Seattle. He said they all have direct access to everyone else’s work list and the whole thing is actually a group effort. If he is getting overwhelmed with images to examine, but another hospital in the network is up to pace, they can help deal with the high demand. That’s a great relief to Dr. Roth, who can now go home at 5 p.m. knowing that the images he received at the last minute will go right on through the process while he tends to his kids. The process has been accelerated to such an extent, he said, that patients are not thrust into a state of anxiety by receiving any preliminary reports. They get the final report reviewed by a specialist in less time that it used to take to get the preliminary report. In critical cases that can be in 30 minutes and in other urgent cases, maybe two hours. Other less urgent cases can generally be turned around within 19 hours. Roth said that the imaging company’s interaction with the medical providers and other staff at Marcus Daly was a step above what he was seeing in very much larger hospitals in the south. He was also impressed by the level of the technology and equipment here which also outstrips what was available in some of the larger hospitals that he worked in previously. Drew Hayward, Director of Imaging at Marcus Daly Hospital, said that the hospital staff was happy to have Dr. Roth and Inland Imaging as part of their team. He said the hospital was employing an after-hours reading service that wasn’t really meeting the hospital’s needs and this seemed like a good solution. He said that the imaging company has leveraged improvements to the system such as voice dictation that are real game changers and made reporting times much faster. Hayward said that the hospital has been storing images with Inland Imaging for about three years already so not all of the process is new to the hospital staff. As for the new part, “It means a little more work for hospital staff in filling out forms but they appreciate the service,” said Hayward. Sheila Gager, a Radiologic Technologist at Marcus Daly and part of the imaging team, is quite enthusiastic about the developments. She worked for Inland Imaging in Missoula before coming to Marcus Daly two years ago. “It’s a great team to work with,” said Gager. “We’ve got each other’s backs. It’s a well-rounded group and they are very supportive of each other and take care of each other.” Gager said it was not her first stint at Marcus Daly Memorial Hospital. She said she worked here about 20 years ago. “The difference is like night and day,” she said. She said the equipment that the hospital has accumulated in the meantime is astounding. She is especially enamored with the new CT scanner and its potential for guiding surgical procedures. She said Marcus Daly Hospital was an excellent place to work and it was just getting better all the time. Filed Under: News Alcoholics Anonymous is open to all who have a desire to stop drinking.

newsletter. Ding Kuen Tam, also known as Danny Wong, was featured here in a 1980 interview. He gave an interview about how it took him 16 years to get permission to bring his parents to the United States from Guangzhou, China. The Pekin Noodle Parlor is the oldest family-owned Chinese restaurant in the United States serving Butte for over 110 years. The restaurant was recently nominated for the 2020 James Beard Outstanding Hospitality Award. Ding Kuen Tam (Danny Wong) is seated here (second from the left) with his brothers, Ding Cheong Tam and Ding Hung Tam. The man in the tie is the brothers' grandfather, Kwong Yee Tam. Ding Kuen Tam, owner of the renowned Pekin Noodle Parlor, died at 86 on Monday. He was better known to the Butte community as Danny Wong, and better known still as a Butte icon. Wong leaves a legacy of historic consequence — he ran the Pekin in Butte since he inherited the restaurant from his great-grandfather in the 1950s. The Pekin is regarded as the oldest family-run Chinese restaurant in America. Wong was born Oct. 12, 1934, in Guangzhou, China. As a child, he fled the Japanese invasion of China before World War II, before making an unforgettable impact on the history and people of Butte. But somehow that tremendous legacy of success and personal triumph is overshadowed by the memory of his pure kindness. And those who knew him best would say, that’s the greatest memory any man — an icon or otherwise — could leave behind. “He was the kindest man that anybody ever knew,” said Wong’s son, Jerry Tam. “His kindness stemmed from having a restaurant that served the mouths of the community. Anybody that wanted a meal, he would offer it to them, whether you had a penny or a dollar. He would make sure you didn’t walk away hungry.” A waitress at Pekin for 11 years, Kate Holland Sheehan adored Wong. “He gave to so many causes, whether it be to a school, a political campaign or fundraiser,” said Sheehan. “I can’t tell you how many meals he gave out for free, too.” Wong went to great lengths to make people happy, especially when it was needed most. “It was his favorite thing to do,” Tam said. “When anyone passed, that’s what he was known for. He would load up his Jeep Wagoneer with the most food anybody could possibly eat and drop if off personally and say, here you go, here’s food during your time of celebration of life.” “And now it’s his turn,” Tam said. “Everyone’s returning the favor.” The phone calls flooded in from friends and political figures like former U.S. Sen. Max Baucus, Kim Krueger, who was Baucus’ Butte District field director, and Montana Lt. Gov. Mike Cooney. Krueger came to Butte to work for Baucus in the ’80s with the city under economic crisis after the mine closed. Wong became one of her first friends in town, and then one of her finest. It wasn’t just his kindness toward her, but to all, that struck Krueger the first time she climbed the steep stairs to the Pekin. “He served miners as well as U.S. senators in the same manner,” she said. “He just loved Butte and all of its citizens. We’re definitely going to miss him.” Holding back emotion, Krueger remembered Wong as a truly compassionate gentleman, who treated everyone like a king or queen. “I just became very touched. And grew to love him as a friend, as a person, as a community leader. I’m ready to cry,” she said. Working tables at the Pekin’s famous booths, Sheehan learned Wong had a knack for remembering a face, even if he hadn’t seen a person in years. He would know exactly what someone would want to order, so menus were never needed. Cooney said that attention to detail extended to a person’s family. “He would always ask about my mother and how she was doing,” Cooney said, remembering when his mother was getting older and could no longer make it up to the restaurant. “Danny would say, ‘Mike, don’t worry about it. You just call me and I’ll bring the food to your mom.’ ” Raised in Butte and a lifelong visitor to the Pekin, Cooney said it was never just about history and food — though there’s always plenty of food. People came to talk to Wong, and Wong lived to talk to them. “Frankly he was always at the restaurant. I’d walk back to the kitchen and find him working over a stove, in a fairly crowded kitchen, working his tail off. But he would always take the time to talk to you,” Cooney said. “He’d make you feel like you were the most important person in the world, and then feed you an incredible meal. He always made you feel like you were the last customer he was going to have.” Baucus described the experience as a whirlwind of too much food and sometimes too much drink, all swirling around Wong’s famous smile. “I can’t think of anybody that’s made a stronger impression on me than Danny Wong,” Baucus said. “He’s one of a kind.” Wong was a legendary talker, and nobody knows it better than his son. “It took hours to go anywhere,” Tam said. “From his painters to friends, politicians, doctors, he would stand and talk to them for hours. My dad was just kind of the epicenter of it all.” “Your kid’s going to college? What college is he going to? I know someone at Columbia. I give him a call,” Wong would say, and reach for the phone. Or, “You want to go into politics? I’ll call my friend Max Baucus,” Wong would say, and then literally fetch the number and call Baucus on the spot. When Tam’s friend Randy Walker told Wong he was a 49ers fan, Wong said, “I know a guy, I call him.” And Walker sailed to a 49ers game with a VIP ticket in a limo, just like that. It all happened in the Pekin. “My dad was always able to find a way to make a connection — for someone to talk to, or for people to advance themselves in the world,” Tam said. With his genuine generosity, Wong advanced incredible friendships. Perhaps none is more iconic than the one between Wong and Butte legend Evel Knievel. Knievel was “Bobby” to Wong. Whenever Knievel pulled his Maserati into the Pekin alleyway, Wong would give him a box full of food and a bottle of Jack Daniels, whether he drank it or not. “Danny, I’m gonna jump Caesars Palace,” Knievel would say. “Bobby, I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Wong would answer. “I’m gonna jump the Snake River,” Knievel would say. “Bobby, I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Wong would answer again. Such was their bond. Knievel even gave Wong his last car, a Lincoln Mark VIII. Perhaps the greatest legend to emerge from their lifetime of friendship? They both died on the same day, at about the same time, 13 years apart. Many of Wong’s best friends, and his wife, Sharon Tam, passed before him. Among many others who define Butte, the late Pat Shea and Mike Mansfield counted themselves as Wong’s customers second, and his friends first. Wong will be personally honored in Butte homes for an extraordinary dedication to the family business and the community who enjoyed it, and his restaurant continues to capture accolades from the nation. The Pekin recently was a prestigious James Beard Foundation semifinalist for Outstanding Hospitality and was showcased in New York at the Museum of Food and Drink Exhibition called CHOW: The Making of an American Chinese Restaurant. The restaurant will also be featured in 2021 at Chicago’s Chinese Heritage Museum. Throughout his life, Wong educated the Butte community on Chinese culture, and kept his restaurant largely unchanged. The simple trick allowed the Pekin to transcend time. “His restaurant is an integral part of Butte’s history,” said Butte-Silver Bow Chief Executive Dave Palmer, “and the same could be said of Danny.” Wong spent every day making people smile, and for no other reason than that it was his honor and delight to do so. He treated his staff the way they deserved to be treated. Both Sheehan and long-time waitress Arlene Breyer called Wong the best boss ever.

simple. It’s a crust of some sort filled with literally whatever you want. It should come as no surprise, then, that the history of pie stretches back thousands of years. This pastry’s flexibility has allowed it to adapt to different times, different cultures and, above all, different tastes. Modern pie means different things to different people. It’s a symbol of Americana, it’s a staple of the holidays, it’s a savory pub meal and it’s a thing to throw in a clown’s face. Exploring the pastry’s past bounces you around the world and shows the enduring power of dough-wrapped food. The world’s first pie Deciding where the history of pie starts will test your understanding of what a “pie” is. Many historians trace it all the way back to the ancient Egyptians, who had a kind of pastry made from grains like wheat or oats, but this is more like a galette — a pan-less, looser-form pastry — which arguably isn’t very pie-like. These early “pies,” especially those eaten by Egyptian sailors for nourishment on their journeys, are more like an early version of biscuits or hardtack. The award for earliest pie, then, might just go to the Sumerians, because a tablet with the recipe for a chicken pie was discovered on a tablet dating back to around 2000 BCE. Nothing else is really known about this pie, though, and it still didn’t resemble the modern pastry we know. Then there’s the Greeks, who some historians also credit with “inventing” pie. The Greeks took Egyptian recipes and enhanced them with pastry, making the whole thing less bread-like and more pielike. There’s not a huge amount of writing about Greek pies, but in the fifth century BCE plays of Aristophanes, there are allusions to pastries filled with fruit. The Romans have a greater written record, so more is known of their baking exploits. Their writings also reveal the early division between sweet and savory pies, which is a split that has carried through to modern pastry-making. On the savory end, the first meat-based pies were not intended to be eaten as pies at all. Romans would use dough as a way to encase meat and to keep it from drying. It wouldn’t be until pies traveled outside the Roman Empire that meat pies took over the world of stuffed pastry. The Romans did eat sweet pies whole, and these were probably more similar to modern pies than anything mentioned so far. The earliest Roman recipe for this foodstuff, published in roughly 160 BCE, involved a rye crust, goat cheese and honey. It’s not a pie you’re likely to encounter in a modern bakery, but all the components were there for the subsequent rise of this food. The spread of pies Because of their subsequent conquest of most of the European continent, Romans have had an outsized impact on the West. Much like the Latin language spread across the landmass, so too did the pies. Because of the pie’s mutable form, any country could make a pie by putting its local foods — meat, nuts, fruit of whatever variety — into a crust. The biggest change that occurred at this point in the history of pie had to do with the crust. One of the distinguishing features of pie crust is that, unlike bread, it needs to be made with some kind of fat. In Rome and other parts of southern Europe, the fat of choice was olive oil, which limits how easily the crust can be shaped. In northern Europe, the cold climates kept olives from being grown, and so other fats were used, like lard or butter. This brought us one step closer to the modern pie, which also usually use one of those ingredients to form the crust. The best pies in London While pies did spread all across Europe, England likely had the biggest influence on the history of pie. It’s also where the pastry finally got the name “pie” (or “pye”) sometime before the 14th century, though no one is quite sure where the word came from. The best guess is that it’s connected to the magpie, which is a bird known for collecting objects to line its nest. The idea was that just as the bird collects things, a baker collects things to put into a pie. English and pies are especially intertwined because not every language has a separate word for “pie.” Most languages tend to call pies words that look more like “tart” (like the Dutch taart and the Portuguese torta) or “pastry” (like the Spanish pastel or the German Pastete). That doesn’t mean there aren’t pies in other places but does imply that it was a more defined category in England than in other places. By the 12th century CE, pies were a commonplace dish in England, but they were still often seen as a way to keep meat fresh for longer periods of time. And it stayed that way for a while. By the middle of the 16th century, a pie crust would be called a coffyn, which — despite sounding funerary — means “basket.” And these baskets could be so thick that the pies were more crust than filling. While the written record supports the idea that pie crusts were not meant to be eaten at this point in history, Janet Clarkson — author of Pie: A Global History — argues that it may have been a matter of class. While the English nobility may have been okay with throwing the dough that encased their preserved meats into the garbage, the lower classes wouldn’t have tossed out something edible so flippantly. Medieval serfs weren’t exactly rolling in food, after all. The consumption of the crusts may have gone from the lower classes on up, then. And by the time it reached the upper classes, chefs had figured out how to create delectable pies from the inside out. By the 16th century, pies made a slight turn from the savory to the sweet. Though custard pies had existed for a while, fruit pies took a while to catch on. The first cherry pie ever made was notably served to Queen Elizabeth I, though no one knows how she reacted to it. In any case, it was a golden age for pie experimentation. And the chefs didn’t let their ingeniousness end with just flavor; many went for presentation. You may have heard a popular old nursery rhyme called “Sing a Song of Sixpence,” which includes the lines “Four and twenty blackbirds, / Baked in a pie.” While this might sound like a pie filled with bird meat, it is in fact a reference to a practice of putting live birds into a pie that would fly up and out when the pastry was uncovered (in this case, the pie would be massive). And it didn’t stop at birds: chefs would use anything and anyone to provide entertainment to the upper classes. In the 17th century, a young boy with dwarfism (who would grow up to be a popular entertainer) was placed in a pie to surprise English King Charles I and his wife. And who wouldn’t be surprised by a small human bursting out of their food? As American as apple pie When the English created their new colonies in the Americas, they brought pie with them. These early pastries would have been very similar to the pies back in England, but it didn’t take long for them to start creating new recipes from the locally available crops.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 2:37 pm On July 3, the Press & Journal, a weekly newspaper in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, produced its last issue after 166 years of local publication. The Independent-Enterprise in Payette, Idaho, shut down June 24. The New Sharon (Iowa) Sun closed June 18. The Merkel (Texas) Mail ended its 130-year run on May 27. The list goes on. One casualty of COVID-19 has been the accelerated carnage of newspapers across America. Publishing businesses that were, in many cases, already shaky have been ravaged by a decline in advertising from other local institutions affected by the pandemic. Just one Montana news organization, the online Havre Herald, has closed as a result of COVID., but journalists and other staff have been furloughed at all the state’s dailies. Along the Hi-Line, the Cut Bank Pioneer Press, Glacier Reporter, Shelby Promoter, and Valerian have, at least for now, merged into a single weekly edition. Media followers know that this is nothing new, of course: The decline of newspapers at the hands of the Internet and changing audience tastes has been playing out for two decades. Those who fault journalism for sensationalism and lack of trustworthiness, among other sins, may say: Good riddance. But there’s ample evidence that independent news actually is critical to democracy, and that the loss of 1,800 print outlets since 2004 (according to data in the Newspaper Research Journal) weakens citizenship and civic function. A 2015 study in the Journal of Politics, for example, found that people in places with less news coverage were less likely to vote and share opinions about political candidates. A study in 2014 described a correlation between newspaper closures and lower civic engagement. Intriguingly, a working paper published in 2018 posits that municipal borrowing costs were higher in communities where newspapers had stopped publishing – perhaps because there was less scrutiny of public projects. If you believe in the importance of newspapers to civil society, you should be heartened by The Local Journalism Sustainability Act. The bipartisan bill, introduced on July 16 by U.S. Representatives Ann Kirkpatrick, (D-Arizona) and Dan Newhouse, (R-Washington, provides for tax credits for subscribing to local newspapers, payroll credits for publishers who employ local journalists, and credits for businesses and others that advertise in local newspapers and local media. Here are the details of what the legislation would allow: •Credit for advertising in local newspapers and local media. Businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees would be eligible for a five-year non-refundable tax credit to spend on advertising in local newspapers or local radio or television stations. The credit, up to $5,000 in the first year and $2,500 in each of the next four years, would cover 80% of advertising costs in the first year and 50% annually thereafter. This provision helps local businesses as well as local media companies. •Credit for local newspaper subscriptions. The act provides for a non-refundable tax credit of up to $250 per year to help cover the costs of subscriptions to local newspapers, in print or digital form, that primarily produce content related to news and current events. The credit would cover 80% of subscription costs in the first year, and 50% thereafter and helps consumers while incentivizing support of local news organizations. •Payroll credit for journalists. This five-year refundable tax credit could be used by local newspapers on compensation of its journalists up to $50,000 a year. The credit would cover 50% of compensation, up to $50,000, in the first year and 30% of compensation, up to $50,000, in each of the subsequent four years. This provision will go a long way toward ensuring that communities keep their local news coverage. As a newspaper publisher myself, I am obviously self-interested — but I believe that this is a thoughtful and far-sighted bill that merits support. I’m especially pleased by the proposed credit for newspaper subscribers, which could help rebuild the muscle among Americans for reading, listening to, and watching the news — and supporting those who produce it — as an elemental act of citizenship. The Local Journalism Sustainability Act would not be a panacea. Many newspapers have been painfully slow to respond to the challenges posed by the Internet and social media; we still have to figure out how get to a business model that’s sustainable. We also must provide responsible, fact-based journalism that earns our communities’ trust and financial support by telling the whole story — covering diverse experiences that reflect the entirety of their communities, and reporting on what’s working in a community, which is as true and as important as what fails. Quality journalism is, I believe, at the heart of the only viable, long-term fix for newspapers. But the Local Journalism Sustainability Act could help give publishers some breathing room in an especially challenging moment. I ask U.S. Senators Steve Daines and Jon Tester, and Representative Greg Gianforte, to lend their backing to this important measure. Log In Keep it Clean.

W winds at 20 to 30 mph, decreasing to 10 to 15 mph. Chance of rain 30%. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:35 pm Seventh grader Ashlyn Brown has plenty of hardware to show for her spelling prowess. She is a three-time Glacier County Spelling Bee champion and it seems good spelling habits run in the family. Her younger brother, Ethan, finished in the top five at last week’s event. Seven of the Top 10 finishers were from Cut Bank schools. In the Glacier County Spelling Bee, the judge asks the contestant to spell the word, advantageous. The contestant repeats the word, spells it and repeats it again. If the contestant spells it correctly, they live to spell again in the next round. Ashlyn Brown knows how spelling bees work and she has gotten pretty proficient at them, having made it to the final round in the last three Glacier County Spelling Bees. And three years in a row she came home the champion. Her last victory came a week ago, Monday, Feb. 24,when the Glacier County Spelling Bee was held here in Cut Bank at the Cut Bank High School Auditorium. Her first-place finish sends her off to the State Spelling Bee, which will be held in Bozeman on March 14 at the Montana State University campus. There her competition is 64 other students all vying for that first-place trophy. “I have gone to the Treasure State Spelling Bee three times,” Ashlyn said. “I didn’t go very far my first year at state. My second year, I got into the top 15. I’m looking to place this year.” Ashlyn, the daughter of Aaron and Rachel Brown and a seventh grader at Cut Bank Middle School, was not the only Cut Bank student to do well in the Glacier County Bee. There were seven students from Cut Bank that placed in the top 10. Pretty impressive! Ashlyn was first at the spelling bee and following her in second place was Blake Seifert, Gracie Edwards in fourth place, Ethan Brown in fifth place, Elyse Bengston in sixth, Kylee Arensmeyer in seventh and in eighth place was Wysper HeadCarrier. The kids all agree that spelling bees are fun to participate in. They also pose a challenge to these young students and that is something else they enjoy. Blake Seifert, the son of Tom and Jamie Seifert, and a fifth grader at Anna Jeffries Elementary School said, “I think competing is fun.” Blake prepares for the bees by having his “mom quiz me on the words and Mrs. Claybourn helped” him too. This was Blake’s first county spelling bee. However, he did participate in the Anna Jeffries Spelling bee and took first place at that event. Gracie Edwards, the daughter of Mia Edwards and also a fifth grader at Anna Jeffries Elementary School likes spelling bees because “you get to do challenging things,” she said. She gets help from her mom when getting ready for a bee. “My mom says the words then I spell them.” This county bee was Gracie’s second spelling bee. Ethan Brown is the brother to Ashlyn and a fifth grader at Anna Jeffries Elementary School. This county bee was his first big spelling bee. “I think the most fun part about the spelling bee is all the tension about being in the top ten and getting to stand in front of the crowd,” he shared. Ethan gets ready for the spelling bee by practicing “with my friends. We go back and forth with studying our words and we did it like a competition,” he said. Elyse Bengston is a fifth grader at Anna Jeffries Elementary School and the daughter of Andrea Bengston. This was her second time participating in a spelling bee. “The spelling bee is fun because it is challenging,” she said. “When we know we will be in the spelling bee we get a big packet of words to study. I usually study at home by having my mom say the word to me, then I spell it.” The Glacier County Spelling Bee champ, Ashlyn, also has help studying her words, thanks to her parents and her teachers. “But I usually study by myself, whenever I get the chance,” she shared. “I glance through the words in the packet, then find the pronunciations for the harder words. I know it’s not the best study habit, but I usually really study the week before the spelling bee.” She added, “The spelling bee is fun because I like to see how far I can go each year. It’s fun to challenge myself with the words for the state spelling bee.” Rachel Brown is mom to both Ashlyn and Ethan and she is also a teacher in the Cut Bank School system, teaching middle school and high school Family and Consumer Sciences. She understands the value of kids knowing how to spell. “Spelling is an important foundational skill for kids. It helps with writing, communication and comprehension,” she said. Rachel believes part of what makes her kids good spellers is that they are good readers and good writers. “I firmly believe that having a reading background is key to their spelling success. Both of our kids love to write as well. Spelling is a key element of reading and writing.” Her children were read to from a very early age and she stands by the fact that if kids are read to early, they will not only love to read as well, but will have a much better understanding of the words and that ultimately leads to them being good spellers. “We love books in this family,” she said. “I am a firm believer in the power of books and how important they are in the lives of kids.” As parents, Rachel said she and her husband Aaron are both willing to help their kids study for the spelling bees. But “these two are both really self-motivated when it comes to the spelling bees and school. I never really worry about homework or studying with Ashlyn and Ethan. They know what they have to do and they take it upon themselves to study and do their work.” She added, “Before this year’s spelling bee, both of the kids would go off on their own and study their word lists. Neither Aaron nor I told them to go study, they just went and did it on their own. Ethan did ask us to quiz him a few times on the words, but that was it.” Good habits taught early does indeed go a long way and the proof is the Brown family having two kids in the top 10 at this year’s spelling bee. Rachel also believes the teachers in Cut Bank play a vital role for not just their kids, but for every student in the school system. “We are lucky in Cut Bank to have so many wonderful teachers. I have witnessed staff and teachers from our schools going above and beyond to help support and care for our kids. I have seen my kids’ teachers show up to support my kids at activities outside of the school realm. That speaks a lot to me about how much these people truly care for the kids in this school and their classroom. That care translates to successful kids,” she explained. Log In Keep it Clean.

W winds at 20 to 30 mph, decreasing to 10 to 15 mph. Chance of rain 30%. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:35 pm Incumbent Supreme Court Justice Laurie McKinnon is being challenged by Mike Black, a Helena-based attorney, in this year’s lone contested Supreme Court race. Eight months ago, Laurie McKinnon wasn’t sure she’d be running for re-election to Montana’s Supreme Court. Now, as the Nov. 3 election looms, she’s facing competition from Mike Black, a Helena-based attorney. Justice McKinnon grew up in Maryland, earning a law degree from the University of Baltimore. She’s lived and raised her three children in Montana since 1995, and worked as a deputy county attorney for Teton County and a special county attorney for Glacier County for 10 years. In 2006, she was elected as a local district judge, serving for six years before winning a seat on Montana’s Supreme Court. At the 2020 campaign’s start, McKinnon decided not to seek reelection, in part because her husband had recently taken a job with a North Carolina health clinic. Now he’s back in Montana, where the two plan to remain. “Being a judge is a privilege,” McKinnon said, “and I’ve enjoyed it very much.” Black was born in Havre, Montana, and earned a bachelor’s degree at the University of Montana. He received his law degree from New York’s Cornell University and returned to Montana, working as a partner at two firms before starting his own. He was litigation director for the Montana Legal Services Association, which represents low-income Montanans. He has also been an assistant attorney general under AGs Steve Bullock and Tim Fox. “I have an experience growing up in Montana, and being a historian by nature helps to understand things like the 1972 Montana Constitution with a little bit of context,” he said. Montana’s nonpartisan Supreme Court elections are often-overlooked races. Rules of judicial ethics prevent candidates from talking about existing or pending cases, so experience, past decisions and associations are important. In June’s three-way primary to determine November’s candidates, McKinnon won 53% of the votes while Black finished second with 30%. McKinnon said her experience on the high court is why voters should give her another term. She said serving as a district judge and justice gives her an advantage over Black, who has no judicial experience. But Black argued his experience in Montana courts qualified him for the race,and criticized McKinnon’s consistency and her readings of Montana constitutional protections in areas like public access. He cited a 2018 McKinnon dissent in an easement case that would have prevented the state from acquiring land on an eastern Montana ranch for conservation purposes. The Montana Land Board had declined to approve the easement, but Gov. Steve Bullock overrode the decision to allow the purchase. In her dissent, McKinnon argued the Land Board should have the final say. She was the lone dissenter. Black also pointed to a 2015 dissent where McKinnon opposed the Court’s majority decision allowing public access to a section of the Ruby River in southwest Montana. McKinnon argued Black did not understand the specifics of the cases in the context they were presented to the Supreme Court. “I would say that Mr. Black probably has not understood the opinion,” McKinnon said. “When somebody accuses a justice of making a political decision, it’s because they don’t understand the process of making that decision.” McKinnon has written for the majority in key cases, as well. In 2018, McKinnon authored the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down a tax credit benefiting private, religious schools in Montana. Conservatives appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court where it was overturned this year, 5-4. McKinnon said she felt the federal court crossed the line into states’ rights in that decision. “I think they were wrong,” she said. “That decision was an interpretation of the Montana Constitution.” McKinnon won her first Supreme Court term in 2012. In that election, a group called the Montana Growth Network, a conservative Political Action Committee headed by Republican state Sen. Jason Priest of Red Lodge, sponsored attack ads critical of McKinnon’s opponent. Critics claimed these ads were funded by “dark money,” or untraceable donations. University of Montana constitutional and elections law professor Anthony Johnstone said then that in judicial races, these independent expenditures can dominate the campaigns. McKinnon, who denounced the ads at the time, said the controversy factored into her initial reluctance to seek reelection this year. She said the ads weren't a reflection of who she is and how she decides cases, adding that it’s been hard to overcome claims to the contrary. “That’s been hard to live with,” she said, “because (the attack ads were) not an accurate statement about who I was, as a person. I didn’t want to go through it again. I wanted to run another term, but I didn’t want to take the personal risk.” As of early September, little dark money has appeared in this year’s lower-profile races, though it’s behind the issue-based ads in the U.S. Senate, House and governor’s race. Both Supreme Court candidates are relying on donations from individuals. Such contributions are strictly limited, but they do reflect support. Notable donors to McKinnon include U.S. Congressman Greg Gianforte and his wife, Susan. On Black’s side, former mayors of Missoula Mike Kadas and Daniel Kemmis have donated to his campaign, along with retired Missoula District Court judge Karen Townsend. Black has been endorsed by five retired Supreme Court justices: James Nelson, Terry Trieweiler, Mike Wheat, William Leaphart, and Jim Regnier. A letter signed by all five said Black was “eminently qualified” for the court and has earned statewide respect from Montana’s legal community.

She spent her high school years in the beautiful Upper Ruby and graduated as a Sheridan Panther. She has been passionate about building community since her college days at Montana State University and believes there is no better place than a vibrant community paper. Cori is currently raising two little darlings with her husband and getting outside as much as possible. 1) Why do you love journalism? I love helping our communities share the stories that are important to their lives. Whether it\'s local government in action, a recent school board decision that affects their family, a natural resource story or a touching human interest piece, all of these stories are interwoven into the fabric of the day to day lives of our neighbors and friends. Connection and understanding are very important to me. 2) What are three of your favorite things? My family, yoga (better yet, yoga on my paddle board) and sunshine on my shoulders. 3) Favorite quote? “A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies, said Jojen. The man who never reads lives only one.”― George R.R. Martin, A Dance With Dragons Kate Joki Rose was born and raised in Butte, America. After her time as a Bobcat in Bozeman her inner gypsy took her on a twenty plus year tour around the country. Kate learned about movies in Los Angeles, how to two-step in Nashville, how to appreciate coffee in Seattle and publishing in Olympia. In 2010 she returned to where she left her heart, Montana. After a few false starts throughout the state, she met her husband in Butte. Kate and Dan took over his family home in The Ruby in 2017. They live with their 2 dogs, 1 cat and future miniature donkey. (Kate is still working on Dan about that one) She has finally planted roots, but her curiosity is stronger than ever. 1) Why do you love journalism? I have always been enamored with the written word and the power of information. Knowledge not simply in an academic sense, but in, and for, our shared experience. Understanding and, more importantly, appreciating our communities is greatly enhanced when we are aware of its character, ongoing history, and the effects each stakeholder has on it. Journalism, particularly local journalism, is one of the greatest promoters and barometers of a thriving community. 2) What are three of your favorite things? Animals, music, and morning’s first coffee. All three at the same time…perfection. 3) Favorite quote? “Everyone is given two lives. The second one begins when they realize they were only given one “. Unknown. Liz was born in California, raised in Utah, and moved to Ennis the summer of 2021 from South Carolina with her trusty cat, Oliver by her side. 1) Why do you love journalism? While working at the local pharmacy, I’ve fallen in love with small town life and enjoy engaging with everyone from local regulars to visitors passing through. Presenting their stories with honesty and transparency is an important service to our community. 2) What are three of your favorite things? Amongst other activities, I especially enjoy baking, cheesy sci-fi, and collecting low-maintenance house plants 3) Favorite quote? This changes from time to time and while I usually go with something silly and light-hearted, one of the more impactful quotes I’ve come across is, ""Real strength has to do with helping others."" – Fred Rogers. 1) Why do you love journalism? I love being a part of building community - the verb. I love knowing that the stories we publish build cohesion and trust and remind us all that we have a stake in one another as human beings. I love knowing we use our platform to passionately serve ALL of our readers. And, that the journalists who come work with our team do so because they love affecting the human condition by providing facts and truths and the tools necessary for their readers to assimilate into their own version of better living. When all of this comes together with advertising to then drive commerce within each of our wonderful communities, the work feels pretty amazing. 2) What are three of your favorite things? Cheesy Hallmark movies, fast cars and loyal friends. And horses. And ice cream and good chocolate. And loud belly laughs… \u200b 3) Favorite quote? “Vulnerability is not about fear and grief and disappointment. It’s the birthplace of everything we’re hungry for.” Brené Brown 65 N.

Wendy Reid and Jeff Peacock hold engagement and wedding photographs of their parents, Skip and Dianne Peacock, who died this fall in Missoula of complications from COVID-19. Skip, who owned ""Skip\'s Orange Street Sinclair"" for many years, became infected first and died at age 82, and Dianne tested positive soon after her husband and was 78 when she died. Jeff also was infected with COVID from helping his father. Skip Peacock was an Air Force veteran, and coached Little Grizzly Football for many years. Dianne worked for Missoula County Public Schools, and was active in their church activities. They had been married 58 years. Jeff Peacock and Wendy Reid sit with their parents, Skip and Dianne Peacock, a year ago at Christmas time. Skip and Dianne Peacock, both longtime Missoulians, were well on their way to celebrating their 59th wedding anniversary together next spring. With children, grandchildren and a large circle of friends in town, it promised to be a bright day of celebration in a gloomy era. The coronavirus pandemic that’s killed at least 300,000 Americans had other plans. Instead of the usual holiday activities for the Peacock family, the last months of 2020 were filled with anxiety-wracked car rides to the emergency room, oxygen tanks, protective gear and grave consultations with doctors. And finally, it ended with family members exchanging last words through a protective mask or over a Zoom call to a dying loved one in a hospital bed. Skip and Dianne succumbed to complications from COVID-19 on Oct. 23 and Dec. 2, respectively, at St. Patrick Hospital in Missoula. With the death toll in Montana on pace to hit 1,000 soon, it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that each and every one of the people lost to the disease had their own story and a circle of friends and family who cared about them. Skip and Dianne Peacock made an indelible mark on countless others during their decades in Missoula, according to their children, siblings Jeff Peacock and Wendy Reid. Skip got drafted by the Boston Red Sox baseball system out of high school but opted to join the Air Force instead. In 1961, he was transferred to the Reserves in Cut Bank where he met Dianne, and they married in 1962 and moved to Missoula to raise their children in 1965. Skip owned “Skip’s Orange Street Sinclair” on the corner of Broadway and Orange for many years, and Dianne was the executive secretary to the superintendent of the Missoula County Public Schools administration and active in church activities. Skip coached Little Grizzly Football in his spare time. “I’ve got a pile of letters that parents had sent him over the years while he was coaching,” Jeff Peacock said. “All saying the same thing: ‘Wow, thank you Skip, what a great job you did with the kids.’ He got nothing but a lot of rave reviews. A lotta parents thank my dad and say he taught them how to win and lose. It’s pretty cool how many kids’ lives he touched.” Wendy also said she can’t believe how many cards they get, even to this day, from parents thanking Skip for building confidence in their kids. Dianne liked playing cards with her friends, spending time with her grandkids, golfing, planting flowers, reading and quilting. When kids from Hellgate High School nearby couldn’t afford lunch, she and other volunteers at Garden City Church would serve them. In their later years, they lived together at The Springs, a senior living facility in Missoula. *** It’s unclear how Skip was originally infected. He started coughing on the 10th of October. He took a rapid test at the emergency room at the hospital, and tested positive that day. It only took 13 days for the disease to take his life. He suffered from Alzheimer’s and had strokes in the past, but Brad believes his father was physically healthy enough to live another decade. “He didn’t have a lot of symptoms at first,” Wendy Reid explained. In fact, he was released from the hospital and sent home to stay with his daughter. But that only lasted one night, and he was re-admitted. The disease worked quickly from there. “My dad, they Zoomed us with him one day and he was smiling and cracking jokes,” she recalled. “The doctor called me 20 minutes later and said he had taken a turn for the worse and he’s not going to make it. They could tell. They said ‘we’ve seen it enough times’ and could tell. It was pretty crazy.” Dianne tested positive shortly after Skip because they shared an apartment at The Springs. She had underlying lung health issues, but she too was released from the hospital after her first stay. And again, she had to be re-admitted because her oxygen declined and her kids noticed she was having delusions. “I saw her at The Springs and for the most part she looked good, and I thought ‘good God I think she beat this thing’ but 4-5 days later she was delirious and hallucinating,” Jeff recalled. Back at the hospital, doctors found she had pneumonia and emphysema. “They realized how much damage the COVID had done to her lungs,” Wendy recalled. “Before, my mom only used oxygen to walk across the facility to play cards, but when she got out the first time she was on it full time. She was a smoker and stuff and had (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), but COVID tipped her over they said, and made everything worse.” Both Jeff and Wendy have nothing but good things to say about how the staff at St. Patrick’s Hospital and The Springs treated their parents. Wendy said because her mom never answered the phone, she would have to make a nurse go to her mom’s room two or three times a day. “They’re swamped, but never once made you feel like you’re a bother,” Wendy recalled. Eventually, their mom was put on “comfort care,” which means they’re not going to make it. It was a decision that didn’t come lightly. The doctors, though, knew her lungs weren’t going to come through. Wendy and Jeff and their family relied on doctors and the palliative care team to talk to their mom about ""not coming through"" it this time, because due to precautions the family couldn\'t be there to help talk about it. “Mom’s not ever going to say that,” Wendy recalled of the decision. “She doesn’t want to die. Nobody does. It took us awhile to get her there. But in the end it was a peaceful decision.” Skip passed at age 82; Dianne was 78. ***** Jeff and Wendy both graduated from high school in Missoula, and Wendy’s husband’s father started Diversified Plastics in town, where Jeff works. Both Jeff and Wendy said they hope people will take the virus seriously so other families don’t have to go through what they did. “I do think, wear a mask,” Wendy said. “It’s simple. It’s not that big of a deal. I know people get frustrated with it. But until it hits your family you don’t quite grasp how quickly it can pass from person to person.” In fact, Jeff was infected by simply giving his father a ride to the hospital. ""It\'s almost certain I got it from my dad,"" Jeff said. ""I was in the ER with him for almost 7 hours. I did have an N95 mask on but I did not have gloves, goggles or any other PPE. I wasn\'t around anyone else but my wife leading up to that either. I got very sick. Came close to going to the hospital."" He said he had almost all the symptoms, but he didn\'t lose his sense of taste or smell as is commonly reported from people with COVID. Wendy said she was impressed at how seriously the hospital took safety precautions. She noticed how much work it is just for nurses to get geared up to enter rooms to do their jobs. “It does shake you when you’re at the hospital and you see the nurses gowning up and all the protective gear, and just for myself the procedure for going into the rooms is quite the ordeal,” Wendy said. “Having to do that every single time made me appreciate it. I get that now, the whole protective gear procedure.” She realized how important it is for medical staff to have the protective equipment they need to be safe. Jeff said he’s dismayed sometimes when people on social media talk about masks as some sort of sign of weakness. “They’re the same people that haven’t lost half their family,” he said. “Wear a mask. It doesn’t hurt anyone. It’s not about you, it’s about other people is what it’s about. Especially the most vulnerable. There have been 20-39-year-olds dying damn near as fast as 80-year-olds. I don’t get that whole thing, that they think it’s the government taking away freedoms. It’s'}]"

weekly! LYMAN BISHOP For years we have sat silently as those in power have worked tirelessly to erode our Second Amendment rights. Often acting under the guise of safety and security, those in power have escalated their attacks on the Second Amendment in response to mass shootings, claiming they want a greater level of safety and security for Americans. This, despite historical evidence that makes clear connections between a disarmed people and an oppressed people. Ben Franklin once wrote, “Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.” Let me make one thing clear. The Second Amendment was not written to give you the right to keep and bear arms. It was written to create a legal framework by which the government could not legally strip you of, or infringe on, your God-given right to self defense. The Founders did not do this simply to allow for hunting or home defense. The Founders did so as a result of their personal experiences with tyranny, and wanted to guarantee that future generations of Americans were always prepared to defend their nation against any threat, foreign or domestic. It is for that reason that those taking military and police oaths state that they will “Defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic”. I do not advocate unnecessary violence, but I understand the importance of having the ability to defend that which is rightfully ours against any who would seek to undermine the legal authority of the American people. Without the ability to do so, the common man is always at the mercy of those in power. If elected I will act as a barrier between the federal government and the people of Montana, ensuring that under no circumstances would we allow the Federal government to infringe on any of our Constitutionally guaranteed rights. My first goal as Governor will be to allow for Constitutional Carry Laws to be enacted statewide for all Montana residents over the age of 18. If you're old enough to die protecting your country you're old enough to carry a pistol in order to defend yourself and those around you. An armed society is a safe society. If we wish to prevent mass shootings we need a populace capable of doing so. To this end I will ratify the Montana Firearms Freedom Act, which by its existing definition nullifies the National Firearms Act, also known as the NFA. The NFA is little more than an exercise of the taxing power, allowing federal tax levies on the manufacture, sale and transfer of certain classes of firearms, including automatic weapons, short-barreled rifles, and suppressors. While I have no experience in politics, I see this as an advantage. I approach this endeavor not as a career politician, but as a man that seeks to accomplish a goal, then return to my normal life as the Founders intended. While I am not wealthy by any means I cannot be bought as my sacred honor means more to me than silver and gold. I will never bow to corruption or special interests, and will do everything in my power to bring those guilty of such treason to justice. I have decades of experience running successful businesses, building teams of professionals and developing new ideas into viable alternatives to existing standards.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:35 pm The unit that initially failed, Drop 5, got its first new water on Oct. 13, marking the completion of a rehabilitation project begun last June. The system serves users in Canada and along the Hi-Line. At around 3 p.m. on Sunday, May 17, a concrete drop structure failed on the Bureau of Reclamation’s Milk River Project St. Mary Canal, northwest of the town of Cut Bank in northern Montana, located completely within the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. When the structure, called “Drop 5,” failed, it shut down the water that used to flow through diversions from Sherburne Reservoir in Glacier National Park through the St. Mary River, to a canal and two sets of steel siphons that take the water 29 miles to the Milk River. In a dry year, the system supplies up to 95% of the flow, traveling up through Canada and returning to Montana around Havre 216 miles away. It is stored in the Fresno Reservoir near Havre, and the water supplies around 140,000 acres of irrigation along the Hi-Line in eight irrigation districts. The system supports Bureau of Reclamation pump contracts, private contracts, stock water, the cities of Havre, Chinook and Harlem as well as providing water to the Fort Belknap and Blackfeet Indian communities, Town of Milk River and Coutts, Alberta, Sweet Grass in Toole County and the Bowdoin National Wildlife Refuge. The project also creates habitat for wildlife and recreational benefits on and off the reservation. The failure occurred entirely within the Blackfeet Reservation, said Jennifer Patrick, project manager for the Milk River Joint Board of Control, the group working with the primary contract holder, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. Jerry Lunak, the Blackfeet Tribe’s Water Resources Director, said, “The project was built in the early 1900s as a project to irrigate parts of Canada and projects on the Hi-Line. This is one issue I worked on with the water compact, and that created a partnership with the Milk River Joint Board of Control.

Just 5,000 acre-feet are what is called “wet water” while the rest goes into Tiber Reservoir and for which the Tribe is compensated $28 million. Any water going into Tiber above 35,000 acre feet is marketable by the Tribe, she said. “Rehabilitation of St. Mary has been on the back burner for a while now,” Lunak agreed, “and if the new rehabilitation expands the water amount, the Tribe gets that water.” The St. Mary diversion is one of the first five water projects done by the Bureau of Reclamation, Patrick said, and the most complicated. “After the failure, we met with agencies to develop a plan,” she said, noting Sletten Construction and HDR Engineering were hired to be the leads on the construction contracts.

The specter of contaminated soil is muddying a city effort to increase public investment in an area of northeast Bozeman that includes a former Superfund site. A mile from downtown Bozeman, sandwiched between the railroad and I-90, the former Idaho Pole yards sit vacant. The property is the focus of a city effort to form an urban renewal district in the area, which would open the door to public investment and possible private redevelopment. With land in Bozeman increasing in value, the location and size of the property is any developer’s dream. But, the Idaho Pole Yards is not a typical chunk of land. Starting in the 1940s, the Idaho Pole Co. treated wood at that location. Decades later, it was discovered that chemicals had contaminated the soil and groundwater around the site. The Environmental Protection Agency got involved, adding the property to the Superfund list in 1986 and eventually leading a clean-up effort that saw 19,000 cubic yards of soil treated, returned to the ground and covered with clean soil. Since Idaho Pole stopped operations in 1997, the property has sat largely vacant, save for a few old structures, the occasional trespasser and dozens of wells sticking up from the ground that are used for sampling. The EPA removed much of the property from the Superfund list earlier this year, but a few acres of treated soil remain. Though there is no proposal for the property yet, a group of potential buyers is in the beginning stages of formulating a plan for development. The efforts to form an urban renewal district are separate from any potential development plans, but the urban renewal plan in part focuses on redevelopment in the area to “retain existing and attract new economic development.” With the lack of utilities to the property limiting opportunities, Nolan Campbell, a Bozeman real estate broker representing Idaho Pole Co., said an urban renewal district with tax increment financing is a viable path to being able to develop the property. “It’s outright been neglected for so long,” Campbell said. “We can just continue to neglect these infrastructure issues or we can address them.” Establishing tax increment financing for the area would direct a portion of property taxes from their normal destinations to be used for investment in public infrastructure. “The goal of these (urban renewal districts) is to incentivize private investment by making certain public investments concurrent or simultaneous with those projects,” said Bozeman director of economic development Brit Fontenot. The Bozeman City Commission will take a first vote on the Pole Yard Urban Renewal District plan on Tuesday. And though the plan isn’t about just the Idaho Pole property — it extends to more than 270 acres — the pole yards, and the rumblings of a development there, are the cause of concern for nearby neighbors. Northeast Bozeman residents aren’t strangers to controversial or complex development ideas. But, neighborhood association president Reno Walsh said their concerns aren’t only because they oppose development in general. “It’s easy to assume that everybody in the northeast neighborhood is opposed to development … (but) we’ve all accepted the fact that it is going to happen. But when it does happen it has to make sense for the health and safety of humans,” Walsh said. In the case of the pole yards, Walsh said he isn’t confident in the safety of potential development there. “I feel like there’s too much confusion, I don’t feel like there’s enough transparency and I feel like … there’s too much risk involved for it to be this confusing and non-transparent,” Walsh said. It’s not just residents. Nearby businesses are concerned that any development in the area leading to more traffic would not just affect their operations, but increase safety risks near the railroad. Local health officials are concerned, too. The Gallatin City-County Board of Health Environmental Health Subcommittee submitted public comment about the proposal stating concerns over the safety of the pole yards. Even the planning board, when voting to affirm that the urban renewal plan matched with the city’s growth policy, cautioned the city commission to consider whether the plan was being pushed forward too quickly, and how it would impact nearby businesses. Some of the concern centers on the potential that housing could be built on the property. Though most of the site is no longer on the Superfund list, it still is subject to “institutional controls” from the EPA, which are written into the deed and restrict or prevent different uses on the property. In 2017, the institutional controls were changed to allow for residential use on a portion of the site, which Campbell said only applied to the property Idaho Pole Co. owns north of I-90. While institutional controls still restrict use on the site, a recent five-year report from the EPA indicated mixed-use, with commercial on the ground floors and residential on upper floors, would limit direct soil exposure to little or none. Roger Hoogerheide, the EPA’s remedial project manager for Idaho Pole, said direct contact with soil is “the primary exposure pathway.” Residential zoning that would allow for homes with yards, Hoogerheide said, is “associated with much more soil exposure via ingestion, skin contact and inhalation,” Hoogerheide said. “In a mixed-use residential scenario, the lack of a yard would prevent homeowners coming into more contact with the soil,” Hoogerheide said.

Gardner said the act will ""truly protect and provide opportunities for all Americans to enjoy the wonders"" of this country. He said this act will stop Congress from ""stealing"" the money it has done for decades and put it back into national parks. ""I know you will the spend the money very wisely ..."" Trump said. ""Because if you spend it wisely you will be able to do five times more than you even think."" The bill will spend about $900 million a year — double current spending — on the popular Land and Water Conservation Fund, and another $1.9 billion per year on improvements at national parks, forests, wildlife refuges and rangelands. Sen. Jon Tester, D- Mont., said Tuesday the signing of the bill ended his years-long push for full, mandatory funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. “This is a big deal for the Treasure State’s greatest treasure – our public lands,” Tester said. “We rely on our public lands, and protecting them means protecting not only the outdoor spaces where folks hike, hunt, fish, and camp, but also the 70,000 jobs and $7.1 billion generated each year by Montana’s outdoor recreation economy."" Supporters say the legislation will create at least 100,000 jobs, while restoring national parks and repairing trails and forest systems. Opponents counter that the money isn\'t enough to cover the estimated $20 billion maintenance backlog on federally owned lands. The park maintenance backlog has been a problem for decades, through Republican and Democratic administrations. The House and the Senate cleared both bills by overwhelming bipartisan margins this summer. Rep. Greg Gianforte, R-Mont., voted for the measure as well. “The Great American Outdoors Act, which I proudly supported, provides dedicated, lasting resources to increase public access to our public lands, conserving them for generations to come,” Gianforte said in an email, thanking Daines and Trump. Ivanka Trump, the Republican president\'s daughter and adviser, also supported the legislation. ""This is a day for great celebration,"" she said. ""This is an extraordinary piece of legislation that will be a great legacy for this administration and most importantly, the country."" She said the natural beauty and majesty of parks and public land are now more valuable than ever, especially during the current pandemic, as these areas offer respite for many. Several groups praised the act\'s passage. Backcountry Hunters & Anglers President Land Tawney thanked elected officials, but also credited grassroots sportsmen and women. “Today we unite in celebration of our public lands and waters,” Tawney said in an email. “Success has many fathers and mothers, and without the dedicated, unwavering support of so many – ranging from rank-and-file hunters and anglers, outdoor recreationists and business owners to members of Congress and the president – we would never have achieved this hard-won victory."" Daines, who is running for re-election against Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock, spoke with reporters after the bill was signed. He dismissed criticism from Montana Democrats who called the bill signing ""an election-year gift now that his reelection hangs in the balance."" ""It\'s not about politics for me,"" Daines said. ""Montanans love the outdoors."" He said he grew up hunting and fishing and said fighting for public land in Montana is something he has done since he has served in Congress. He said he has been ranked as one of the most effective and bipartisan members of Congress. ""This is another example of actually getting it done,"" Daines said. He said it was refreshing to see something move forward without the typical partisan bickering. Daines said he was looking forward to the deferred maintenance projects being done at Yellowstone and Glacier national parks. He said the Land and Water Conservation Funds would be of big benefit to Montana as well. Trump failed to give Democrats any credit for their role in helping to pass the measure on Tuesday. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said it was because Democrats and Republicans — including the administration — have yet to agree on extending now-expired coronavirus relief payments and protections.

Tyler Trevor, deputy commissioner of budget and planning at the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education, said he estimated up to $14 million would be put toward refunds to students moving off campus early. Late last week, Commissioner Clay Christian approved campuses to refund students who moved out of dense student housing. The communal living spaces could become a breeding ground for coronavirus if it were to infect someone in the dorms, and the more people who moved out the safer they would be. University of Montana spokesperson Paula Short said since sending emails to students prompting them to move out if possible and including information about refunds, the number of students who said they would plan to leave skyrocketed. Trevor said that while campuses could likely weather the lost revenue and extra costs through the end of the school year, the unknowns of how coronavirus will affect the upcoming year and beyond had him more concerned. He said providing the refunds would be a one-time cost. However, the effects of many potential disruptions caused by coronavirus could later include a drop in tuition revenue, fewer students paying fees that fund things like on-campus gyms and dining halls, and a hit to the state budget. “If there’s a drop in enrollment in the fall, that would cause stress,"" Trevor said. ""In the short term, the refunds and costs may stress campuses, but they should be able to absorb it. But combined with foreseeable and unforeseeable effects over the long-term, that could cause issues.” Among one of the unforeseeable effects is how long the coronavirus will be affecting the state economy, and therefore the tax revenue used to fund agencies like the university system. Trevor said that state budget officials felt the state government’s tax revenue was still in good shape, but that could change if the large-scale drop in tourism and other economic activities lasts more than a few months. UM vice president for operations and finance Paul Lasiter said that while the upcoming year and any effects the virus has on enrollment were too difficult to forecast at this point, the next fiscal year\'s state contribution to UM\'s budget was already set in place by the legislature. Higher education officials across the country were working together, Trevor said, to lobby federal representatives to include provisions for colleges and universities in the stimulus packages being worked through Congress. He said he had been in touch with U.S. Sens. Jon Tester and Steve Daines, but he said none of the bills that have been voted on in the Senate included provisions for higher education. He said officials were hoping it could make it into the “third round” of stimulus legislation.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 2:52 pm By Johnathan Hettinger Montana Free Press Since starting as superintendent of Yellowstone National Park in 2018, Cam Sholly has made it a priority to upgrade housing for employees. The dwellings for seasonal employees, he has said, are “dumps” and “unbefitting for Yellowstone or any park in the system.” But the problems go beyond employee housing. With 1,500 buildings, 300 miles of paved roads, and more than 1,000 miles of hiking trails, Yellowstone has a backlog of deferred maintenance carrying a price tag of $585 million, according to theNational Park Service. Those stresses aren’t likely to find any relief under the current administration. In a proposed budget released by President Donald Trump earlier this week, the National Park Service would lose nearly $600 million in funding. “It is difficult to summarize how damaging that would be for our national parks,” said John Garder, senior director of budget and appropriations for the National Parks Conservation Association. It could mean a reduction of about 952 full-time-equivalent staff across the Park Service. Quantified another way, parks that rely on seasonal employees could lose three four-month employees during peak season, Garder said. The proposed budget continues a trend of cuts to the National Park Service budget. Since 2011, parks nationwide have reduced staff by 16 percent. Over the same span, visitation to national parks has increased 17 percent, Garder said. Yellowstone has lost 4 percent of its staff, while Grand Teton National Park has lost 10 percent in that same period, Garder said. Garder said he did not have numbers for Glacier National Park. Trump’s new budget would amount to a 7 percent loss to the operating budget of each park in the system, Garder said. “Given record increases in visitation at those parks, it’s clear that that is insulting to the park superintendents, the rangers who steward our parks, and the gateway communities that rely on them for our economic well-being,” Garder said. In addition to the proposed cuts to the National Park Service, the Trump budget also calls for a 97 percent cut in discretionary spending to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which would leave it with only $15 million in fiscal year 2021, down from almost $500 million in fiscal year 2020. The Land and Water Conservation Fund, which is itself funded by offshore drilling fees, feeds money to state grants and federal public lands acquisition projects. It was permanently reauthorized for the first time in 2019 as part of a sweeping public lands package heralded by all three members of Montana’s federal delegation. Even with LWCF permanently reauthorized, Congress has to determine appropriations for the fund each year. LWCF is authorized to receive funding up to $900 million. Last year’s $495 million budget was the highest since 2003. Both of Montana’s senators — Republican Steve Daines and Democrat Jon Tester — are members of the U.S.Senate Appropriations Committee, which makes decisions about federal program funding. “I expect Congress will reject it,” Garder said of the cuts to parks. “But it’s unhelpful, to say the least, when the president proposes a vision for our parks that would set them back considerably from where it needs to be.” The president’s budget is just a “blueprint,” according to Daines spokeswoman Julia Doyle. Congress generally does not approve the presidential budget in its entirety. “Congress has the power of the purse and is the body that actually makes the decisions and funds the government,” Doyle said in an emailed statement. “Senator Daines will continue fighting for funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund and other important Montana priorities, including the National Park Service, in the appropriations process.” Doyle said Daines is pushing for full funding of LWCF. “You may recall that last year, funding for LWCF in the Administration’s budget was also very low,” Doyle said. “That’s why Sen. Daines stressed the importance of strong funding for the program, and his disappointment for the low number coming out of the administration. Secretary [of the Interior David] Bernhardt agreed with the Senator and publicly stated the budget number is simply a starting point.” In a statement, Tester called Trump’s budget proposal “irresponsible” for not tackling wasteful spending and the national debt. “Instead, it funds tax cuts for the wealthy by slashing Medicare and health care for rural families, cutting rural infrastructure projects, and decimating our public lands and outdoor recreation economy,” Tester said. Rep. Greg Gianforte said in an emailed statement that “Congress will decide how much to spend and where.” “I’ll remain focused on putting Montana first and reining in out-of-control spending,” Gianforte said. “It’s critical that we balance the budget to stop saddling our kids and grandkids with today’s reckless spending, which is why I support amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget and not paying members of Congress when they don’t balance the budget.” All three members of Montana’s congressional delegation have sponsored the Restore Our Parks Act, which would help address a nationwide $12 billion backlog of deferred maintenance by diverting a portion of rents and fees generated by mining and energy development on federal lands. The act would provide $6.5 billion over five years to address deferred maintenance at National Parks. “Unless that bill passes, it will be very difficult for park superintendents to address repair needs that continue to build up each year,” Garder said. “Increasing visitor fees or any other funding sources are not sufficient to deal with the problem.” Log In Keep it Clean.
