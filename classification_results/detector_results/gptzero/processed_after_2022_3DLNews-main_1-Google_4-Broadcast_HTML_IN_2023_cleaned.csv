The blog also lists recommendations for nearby amenities, such as the Noble County Courthouse and the Chain O’Lakes State Park. Grace Caswell, executive director of Visit Noble County’s Tourism Bureau, said she had come across the list nearly two weeks ago in a web search and shared her reaction to the listing. Caswell says she shared the blog with several local organizations and says even the local newspaper did some coverage based on the listing. Both Caswell and Lori Gagen of the Albion S.T.A.R. Team say the community’s reaction to the news was quite exciting. Caswell says it was encouraging and exciting to see an organization with a different audience giving such praise to a small Noble County community. “I think everyone was very happy with the list, and they felt it was accurate and reflective of the historic charm and beauty of a small town, and to be known as ‘beautiful’ or ‘pretty’ was meaningful.” Gagen says many people told her that they already knew Albion was a pretty town and are glad the rest of the world is being told about it. Caswell says she believes that Albion being listed in the World Atlas blog will allow readers to know about Noble County and its amenities and inspire other small communities. Copyright 2023 WPTA.

(WEHT) – Despite Owensboro Catholic’s loss to Mayfield in the KHSAA 2A state championships, the Aces still managed to pull off an incredible performance, led by senior William “Tutt” Carrico. At one point, the Aces were down 20 points in the game, but giving up isn’t in their DNA. Tutt says that this was a game that he and his brother Vince Carrico have prepared for since they were kids. “We came this close, me and Vince, when he was a seventh grader and I was in eight grade, it was our dream,” explained Tutt. “I’ve dreamt about this day every day; whenever times get hard, I work harder and push myself.” Tutt finished with 11 catches for 332 yards and three touchdowns in the state championship. Head Coach Jason Morris understands just how much Tutt has meant to this program. His three touchdowns helped to end his season with 30 receiving touchdowns, a new Kentucky state record. “Tutt is the hardest working player I ever coached,” said coach Morris. “He may be the hardest working player I ever coach because I don’t know that you can work harder. He is the best football player in this state and he proved that.” Brady Atwell threw for 514 yards for the Aces in the state championship and over 300 of those yards going to Tutt, as the pair would break the record for most receiving touchdowns in a season. “That’s my brother, I always have his back,” says Atwell. From Tutt Carrico, to Mitchell Sims, Carson Lewis, Noah Rhinerson, Major Pride, Kaiser Frick and the rest of the seniors, coach Morris knows how special this senior class was for the program. “(I’m) proud of the senior class, but not just the senior class, the entire Catholic community,” says the coach. “Our football programs are in good shape right now, and we’ll be back.” Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

(WNDU) - 16 Investigates is learning what caused three patients at a former rehab center in Mishawaka to die within a one-week timespan earlier this year. The patient deaths were reported at the Landmark Recovery center on Bodnar Boulevard between July 3 and July 9. Autopsies have been completed on those patients, and 16 News Now Investigates has obtained those results through a public records request. First responders were first called to the facility around 12:30 p.m. on July 3 for a report of a dead male. When they arrived, they found Seth Jones, 19, of Montpelier, Ind., deceased. According to his autopsy results, his death was ruled accidental and caused by the combined toxic effects of Buprenorphine and Gabapentin. Police officers and firefighters were called to the facility again for another death less than 24 hours later at around 7 a.m. on July 4. Police arrived to find William Breda, 46, of Griffith deceased. His cause of death was determined to be chronic alcohol use disorder. First responders were called out to the facility again on July 9 for a report of a smoke alarm going off. But when they arrived, they found a deceased 38-year-old man. His death was ruled a suicide. The Mishawaka location remains closed after the state of Indiana revoked its license. Chris Kang, general counsel for Landmark Recovery, told 16 News Now the next step is a full hearing to resolve disagreements in the case. A spokesperson for the facility also tells us they have completed an internal investigation into these deaths. They are calling the deaths “tragic events” and a “sad reality” of the work they do. They also suggest that the autopsy results confirm none of the deaths were due to overdose or other suspicious circumstances as initially suspected by investigators. You can read Landmark’s full statement below: The deaths of the three individuals at Praxis of South Bend are tragic events. This is the sad reality of the work we do. Below are our initial comments on the findings from the Coroner’s Office: 1. The Coroner reports the first patient died of ""Chronic Alcohol Use Disorder.” It also noted the death was ""Natural."" This indicates that: (1) the patient\'s long-term abuse of alcohol led to the death; and (2) external factors (e.g., injuries, medications, overdose from illicit substances, etc.) played no role. 2. The second patient took their own life just a day before finishing our program. It\'s truly devasting. There were, however, no illicit substance, injuries, or any other suspicious circumstances involved. 3. The third death was apparently caused by “Combined Toxic Effects of Buprenorphine and Gabapentin” and was labeled as an “Accident.” This mix of medications is standard in the industry for managing withdrawal symptoms. It is especially useful for treating patients with severe anxiety and specific types of seizures. Medical experts — including the American Society of Addiction Medicine — recognize the increased risk of potential harmful side effects. But they also recognize that the harm associated with an untreated opioid use disorder may outweigh such risks. The term “Accident” indicates that the Coroner doesn’t view the death as intentionally caused by the medication. The above does confirm that — contrary to initial reports — none of the deaths were due to overdose or other suspicious circumstances. We’re committed to our mission of helping low-income Hoosiers fight addiction. We will continue our appeal process and dialogues with stakeholders to continue our mission and help hundreds of our former employees gain back their livelihoods.

An emerging drug poses a threat to communities as it increases in the country. EVANSVILLE, Ind. (WEVV) - A new deadly street drug has already taken the lives of many people in Ohio and Illinois, making its way down to Indiana. This year is the first time officials have seen the drug involved in overdoses as it is often mixed with other narcotics such as Xanax and Fentanyl. It is known as Bromazolam. A drug that has been found in 64 toxicology reports here in Indiana since the beginning of the year. Officials tell 44News to order any prescription from a reputable place, but for individuals buying drugs off the street, it\'s the danger of believing they\'re taking one specific narcotic when they are actually consuming a variety of different mixtures. The Vanderburgh County coroner, Steven Lockyear, says “For years we\'ve learned that benzos are a tipping drug for overdoses. Generally not the primary drug, but when they are mixed in with other things can be that one thing that tips you over.” It\'s not approved for any medical use in the country and has many adverse effects such as difficulty breathing, amnesia, blurred vision, and even death.

Mario Garcia and son-in-law Nivardo De La Torre were walking Salt Creek trying to kill time by scouting fishing holes. What they soon would discover. left the two in shock – finding 27-year-old Reum who had been trapped in his mangled truck under a bridge on I-94 for 6 days. “He was very happy to see us like he was really.. I’ve never seen a relief like that. He was really hurt and everything so right away we went into a motive of get up there and call someone right away. Let’s get someone there,” said Garcia. Reum was airlifted to Memorial Hospital in critical condition. Reum told police the crash happened last Wednesday, and he was unable to reach his cellphone to call for help. He told rescuers he survived the six days by drinking rainwater. Police believe the crash happened late at night as they see the odds of no one seeing the vehicle go off the heavily traveled highway during the day very unlikely. “It’s one of the highest traveled interstates in the United States,” Sgt. Glen Fifield, Indiana State Police public information officer. Officials received no reports of a crash or a missing person. They believe the outcome would had been different if Reum wasn\'t found when he was. Brad Sievers, who works with Reum says: ""Since I have known Matt, he has always been a positive, kind, and energetic person. We will continue to pray and support our brother as he begins his recovery. We thank God that Matt is still with us.” He also shares Reum had surgery Wednesday morning where his left leg was amputated from his mid-shin down. Friends have started a GoFundMe to help cover medical expenses. Police want to remind drivers to always be prepared in case of a similar incident occurring. Always have blankets, water, and phone charging abilities handy. And let someone know where you are traveling. “So if you don’t show up you want people to know well.. last time I talked to, you know, a loved one... They were stopping for gas in South Bend,” said Fifield. Fifield says police are still not sure what caused the crash. Reum remains in South Bend Memorial Hospital.'}]"

I said I want to be a dictator for one day. You know why I wanted to be a dictator? Because I want a wall, and I want to drill, drill, drill.” His remarks prompted chants of “build a wall” from the audience before Trump added, “Well we did.” Trump was making an apparent reference to an article published earlier Saturday by The New York Times’s chief White House correspondent, Peter Baker, in which he discussed the implications of Trump’s “dictator” remarks in a Fox News town hall last week. Trump was pressed last week by Fox News’s Sean Hannity on whether he has plans — if reelected — to “abuse power, to break the law, to use the government to go after people.” Trump initially avoided directly answering the question, and then, when asked for a second time, the former president said, “Except for day one.” “He says, ‘You’re not going to be a dictator, are you?’ I said, no, no, no — other than day one. We’re closing the border and we’re drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, I’m not a dictator,” Trump said to Hannity before an audience in Iowa. The remarks further fueled concern from Democrats and even some Republicans that a second Trump term could threaten democracy and risk an abuse of power to target those who have disagreed with or wronged him. Saturday night’s gala featured other headlining Republican voices, including Rep. Matt Gaetz (Fla.) and Sen. Roger Marshall (Kan.), both of whom have endorsed Trump’s 2024 reelection bid. “Less than a year from now, American has a choice to make — greatness or decline. I look around this city and I see the fingerprints of President Trump everywhere,” Gaetz said in a fiery speech Saturday. “And how has New York rewarded this great man? By trying to bankrupt him and imprison him,” he said, referencing Trump’s ongoing civil trial in which control of his business empire is at stake. Submit Δ Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

Ruba Almaghtheh, 34, was arrested on a preliminary charge of criminal recklessness. According to a police report obtained by FOX59/CBS4, police were called to the building around 11:30 Friday evening to investigate a hate crime. Officers said Almaghtheh backed her car into the building while several adults and children were inside. Almaghtheh told officers she was watching news coverage of the Israel-Hamas war on television and decided to plan an attack on the building because she was offended by the “Hebrew Israelite” symbol on the front of the building. The Anti-Defamation League defines the Israelite School of Universal and Practical Knowledge as an “extreme and antisemitic” sect of the Black Hebrew Israelites. The Southern Poverty Law Center has designated the Black Hebrew Israelites as a hate group. In a statement released Sunday night, the Jewish Federation of Greater Indianapolis reported that Safe Indiana, a Jewish community security program, was immediately notified of the incident. Safe Indiana is working alongside law enforcement to investigate the incident. “Safety and security for our community is of the utmost importance, and we are more secure and prepared than ever before,” Jewish Federation of Greater Indianapolis officials wrote in a press release. “Although a Jewish facility was not targeted, solely due to ironic misidentification, this is yet another reminder to maintain security protocols, remain vigilant of suspicious activity and to (report promptly) to the appropriate authorities.” According to the report, Almaghtheh was interviewed by detectives and admitted to committing the hate crime during her courtesy phone call with a family member. Almaghtheh is expected to make her first court appearance on Wednesday. IMPD has contacted the FBI about the incident. Submit Δ Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Knowles addressed a sold-out crowd in the Purdue Memorial Union’s north ballroom. Just next door, thousands of students and community members gathered to celebrate trans life. The event – called the “Block Party to Eradicate Transphobia” – included a drag show, art exhibition, resource fair, and games. Lilli Ferguson is the President Pro-Tempora of Purdue Student Government. She said they didn’t want the event to feel like a response to Knowles’s visit. “Someone coming here shouldn’t feel this is a protest or a response. They should just feel they are coming to be a part of the community and to celebrate our trans and gender non-conforming students on campus,” she said. Student Russell Kleiner ran operations for the event. He said the community came together quickly to organize the evening – including planning over Purdue’s spring break. “We got the banners, we got the balloons, we got all the sort of [knicknacks] and things, and that’s an incredible story to tell about Purdue,” he said. “In a timeline that we were working with we were able to do it, and now you look around and see tons of students feeling like themselves and enjoying the time and enjoying the community.” A number of organizations set up tables in the Loeb Playhouse lobby, including the Purdue LGBTQ Center, Purdue Episcopal Campus Ministry, and Purdue Graduate Student Government. State representative Chris Campbell (D-West Lafayette) set up a booth at the event and covered it in pride flags. She said she was happy to be at the block party – especially in light of the series of anti-trans bills move through the legislature. “If we’re going to allow speakers at the university, we need a way to express the support for the community and make sure they know that having a speaker does not represent the voices of the university and this community,” she said. Down the hall Robert Kim, a volunteer with Purdue Student Government, carried an armful of pride flags. “So I’m passing out some pride flags,” he said. “Seems like a lot of people want these.” Kim said with Knowles on campus, it’s important to make trans students feel supported. At PMU, the atmosphere was not quite so convivial, as protesters and Knowles supporters began to gather ahead of the 8 p.m. speech. A gray sky threatened rain outside, where hundreds of students gathered with protest signs and banners that said everything from “Protect trans kids” to “Transphobic? Kill yourself.” Ben O’Brien is a sophomore at Purdue and a member of the Young Democratic Socialists of America, which helped organize the protest. They said they’re upset that Purdue is paying for Knowles’ speaking fees. “This is my tuition dollars that’s paying for this, this is coming through a SOGA (Student Organization Grant Allocation Board) grant. I don’t want a single cent of my tuition dollars into his pocket,” they said. “I don’t want to pay him to encourage other people to enact violence onto me.” According to reporting from Based in Lafayette, Knowles was paid over $8,700 in speaking fees, with an additional $4,300 paid by the university for police personnel on site. Riley Park, a University of Indianapolis grad student, came up to Purdue for the protest. They demanded that speakers like Knowles be barred from campus. “Eradicate transphobia!” they shouted to cheers from the crowd. The protest briefly fell into chaos when a person wearing a ski mask, glasses, and a red ball cap began taunting the group with a megaphone – shouting that “10 years ago, none of this was normal.” A crowd of people gathered around to shout him down – some apparently trying to debate him – while organizers pleaded for people to “not engage.” The standoff between the two parties didn’t end until protesters moved inside ahead of Knowles’s remarks. Inside, a long line of attendees snaked out of the ballroom and spilled out into the common area, where police tried to quickly move protesters back against the walls to keep them from blocking any walkways. Eventually, protesters were cleared out of a long PMU hallway and told to gather outside, though many remained indoors. Hundreds of people gathered to see Knowles, and many were turned away. The ballroom filled after 7:30 p.m. Those still interested in hearing him speak were guided to a room on the second floor where TVs were set up to stream the event – until that also filled to capacity. To begin his speech, Knowles showed the crowd posters with his face and the word “fascist” plastered on top of them in gray block letters. “So where’d they get the idea that I’m a fascist?” Knowles asked. “They got the idea, it seems, from a speech I gave a few weeks ago at CPAC [Conservative Political Action Conference] in which I observed that men can not really be women. I said we should stop pretending that they can, and we should stop tolerating this nonsense as a basis for reordering our public life - that we ought to eradicate the ideology of transgenderism entirely.” At this, the crowd erupted into applause. “I guess you’re all fascists, too,” Knowles said, grinning. Over the course of his roughly half-hour speech, Knowles outlined his view of a country locked in an ideological war that only one side could win. “Like a troubled teenager at a crossroads, we must choose who we will become,” he said. “Will we continue to rebel against reality? Will we degrade ourselves further into decadence and delusion and drown out the facts of life by howling into the wind like the poor souls outside? Or will we open our ears to reason?” Throughout the speech protesters could be heard chanting just outside – and Knowles missed no opportunities to mock them, describing them as everything from angsty teens to smelly. Knowles ended his speech to a standing ovation before taking questions from the crowd, joking that his contract required he hear from people who disagree with him. Instead, attendees asked a variety of questions centered around how to protect children from “progressive, leftist, and transgender indoctrination.” “Run very far away,” Knowles joked to one questioner before offering a longer answer about homeschooling children because it was “increasingly impossible” to send kids to either public or private school. “We need to break the backs of the teacher unions and push for school choice,” he said. “Which is for many people the only chance they’ll have at raising their children in a way that won’t completely screw them up for the rest of their lives.” As attendees filed out of Knowles’s speech, they were greeted again by a long row of protesters who continued to line the halls, occasionally shouting at one another before heading out into the night. Jordan Stribling is a Lafayette resident who came to the speech because he was interested in Knowles. He said he’s a conservative and has wanted to hear Knowles speak for a while. “Him talking about how we can protect our kids from this ideology in schools stood out a lot to me,” he said. “I’m hoping they [Purdue] can get some other people in as well,” Stribling added. “Like Ben Shapiro or Matt Walsh.” Back in the Stewart Center, the Block Party to Eradicate Transphobia was also beginning to disperse. Mathew Neidmann is a graduate student at the university, who was passing through the event on his way back from seeing Knowles speak. He said he was horrified by what he heard. Neidmann’s partner was assigned female at birth and uses the women’s restroom – but according to Neidmann, because of the way his partner appears they are occasionally mistaken as a man. “My partner is trans, specifically non-binary,” he said. “...lately because of what’s going on with the degradation in the trans debate such as it is in America, I worry. What happens when my partner goes into the women’s restroom - where someone like Mike Knowles thinks they should be – they are mistaken for a man and harassed or assaulted?” “I dread waking up at night to a phone call that they are in the hospital because someone thought they were a man and decided they shouldn’t be in the women’s bathroom,” Neidmann added. He said he disagrees with Knowles’s assertion that only one ideology can truly “win.” “If he believes that Christians must achieve dominion over the United States, then of course transgender people must lose,” he said. “I think that transgender people don’t necessarily think that Christians must lose. They just have to accept the self-identification that they do and accept there are certain best practices that the medical community agrees on for treatment. That’s basically it…it’s a false dichotomy.” A Purdue spokesperson said in a written statement that Knowles was'}]"
