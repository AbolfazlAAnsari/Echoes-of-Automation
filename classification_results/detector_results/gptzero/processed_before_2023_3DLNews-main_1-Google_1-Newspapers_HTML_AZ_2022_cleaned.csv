Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:59 am Sabrina Greenlee, the mother of the Arizona Cardinals’ DeAndre Hopkins, founded S.M.O.O.O.T.H., which aims to educate and empower as many women and children as possible through mentorship, counseling and outreach. (Sean Coleman/Submitted) When Arizona Cardinals fans watch DeAndre Hopkins, they see a talented, spirited athlete who maintains a tough exterior. His mother, Sabrina Greenlee, witnesses something a little different. “He’s always been a momma’s boy — although he might not admit it,” the South Carolina resident said with a laugh. “I’m definitely proud of him, not only on the football field but the businessman he’s become as well.” Life wasn’t always so playful for their family. Greenlee’s story is filled with cycles of abuse, teen pregnancy, and a violent attempt on her life that ultimately left her completely blind. Although her life has been “no crystal stair,” she credits her faith as the fuel that equips her with the confidence and tenacity to inspire others to repair, recreate and restore their purpose and infinite potential. Greenlee will soon share her story through her memoir and is preparing for BRON Studios to make a movie about her life. “It’s a little surreal that they would make a depiction about my life,” she said. “I’m embracing it each day. I’m even thinking about who’s going to portray me. When they asked, I said Taraji P. Henson. She’s the same age as me and has an amazing personality. I am excited, but now I can’t believe this is really happening.” Working on the memoir and film has been trying for Greenlee. They unveiled a lot of darkness, but it led to healing. “Between the two, I did a lot of meditation and a lot of floating in the water to relieve stress,” she said. “Definitely, between writing the book proposal and the movie script, a lot of self-reflection and a lot of healing came about.” S.M.O.O.O.T.H. operator Greenlee is the founder and CEO of S.M.O.O.O.T.H. Inc. — Speaking Mentally, Outwardly Opening Opportunities Toward Healing. Through this platform, she and her team aim to educate and empower as many women and children as possible through mentorship, counseling and outreach. She intends to continue raising awareness year-round by unmasking the myth and unveiling the many different shades of purple surrounding domestic abuse. S.M.O.O.O.T.H. has started operating in Arizona, which marks its third state. “I’m really ecstatic, with DeAndre having this amazing year coming up,” she said. “We take women who are in shelters, as they’re transitioning into their own dwelling — whether it be a home, a condo, it doesn’t matter. My philosophy is if you have a key, we can help you.” Greenlee and two S.M.O.O.O.T.H. members are certified life coaches who set the women up for success. “Most of the members of S.M.O.O.O.T.H. haven’t gone through domestic violence themselves, which is pretty amazing,” Greenlee explained. “I get to teach them and take them into shelters. It’s really great that they haven’t been through it, but they’re prepared and they did the training to understand what the ladies need to go through to heal.” Greenlee is a recipient of the 2020 Houston Humanitarian Awards. She has been featured on ESPN, USA Today and the Emmy-winning “Living in Fear: Chronicles I and II,” and regularly appears on local media outlets from South Carolina to Texas. Sabrina appeared on ABC news with the CEO of the National Domestic Violence Hotline. “The ESPN article was definitely amazing,” she said. “It got so much exposure. We had an outpouring of support from the NFL and NBA. People knew who I was then. While we’re sitting in the airport, I get, ‘Is that…?’ My daughter just starts shaking her head like, ‘That’s her.’” She is the mother of four children — Kesha Smith, who is a Houston-area Realtor; musician Marcus Greenlee; Hopkins and model Shanterria Cobb. Cobb was named after Greenlee’s brother, Terry Smith, who died in 1997. Besides her family, faith has helped Greenlee through her turbulent life. “Nine, 10 years ago, there was no way I could have thought about faith,” she said. “I was just so broken and really in a hurtful place. Over the years, I did a lot of reflecting, a lot of self-healing, realizing my faith played a big part of who I am now. “Had I not had faith, I would have crumbled a long time ago. I would say my faith is stronger now than it ever has been.” Never miss an issue. Sign up for free today.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 12:15 pm Benjamin Peter Anastasoff of Litchfield Park was recently sworn in as a midshipman at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) and as a member of the U.S. Naval Reserve. Anastasoff was nominated by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema to attend USMMA, located in Kings Point, New York, and one of the nation’s five federal service academies. The U.S. Merchant Marine Academy is a federal service academy that educates and graduates licensed Merchant Marine officers. In addition to the rigorous academic and physical requirements for admission, applicants must be nominated by their congressman or senator. It is one of five federal service academies, which include the Military Academy at West Point, the Naval Academy at Annapolis, the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut. All USMMA graduates earn both a Bachelor of Science degree and a Merchant Marine Officer license, and incur an obligation to serve the country as an active or reserve officer in the U.S. armed forces. The U.S. Flag Merchant Marine — manned by U.S. merchant mariners — is essential for securing the country’s commerce in peacetime and delivering warfighters, weapons and military supplies in times of conflict. The majority of “Kings Pointers” will serve as Navy reservists in the Strategic Sealift Officer Force while working aboard U.S. flag vessels; others will serve on active duty in our nation’s armed forces. As part of his four-year education, Anastasoff will spend one year training as a cadet aboard ocean going vessels. USMMA is the only federal academy where students train on commercial vessels traveling around the globe. Dedicated during WWII, USMMA has since served the nation in both peace and war.

Long before transparency was the catch phrase of government watchdogs, Arizona newspapers have been the primary fighters in the battle to keep government records open to citizens. In the last few years, the transparency fight moved to protecting the public’s right to know by keeping public notices in newspapers. Legals in the Sedona Red Rock News include notices on upcoming public hearings, proposed tax increases, ordinance changes, zoning changes, budget proposals, school district information and many other important government actions and information that impact people’s rights and lives every day. Arizona governments from the state legislature down to counties, cities, towns, fire districts and school boards are required by Arizona state law to publish these legals in newspapers. Importantly, newspapers do this while providing independent, third-party verification information is actually being made available to the public. Arizona State Legislature has attempted a few times to introduce legislation to set up a state-run public notice website, but — to no one-surprise — proposed costs to taxpayers for the computer programmers, website designers, server maintenance and administration ballooned to a millions dollars before legislators realized the absurdity of having a government agency duplicate what newspapers do already at a fraction of the cost to themselves and to the government agencies that are required by state law to publish public notices in official “newspapers of record” which include both Sedona Red Rock News and The Camp Verde Journal, published by family-owned, Sedona-based Larson Newspapers. Arizona newspapers already publish public notices in their print editions and on a centralized statewide website — www.arizonapublicnotices.com — a database of all public notices published in newspapers across the state since 1998. Local newspaper websites are the most popular and most commonly viewed websites in their local communities. Also, the free statewide website regularly receives nearly 4 million hits a year. Simply put, the current system is working well. Moreover, government has no business taking over a function currently being performed very well and cost-effectively by Arizona’s newspapers — thus taking private jobs and giving them to government — especially during tough economic times. There are four elements that mark a valid public notice under Arizona state law: If any one of these elements is absent, the notice simply cannot be properly authenticated and is subject to challenge. If a state-run website goes down due to government ineptitude, hack or systemic failure, those records are inaccessible and perhaps lost forever, which affects courts, counties, towns, cities, businesses, nonprofits and when a person dies, executors of personal estates are also required to notify heirs, debtors and creditors, so a computer collapse would affect millions of Arizonans, rich and poor. Conversely public notices in newspapers of record are accessible in hardcopy format at libraries all over the state, include the Sedona Public Library, where you can check on any public record published in our newspaper going back decades. The public must also be able to verify the notice was not altered once published. Websites are commonly hacked, go down for various reasons and website content can be changed. Websites are fallible in a way print is not. When published, a legal affidavit is provided by the newspaper, which can be used as independent, third-party verification that the notice was made and proof of the true copy and exact text. Simply put, public notices in newspapers can’t be falsified. The amount of money government spends on these notices is a very small part of the overall budget for cities, towns and counties. In almost all cases, governments spends less than one-half of 1% of their budgets on this legally required and valuable service. In Sedona, with its $105 million budget, that is 0.01%. Public notices keep governments and government officials honest because they’re legally required to disclose a host of public records in a public forum that can’t be tampered with. Folks who suggest hiding notices on government or third-party websites are those with something they want to hide, be it shady land deals, attempts to influence officials or hide business transactions from federal or state investigators or prosecutors. Be wary when anyone wants to hide this legally required public material from scrutiny: From you, dear readers, citizens and taxpayers. Democracy dies in darkness, the saying goes. We’ll keep publishing public notices for you to read and pour over so that you’re informed about your governments and do so efficiently, cheaply, effectively. If it isn’t broke, don’t fix it.

Alex Hager KUNC//December 9, 2022// Page wary of crisis on the Colorado River Alex Hager KUNC//December 9, 2022// Tobyn Pilot took a few crunchy footsteps through the red dirt near the edge of a towering cliff. Pilot, an operator at the water plant in Page, pulled out a hefty collection of keys to unlock a tiny plywood shed just a few feet from the brink. The building is barely bigger than an outhouse, but it’s a pivotal part of keeping the taps flowing in this city of 7,500 people. “The town’s water comes right through this shack,” Pilot said, revealing a small setup of pumps behind the creaking shed door. “Isn’t that crazy to think?” Hundreds of feet below, the Colorado River calmly chugged along. It’s here, on the dusty precipice, that water from the river is redirected into homes, hotels and restaurants in this tourist town. As the once-mighty Colorado shrinks in the hands of a changing climate, communities that rely on it are starting to feel the pinch. Many large cities in the Southwest are well-positioned to weather the growing crisis, but some smaller ones have a perilous front row seat as the diminished river threatens to cut off their water supply completely. Page is one of them. Pilot pointed down to Glen Canyon Dam, a 700-foot-tall concrete behemoth that looms large in the background. “There’s a pipeline that’s bored through the cliff of Glen Canyon,” Pilot said. “It comes to the edge, just past us here, and goes straight up into another pipeline that goes up to our water plant.” That pipe brings water up from the river hundreds of feet below. But the system is under threat. Page pulls its water from Lake Powell, the nation’s second-largest reservoir, which is held back by Glen Canyon Dam. Inside the dam, a pipe siphons water to Page as it passes from the reservoir to the river on the other side. Drought and steady demand have drained the reservoir to historic lows, putting Page’s drinking water system in jeopardy. Bryan Hill, general manager of Page Utility Enterprises – the city’s water and electric provider – is tasked with keeping taps flowing in the cliffside city. He grapples with the historic missteps, both recent and decades-old. “They never anticipated the lake actually dropping down to a level where Page was going to struggle to get water,” he said. “That just simply wasn’t anticipated. That’s why we’re scrambling to make a design mod down there now.” Hill is referring to an ongoing rework of the pipes inside the dam. If the reservoir drops below Page’s current intake, water would flow through a set of backup pipes known as the “river outlet works.” Originally designed as a channel for extra water during high-flow times, those tubes, which are lower than the existing pass-through, could soon be the only way for water to make it through the dam. Without a fix, Lake Powell could have dropped low enough to cut off Page’s drinking water supply completely. A welder inside Glen Canyon Dam works on new pipes to pull Colorado River water hundreds of feet up to Page. If water levels in Lake Powell keep dropping, those backup tubes could be the only way for water to make it through the dam. (Photo by Alex Hager/KUNC) Inside the dam this fall, a team of welders has been working to put together new pipes that will connect Page to those river outlet tubes, making sure water still flows to the city even if the reservoir drops to an extremely low level. The new pipes also will help supply water to the neighboring LeChee chapter of the Navajo Nation. This is shaping up to be a relatively easy fix. The modifications only cost $60,000 to $80,000, Hill said, and are slated to be finished this month. “We’re proud of the Reclamation staff at the Glen Canyon Field Division for coming up with this cost efficient, relatively effortless solution,” said Bob Martin, the Bureau of Reclamation’s deputy power manager at the dam. “And it’s a positive step forward in maintaining the dependability of the area’s water supply during this time of increased risk.” But a much bigger addition may be needed to give Page lasting peace of mind. A ‘second straw’ Hill already knows what’s next on the to-do list: add redundancy. A lengthy 2004 report called for the construction of a “second straw,” another pipe upstream of the dam that would carry Colorado River water through hundreds of feet of rock and keep water flowing to Page should anything happen to the current intake within the dam. But that would be an expensive project. The report, which was authored near the beginning of the two-decade-long megadrought that has thrust the Colorado River Basin into a supply-demand crisis, put a $46 million price tag on that second straw. Page won’t be able to scrape together that much through rate hikes, Hill said. “You’re not going to get that kind of money out of 3,500 water customers,” he said. “People would just leave.” Hill thinks the federal government should be on the hook for that project. Page is on the map only because of the dam and Lake Powell. The city originally was a housing camp for workers building and operating the dam in the late 1950s. Now, it’s a base camp for many of the 2 million annual visitors who come to the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area to boat around Lake Powell and camp on its shores. The dam was built and is operated by the Bureau of Reclamation, the same agency which published the report recommending a second straw. “In the mid-70s,” Hill said, “(Reclamation) essentially said, ‘You know what, we really don’t want to run this town anymore. We want to run the dam, but we don’t want to run out of town,’ and flipped the keys to the kids and said, ‘Good luck.’” Page has requested federal funding but hasn’t received it. This fall, water managers and utilities departments around the arid Southwest got a glimmer of hope that their projects might get a financial boost when $4 billion from the federal Inflation Reduction Act was designated for drought mitigation work in the Colorado River Basin. After that announcement, Reclamation set aside some of that money to pay farmers to conserve water, but also hinted that some will be used to upgrade outdated water infrastructure. Reclamation officials say they’re still committed to working with Page and the Navajo Nation to offer assistance where appropriate.

It’s here, on the dusty precipice, that water from the river is redirected into homes, hotels and restaurants in this tourist town. As the once-mighty Colorado shrinks in the hands of a changing climate, communities that rely on it are starting to feel the pinch. Many large cities in the Southwest are well-positioned to weather the growing crisis, but some smaller ones have a perilous front row seat as the diminished river threatens to cut off their water supply completely. Page is one of them. Pilot pointed down to Glen Canyon Dam, a 700-foot-tall concrete behemoth that looms large in the background. “There’s a pipeline that’s bored through the cliff of Glen Canyon,” Pilot said. “It comes to the edge, just past us here, and goes straight up into another pipeline that goes up to our water plant.” That pipe brings water up from the river hundreds of feet below. But the system is under threat. Page pulls its water from Lake Powell, the nation’s second-largest reservoir, which is held back by Glen Canyon Dam. Inside the dam, a pipe siphons water to Page as it passes from the reservoir to the river on the other side. Drought and steady demand have drained the reservoir to historic lows, putting Page’s drinking water system in jeopardy. Bryan Hill, general manager of Page Utility Enterprises – the city’s water and electric provider – is tasked with keeping taps flowing in the cliffside city. He grapples with the historic missteps, both recent and decades-old. “They never anticipated the lake actually dropping down to a level where Page was going to struggle to get water,” he said. “That just simply wasn’t anticipated. That’s why we’re scrambling to make a design mod down there now.” Hill is referring to an ongoing rework of the'}]"

Howard Fischer, Capitol Media Services//September 30, 2022// State wins major legal victory in fight over federal immigration policies Howard Fischer, Capitol Media Services//September 30, 2022// Arizona has won a significant legal victory in its battle over federal immigration policies. U.S. District Court Judge Michael Liburdi has given state Attorney General Mark Brnovich permission to pursue his claims that the Biden administration acted illegally when it enacted policies that have allowed hundreds of thousands of undocumented individuals to be released in this country. Those policies, Brnovich contends, have abdicated the federal government’s responsibility. Liburdi, in his 27-page ruling, rejected efforts by the administration to dismiss the case as beyond the purview of the court. He said judges have the ability to determine whether policies comport with federal law. The ruling does not guarantee that the state will win the lawsuit seeking to void the policies. That will come after a trial where Brnovich will need to prove his legal claims. But the attorney general, who has waged war with the administration on multiple fronts, already has cleared a significant legal hurdle. Liburdi said that, despite claims to the contrary by federal lawyers, Brnovich has standing to challenge the policies. That’s because there is reason to believe the state has been financially damaged by the presence of all the people that the attorney general contends should have been either detained or deported as he alleges the law requires. Central to the court fight are laws dealing with what is supposed to happen to anyone who arrives in the United States or is present but “has not been admitted.” In this March 2, 2019, file photo, a Customs and Border Control agent patrols on the U.S. side of a razor-wire-covered border wall along Mexico east of Nogales, Ariz. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) Aside from some who are initially determined to be inadmissible due to various reasons, like fraud, the law generally requires that they “shall be detained” for a removal proceeding unless an immigration officer decides they are “clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted.” Those arriving by land can be returned to the border country from which they came as an alternative to being detained. The law also says that applicants for admission may be released on parole “only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.” What makes all that relevant to the lawsuit is the claim by Brnovich that the Biden administration, rather than acting selectively, released more than 225,000 undocumented individuals into the country between the time he took office and when he filed his latest version of his complaint a year ago. More to the point, Brnovich said these individuals were served not with a “notice to appear,” a legally recognized document that initiates removal proceedings. Instead, they were served with a “notice to report,” something the attorney general says does not exist in immigration laws. And he contends about 80% of those served with those latter documents do not show up. “The Biden administration is thus giving tens of thousands of aliens per month, in essence, license to disappear into the interior of the United States,” Brnovich said. In seeking to have the case dismissed, the Department of Justice claimed that Brnovich and the state have no legal standing because they “cannot demonstrate any actual or imminent injury caused by the challenged policies.” Liburdi, however, said there is evidence to the contrary. He cited just the area of medical services provided to those not in the country legally. “Federal law requires Arizona to provide emergency medical services to all individuals regardless of their immigration status,” the judge said. “Consistent with that requirement, Arizona delivers millions of dollars in medical services to unlawfully present noncitizens each year.” What Brnovich is arguing is that the refusal of federal immigration officials to detain or remove aliens, coupled with their expansive use of the parole authority, increases the number of undocumented individuals in Arizona. And what that means, he told the judge, is the administration’s lax immigration policies have increased — and will continue to increase — the state’s healthcare costs. “This argument comports with common sense,” Liburdi said. “If plaintiffs are right that defendants’ detention and parole policies are inconsistent with federal statutes, and the government should accordingly detain noncitizens rather than release them into the United States’ interior, then those policies injure Arizona because they lead to releasing more undocumented aliens into the state than if defendants followed the law,” he said. Liburdi cited data provided by the state from the Yuma Regional Medical Center, which provided care to more than 100 noncitizens in United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody during February, March and April of 2021, the three months after the administration changed its policies. Brnovich said that in February of 2020 alone, the cost to provide care to noncitizens was $591,602, more than double the average monthly cost of care for the preceding nine months. And he said these costs are neither fully reimbursable from the federal government or the patients themselves, which means the balance is borne, in large part, by Arizonans. “Plaintiffs have met their burden to show they have suffered a concrete and particularized injury,” Liburdi concluded, citing the increased cost of medical services. The judge also said that the lawsuit meets the second part of the test — that the claimed damages are both traceable to the conduct of the administration and that the injury can be redressed with a court order to the government to follow the law. Liburdi brushed aside arguments by the federal government that the whole issue is legally moot because it no longer uses “notices to report.” He noted the attorneys never represented that they cannot simply reinstate the program. No date has been set for a trial.

Please give us a call at 520-458-9440 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy Kay Cameron waits at the ramp entrance of Cornerstone Bible Church to greet senior citizens who might like to join Gathering Old Geezers, a new club that will have its first meeting Friday. WILLCOX — When the pandemic shut down Willcox’s senior center, it left a hole in the senior social scene. Now meet Kay Cameron, a determined 77-year-old woman who will not let a closed building or a pandemic stop her. You can actually meet Cameron in person at the first meeting of the Gathering Old Geezers, a new “club” for seniors she is organizing to replace the closed senior center. She’s doing it, she said, because she simply saw a need. “I went to the senior center, the one behind the hospital, and it was closed, and I couldn’t believe it after all this time,” she said. “I thought, ‘People are just sitting home in their apartment.’ ” Seniors don’t have to just sit there anymore. The first meeting of the Gathering Old Geezers will take place from 1 to 4 p.m. Friday at Cornerstone Bible Church, 612 W. Delos St. Cameron is quick to say the church is simply a meeting place, that the group is not about religion; it’s just where her son is pastor and made the space available to Cameron. Once she fixed on the idea of a meeting and secured the space, Cameron began gathering games from thrift stores and now has Yahtzee, Pictionary, checkers, chess and Sorry, to name a few. At the first meeting on Friday, Cameron hopes to assess what participants might be interested in doing and how often they might like to meet. She is willing to meet twice a month but for now, the meetings will take place on the third Friday of each month. Among the activities Cameron has planned are board- and card games, chair aerobics and crafts, but it really depends on what the group wants, and that will be determined at the first meeting. “The first meeting is going to be a kind of meet and greet,” she said. “I’m going to have snacks and explain what we’re going to do. We’re going to have chair aerobics. (Each) week, it’s going to be something different. I hope to do a calendar, so the people will know what’s going to go on that Friday.” Classes, games, supplies: it’s all going to be free. “I wanted to be able to do (this) with no cost,” Cameron said. Plus, you don’t have to be vaccinated, boostered, or masked to come, Cameron said. “As far as that goes, my answer is, when you’re older, if you’re sick I hope you have enough sense to stay home,” she said. “I’ve had my shots; I’ve had my booster. I’m not particularly worried about it ... I feel that choice is up to everybody and their own beliefs. If they want to wear a mask, that’s fine. I don’t think anybody is going to care.” Also, the entrance to the church has a ramp, which is the door Cameron will use, so everyone will find accessibility. There are also handicap-accessible bathrooms. Basically, the Gathering Old Geezers will be a place for seniors to come together and have a bit of fun. “It’s a place to come to make new friends,” Cameron said. “It’s not going to cost them anything. Everybody is always free to bring something to share, but that’s not a necessity. Stuff will be there for people to do, if they want to do it.” For information, call Cameron, 520-248-1190.

Please give us a call at 520-375-5760 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy Densely populated residential areas of Nogales, like this downtown neighborhood, offer little room for new housing units in the city. In recent years, high demand for housing has run up against limited residential inventory, leading to shortages and rising rents and home costs. After Kerri Muñoz’s son and his girlfriend finished college, they attempted to find housing in Santa Cruz County. The options were scarce. So, Muñoz said, the couple moved to Sahuarita instead. “They just couldn’t find a place to rent here in Santa Cruz County,” she added, speaking to a half-filled room at the Rio Rico Community Center on Nov. 16. That afternoon, about a dozen residents piled into the center to address the same, lingering question: What can be done about the county’s affordable housing shortage? Now, a national association is working with the county government to identify potential solutions. Earlier this year, Santa Cruz County was awarded 120 hours of technical assistance from the National Association for Latino Community Asset Builders, or NALCAB, a Texas-based nonprofit that specializes in housing development, among other areas. On Nov. 16, Angie Donelson – another consultant working with the county – passed out surveys to the handful of participants. “We’re going to compile these responses,” she said, “to look at a summary of what stakeholders say are important to them.” The forum included a small selection of residents – mainly individuals involved in the county’s education, nonprofit and housing sectors. After gathering feedback from this group, consultants will publish a draft of a housing strategy online, allowing more members of the public to weigh in, according to Jeanne Shaw, a consultant with NALCAB. Already, NALCAB has conducted a preliminary study on housing in Santa Cruz County, uncovering issues often acknowledged by residents: A lack of affordable housing stock. High poverty rates. Stagnant development in flood hazard areas. After conducting the study, it became clear that residents need more housing options within the county, Shaw said. And if they don’t get those options, they could move elsewhere – the way Muñoz’s son and his girlfriend did. Recurring problems When the Santa Cruz Valley Unified School District hires a new teacher, they’re generally able to find housing – but it’s not always an ideal situation. John Fanning, the district’s community outreach coordinator, described crowded accommodations for educators who move into the county. “It’s just very difficult to find housing where they’re not sleeping on top of each other, which is what we’re seeing,” Fanning noted during the forum in Rio Rico. John Fanning of the Santa Cruz Valley Unified School District ponders a talking point during the Nov. 16 forum. Other housing problems persist, depending on the location. In a previous story published in the NI, residents described year-long waitlists for local apartment complexes. In Sonoita, according to the NALCAB study, rental units are virtually non-existent. Across the county, NALCAB’s study found, many homeowners and renters are cost-burdened – meaning they spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing expenses. What’s more, as the study confirmed, property values are rising. Between September 2021 and September 2022, the average sales price for a house in Santa Cruz County shot up from about $312,000 to nearly $395,000 – an increase of more than 26 percent, according to the Multiple Listing Service of Southern Arizona. Fanning said he’s noticed new homes being built in his own Rio Rico neighborhood. Still, affordable housing in the county remains limited. “We’re talking here about not having housing. But yet all these houses are going up,” he said. “To me, it just doesn’t match. Are those the houses that are outlandishly expensive that people aren’t buying?” Examining the floodplain Residents at the forum didn’t hesitate to offer up housing solutions: Incentives for developers. Grants and loans for homeowners. New zoning laws. And then, there was the floodplain. “We all know insurance and building costs go up when you’re in a floodplain,” pointed out Chris Young, chief deputy of the County Superintendent of Schools’ Office. “Is there a way to re-examine the floodplain?” asked Fanning. “And if there is a way to do so, can we move forward with that?” Many properties in Santa Cruz County – including numerous in downtown Nogales – are situated in a federally identified flood hazard area. That designation complicates the building process with extra permit requirements and inspections. Revising a floodplain map is possible, though it’s a multi-step process, according to Jesus Valdez, the county’s public works director. First, Valdez told the NI in an email, someone would need to commission a hydraulic study of the area. Then, a letter requesting the floodplain change would be submitted to FEMA. If a local government or property owner wanted to change the designation, they’d have to implement a construction project to diminish “peak flow” of potential floodwaters, Valdez added. Johany Rivera, a program manager at the National Association for Latino Community Asset Builders, speaks with a colleague at a Nov. 16 housing forum in Rio Rico. Workforce needs Another question hung in the air during the Wednesday forum: How will the Hermosa Mine Project affect housing in Santa Cruz County? Currently, South32 – the Australian company behind the project in the Patagonia Mountains – is predicting that 2,000 workers will be employed in the mine’s construction. During the mine’s life, South32 estimates, between 400 and 500 people will be directly employed full-time. Addressing the growing workforce, Shaw noted, “those people need to live somewhere.” However, it doesn’t seem that there’s any permanent housing plans in the works to accommodate a boom in the population, in part because South32 has stated it plans to hire residents who already live in the county. South32 has concluded that for now, there is “adequate availability” of housing, in terms of its construction phase. During that phase, a spokesperson told the NI, some construction workers will only require short-term housing – like living in an RV park or a hotel room. “Looking ahead to when mining begins, we continue to support regional planning efforts and private-public partnerships to solve the housing issue, which is a challenge countywide, not just for South32,” added spokesperson Jenny Fiore-Magaña in an email. What’s more, Fiore-Magaña added, “many of our future employees are already living here.” Getting the word out As residents brainstormed ideas, Corina Fragozo addressed the room: Some solutions, she pointed out, already exist. “I think education out to the community of programs that are available is something that has to happen,” said Fragozo, rural community development director for Chicanos por la Causa . Liza Gonzalez (left) and Corina Fragozo of Chicanos por la Causa take notes during a Nov. 16 housing forum in Rio Rico. Currently, Fragozo said, CPLC has active programs designed to help prospective homeowners. The organization’s Self-Help program creates a path to homeownership for low-income residents. In return for the subsidized housing costs, program participants put hours of work into constructing the homes themselves. Currently, Fragozo said, the organization has a waitlist of nearly 70 clients hoping to enroll in CPLC’s local programming. And with that demand, CPLC developers are looking for land within the county. “We’re looking for lots to purchase. We have funding available,” Fragozo said. Fragozo also urged the City of Nogales and the county to take more active roles in searching for grants. Speaking for a previous story, Fragozo had mentioned similar ideas: Nogales, she said, could qualify for federal grants like Community Development Block Grants and the HOME Investment Partnerships Program. “There is a lot of money there that the city and the county could obtain. And there is no one that is pursuing those grants,” she added on Nov. 16. Using federal funds Both the City of Nogales and Santa Cruz County received millions of COVID-19 relief dollars from the American Rescue Plan Act, a federal stimulus package. Legally, that money can go toward housing projects. The Nogales City Council voted to funnel the money into two main efforts: paying down police and fire pensions, and using the rest to fund city operations. No money went directly to the Nogales Housing Authority, which oversees low-income housing. However, at the time of the last ARPA vote, Mayor Arturo Garino noted that one chunk of the money – about $357,000 – could still be used to offer certain service-related discounts to new businesses and homeowners in town. For its part, the county used its ARPA funds to balance its budget, incentivize vaccination, roll out an internet expansion program, and award forgivable loans and grants to local businesses and nonprofits. A few of those grants went toward housing-related nonprofits, including Nogales Community Development, Community Homes of Patagonia, and Rebuilding Together Santa Cruz County. District 3 County Supervisor Bruce Bracker, who sat in on the Rio Rico forum, added that the county currently doesn’t levy impact fees for developers. Still, he acknowledged that more needed'}]"

Casi un año después de incursionar en el mercado de Tucsón, la cadena de sopas y ensaladas Salad and Go, original de Gilbert, Arizona, tiene planes de expandir su huella en Tucsón con tres nuevas sucursales. Se espera que la primera, en 1302 S. Kolb Road cerca de 22nd Street, abra el 7 de agosto y un vocero de la compañía dijo que comenzó la construcción de una ubicación en el lado noroeste en 2080 W. River Road, cerca de La Cholla Blvd., que se espera que abra a principios de 2023. La compañía todavía está en las etapas de planificación y permisos para otra ubicación en 7980 E. Speedway, cerca de Camino Seco, y no se ha anunciado una fecha de apertura. Salad and Go se presentó en Tucsón en agosto de 2021 en su primera ubicación, 5501 E. Speedway, cerca de North Craycroft Road. En cuestión de meses, se abrió una segunda ubicación en el bullicioso Tucson Marketplace del lado sur en Bridges, cerca de Costco y Dave & Buster’s, en 1730 E. Tucson Marketplace Blvd. Todo en Salad and Go está preparado para llevar, de ahí el nombre, pero en lugar de servir comida rápida poco saludable como hamburguesas y frituras, el menú de Salad and Go se centra en lo saludable. El pollo al horno o a la parrilla o el tofu se pueden agregar a generosas ensaladas verdes cubiertas con vegetales frescos que muchas veces se obtienen localmente de los agricultores del área. Las ensaladas y los wraps, que tú mismo puedes crear a partir de una lista de verduras, lechugas y proteínas disponibles, cuestan $6.24. También puedes hacer que la ensalada sea aún más fácil de llevar envolviéndola en una tortilla, un burro de ensalada, lo que también sirve como ancla para las cinco variedades de burritos de desayuno, incluidos los burritos de salchicha de pavo y el clásico de huevo, papa y tocino (sin nitrato, por supuesto). Y si pides una de sus sopas y una ensalada, tienes una comida completa. Salad and Go se lanzó en Gilbert en 2013 y ya tiene casi 50 ubicaciones en todo el estado, así como más de 40 restaurantes abiertos o a punto de abrir en Texas, y uno en Oklahoma.

The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has started reducing flows out of Lake Powell in an effort to prevent the lake surface from approaching the minimum power pool elevation (MPPE), where Glen Canyon Dam can no longer effectively generate electricity. The reason for the reduction is lower-than-expected mountain moisture in November 2021. The new flows started on Jan. 1 and will continue until April. If future projections reveal that the current releases are insufficient to protect Lake Powell, the bureau will consider further modifying flows, depending on precipitation in the Upper Colorado River watershed, including releasing more water from Flaming Gorge, Blue Mesa and Navajo reservoirs. MPPE is 3,490 feet and poses a risk of allowing air into the turbines and other power-generating equipment inside the dam. Air can damage the equipment and reduce the amount of electricity available for surrounding states. The lower levels at Lake Powell can result in an energy shortage in addition to a water shortage. Decreasing lake levels also decrease the generation capacity of the dam. As of Jan. 5, 2022, the lake elevation was 3,536 feet, or 164 feet below “full pool” elevation of 3,700 feet. The bureau has established a target elevation of 3,525 feet, the critical stage elevation, 11 feet below the Jan. 5 level, leaving a 35-foot buffer above MPPE. “Dead pool” is at elevation 3,370 feet, some 120 feet below MPPE. On Jan. 5, the lake was 166 feet above dead pool. At dead pool, the low water level results in no water being able to flow out of Glen Canyon Dam. The latest bureau predictions, based on data measured last month, suggest that the target elevation of 3,525 may occur as soon as February 2022. Typically, inflows to Lake Powell are the lowest when the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains and San Juan Mountains of Colorado, the mountains of southwestern Wyoming and eastern Utah are historically covered in deep snow. While the watershed saw a wetter-than-normal October, it was followed by the second-driest November on record, resulting in a loss of around 1.5 million acre-feet of water flowing into Lake Powell for November.

KINGMAN — One man was killed Friday night when a minor accident turned into a major one on a stretch of Historic Route 66 between Kingman and Peach Springs in Mohave County. The Northern Arizona Fire District, which serves about 69 square miles of Mohave County north and east of Kingman, was dispatched at 5:30 p.m. Friday to an accident near Mile Marker 81 on Route 66, near Hackberry, northeast of Kingman and southwest of Peach Springs. ""Units arrived on scene of a three-vehicle collision with heavy damage,"" NAFD said in a brief report. ""Initial reports indicated that a minor accident had possibly occurred between two vehicles. Shortly after, a third vehicle struck one of the first two vehicle at a high rate of speed, causing a major secondary collision."" NAFD said that one person, who was not publicly identified, was pronounced dead at the scene. NAFD had no information about any other injuries from the crash. ""The cause is still under investigation,"" NAFD said. The department said the accident should ""serve as a reminder to slow down when approaching parked vehicles on or near the roadway and to always practice safe-driving techniques, especially at night."" It was at least the third fatality accident in a little more than a year on the segment of Route 66 between Kingman and Peach Springs. Three people were killed in a two-vehicle crash near Mile Marker 64 in July and four died in a head-on collision at Mile Marker 90 last December. Log In Keep it Clean.

(928) 779-4492. 10-11 a.m., ALL ARE WELCOME! You BELONG at Beacon. Spiritually open and intentionally inclusive since 1958.

This sermon will explore the Call of The Elder in each of us as a resource of resiliency, endurance, and renewal. Rev. Anthony Mtuaswa Johnson preaching, with Worship Associate Nancy Paxton and music from Austin Shaw. Rev. Anthony is the minister of the Sedona UU Fellowship. Rev.

Bikers Against Child Abuse riders may look gruff on the outside with their tattoos and leather jackets, but the caring bikers help empower abused children. They use road names for safety and are there for the kids 24 hours a day, seven days a week. “We’re there so that an abused child who is afraid can live the life that a normal kid should have. And we do that just by showing up,” said Woodstock, BACA member and treasurer of the Maricopa County chapter. “It’s amazing how much showing up for a child who’s been abused and been disappointed by adults their whole lives — it’s amazing how much showing up really does empower a child.” The process starts when an abused child’s guardian calls the BACA Arizona Helpline. A child liaison returns the call to discuss the child’s situation. Woodstock said the trained child liaison knows the specifics about the child’s situation, while the other members only know that he or she needs their help. From there, if BACA board members deem this is a child they can help, the organization does a level one interaction, which is its first visit to invite the child to be part of the organization. Turtle, who lives near Bell Road and is vice president of the Black Canyon BACA chapter, said it’s a great moment and a spectacle to see. “This is the first interaction with the child where we will actually set up a time where the whole chapter can ride out and meet that child for the first time,” Turtle said. “And when we ride in, it’s kind of an occasion. Then we initiate them by giving them a cut to make them feel like they have that biker family.” The “cut” is a vest with a BACA patch on it, which the kids can choose whether or not to wear. The child is then assigned two primaries, those who are the main point of contact and do routine checks and visits to ensure the child’s safety and work toward removing fear from his or her life. BACA also goes to court with the kids, to provide support for the child during a stressful time. And, while the organization does not condone violence, its mission states that “if circumstances arise such that we are the only obstacle preventing a child from further abuse, we stand ready to be that obstacle.” “That biker mentality of family comes into place where we don’t have to be blood to be family,” Turtle said. “We are always there for one another. And that reputation as a biker definitely helps us in the case of the perp, but it also helps us with the kids because when they get to know us, they know we’re just teddy bears. But they know we’re teddy bears that are going to do anything to protect them.” Being a biker isn’t a free pass to join the group, though, and Turtle said there is an extensive process to become a primary. After attending three group meetings, those interested in being a primary undergo a background check. Once the background check has cleared, the person will become eligible to start the “supporter” process and serve in that role for over a year to learn policies and procedures. After that time, and if approved by the board, the person will be promoted to full membership status and an honored primary. The organization was founded in 1995 and now covers 48 states and 22 countries. Woodstock said the organization is growing strong, but the problem is increasing even faster. He said the latest studies show there were more than 51,000 cases of child abuse in Arizona annually. Both Turtle and Woodstock said they have seen the positive impact BACA can have for the kids. While they admitted the kids are sometimes a little intimidated at first, they always open up and seem to feel more confident. “When we do the level one interaction and we roll in, we wake up the neighborhood,” Woodstock said. “We’re parking all these bikes in front of the child’s house and sometimes the child will be hiding behind mom. After a few minutes, though, that child will come around after we introduce ourselves. Pretty soon, they’re walking up and down the street looking at the motorcycles with us.” Turtle said adults have repeatedly disappointed these kids. Being a reliable constant in the kids’ life is a huge part of making them feel safe. He said the primaries try to be available at any time, whether it’s responding to a text or showing up in person. “We always tell the kids that they can reach out to us 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” Turtle said. “We’ve had kids call us at 1 a.m. just to see if we will answer the phone and if we can talk them through some of their nightmares.
