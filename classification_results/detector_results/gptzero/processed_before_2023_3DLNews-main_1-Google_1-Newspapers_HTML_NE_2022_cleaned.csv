He focused on the achievements and fumbles of their high school years, emphasizing the value of such experiences. Hutsell boots four goals in postseason win With Aurora’s season on the line, its most decorated player in recent team history made sure it didn’t end quite yet. Ellie Hutsell found the back of the net four times, tying her school record from a year ago for most goals in a game as Aurora downed York 5-1 on a windy, rainy Saturday morning from the Cornerstone soccer complex in Aurora. Aurora coach Micayla Dunn was happy with the effort the entire team brought to the field Saturday despite the conditions, noting Hutsell’s solid play of late has come at the expense of racking up goals. That, of course, changed Saturday. “She has been working so hard the last few games and just couldn’t find the back of the net,” the coach said. “She made it personal and took the game over. She was unstoppable.” To read more of any of this week's top stories, please see this week's print or e-edition.

OMAHA -- Nebraska agriculture experts are closely monitoring the situation in Ukraine and its possible effects on commodity prices and production. A Russian invasion and blockade of Ukraine jeopardizes the latter country’s wheat exports, which account for 12% of the world’s total, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. To prevent supply chain issues, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack recently told the Associated Press, American farmers will boost wheat production in the event that a full Russian invasion of Ukraine chokes off agricultural exports. “If something happens (in Ukraine) … it’s going to create some uncertainty and volatility,” said Jay Reppe, senior economist for Nebraska Farm Bureau. With Ukraine also being a major corn exporter, one possible impact of a Russian invasion would be price spikes of the two commodities. Reppe acknowledged that could be beneficial to Nebraska farmers who produce those crops. He added that it could give the United States more opportunities to bolster its trade relationships with China and the Middle East — two regions that already are major importers of U.S. corn and wheat crops. Partly in response to the crisis, the futures market on wheat and corn commodities have reflected price increases. As of Wednesday afternoon, the price of a bushel of corn was $6.82 and a bushel of wheat was trading at $8.75. Those prices, Reppe said, were up 27 and 80 cents, respectively, compared to Friday\'s prices. With Nebraska’s winter wheat already rooted, farmers may look to maximize their yields with additional fertilizer applications, assuming it comes out of dormancy in good shape, said Cory Walters, an associate professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s agricultural economics department.
