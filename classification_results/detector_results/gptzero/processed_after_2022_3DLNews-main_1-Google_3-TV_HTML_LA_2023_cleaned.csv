Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) asserts Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) flew down to Mar-a-Lago three weeks after the Jan. 6, 2021, riots on the Capitol because former President Trump was “not eating.” In her new book, “Oath and Honor,” — set to be released on Dec. 5 — Cheney said she was bewildered by McCarthy’s reason for his visit to the former president’s residence so shortly after the insurrection, according to CNN, who obtained an advanced copy of Cheney’s book. She also claims the former House Speaker told her that Trump’s staff called for him to come. “Mar-a-Lago? What the hell, Kevin?” Cheney asked, per CNN. “They’re really worried,” he replied, according to her book. “Trump’s not eating, so they asked me to come see him.” “What? You went to Mar-a-Lago because Trump’s not eating?” Cheney said. “Yeah, he’s really depressed,” McCarthy added. Cheney, who has emerged as an outspoken critic of the former president since the Jan. 6 riot, recalled another incident in her book where a fellow GOP lawmaker labeled Trump as “Orange Jesus.” While in the House, she was one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump following the Capitol riots. She also served as the vice chair on the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection. In “Oath and Honor,” CNN also reported that Cheney says that McCarthy told her Trump was aware that he had lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden — and had told him so two days after the election. “He knows it’s over,” McCarthy told Cheney after speaking with Trump, CNN reported. “He needs to go through all the stages of grief,” he added. The Hill has reached out to McCarthy’s office for comment. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Lopinto said a former employee, who was terminated within the last week, showed up unannounced and shot and killed two of his coworkers. According to Lopinto, the two employees killed were men, and the suspect targeted people who were on his crew. The suspect is accused of calling his mother after the shooting to pick him up at the shipyard. The suspect\'s mother drove him to the St. Germain Apartment Complex on Manhattan Boulevard, where he was shot and killed.

No deputies or other apartment residents were hurt in the shooting, but other apartments were damaged by gunfire. Lopinto has not released the name of the suspect at this time but the Jefferson Parish coroner\'s office identified the suspect as 31-year-old Willis Thomas, Jr. The family of the deceased employees were at the scene.

Dr. Gerry Cvitanovich added there were gunshot wounds to the arms, legs, torso and one had a gunshot wound to the head, but would not confirm which victim. Many of the shots were from behind, which Dr. Cvitanovich says indicates the victims were running away.

The Colorado State Supreme Court ruled on Dec. 19 that Trump’s actions on Jan. 6, 2021, constituted participating in an insurrection and prevented him from running for office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. That ruling itself overturned a lower court’s ruling that, while he had participated in the insurrection, the office of president was not included under the so-called insurrection clause in the 14th Amendment. Now, the Colorado GOP has appealed the state Supreme Court’s ruling to the United States Supreme Court, which triggers a stay in that ruling. Under the stay, Trump’s name will be allowed as a candidate unless the U.S. Supreme Court declines to take the case or otherwise affirms the Colorado Supreme Court ruling. The deadline for Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold to certify the primary ballots is Jan. 5, meaning that if the Supreme Court doesn’t decide by then, Trump’s name will appear on the primary ballot when Republican voters decide who to support on March 5. An additional appeal to the Colorado State Supreme Court’s decision is expected to be filed by Trump’s legal team. Submit Δ Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Prosecutors’ motion asks the court to bar Trump and his lawyers from introducing evidence that suggests he is being selectively prosecuted, that prosecutors are coordinating with the Biden administration or that foreign actors interfered in the 2020 presidential election. It further urges U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, an Obama appointee who is overseeing the trial proceedings in Washington, to prohibit certain evidence related to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Prosecutors are seeking to prevent Trump from placing blame on the National Guard or the D.C. mayor for the attack or claiming to jurors that undercover officers were present at the Capitol. “Allowing the defendant to introduce evidence about undercover actors would inevitably lead to confusing minitrials on collateral issues, such as the identities and intentions of the alleged undercover actors,” prosecutors wrote. “For example, it may require the Government to introduce evidence to show that people whom the defendant alleges were undercover actors actually were his vehement supporters.” Trump is charged in the case with four federal felonies, accusing him of conspiring to subvert the election results. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. The trial is currently slated for March 4, the first scheduled in Trump’s four criminal cases as he campaigns to return to the White House. But that trial date has increasingly come into doubt as Trump appeals his presidential immunity and double jeopardy defenses. Trial proceedings are on hold until his appeal is resolved. But, set on keeping the schedule on track, prosecutors have continued to meet the various pre-trial deadlines currently halted, including Wednesday’s deadline to make any requests to exclude evidence. Prosecutors’ motion comes after a bid from Trump to have the case dismissed, arguing he is facing a “vindictive” prosecution from a team determined to hamper his electoral prospects. Smith’s team Wednesday said Trump has raised “wholly false claims such as the Government’s non-existent ‘coordination with the Biden Administration’ and other empty allegations.” And in another prior motion, Trump’s team asked for information on “informants and other undercover operatives” as well as unclassified assessments prepared by the intelligence community about the security of the 2020 election. Chutkan had not yet ruled on those matters before proceedings in the case were paused amid his appeal on the immunity issue. The last time Smith’s office pressed ahead with the original schedule, Trump’s lawyers chided prosecutors and said their actions were unlawful. “Although the prosecution may wish to rush this case to an early and unconstitutional trial in hopes of undermining President Trump’s commanding lead in the upcoming Presidential election, it must nonetheless abide by the Stay Order,” Trump attorney John Lauro told prosecutors in a letter earlier this month. “As such, we will not accept or review the present production, or any additional productions, until and unless the Court lifts the Stay Order. If the prosecution continues to violate the Stay Order, we will seek appropriate relief,” Lauro’s letter continued. Trump’s immunity appeal is now proceeding in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, where the former president has asked a three-judge panel to toss his indictment. Oral arguments are scheduled for Jan. 9, and after the panel’s ruling, the appeal could then head to the full D.C. Circuit bench or the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court last week rejected Smith’s gambit to leap-frog the D.C. Circuit and immediately take up the issue to resolve it sooner, a tactic that would’ve sped up Trump’s trial timeline.

final roadway test, and her instructor. They made it out of the 168-vehicle crash alive, unharmed and without a scratch on their car. Instructor Gisela Chevalier said she got into her J&G International Driving School car Monday morning (Oct. 23) to test a student on the I-10 to I-55 route she’s used for years. “I’m not afraid of fog. So, I told my student, ‘Don’t be afraid of fog,’” Chevalier said. “We have to drive on foggy days, on rainy days, so that’s OK.” But on this foggy day, visibility dropped to near zero on I-55 near Manchac. Chevalier’s student driver was behind the wheel. In front of their car was a flatbed trailer. Coming up behind them, a double 18-wheeler. They both slammed on the brake and hoped for the best. “I’m very proud of her, because she did what we taught her to do,” Chevalier said. “We are here because she handled it really good. Really brave.” Chevalier was happy with her driver, but critical of those sharing the road that morning. “A lot of cars were passing -- a little bit of speeding -- due to the smoke and fog. In my opinion, they were a little bit too fast,” Chevalier said. “A lot of them with the lights off. And that’s why that state trooper was almost going from car to car, in his car, ‘Hey turn the lights on.’ I had the automatic, but evidently it wasn’t enough.” Not soon after, the pileups began, 911 calls were made and dispatchers sent whomever they could to assist victims. “We do have everybody in route to y’all. Multiple fire departments, police and ambulance,” said an operator. “So, they’re coming that way, and they’ll get to you when they can.” Chevalier says the cars around hers were smashed beyond recognition. She and her student spent hours trapped on the bridge. They saw a fire truck driving in reverse to get to victims. They saw first responders getting out and walking where the road was impassable. And when it came time to give her student a final grade, she had no hesitation. “She was really calm, too,” Chevalier said. “She was at the wheel when all that happened. When we were ready to leave and turn around, I took the wheel, because I thought it was too much for her, honestly,” Chevalier said. “She’s a master. She made 100 (for her grade), no doubt about it. She earned it.” Chevalier says she graduated that driver’s husband as well, just last week. Chevalier also didn’t wait long to conquer the fear of riding again. She said another student was tested Tuesday morning in the same car, on roughly the same route, albeit modified by the closed stretch of I-55 still being cleared of wreckage.

Ron DeSantis took aim at former President Trump on Tuesday, claiming that the “swamp got worse’ when Trump was in the White House. DeSantis, in an interview with Fox News’s “The Ingraham Angle” on Tuesday, suggested that Trump did not do enough to hold people like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and FBI Director Christopher Wray accountable. Like a handful of other GOP presidential candidates, DeSantis has vowed to fire Wray if elected to the White House. “Well, he had three years to fire Christopher Wray, and he didn’t fire him,” DeSantis told host Laura Ingraham. “And, remember, I went to the rallies in 2016, Laura. You remember them, ‘lock her up, lock her up,’ about holding Hillary accountable.” “And then, two weeks after the election, he said, never mind that I said that and let her off the hook,” DeSantis continued. “And so I think, if you look at it — and I give him credit, even though we’re competing, for the great things he did do. But one of the things he did not do was drain the swamp. I mean, the swamp got worse in his four years.” DeSantis added that Trump “had people in power who were not getting the job done.” DeSantis also claimed that “very swift action” needed to be taken to hold people accountable, noting that — as president — “you have got to make it happen.” Over the course of several hours, GOP members on the House Judiciary Committee last month grilled Wray with questions about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and alleged bias in the investigative agency. Many Republicans have accused the Department of Justice (DOJ) and FBI of being politicized under President Biden as Trump faces two federal indictments handed up by the DOJ.

The four Latino Democrats in the chamber — who are not part of the talks — have made clear that the fundamental precept being negotiated is unacceptable to them. This week three of them, Sens. Ben Ray Luján (N.M.), Alex Padilla (Calif.) and Bob Menéndez (N.J.) joined eight other Senate Democrats, including Majority Whip Dick Durbin (Ill.), to decry the talks. “Using a one-time spending package to enact these unrelated permanent policy changes sets a dangerous precedent and risks assistance to our international partners. Any proposal considering permanent changes to our asylum and immigration system needs to include a clear path to legalization for long-standing undocumented immigrants,” they wrote. But the negotiations have explicitly excluded any form of legalization, while tying border policy and wartime aid to Ukraine, two previously unrelated issues. That core concept has made waves among immigration advocates outside Congress and in the House, where the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) and its allies have a larger contingent. Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) called the Ukraine-border amalgam “an aberration.” The Ukraine side of the deal is relatively simple, a question of opening the purse strings for the Biden administration to send much-needed aid to its Eastern European ally, a major priority for the administration, many Democrats and a fair share of Republicans. On the border policy side, talks are revolving over changes to tighten asylum policy — a concession immigration advocates don’t take lightly — and curbing the president’s immigration parole powers, blowing a hole in President Biden’s border strategy. Those are potential concessions immigration advocates would hope to avoid in tit-for-tat negotiations, let alone in a deal with no Republican concessions on immigration. Republicans have so far been successful at portraying both Ukraine funding and their border policy proposals as national security priorities. That’s making some Democrats nervous. “It’s going to be ugly. I think the Senate effectively is going to sell us out. And when I say us out, it’s not just border communities. It’s not just the issue of asylum seekers and refugees attempting to be in this country,” said Grijalva. “Allowing the Republicans to grab this narrative and to continue to attempt to poison with that narrative the upcoming election — because they see that it’s their issue, because they have no other issue — I think that’s what they sold out.” Other House Democrats also said they were surprised by the nature of the talks, including that limitations on immigration would be swapped for something wholly unrelated. “If we’re going to concede on policy, then the bill should be related or the concessions should be related to getting things on immigration and asylum reform and so forth. Not on issues of war or other funding,” one lawmaker said. And advocates say the core issue is being overlooked: The proposed changes threaten to endanger human lives. “The credible fear standard is being treated as a technical point that can be traded away, but in fact it’s the heart of the United States’ compliance with the Refugee Convention and if it’s out of reach, access to the entirety of the asylum system is blocked,” said Heidi Altman, director of policy at the National Immigrant Justice Center. “Heightening it would be historic … are these lawmakers just OK with knowing that the U.S. will be regularly sending bona fide refugees back to harm?” Lawmakers say those attitudes are par for the course. “For 200 years, 250 years in this country, immigrants have been a good political piñata to swing at. You know, this country is made of immigrants. ‘We’re all immigrants but yet we detest immigrants,'” said Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.). Regardless, the Senate negotiations have plowed on, attracting intense media attention. The talks have been reported to include Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). In public, each of the negotiators has played a different role. Tillis, for instance, has led the charge to include limits on parole; Cotton has been an advocate for including elements of H.R. 2, a House GOP border security bill that is a nonstarter with most, if not all, Democrats. The mediatization of the talks has rankled some participants. “There’s a big difference between people going to the press versus the people doing the work,” said a source close to the talks. That work, say immigration advocates, is leading Democrats into a trap. “My question is, what are Democrats getting in exchange for this type of deal? Democrats understandably and rightfully should support border security, a more orderly border – those are all important democratic values for voters,” said Andrea Flores, vice president for immigration policy and campaigns at FWD.us on a recent call with reporters. “But that is not what they’re getting here. And also, they’re showing Democratic voters that they’re willing to go through a whole negotiation, compromise on our values and not get a single, pro-immigrant Democratic priority in exchange.” A Democratic aide put it more succinctly. “Democrats are the ones putting themselves in a situation to eat a pile of s—.” But pressure to fund Israel and Ukraine is intensifying, and Republicans could end up forcing Senate Democrats to take a tough vote letting down either a foreign ally or a core constituency. Meanwhile, the White House is pushing Congress to act on a supplemental to fund aid to Israel and Ukraine, Indo-Pacific security and border security. “We want to see all four priorities taken up by Congress and all four funded. The reason why it’s a supplemental is because they’re all urgent. And as I said earlier, we’re running out of runway on Ukraine, and I would tell you the same thing for Israel,” White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Friday. The administration is likely to be more open to asylum changes than to parole restrictions, which would undermine President Biden’s border strategy. Biden press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday the administration had “had conversations with members of Congress” regarding the supplemental request. Jean-Pierre panned H.R. 2, but left the question open on Senate negotiations, saying, “as it relates to negotiations that are currently happening in Senate, with senators — right? — both Republicans and Democrats, we’re just not going to negotiate from here.” Still, it was the White House that originally mashed the four issues together in their supplemental request; the original border requests rankled some in the CHC, but to a much lesser degree than the current talks. With Senate Republicans supercharging the border provisions, many CHC legislators had hoped to see the White House stepping in to set boundaries. “I’m disappointed in the lack of communication and consideration that the White House is giving the Hispanic Caucus and our priorities,” said CHC Chair Rep. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.). “This is where I think the problem lies. Combining this aid was a mistake. And I think it should have never been done.” With House GOP opposition to the supplemental almost a certainty, a Senate deal — if it is reached and passed — will face an uphill battle in the lower chamber. And any bill that tightens border policy without loosening immigration laws seems likely to split apart the unity that has characterized House Democrats this congress. For some Democrats, that split won’t be a surprise. “They sold out the opportunity to actually stand for something a little more fundamental. And it’s — it’s not even disappointing, to some extent it’s expected from the center,” said Grijalva. —Updated Monday at 10:26 a.m. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.
