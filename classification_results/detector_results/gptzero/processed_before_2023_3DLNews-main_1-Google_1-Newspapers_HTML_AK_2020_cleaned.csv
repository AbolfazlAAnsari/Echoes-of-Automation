Courtesy of Glenn Sheckells The F/V Scandies Rose docked in Kodiak. BREMERTON — Dan Mattsen went to bed Dec. 31 with his fishing boat, the Amatuli, finally snug in port in Dutch Harbor, Alaska, after a three-day trip through difficult seas. He wished a happy new year to his wife back home in Bremerton, then retired to his cabin. He woke up the next morning to horrendous news, broken through text messages of condolence on his cellphone. The Scandies Rose — the crab boat boat he co-owned — had gone down in rough seas off the Alaska Peninsula. Of the seven crew, two had been rescued and five were lost, including the captain, Gary Cobban Jr., his longtime friend and business partner. ""I first thought, this can\'t be true. Not the Scandies Rose and not Gary ... It was mind-numbing ... a nightmare, "" Mattsen recalled in an interview Monday in Bremerton. He has struggled along with investigators from the Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to understand what went so terribly wrong after the 130-foot vessel left Kodiak, Alaska, to start a new winter season in the Bering Sea. Mattsen during the past week has reached out to the families of the survivors. He also has answered hours of questioning from investigators about the accident, which came in a difficult stretch of water amid 20-foot seas. A marine forecast for the area called for heavy freezing spray, which can coat a boat with ice that can dramatically reduce stability. Mattsen and his boat had begun their voyage in Kodiak, leaving several days earlier than Cobban. He recalls how Cobban, whose father also was a Kodiak-based crabber, was eager for the new season, when the boat would have the harvest rights to some 600,000 pounds of snow crab. Cobban, 60, had been in Kodiak to rework some gear, and planned to conduct a brief fishery for cod that he would use to prospect for the best spots to catch crab. ""Gary has been running boats since he was about 16 years old ... and he\'s been running larger boats probably since he was 20 or 21,"" Mattsen said. The boat\'s crew included Cobban\'s son David Cobban, 30; Brock Rainey, 47; Seth Rousseau-Gano, 29; and Arthur Ganacias, 50, an Alaskan, as well as two survivors — Dean Gribble Jr. and John Lawler. Mattsen said he had exchanged radio messages with Cobban on New Year\'s Eve, the day of the sinking. ""He just said the weather was crappy and my weather was crappy, too. I mean, I was just kind of doing typical captain commiserating,"" Mattsen said. Coast Guard interviews with the two survivors indicate that when disaster struck, the younger Cobban was in the wheelhouse sending out a mayday distress call, according to Mattsen. It is unclear whether he or any of the other missing crew had time to get into survival suits and evacuate the sinking vessel, which rolled on its side and then went down stern-first. Gribble, in a YouTube video posted last week that was later withdrawn from public view, talked about issues with safety equipment. He noted that an Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) failed to go off to signal the vessel\'s position. Mattsen said the safety gear met regulatory standards. He said the EPIRB goes off as it pops to the surface, and might have got caught underwater as the vessel sank. ""Clearly emotions are running raw,"" he said. ""I am very happy he [Gribble] made it. Our crew is family."" The Scandies Rose has long been a workhorse of the Alaska crab fleet. It was built in 1978, and since Mattsen and Cobban took over ownership of the vessel in 2008, it has been brought to Seattle each year for maintenance and pulled out of the water every other year for additional work, according to Mattsen. The Scandies Rose sinking comes less than three years after the Feb. 11 demise of another Alaska crab boat — the Destination, which sank in the Bering Sea, killing all six crew amid treacherous conditions that included freezing spray. A Coast Guard investigation that concluded in 2019 found that the Destination\'s pots were heavier than assumed by the captain, and could have thrown off stability calculations. The Coast Guard also found that an on-board booklet to guide the loading was out of date. Mattsen said he and Cobban tried to learn from the Coast Guard findings about the Destination as they prepared the Scandies Rose for the 2020 harvests. Last spring, they weighed the Scandies Rose pots and found they were significantly heavier than previously thought. That prompted a revision in the loading booklet to prevent the vessel from carrying too much weight as pots were stacked on deck at the beginning of the harvest seasons. Mattsen said reports indicate the Scandies Rose was carrying no more than 195 pots as the vessel left Kodiak. That was below the 208-pot limit allowed in the loading booklet, he said. In the months ahead, Coast Guard and NTSB officials will continue to investigate the sinking. ""We want to know what happened because if the Scandies Rose can sink in these conditions, any crabber can,"" Mattsen said. In the aftermath of fishing-boat accidents, a legal process, guided by maritime law, will unfold that sometimes ends up in U.S. District Court and sometimes is settled out of court as families of the deceased and survivors seek compensation for their loss. Mattsen has hired two Seattle attorneys, Mike Barcott and his son Dan Barcott. Families typically hire their own attorneys. The Scandies Rose carried liability insurance with proceeds that may be divided up among survivors. Mike Barcott on Monday declined to disclose the dollar amount of this insurance. In the days ahead, families of the lost crew will be holding individual services, according to Mattsen. A broader memorial for all the crew will be scheduled once the winter crab season is over and friends and colleagues now at sea are back home, Mattsen said. Log In Keep it Clean.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Bob Letson led several expansions, improvements in nearly 10 years in Homer A former chief administrator of South Peninsula Hospital, Bob Letson, has died at the age of 72. His family has released, through his obituary and in interviews with the Homer News, that he died of COVID-19. His widow, Cristal Letson, said she didn’t want to hide that fact. Letson died on Nov. 8 in Columbia, South Carolina. Born in Camden, South Carolina, Letson grew up in the South and was a hospital administrator in several places around the country besides Homer, including Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Mississippi and, most recently before his death, North Dakota. He was awarded the American Hospital Association’s Grassroots Champion Award in 2013. Letson became South Peninsula Hospital’s Chief Executive Officer in March 2008 and served in that position for nearly a decade. He led a number of expansions to services and infrastructure at the hospital during that time, including the expansion and renovation of the Homer Medical Clinic. He worked to expand orthopedic services for residents, to get an oncology clinic, and to recruit specialists to the area. South Peninsula Hospital gained its designation as a Critical Access Hospital while Letson was at the helm, as well as its Emergency Level Trauma IV and Patient Centered Medical Home II designations. An acute care wing and a new emergency room, imaging department and MRI scanner were all added during his tenure as well. Letson retired from South Peninsula Hospital in June 2018. He and his wife Cristal moved back to the Lower 48 to be closer to members of their family. “I started thinking about being able to visit my children and grandchildren more often because, you know, life can be short,” he told the Homer News in a 2017 interview. Before his death, Letson came out of retirement to take an interim hospital administration job at Southwest Healthcare Services in North Dakota, his family said. Upon returning to Columbia for a visit, Letson developed symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19. It is not known exactly where he might have contracted the virus, his children Paul Letson and Sarah Luell said. Luell and Paul Letson described a man who came out of retirement to help a community that needed leadership when the pandemic hit. He didn’t shy away, they said. Luell said he bonded with the hospital team and community in North Dakota, even during the short time he was there. Once positive for the virus, Letson’s health declined and he was admitted for treatment. Eventually he was intubated. Luell, Paul Letson and Cristal Letson all said Letson had been in good health for his age, even better health than when he had been in his 50s. In recent years he had started going to the gym multiple times a week and had lost weight. Letson had diabetes, Cristal Letson said, but no other underlying conditions. He had never smoked and rarely drank anymore, she said. “It took our strong, charismatic, loving father,” Luell said. “… He got all of the right care; the hospital did all that they could, but COVID took him.” His death was not attributed to any reason other than COVID-19, and he would still be here if he had not contacted it, Luell said. Paul Letson said the team at the hospital in North Dakota was following pandemic protocols and guidelines. He said his father was spending his time helping the hospital prepare itself, and that he was really trying to help protect that community. “Someone that didn’t really have other health complications at the time that would have caused any near passing, was robbed of years,” he said. According to Cristal Letson, those years were to be filled with travel in their motorhome, time spent at the beach, and fishing in the pond near the house they had just bought. Letson was set to retire from the interim position in North Dakota around Christmas. “We just had all these plans of things to do,” she said. Plans like taking their kayaks out on the water, much like they did in Kachemak Bay when they lived in Homer. “You know, you would never imagine that he was as old as he was,” Cristal Letson said of how active Letson was. That proclivity for outdoor activities was something new his son saw Homer bring out in him. Paul Letson said the family would go on outdoor adventures together when he was younger, but not often. Learning that his dad liked to fish and kayak on Kachemak Bay and go hiking revealed a slightly new side of him. “I think Homer gave him a greater appreciation for the outdoors than he had ever had,” Paul Letson said. During his time in Homer, Letson was also active in the community outside the hospital. He served on the board of directors for the Homer Chamber of Commerce, and took opportunities to see local plays, Cristal Letson said. “He really, I think, felt like he connected with the community there and … he was very invested in it,” Luell said. In Homer, Letson could see the direct impact of his work around him, she said. Cristal Letson recalls a favorite activity of hers and Letson’s was going out to eat at their favorite Homer restaurants. Back then, you could find them at Wasabi’s Bistro, getting a burger at the Glacier D on the Homer Spit, or at Don Jose’s and the former Cafe Cups. Another of Letson’s favorite activities was going to the local movie theater, Cristal Letson said. She and Letson met at the hospital, where she worked as a CNA at the time, and later as a pharmacy technician and a unit clerk in Long Term Care. She described them discovering their shared experiences and similarities, and eventually falling in love. “Our whole thing was like a love story and everybody was participating in it,” she said. “And it was cut short way too soon.” Cristal Letson described being hesitant when Letson asked her to have dinner with him, but she agreed. “We had the same quirky sense of humor, both of us did,” she said. “I mean, we got each other. We would end each other’s sentences and think the same weird things at the same time.” “We were just best friends,” she said. Cristal Letson said she wants people to understand how serious the virus is and to take take it seriously. She and Letson’s children described the illness brought on by COVID-19 as very difficult and painful for Letson. It ravaged him, Luell said. “He said it was the most painful thing he had ever felt, and he couldn’t describe to me how much pain he was in,” Cristal Letson said. Luell and Paul Letson described it as taking a sharp turn for the worse. There are people who have milder cases, Luell said, and her father had expected to make it through. In the end, she and her brother said goodbye to Letson through a glass window and a monitor. “The (virus) and its (contagious) nature robbed us of our ability to say goodbye to him,” Luell said. Cristal Letson said she’s aware that Homer, as a community, has not been hit very hard by COVID-19 relative to other places around the country. Still, she urged caution. “I want to say that, please take it serious,” she said. “Because a lot of people don’t. A lot of people think its’a joke, and it’s not a joke.” Cristal Letson also thanked the members of the community who have reached out to her and her family since his death. “I just want them to know that I know it would have meant a lot to Bob to know that those people cared,” she said.

As the first meeting held on the subject, members of the public who were unaware of the process came to voice their opinions. In total, two out of the 19 cumulative members of the public who commented did not speak in opposition to the annexation process. Of the 19 public commenters in total, six of those in opposition spoke in person and 11 more wrote letters to the council in opposition. “We appropriated money towards an annexation community and economic analysis last December and this is just what this is. This is an analysis of an annexation, not the creation of a petition for the submission to the local boundary commission but just the analysis, both the community and economic,” said Community Development Director Brad Hanson. Agnew Beck Principal co-owner Shanna Zuspan presented along with project manager and overall project lead Heather Stewart, Tanya Iden and Jonathan King. Zuspan said that the study for annexation looks at the areas that need to be studied, the economics of the annexation of process and the analysis of the community. The lengthy packet presented by Agnew Beck was rushed through as members of the public took up much of the time for the presentation. “I personally worked on the 2010 annexation strategy and I know that some of the same issues that came up during that time are still coming up today, so I think it’s important that we take a moment to look back and make sure that w e’re learning from what has gone before,” said Stewart. “We want to make sure if the city again goes through this process, we want to make sure that you have the best information available to come up with something that’s most likely to succeed.” The last process for annexation began in 2006 and the petition failed in 2007 without ever going before the Local Boundary Commission after failing a vote of the council. “We have been, I would say deliberately moving at a pace that allows us to sort of think about what makes the most sense for community outreach and get the study going,” said Zuspan. Community members that rose to speak about annexation were worried about extra taxes and regulations. “I think it’s unfair to go outside the community because when you start annexing you start charging. I will do everything in my power that I know how to do to stop this annexation,” said Scott Brown. “Going outside to a real community and annexing property, normally where I’m from, everybody has to agree to it that lives in the area but not here which I think is unjust.” Other members of the public spoke specifically about the process in 2006 and the existing animosity toward annexation that still lingers. “We’ve been down this road before several years ago probably 2004 or 5, overwhelmingly people were very upset with the whole idea, did not want it,” said Frank Kish. “We don’t want this stuff zoned out. If we wanted to live in a very residential area we’d have moved to Wasilla, we’d have moved to Eagle River. We like where we are, we like the autonomy that we have.” As the first meeting with Agnew Beck Consulting, Halcyon Consulting and Alaska Map Company, Council members and community members alike heard the plan to discuss annexation with the community for the first time since the budget passed with approval for the annexation study last December. “I would like to see us bring this panel back if we can and actually get a real presentation because I think we short changed ourselves as well as them, so I think that that would be a good thing,” said Councilwoman Jill Valerius. “I think had we started the meeting saying that this was our first time we were all being presented this, I think that would’ve alleviated what seemed to be a bit of animosity and anger in the council chamber tonight.” Of the members of the community that spoke out, many were dismayed that they had only learned about the meeting recently. Jason Ortiz said that nearly 300 people live in his community, but noted that nearly all of the written comments from residents used an identical form letter and he could not speak for his entire neighborhood. “I do want to know more information. I don’t see a whole lot of benefit for us at this time but I am open to looking to see what benefit I guess is of joining into the city, so I hope that the city is very clear and as far as working together with all the residents in all these areas and everything so I understand the process,” said Ortiz. The brief presentation by Zuspan, Stewart, Iden and King outlined the process for annexation by a vote of 10 percent of the people within the area, 10 percent of the current city of Palmer residents or a petition to the Local Boundary Commission. “If we’re going to, for the sake that annexation should follow local priorities to review, the city of Palmer comprehensive plans, the Mat-Su Borough core area comprehensive plan, similar plans they both recognize that the city of Palmer is likely to annex land outside of its current boundaries at some point,” said Stewart. “In a nutshell we want to make sure that if there is an annexation proposal that it is in the best interest of everyone involved to the extent possible.” The Palmer City Council will continue involving the community in the annexation process up until any Local Boundary Commission petitions are submitted, which would also include a 28-day public comment period itself. “One of the reasons we decided this was great is because we did look in the past and people were adamantly opposed to whatever information I could find, I think it was pretty strong consensus that nobody wanted to be annexed,” said John Campbell. “To me in these hard economic times it makes no sense to go through this process and spend lots of money if the people you’re trying to annex don’t want it.” Log In Keep it Clean.

when musher Kaci Murringer arrived under the burled arch as the last team off the trail. Murringer, of Willow, running a team of dogs out of Matt Failor’s 17th Dog Kennel, extinguished the flame of the widow’s lantern that burns throughout the race until the last musher is off the trail. This Iditarod was unlike any other that Alaska has ever seen. While mushers were on the trail, the world changed due to COVID-19. This they didn’t expect. However, from start to finish, they were also pummeled by weather. First, heavy snowfalls in the very beginning, then bitter cold with minus 50°F coming out of the Alaska Range and then encountering warm temperatures, deep snow and stretches of brutal overflow at the coast, this race has had plenty of challenges. Says Nome/Nenana musher Aaron Burmeister, “It was challenging, from the day one. Every run of the race had its own challenges, there was not one stretch of hard, fast trail.” He said while his team was prepared for plowing through deep snow and bitter cold temperatures, they were not ready to face the heat that occurred in form of southern blizzards once teams hit the coast. He said early on in the race, he changed his race plan. “In the beginning, I don’t pay attention to the teams around me and with the deep snow conditions, my schedule went out the window around Yentna,” Burmeister said. “I threw that schedule away and decided to run this race based on what’s best for the dogs.” The front pack of mushers, lead by Norwegian Thomas Waerner who maintained a lead from Kaltag on, managed to mush into Nome before the worst of the weather hit. The middle pack and the last eleven mushers were pummeled by strong westerly and southerly winds that pushed water up into bays and river mouths, making for miserable conditions. On Friday morning, Matt Failor, Sean Underwood and Tom Knolmayer were rescued via Blackhawk helicopter about 25 miles shy of reaching the finish line in Nome. According to Nome Volunteer Fire Department and Search and Rescue Chief Jim West Jr. he received a request from Iditarod on Friday morning that the three mushers activated the distress signal on their GPS. Nome SAR reached out to the Alaska State Troopers to authorize the search and rescue. West said they had little information in what kind of shape the mushers were in, so they utilized the Alaska Army National Guard’s 1st Battalion, 207th Aviation Regiment’s aircrew and Blackhawk to get the mushers. West sent a ground crew of four snow machiners, Jake Stettenbenz, Chugie Farley, Benny Piscoya and Roy Walluk Jr. out. Additional snowmachiners were sent out with sleds and dog boxes. Two dog handlers and two EMTs boarded the Black Hawk. At 10:15 a.m. the UH-60 Black Hawk launched from Nome, said Chief Warrant Officer 3 Josh Claeys, the pilot in command of the helicopter that performed the search-and-rescue mission. In addition to the COVID-19 threat and the ensuing gradual shut-down of life as usual in Nome, a series of warm blizzards, strong winds and wet snow complicated the Iditarod race even further. The southerly winds caused significant overflow along the coast and river mouths, destroying the trail and turning it into treacherous wet holes and sections of deep overflow. The three left White Mountain and encountered significant overflow in the creeks that run like veins through the Topkok Hills. One of the rescuers, Chugie Farley, said the mushers said they had been wet since traversing waist deep overflow at the Koocheblok (Kloberblok River). The SAR team found the mushers at the Solomon River mouth. Farley said one sled was stuck in the overflow, the dogs were on the eastern side of the river, and rested on dry ground and out of the wet hole. The other two teams were still on the western side of the river and hunkered down there. “They were inside of sleeping bags,” said Claeys. “The medics got them on oxygen and warmed up inside, and the dog handlers and some of Nome rescue stayed with the dogs and had plans to get them back to Nome,” Claeys said. According to Farley – who is the son of Howard Farley, one of the race founders and first mushers of the Iditarod in 1973 — they rerouted the trail from Solomon River mouth north toward the Train to Nowhere, got them on the bridge and then escorted them on the Nome-Council Road toward Safety. There, at the last checkpoint about 22 miles east of Nome, the Iditarod veterinarians checked every dog and feed them a meal. They were then mushed to Farley’s camp, about four miles east of town, and then transported via dog trucks to the Nome Iditarod dog yard. The mushers were flown to the National Guard Nome Army Aviation Operating Facility and arrived Friday morning at 11:15 a.m. Two ambulances awaited their arrival and transported them to Norton Sound Regional Hospital. West said musher Underwood noted that he couldn’t feel his legs. According to Jim West, some of the snow machiners who went to aid with the rescue, themselves ended up stuck in overflow at the Nome River, but self rescued and became unstuck. An Iditarod statement said that all sled dogs and mushers are in good health. “Because of these rescue efforts and in accordance with rule 31, all three mushers did scratch from Iditarod XLVIII.” At the same time, eleven mushers who were sitting out the storm in Elim had left and were on their way to White Mountain. They had tried to leave Elim the day before with two local trail breakers, but once they reached the top of Little McKinley, weather worsened and their trail breakers took off after a wolverine. The teams then turned around and went back to Elim, to make the push again towards White Mountain and ultimately Nome, where the last musher arrived on Sunday at 12:29 p.m. Out of 57 teams that started, only 34 reached Nome. Due to strict measures to limit visitors to Nome and to get mushers, handlers and family out of Nome as fast as possible, this Iditarod was not as festive as it usually is. The finisher’s banquet is postpone to a yet to be announced date and time and just as soon as the last musher drove her dogs to the dog yard, Front Street became quiet and deserted.
