The Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that hosts Wikipedia, has released its annual list of most popular articles in the English language. ChatGPT takes the top spot, with more than 49 million views. The article had between 100,000 and 400,000 views almost every single day in the first half of the year, and the interest wasn’t confined to the English-language version of Wikipedia. Across all languages, ChatGPT picked up more than 79 million pageviews in total. The second-most popular article was Wikipedia’s annual list of deaths, which frequently makes an appearance in the most-viewed articles of each year. Individual deaths also spurred significant traffic on the site — the articles on Matthew Perry and Lisa Marie Presley were both in the top 25 most-viewed list. Other celebrities also appear, including Taylor Swift and Elon Musk, at No. 12 and 19 in the rankings, respectively. Meanwhile, several movies are among the most popular articles of the year. While Barbie trounced Oppenheimer at the box office, the latter was more popular on Wikipedia. More than 28 million people clicked on the article about the film, compared to 18 million who read the article on the Barbie movie. Here’s a look at the full list of 25 most-read Wikipedia articles of 2023: And here’s a look at the most-viewed articles over the past few years: According to the Wikimedia Foundation, the pageviews for 2023 are as of Nov. 28.

Ron DeSantis’s presidential campaign and former President Trump this week rolled out dueling plans for the U.S. military, with both GOP candidates’ proposals light on details and heavy on gripes over Biden administration efforts. While DeSantis’s proposition took aim at Pentagon diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, recruiting woes and policies impacting transgender service members, Trump’s plan focused largely on seeking reimbursements for U.S. aid to Ukraine, lambasting Europe for what he decried as only a “tiny fraction” of what Washington had contributed. But as both candidates strive to stand apart from each other’s messaging, choosing to focus on different aspects of national security, experts say there appears to be little difference between the two proposals. “There doesn’t seem to be very much daylight between the two of them on a couple of different fronts,” said Katherine Kuzminski, an armed forces expert and society at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington, D.C., think tank. “I think there’s a real focus on bringing resources back to the U.S. and not extending American leadership abroad. And then, certainly, when it comes to the domestic politics, the pushes for reform within the Department of Defense when it comes to DEI policies and transgender policy,” she said. “There isn’t really a debate between the two of them on these specific issues … When you look at their policies, they’re not actually all that different,” Kuzminski said. Here are both candidate’s messages on the U.S. military and national security: DeSantis’s plan, unveiled at a brief news conference last Tuesday in South Carolina, doubled down on past campaign promises to “rip the woke” out of the U.S. military and overhaul the institution. The “Mission First” proposal includes potential six-month performance reviews for all four-star generals and admirals, and possible dismissals should anyone be found to have “promoted policies to the detriment of readiness and warfighting.” He also pledged to rescind Biden’s executive order that allows transgender individuals to serve under their preferred sex, rip out DEI initiatives in the services or military academies, end Pentagon efforts to combat extremism in the ranks and reinstate personnel who were dismissed for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine as well as give them backpay. In addition, he promised to end programs meant to prepare military installations and troops for future climate change, bashing the Pentagon for shifting, in part, to electric vehicles. In an interview with CNN the evening after the press conference, DeSantis claimed his policy targets Pentagon efforts that hinder recruitment and said the military is currently suffering from America’s loss in confidence in the institution. “At this level, everybody has acknowledged these recruiting levels are at a crisis. … I think it’s because people see the military losing its way, not focusing on the mission and focusing on a lot of these other things,” DeSantis said. DeSantis isn’t straying far from his policy proposals already enacted as Florida governor. While head of the state, he has banned higher education institutions from putting dollars toward diversity and inclusion programs, forbade the use of federal resources to teach students about sexual activity, sexual orientation or gender identity, and prohibited some teachings about race and U.S. history. But Michael O’Hanlon, a security fellow at the Brookings Institution, called DeSantis’s stance a “missed opportunity” for the former Navy officer, who served in the Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps in Iraq. “Cleary DeSantis is fighting the culture wars and he’s sort of staying true to his M.O.,” O’Hanlon told The Hill. “I think it’s probably a missed opportunity for him. … He should be trying to show he is actually capable of developing serious views on the big strategic issues of the day, which are fundamentally not about diversity, equity and inclusion within the armed forces,” he said. “I think he ought to be engaging on China and Russia, how to solve the Ukraine, how to prevent war over Taiwan.” And Kuzminski said there’s a misperception that the Florida governor is capitalizing on “wokeness” as a recruiting challenge in the U.S. military, “That is the perception of some who may have served a long time ago, but the reality of military service is that it needs to reflect the population from which it’s drawn,” she said. “That’s a challenge that I think a President Trump 2.0 or President DeSantis is going to run … into if they were to win the election.” On Ukraine, Desantis has offered tentative comments on the conflict, insisting it wasn’t a U.S. national security priority and downplaying the Russian invasion. “While the U.S. has many vital national interests [such as] securing our borders, addressing the crisis of readiness within our military, achieving energy security and independence, and checking the economic, cultural and military power of the Chinese Communist Party, becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them,” DeSantis said in March. He has since walked back his comments on the war being a “territorial dispute.” Trump, meanwhile, has long made pledges to cut back U.S. involvement in foreign wars, starting with campaign promises ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump coasted through the 2016 GOP primaries under his so-called “America First” foreign policy, intended to diminish Washington’s role on the world stage and focus more dollars at home than overseas. During his presidency, he continued that line of thinking, calling for a reduction in service members serving abroad and criticizing the U.S. foreign intervention as being too expensive and ineffective. Trump seems to be doubling down on that track with his plan for “Rebuilding America’s Depleted Military,” also released last week. In a prerecorded video put out by his campaign, the former president focuses largely on foreign policy, repeating criticisms over Biden’s handling Russia’s war on Ukraine. If reelected, he claimed, he would demand Europe pay the U.S. to rebuild its weapons stockpiles — which have pulled from heavily since February 2022 to help bolster Kyiv in its fight. “Less than three years ago, I’d fully rebuilt the United States military and steered America into such a strong global position,” Trump boasted. “Twenty-nine months later, the arsenals are empty, the stockpiles are bare, the Treasury is drained, the ranks are being hollowed out, our country has been totally humiliated, and we have a corrupt, compromised president, crooked Joe Biden, who is dragging us into World War III,” he said. Trump also claimed Washington’s European allies were only giving a “tiny fraction” of the assistance to Ukraine compared to the United States, and suggested Biden was “too weak and too disrespected to even ask” for reimbursement. Trump also said in a recent interview that he could end the war in 24 hours, a claim many found dubious. O’Hanlon, who called Trump’s assertions on lagging European assistance to Ukraine “incorrect,” said he appears to be banking on his past arguments on making America first. Kuzminski agreed that Trump’s campaign looks to be “hitting harder on making Ukraine repay us,” and “doubling down” on those statements. While Trump hasn’t been as vocal on culture war issues in the military this time around, he has a well-documented history when it comes to his stance on transgender service members in the military. In July 2017, he announced on Twitter, apparently out of the blue, that transgender individuals would no longer be allowed “to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.” That ban was eventually rescinded by Biden via executive order shortly after he entered the White House in January 2021.

While the Texas Education Agency is under litigation and won’t provide the official accountability ratings, the superintendent said he received the data and methodology used for Assessment Accountability and Compliance to come up with the scores. According to Miles, the number of D and F schools is much higher than in the past. Using the raw data, Miles said that there are 52 F-rated HISD campuses, 59 schools with D ratings and 64 with C ratings. “These of course are unofficial until TEA, if ever, are able to report it, but they’re accurately based on the raw data, which we have,” Miles said. Miles expressed that while the TEA has upgraded and made the accountability process more vigorous, the district’s goal is to improve the low ratings. “We have a lot of work to do is the main message,” Miles said during the news conference. “We have a lot of schools that are struggling... We went into this year knowing that we would have a lot of work to do, especially around the quality of instruction, which is the leading indicator of academic achievement and hence accountability.” Miles believes there’s a need for a “whole-scale systemic reform” within the entire district. “We can’t continue to do the things we’ve always done, I’ve said that before,” Miles said. “This data just confirms the distance we have to travel and the need for doing bold, innovative transformation.” Miles said the New Education System schools are examples of implementing systemic reform. According to the district, NES schools are priority campuses in HISD that are provided with resources and support to dramatically improve outcomes for their students. Miles is also hoping that the district can increase its overall reading scores. “The message we want to communicate is the same. We need to focus on high-quality instruction in every classroom, in every campus,” Chief Academic Officer Kristen Hole said. “That’s what our students need and that’s what our students deserve.” Hole said that NES and non-NES campuses are getting the support they need for academic success. “We’re providing access to high-quality curriculum. We’re also providing access to staffing, professional development, and on-the-job coaching for our teachers and our administrators. Those two things together really get at the heart of what a student is doing every day in the classroom.” Miles said he isn’t sure when the official ratings will be released. He plans to release the raw data to schools in January. According to the district’s website, the state accountability system uses student assessments (State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness or STAAR) but also makes use of additional indicators to provide parents and taxpayers greater detail on the performance of a district or charter and each campus throughout the state. The state accountability system uses a performance domain framework that considers three areas: Overall scores and ratings are determined by a weighted average of the individual domain scores.

Victoria Crisitello filed a complaint against the St. Theresa School alleging discrimination based on pregnancy and marital status. The school claimed, however, that the termination was because Crisitello, in having premarital sex, violated the terms of her employment agreement, which stipulated that employees must abide by the teachings of the Catholic Church. In its decision on Monday, the state Supreme Court held that St. Theresa School validly asserted the “religious tenets” exception as an affirmative defense, which allows religious entities to make hiring decisions based on criteria established using tenets of their faith, and therefore did not violate New Jersey’s Law Against Discrimination. “The religious tenets exception allowed St. Theresa’s to require its employees, as a condition of employment, to abide by Catholic law, including that they abstain from premarital sex. Crisitello, a practicing Catholic and graduate of the St. Theresa School, acknowledged that St. Theresa’s required her to abide by the tenets of the Catholic faith, including that she abstain from premarital sex, as a condition of her employment,” the court filing reads. The court noted that there was no evidence supporting the position that the termination was for any reason other than premarital sex. “St. Theresa’s has remained steadfast in basing its employment action on Crisitello’s violation of the terms of her employment as permissibly derived from the tenets of the Catholic faith. Crisitello was hired in 2011 and worked as an art teacher and toddler room caregiver. She signed an acknowledgment of the Code of Ethics when she was hired. When she was approached about potentially becoming a full-time art teacher, Crisitello acknowledged in an initial meeting that she was pregnant, according to court documents, and would therefore need a higher salary. The court documents also suggest that it was well-known that Crisitello, a former student at the school, was not married. A few weeks later, she was told she needed to either resign or be terminated because she had sex out of wedlock, which violated Catholic law, and therefore, her employment contract. “Of course we are disappointed with the decision because it did not go our way … and we don’t think that going forward a pregnant woman will be treated equally based on these policies of the employment,” Crisitello’s attorney, Thomas McKinney, Crisitello’s attorney, said in a statement to CNN. “We would have liked to see this reminded in court but we understand the decision of the Supreme Court justice and we accept it,” he added in the statement.

Please enter a search term. by: Jared Gans, The Hill Posted: Apr 26, 2023 / 05:13 AM CDT Updated: Apr 26, 2023 / 05:13 AM CDT by: Jared Gans, The Hill Posted: Apr 26, 2023 / 05:13 AM CDT Updated: Apr 26, 2023 / 05:13 AM CDT (The Hill) – With President Biden officially declaring his candidacy for reelection in 2024, the country could be gearing up for a rematch of the 2020 presidential election. Biden released his long-anticipated announcement in a video early Tuesday morning, criticizing what he has branded as “MAGA Republicans,” including images of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and protesters opposing the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Despite the election season being in an early phase, Biden appears poised to win the Democratic nomination with only two long-shot opponents, self-help author Marianne Williamson and environmental attorney and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., opposing him. Trump also appears to be in a strong position to win the Republican nomination with him leading in most polls by double digits. If a Biden-Trump rematch does happen, it would be the first time in more than half a century that a presidential rematch happened but far from the first time ever. Here’s the presidential election rematches that have occurred in U.S. history: Former Presidents John Adams and Thomas Jefferson (White House Historical Society) The first rematch in a presidential election happened soon after the Constitution went into effect. John Adams and Thomas Jefferson had emerged as the leaders of the Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties, respectively, and faced off in two of the most bitter races in the country’s history. Adams and Jefferson first ran against each other in 1796. Candidates at the time did not directly campaign themselves and relied on their supporters to campaign for them. Jefferson was accused of having an affair with one of his slaves while Adams was nicknamed “His Rotundity,” an insult for his weight, according to The National Constitution Center. Adams ultimately won the race narrowly, 71 electoral votes to Jefferson’s 68. The 1800 election only increased the bitterness between the two sides. Jefferson’s critics accused him of being an atheist and his election would lead to “Murder, robbery, rape, adultery, and incest,” according to the University of Virginia’s Miller Center. Adams was accused of wanting to have one of his sons marry one of King George III’s daughters to create an American monarchical dynasty. Jefferson defeated Adams to deny him reelection, winning 73 electoral votes to Adams’ 65. Jefferson received the same number of votes as another Democratic-Republican, Aaron Burr, but the House settled the tie and Jefferson clinched the presidency on the body’s 36th ballot. Former Presidents John Quincy Adams and Thomas Jefferson (White House Historical Society) John Quincy Adams, the son of the second president, and Gen. Andrew Jackson first ran against each other in 1824 at a time when only one political party, the Democratic-Republicans, existed. The Federalist Party had collapsed by this point, and Adams and Jackson, along with fellow candidates William Crawford and Henry Clay, considered themselves to be members of the same party. The 1824 contest became the second in American history to go to the House to pick a winner when no candidate received a majority of the votes. Jackson won a plurality of the popular and electoral votes, causing him to expect to ultimately be elected president, according to the National Archives. Clay did not advance to the House tiebreaker but held considerable influence in the House as speaker. He advocated for Adams, with whom he was most ideologically aligned, helping him clinch victory. Adams later appointed Clay as secretary of state, which Jackson and his allies blasted as a “corrupt bargain.” Adams and Jackson soon after established their own political parties, the National Republicans and the Democrats, and faced off again in 1828. The contest was dominated by personal attacks, similar to 1800. Jackson was accused of being bloodthirsty and an adulterer, while Adams was accused of corruption and facilitating prostitution. Jackson’s widespread popularity helped him in the race and defeat Adams comfortably. Former Presidents Martin Van Buren and Willian Henry Harrison (White House Historical Society) Opponents to Jackson’s presidency rallied around the newfound Whig Party by the mid-1830s. But the Whigs were formed from a wide range of members who represented differing ideologies and regions of the country, and they struggled to form a consensus beyond opposing Jackson. They nominated multiple candidates from different regions to oppose Jackson’s vice president, Democrat Martin Van Buren. They hoped to send the election to the House and have one of their candidates win the presidency there. The strategy failed to stop Van Buren in 1836, but the plan did help launch Gen. William Henry Harrison onto the national political stage as the best-performing Whig that year. The Whigs nominated Harrison to face off against Van Buren again in 1840. Harrison’s supporters were able to successfully attack the increasingly unpopular Van Buren over a lingering recession and depict Harrison as a folk hero. Harrison comfortably won the election. Former Presidents Grover. Cleveland and William Harrison (White House Historical Society) Incumbent Grover Cleveland easily won renomination from the Democrats in 1888. Benjamin Harrison, the grandson of William Harrison and a former senator from Indiana, won the Republican nomination on the eighth ballot. The election focused mostly on the issue of tariffs, with Cleveland supporting lowering tariffs to try to reduce costs for consumers and Harrison supporting high protective tariffs to try to protect U.S. industries, according to UCLA. Republicans ran a more effective campaign and Harrison narrowly won. But Cleveland won the popular vote by about 100,000 votes. Cleveland faced opposition to become the Democratic nominee in 1892 but was the frontrunner and won the nomination. The race was similar to 1888 in that it focused on economic issues like tariffs, according to the Miller Center. Cleveland attacked the Harrison administration for a strong, protective tariff passed in 1890, and Republicans also had to face a third-party challenge from James Weaver of the Populist Party. Harrison was unable to overcome that, and Cleveland became the only president elected to two nonconsecutive terms in U.S. history. Former President William McKinley and former Ohio Gov. William Jennings Bryan (White House Historical Society/Portrait Gallery) The Republican and Democratic nominees in 1896 and 1900 differed greatly in their economic policies. William McKinley, a former Ohio governor who authored the 1890 tariff, was mostly supported by big business, while William Jennings Bryan, a former House member, was backed by farmers and small businesses. McKinley pledged to maintain the gold standard as the country’s currency, while Bryan condemned the plan and advocated for the expansion of silver as part of the currency, according to the Smithsonian Institution. Bryan ran a vigorous campaign while McKinley campaigned from his front porch. McKinley vastly outspent Bryan in the race and won the race. McKinley emerged as a popular president following the U.S. victory in the 1898 Spanish-American War and was easily renominated in 1900. Bryan was nominated to oppose him again. The contest focused on similar economic issues of currency and a battle between business and labor. Bryan also attacked McKinley over expanding U.S. influence in the world, arguing that the country was becoming an empire. McKinley won reelection and expanded his margin from four years prior by more than 100,000 votes. Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower and former Illinois Gov. Adlai Stevenson (White House Historical Society/Archives) Both Republicans and Democrats were interested in popular World War II Gen. Dwight Eisenhower running for president for their party. But Eisenhower ultimately decided to run as a Republican in 1952, and the Democrats nominated Illinois Gov. Adlai Stevenson. Stevenson could appeal to moderates and liberals in the Democratic Party and had extensive experience, but Eisenhower significantly outcampaigned him. The general widely campaigned with confidence and personality while largely ignoring Stevenson and attacking incumbent Harry Truman’s administration, according to the Miller Center. He attacked the administration for the ongoing Korean War, the spread of communism internationally and corruption and easily won the election. Eisenhower was a widely popular president as he decided to run for reelection in 1956, and Democrats seemed to have a steep challenge before them no matter who they nominated. They turned back to Stevenson again, but he had trouble finding issues that could stick. Eisenhower won again in 1956 by an even larger landslide than he won in 1952.

5 Example video title will go here for this video ALEXANDRIA, Va. — A 31-year-old father of four who had been living in Alexandria, Virginia for less than a year was gunned down early Monday morning as he finished up a late Lyft shift. Nasrat Ahmad Yar\'s wife wanted him to come home after a night out with friends, but he told her rent was due soon and he needed to keep working, right before he was shot and killed in his car. DC Police officers responded to 11th Street Northeast, near D Street Northeast, just after midnight for a reported shooting, and found Ahmad Yar with a gunshot wound. He was taken to a hospital for treatment but died of his injuries. ""He was so happy he got a new car because he could take care of his family,"" his best friend Rahim Amini told WUSA9. ""His wife asked him to stay home but he said, \'I have to pay rent. I don\'t have that much money. I have to work.\'"" Ahmad Yar was the sole provider for his wife and four children, ages 13 years to 15 months, and was still sending money home to family overseas in Afghanistan. He served as an interpreter alongside U.S. Army Special Forces in Afghanistan. Ahmad Yar escaped with his family in 2021 after the fall of the Afghan government to the Taliban. Amini said Ahmad Yar would often drive up to 12 hours a day for Lyft to make ends meet. A GoFundMe has been set up to provide help for Yar\'s family left behind. The local Afghan community also started a donation page. Loved ones described him as hardworking, generous, diligent and positive. ""We need justice for Nasrat,"" his cousin Samim Amiri said. ""That\'s all the family wants."" Ahmad Yar and his family first moved to Philadelphia, before relocating to Alexandria. He felt unsafe in Pennsylvania after being robbed at gunpoint, according to his friend Jeramie Malone. ""I can\'t emphasize enough how he was always helping,"" Malone added. ""Leaving the house was very dangerous for him, but he was always eager to help somebody else who is a good guy. His children were the most important thing to him, and he brought them here so he could be safe."" Malone helped his family relocate to the U.S. through a volunteer organization. They fled to Abu Dhabi in 2021 from Mazar-i-Sharif, an evacuation site. Since he served as an interpreter for the U.S. government, Ahmad Yar was considered a target for the Taliban. ""He was most certainly a marked man if he stayed,"" Retired Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Butler told WUSA9. ""He served this country a great deal more than I did. I did 42 months in combat but that was nowhere near what he had."" Butler, who was with the U.S. Army Special Forces, worked closely with Ahmad Yar in Camp Vance of the Bagram Airfield for two of his deployments. He last saw Ahmad Yar in Pennsylvania in 2022, and helped start his immigration process before the Taliban takeover. ""You just don\'t have words to describe how you feel about someone who had given so much to his country, not as a citizen, but then comes here and experiences some of the worst behavior our country has to offer,"" Butler said. ""The irony is really thick here."" Nest camera footage on the night of the shooting was sent to WUSA9 by a neighbor who lived nearby. In the surveillance video, you hear a single gunshot and then see four boys running down an alley near the in the 400 block of 11th Street Northeast where Nasrat gunned down in his car. In the video you hear one of the boys shouting, ""You killed him! He was about to get out"" and another responds, ""he was reaching, bro."" ""There\'s like a lot of questions we should be asking like: Why do these kids have access to a gun,"" the woman who sent the Nest video to WUSA9, said. ""Will they be held accountable? Why don\'t they comprehend life-altering consequences of pulling the trigger. Who is this person?"" Lyft confirmed that Nasrat was a driver for their platform. ""Our hearts are with Mr. Nasrat\'s loved ones as they confront this unspeakable tragedy,"" Lyft said in a statement after Nasrat\'s death. ""We have reached out to his family to offer our support and are in contact with law enforcement to assist with their investigation."" According to DC Police stats, there have been 127 homicides so far this year, which is a 19% increase from the same period in 2022. A $25,000 reward is being offered for anyone that can provide information that will result in an arrest in this case. Anyone with information about this case is asked to call the police at 202-727-9099.

Another good Samaritan, Jeff Thornton, was already there, helping the eight or nine children who authorities say had been on the Grandfield Public Schools bus. “He already got the kids out of the school bus, and we made a decision to hook his pickup up and pull the school bus off the vehicle that was on fire because that was all we could do,” Wittington said. Wittington says the bus driver, James Jackson, was trapped and that pulling the bus from the fire was all they could do to help the situation. “We started to check the kids to make sure they weren’t too seriously injured and waited for help to get there,” Wittington said. “Those kids had a lot of guardian angels looking over them.” Wittington, who spent 40 years in law enforcement, commended Jackson for how he handled the situation. “He did a remarkable job of protecting those kids,” Wittington said. Authorities say Jackson was airlifted due to his injuries, and a few of the children were also hurt in the crash. The driver of the pickup, whose identity has not been confirmed by authorities, died of his injuries. “The ones you can’t save are the ones that bug you.

Jean Carroll, denying Trump’s bid to avoid civil trial next month and thus setting up a Supreme Court battle. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit ruled against Trump, finding that presidential immunity could be waived as a defense and that Trump had in fact waived it. The panel went on to reject the former president’s various arguments for why he should be able to assert the defense now. “[R]ecognizing presidential immunity as waivable reinforces, not undermines, the separation of powers and the President’s decision making authority by affording the President an opportunity to litigate if he so chooses. Accordingly, we hold that presidential immunity is waivable,” Judge José Cabranes wrote in the 35-page decision. Trump attorney Alina Habba called the ruling “fundamentally flawed” in a statement and said the former president will seek the Supreme Court’s review. Carroll, a longtime advice columnist, is set to take Trump to trial for a second time next month after coming forward during Trump’s presidency with accusations that he sexually assaulted her in the mid-1990s at a New York City department store. Trump vehemently denies Carroll’s story. After a jury earlier this year found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll — but not for rape — and ordered him to pay $5 million, Carroll is now taking Trump to trial again, this time for defamation over his initial denials. A federal judge already ruled that Trump is liable in the case. A trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 16 — the day after the Republican Iowa caucuses — to determine how much Trump must pay in damages. Trump’s immunity appeal was his most significant remaining effort seeking to avoid trial. The 2nd Circuit’s ruling affirms a decision issued by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who will oversee the trial. “We are pleased that the Second Circuit affirmed Judge Kaplan’s rulings and that we can now move forward with trial next month on January 16,” Roberta Kaplan, Carroll’s lawyer, who is not related to the judge, said in a statement.

Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), who challenged a Teamsters boss to a fight last month, on Thursday slammed Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) for “living off” his “daddy’s money” after Gaetz cited Mullin’s increase in wealth as a reason to ban members of Congress from trading stocks. “I hear @RepMattGaetz has criticism of hard-earned success — he should try building a business that gains value, it’s more gratifying than living off your daddy’s money,” Mullin posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. Mullin was reacting to a graphic Gaetz reposted that showed Mullin’s net worth swelled from $12 million in 2018, when he was a House member, to $63 million in 2022, despite earning a $174,000 salary in Congress. “We should pass a ban on trading stocks!” Gaetz said in his post, citing Mullin’s rise in wealth. Gaetz also defended his post after Mullin’s comment. “The only thing I criticized were your stock trades while a member of Congress. I want to ban those trades. You cashed in and made millions,” Gaetz wrote. Mullin’s stock trades have attracted some attention online. Capitol Trades pointed out that Mullin bought between $15,000 and $50,000 in Raytheon Technologies stock through a joint account on Sept. 13, noting that company’s stocks have risen 6 percent since the Oct. 7 attack on Israeli civilians outside of the Gaza Strip. Gaetz’s family’s wealth has also received media attention. Forbes estimated in 2021 that Gaetz and his parents had a net worth of about $30 million. Gaetz’s father, Don, reported his and his wife’s net worth as $29.6 million in June of 2020. Don Gaetz served as president of the Florida Senate from 2012 to 2014. Last month, Mullin demonstrated his willingness to engage in a physical fight with a union official at a Senate hearing, challenging Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien to a fist fight during a Senate hearing after O’Brien said the Oklahoma senator is “a greedy CEO who pretends like he’s self made.” Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.
