(KSNW) — Cecil O’Brate, a Kansas farmer, banker and devoted philanthropist, died in Garden City at the age of 95 on Saturday. O’Brate was the founder of the O’Brate Foundation, which has awarded over $7 million in college scholarships, mostly to those who grew up in the foster care system or were economically disadvantaged. A graduate of Syracuse High School in 1946, O’Brate was born in Enid, Oklahoma, before moving to Kansas. After attending Oklahoma A&M University — which is now known as Oklahoma State University — he began his career as a farmer and rancher in southwest Kansas. O’Brate would go on to own several banks, farm implement dealerships and more. A news release says he was known as one of the largest independent oil and gas producers in Kansas with the company American Warrior, Inc. He also invested heavily in ethanol production and real estate development, including the forthcoming indoor sports complex in Garden City. O’Brate is survived by his wife Frances of 76 years, who continues to reside in Garden City, KS; four sons Patrick (Jennifer) of Houston, Texas, Michael (Judy) of Garden City, KS, Steve (Bonnie) of Garden City, and Mark (Marilyn) of Bentonville, Arkansas; eight grandchildren, nine great-grandchildren, and one great-great granddaughter. An avid fan of the Oklahoma State Cowboys, O’Brate was the lead donor for the construction of OSU’s new baseball stadium, named O’Brate Stadium.

February 16, 2024 at 11:37 AM ET Alexei Navalny, a thorn in Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s side, was repeatedly attacked and jailed. When he tried to enter politics, Navalny was threatened, thwarted and poisoned. Finally, on Friday, he was reported dead in a Russian prison at age 47. For years, Navalny was Russia\'s most outspoken critic of Putin and his inner circle, publishing embarrassing details about corruption and excess as Russia\'s household income per capita plunged in an era of cheap gas prices and international sanctions. ""I want to live in a normal country and refuse to accept any talk about Russia being doomed to being a bad, poor or servile country,"" Navalny told NPR in 2018. ""I want to live here, and I can\'t tolerate the injustice that for many people has become routine."" Navalny told Russians they deserved better — from their leaders and in their own lives. His message of change resonated particularly strongly in Russia\'s younger generation, many of whom have lived only under Putin\'s influence: Since 1999, Putin has been either Russia\'s president or its prime minister. Navalny rose to fame by publishing investigations that exposed corruption, using videos on YouTube and other platforms as he sought to get around officials\' efforts to limit the size of his audience. He organized mass street demonstrations, calling for political mobilization against Putin\'s regime. Many of the excesses he exposed were hiding in plain sight: luxury homes that he called the spoils of profiteering by Putin and his allies. In 2021, Navalny released a bombshell video accusing Putin of using a slush fund to build a palace on the Black Sea. That report has now been viewed nearly 130 million times on YouTube. The Kremlin denied Navalny\'s claims, calling the investigation ""pure nonsense."" In the opening lines of that video, Navalny called Putin ""a petty KGB officer who now masquerades as a great spy."" In 2016, Navalny\'s Anti-Corruption Foundation published a story on a luxurious summer-vacation estate frequently visited by then-Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev — including a special house just for ducks. The story included aerial footage of the property and its three helipads, along with an explanation of its ownership by a foundation with links to Medvedev\'s family. Yellow ducks soon became a symbol of anti-regime protest — and in 2017, a huge inflatable yellow duck was among those detained by police, as security forces cracked down on large demonstrations. A cornerstone of that protest took place in St. Petersburg, Putin\'s hometown. In a sign of Navalny\'s ability to inspire the public, his followers took his message to the city\'s streets, chanting words that are among the most dangerous to utter in their country: ""Russia without Putin."" Navalny was frequently detained in connection to the demonstrations he organized. Russian authorities also accused him of fraud in 2014, securing a criminal conviction that Navalny called retribution for his activism. Election officials also cited the fraud conviction on Navalny\'s record as justification to reject his attempt to run against Putin for the presidency. Prosecutors repeatedly brought criminal charges against Navalny over the years; even in cases where he was able to go free, courts often attached conditions that served as leverage, threatening to limit his activities. Last August, Navalny was sentenced to 19 years in prison over charges related to extremism. In recent years, Putin\'s regime has tightened its grip on speech and other rights even more, in attempts to quell dissent over its invasion and war against Ukraine. In the face of those controls, Navalny\'s family, his attorneys and supporters in Russia and in exile have helped get his message out — including last summer, when he used a court statement to condemn Putin\'s vision of Russia. ""It is now floundering in a pool of mud and blood, with broken bones, and an impoverished, robbed population; and with tens of thousands of people who have died in the most stupid and senseless war of the 21st century,"" Navalny said, according to a message his team shared online. Navalny was born in a rural area west of Moscow in 1976. After becoming a lawyer in 1998, he earned an economics degree. And while Navalny\'s political activism saw him pushing for a market economy and liberal democracy, his ideological leanings were difficult to parse. Early in his public life, he was also seen as being sympathetic to far-right parties. Navalny once told NPR that under an authoritarian regime, political nuances didn\'t matter: The overarching goal — people should agree, he said — is to call for open and fair elections, an independent judiciary and other aspects of a free society. He also identified two experiences that set him on a collision course with Putin. One was his work as an attorney, where he concluded that Russia\'s court systems wouldn\'t be free to dispense justice unless the country reformed its government. Another was an eight-month fellowship at Yale University in 2010, which he said revealed ""the bigger picture"" of how other political systems operate. When Navalny decided to share his ideas for a new Russia, he didn\'t rely on traditional print and broadcast media. ""Probably you can call me a person of the internet,"" he said. ""It was a lifesaver not just for me but everyone else who suddenly found themselves under censorship."" Navalny also rejected the label of ""dissident,"" saying it suggested he was someone who stood alone. ""If you take any of my anti-corruption investigations or any points from my political platform, I\'m sure the majority of Russian citizens would support me,"" Navalny told NPRin 2018. And that, he added, was why the government would not allow him to run against Putin for the presidency. Copyright 2024 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.'}]"

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: If you picture a map of Gaza, Rafah is at the very bottom at a border crossing to Egypt. It\'s now the refuge for people from all over the rest of Gaza who fled Israel\'s offensive in recent months. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told the army to prepare some kind of plan to evacuate more than 1 million civilians from Rafah, although it\'s not clear where they could go. FADEL: NPR\'s Eyder Peralta is following the story from Tel Aviv, and he joins us now. Good morning. EYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Leila. FADEL: So let\'s start with these threats from Israel. Palestinians have been displaced multiple times over. Now, a majority of residents of the strip are in this small piece of land in the southernmost part of the Palestinian territory. Why is Israel now moving into this part of Gaza? PERALTA: Well, Israel says that it\'s going after Hamas. Remember, last October, Hamas launched an attack in southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people, and Israel vowed to destroy Hamas. And so far, they have swept from Gaza\'s north to itself. The bombing has killed some 28,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\'s health ministry. And in the past few days, Israel\'s defense minister and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu say that Rafah, a city that, as you said, is along the border with Egypt, is Hamas\' final stronghold. Netanyahu was interviewed by ABC yesterday, and he reiterated that Israel was poised to launch a military operation at Rafah. Let\'s listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: Those who say that under no circumstances should we enter Rafah are basically saying lose the war, keep Hamas there. FADEL: And part of this may have already started. We\'re hearing reports of airstrikes this morning and some good news about hostages taken from Israel. What are you learning? PERALTA: So we know there\'s been an increase in airstrikes generally in Rafah. But the Israeli military says what happened overnight was about hostages and that the airstrikes were a diversionary tactic. The military says that they rescued two of the 136 hostages who Israel believe are still in Gaza, and they say both are in good condition. A hospital official tells NPR that at least 50 Palestinians were killed last night. NPR producer Anas Baba was on the street in Rafah. Let\'s listen. (SOUNDBITE OF SHELLING) ANAS BABA, BYLINE: It\'s very intensive shelling all around me. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE) BABA: Next to my house, there is Al-Huda. Al-Huda Mosque is one of the most known mosques all over Rafah, and it got bombed to pieces. Could you exactly tell me your name, please? AMZA NEDAL ABUL: Amza Nedal Abul (ph). BABA: Could you tell me what\'s happened exactly? ABUL: Every day we lose everything. We lose our family, we lose our health, we lose our mosques. We lose our children and our houses. You know, where\'s the humanity? I mean, where\'s the humanity? PERALTA: Where is the humanity, she keeps asking, where is the world? FADEL: OK, so let\'s ask that question. Where does the world stand on this? PERALTA: I mean, pretty much everyone - the U.S., the U.N., the EU, the U.K. - is warning Israel against moving into Rafah, and that\'s because Rafah is the last remaining relatively safe space for Palestinian refugees. Some 1.4 million Palestinians are now in Rafah. I spoke to Yousef Hammash, who works for the Norwegian Refugee Council, and he describes a desperate atmosphere. To the north you have bombing and hunger, and to the south you have Egypt, which does not want to take refugees. So everyone feels like they\'ve been painted into a corner, that there is nowhere to run. And if bombing begins, he says, it feels like the only choice you\'re left with is - the only choice you\'re left to make is how you want to die. It\'s worth noting that in a phone call, President Biden caution Prime Minister Netanyahu, saying that any military operation in Rafah should be accompanied by a credible plan to protect civilians. FADEL: That\'s NPR\'s Eyder Peralta reporting from Tel Aviv. Thank you, Eyder. PERALTA: Thank you, Leila. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: Former President Trump has reignited questions about what he\'d do to U.S. alliances as president. INSKEEP: At a campaign rally, the ex-president told a rambling tale of a supposed conversation with the leader of an unnamed nation in NATO, the North Atlantic Alliance. Trump pictured himself saying that if the NATO ally didn\'t pay enough, he would not protect them against Russia. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills. (CHEERING) INSKEEP: The ex-president, who is famous for failing to pay his own bills, appeared to misspeak about the nature of the NATO alliance, whose members do not owe bills. The nations do commit to spend a percentage of their budgets on defense. They are also committed to defend one another and came to the United States\' defense when it was attacked in 2001. FADEL: NPR\'s Stephen Fowler in Atlanta was at the rally and joins us now. Good morning. STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: So Donald Trump says he would encourage Russia to, quote, ""do whatever the hell they want"" to NATO countries in Europe that, in his mind, aren\'t spending enough on defense. Pretty controversial statement to make at a time Russia\'s actively at war in Ukraine and NATO allies feel threatened. What\'s his message with this statement? FOWLER: Well, Leila, Trump has been critical of NATO for a while. That\'s not a new development. FADEL: True. FOWLER: I mean, in fact, his presidency was marked by consistently questioning the value of international alliances broadly and NATO specifically. I mean, he repeatedly threatened in private to withdraw the U.S. from the alliance and publicly harangued other global powers like Germany and France to contribute more to defense spending. Over the last decade, NATO members have aimed to increase spending levels to 2% of their GDP, and as of last year, only 11 of 31 countries hit that target. That includes the U.S., which spends about 3.5%. As we heard, Trump falsely implies there are countries that haven\'t paid their bills or owe the U.S. or NATO directly. I mean, it\'s not like a country club where there are dues to be considered a member, it\'s a club of countries that have promised to defend and protect each other from threats. So why more spending over the years? Russian aggression over the last decade, which is complicated by Trump\'s vocal support of Russia. FADEL: What\'s the reaction been to his comments? FOWLER: Well, the White House issued a rare statement late Saturday calling the comments, quote, ""unhinged,"" said it was promoting deranged chaos and stressed that the stance of President Joe Biden\'s administration is that NATO is the largest and most vital it\'s ever been.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Sunday that any suggestion NATO allies would not honor the commitment to defend one another, quote, ""undermines all of our security."" Republicans in Congress largely shrugged it off as Trump being Trump. FADEL: An excuse we hear often from his Republican colleagues. So he\'s made a lot of people upset. Who is he appealing to here with these comments, Republican voters? FOWLER: Well, yes and no. I mean, remember, Trump isn\'t a fan of NATO. And if he\'s elected again, there\'s no telling what he would advocate for. But some of Trump\'s defenders do point out the veiled threat from his anecdote was ultimately successful because other European countries and NATO did start stepping up to the plate and beefing up their spending. There are GOP primary voters that want America\'s global footprint to retreat a little bit and focus more domestically, but this meandering message about NATO and funding and foreign policy is typical Trump. I mean, think stories where people say, sir. It was part of a nearly two-hour riff in front of his biggest supporters, but it didn\'t really make that much of an impact to the crowd. FADEL: That\'s NPR\'s Stephen Fowler in Atlanta. Thank you, Stephen. FOWLER: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: Now let\'s check a claim that\'s made in the immigration debate. Republicans who blocked a bipartisan immigration plan in Congress have been insisting it\'s not really needed. INSKEEP: House speaker Mike Johnson is among those making that assertion.

The union said Friday that nearly 9,000 workers at the Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville will strike on Feb. 23 if the local contract dispute is not resolved. If there\'s a strike, it would be the second time the union has walked out at the sprawling factory in the past year. In October, UAW workers shut down the plant during national contract negotiations that ended with large raises for employees. The plant, one of two Ford factories in Louisville, makes heavy-duty F-Series pickup trucks and the Ford Excursion and Lincoln Navigator large SUVs, all hugely profitable vehicles for the company. The union says that workers have been without a local contract for five months. The main areas of dispute are health and safety issues, minimum in-plant nurse staffing, ergonomic issues, and the company\'s effort to reduce the number of skilled trades workers. Ford said that negotiations continue and that it looks forward to reaching an agreement at the plant. The union says the strike could begin at 12:01 a.m. on Feb. 23. It says there are 19 other local agreements being negotiated with Ford, and several more at rivals General Motors and Stellantis. The strike threat comes one day after Ford CEO Jim Farley told an analysts\' conference in New York that last fall\'s contentious strike changed Ford\'s relationship with the union to the point where the automaker will ""think carefully"" about where it builds future vehicles. Farley said that the Louisville factory was the first truck plant that the UAW shut down during last year\'s strike, even though Ford made a conscious decision to build all of its pickup trucks in the U.S. Rivals General Motors and Stellantis have truck plants in the U.S. and Mexico.

But the two countries are in talks over how long those troops will stay. That\'s just one of the repercussions of the current conflict in the Middle East and a recent escalation in attacks between the U.S. and militias backed by Iran. NPR\'s Jane Arraf sent us this report from Baghdad. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in non-English language). JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: This was the scene in Baghdad from a funeral for a senior commander of the most powerful Iran-backed militia here, assassinated in the street in a U.S. drone strike. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in non-English language). ARRAF: Hundreds of fighters crowded the streets. A dozen of them carried the coffin of Abu Baqir Al-Saadi, a commander of Kataib Hezbollah, the Party of God Brigades, draped in a flag and covered with plastic flowers. This feels like it might be a turning point because this is not something that Kataib Hezbollah will forget. This funeral ceremony for a single man was more elaborate than that for 17 of their fighters killed on a base near Syria recently. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Non-English language spoken). ARRAF: A militia speaker, Sheikh Abu Talib Al-Saidi, praised the commander as a resistance fighter, saying he was involved in 25% of more than 200 attacks on U.S. and Israeli targets. ABU TALIB AL-SAIDI: (Through interpreter) Today, thanks to God Almighty and with the blessings of the Islamic resistance in Iraq and everyone for this brave, heroic and holy stance with the people of Gaza. ARRAF: Two weeks ago, a militia attack on a U.S. base in Jordan killed three U.S. service people. The U.S. says it bore the fingerprints of Kataib Hezbollah. It killed Al-Saadi in a drone strike in retaliation. QASIM AL-ARAJI: (Non-English language spoken). ARRAF: Iraq\'s national security adviser, Qasim al-Araji, is one of the mourners. He tells us that strike made clear the need to disband the U.S.-led military coalition. AL-ARAJI: (Through interpreter) This incident will reinforce the necessity of ending the international coalition\'s mission. I believe that one year is sufficient for the coalition forces to leave Iraq. ARRAF: While Al-Saadi was attacking the U.S., a close ally of Iraq, here\'s the complication - as al-Araji notes, the militia he belonged to, one that fought the militant Sunni group ISIS, is now part of Iraq\'s official security forces. AL-ARAJI: (Through interpreter) The man is a fighter and a leader of the Popular Mobilization Forces. The Popular Mobilization Forces are a national institution, and they are part of the security system. So this is a targeting of the sovereignty of the Iraqi state. ARRAF: The Kataib Hezbollah spokesman, Mohammed Mohi, says the U.S. will pay a heavy price. MOHAMMED MOHI: (Through interpreter) He is one of our major leaders that the United States dared to target. God willing, we will confront the United States and not only expel it from Iraq but the entire region, as well. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Chanting in non-English language). UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in non-English language). ARRAF: Before the assassination, Kataib Hezbollah said it would suspend attacks on the U.S. in deference to the Iraqi government. That all changed after the drone strike. Kataib Hezbollah is part of a coalition of mostly Iran-backed Shia militias targeting the U.S. and Israel. They\'re loosely connected to groups in other countries, like Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HASSAN NASRALLAH: (Non-English language spoken). ARRAF: ...Whose leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is fighting Israel across the Lebanese border. In Baghdad, we sat down with the spokesman for one of the other militias in the coalition, Kata\'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada. For Sheikh Kadhim al-Fartousi, this is a holy fight. Al-Fartousi says under Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, Iraqis were dragged into devastating wars with Iran and over Kuwait. KADHIM AL-FARTOUSI: (Through interpreter) Those wars were imposed on Iraq, but today the Iraqis are choosing this war. This war confirms that they belong to their homeland and to Iraqi sovereignty, and also confirms their belonging to the Arab and Islamic people in support of Palestine and Gaza. ARRAF: But in the streets and the glitzy cafes springing up in Baghdad, Iraqis are not choosing war. Most people not involved in militias are just trying to live their lives, find jobs, study, raise children in what they hope will eventually be a peaceful and prosperous country. It\'s a far cry from the chants of - death to America and death to Israel - at the militia events. It was mostly young fighters killed in the U.S. strike on an Iraqi militia base near the Syrian border, the first of the U.S. retaliatory strikes after the attack on its base in Jordan. Iraqi officials say militia leaders have left for Iran. Iraq\'s foreign minister, Fuad Hussein, tells us it\'s a difficult atmosphere to hold discussions on U.S. forces. FUAD HUSSEIN: I mean, if there will be attacks and counterattacks, then it will be difficult to negotiate. We cannot negotiate through bullets. ARRAF: The U.S. believes there should be a smaller U.S. military presence here but still a presence. Hussein says there\'s a more basic question. F HUSSEIN: Which kind of relationship do we want with the American? For Iraqis, we are really caught between an ally, which is the American, and a neighbor, which is the Iranian, and they are fighting each other on our soil. So this is very strange. ARRAF: Hussein canceled meetings with Iranian officials after Iran attacked a private home in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, claiming without proof it was an Israeli intelligence base. He says it\'s because Iran is afraid to attack Israel directly. F HUSSEIN: They must stop these kinds of attacks because they know that what they are talking about is baseless. But they are attacking us. If it is an attack against Israel, Israel is somewhere else. It\'s not in Iraq. ARRAF: The foreign minister, who is Kurdish, says since most Kurdish and Sunni parties want U.S. troops to stay in Iraq, any decision has to be a joint one. Twenty-one years ago, the U.S. invaded this country. It toppled Saddam Hussein but created a security vacuum. Following a civil war and then the war against the Sunni militant group ISIS, Iraq, while still volatile, has become a lot calmer in the last five years. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL GROUP: (Singing in non-English language). ARRAF: During a religious commemoration in Baghdad last week, millions of pilgrims walked to the shrine of a Shia imam - ceremonies banned under Saddam and later bombed by militant Sunni groups during the sectarian war. These pilgrims are walking in safety. (SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER WHIRRING) ARRAF: In the air, an Iraqi military helicopter hung with a huge religious banner keeps watch. The Shia, a majority in Iraq, are grateful for the religious freedom, but most don\'t want the complications of having U.S. forces here. QAID HASSAN HUSSEIN: (Non-English language spoken). ARRAF: An off-duty policeman, Qaid Hassan Hussein, is near a gas burner, stirring a huge pot of rice to help feed the pilgrims. Q HUSSEIN: (Non-English language spoken). ARRAF: ""A question,"" he says. Q HUSSEIN: (Non-English language spoken). ARRAF: He\'s saying that if you\'re in your house and a stranger comes, and he wants to enter and tell you who comes in and out, would you accept that? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL ARTIST: (Singing in non-English language). ARRAF: Two decades on, for many Iraqis, the U.S. is not just a stranger at the door but a threatening one.
