We’ve got employees and crews watching those fires 24/7, and they will continue to do so and continue to monitor that fire,” Eric Smith with Vista Outdoor said. “That’s where things stand right now. We’ve got two buildings on the property. One of the buildings was mostly saved, and the other one was completely damaged.” Smith is a spokesperson for Vista Outdoor, the parent company that owns Fibery Energy, which runs the pellet factory. “Vista Outdoor acquired Fiber Energy in late 2021. So we’ve owned the brand for about a little bit over two years,” Smith said. Fiber Energy makes pellets for grills and they’ve got a number of different customers, including retailers.” OzarksFirst asked Smith about what the next steps are for the factory, which has temporarily suspended regular operations at this time. “It’s too soon to tell right now,” Smith said. “Our number one focus right now is the employees and their families.” Smith said it’s also too soon to speak about whether the company would rebuild, or if they wouldn’t. “It has taken the facility completely offline, you know, which is going to keep people from working and earning a living,” Smith said. “We understand the challenges that this is going to cause. Our HR team is doing all we can to support them during this period. We’ve got HR people on the ground and HR people at corporate and other places working to make sure that we find the right solution for all these employees.” While the factory isn’t inside the city limits of Seymour, Missouri, Alicia Hagen, the town’s mayor says anything less than a full recovery would be devastating. “Even though they are outside the city limits, they are a part of our Seymour community and we care about that business and we care about the workers, not just from Seymour that work there, but also from the surrounding areas that depend on that plant for their income,” Hagen said. “They’re doing the best that they can to try to give their workers hours now.” Smith said the 29 employees at the factory, which none were injured in the fire, remain on the payroll at this time. “Some of the fires are, of course, still burning in the building, and we just want to make sure that the property is safe and that the employees are taken care of,” Smith said. “It’s way too soon to even speculate on what the the end result is going to be right now. We’ll obviously keep the community informed and first of all, keep our employees informed and then keep the community informed of what happens next.” Hagen said if the worst-case scenario turned into reality, she believes the Seymour community would step up for support. “We have several citizens that are dependent on that business for their income. As a city, we would do what we could to try to help support those people,” Hagen said. “We live in a community that is very supportive of each other. I’m sure any businesses looking to hire somebody would let that be known to any of these workers if they do find themselves without a job. We’re really hoping that that doesn’t happen. We would really like to see them recover from this. That’s what we’re praying for, that that this business is able to recover and go on and and go and back into full production operation.” Smith was unable to provide an estimate on the total cost of damages from the fire.
