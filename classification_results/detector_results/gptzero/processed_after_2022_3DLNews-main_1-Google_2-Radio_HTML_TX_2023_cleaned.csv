There is NO wrong answer to getting well. I will tell you from my own struggles that I required medicine for many years. This allowed me time to heal mentally and begin a life full of gratitude and thankfulness (I also found reading about Stoicism helped a lot). If religion works for you that\'s fantastic, but it\'s a lot to take on when you\'re already having mental problems. I can tell you in my dealing with Jacoby that he is very genuine and he may not even realize that he was putting out mixed messages. I hope no one ever says ""F@#% that"" and takes on a battle bigger than they can handle. If you or a loved one is experiencing suicidal thoughts, get help immediately and grab any lifeline you can, then sort the rest out later. Just dial ""988"" to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (in English and Spanish). Gallery Credit: Mikael Donnovan Gallery Credit: Chrissy'}]"

in this border city has nearly tripled. According to an investigation by KTEP News, Department of Public Safety troopers initiated 140 vehicle chases from January through June 21st. There were a total of 55 pursuits and 10 collisions last year. Of the 140 chases this year, at least 17 ended in a crash often resulting in injury. One person died. KTEP obtained the pursuit and collision data with a Texas Public Information request. Among the findings: Governor Abbott has long insisted that the state of Texas is working to “secure” what he calls “Biden’s open border.” Lieutenant Elizabeth Carter, a spokeswoman for DPS told KTEP News, said the agency takes precautions to protect the public during pursuits. “We want to mitigate the situation as safely as possible.” During a chase, troopers are required to inform a supervisor so they may “review and evaluate” each pursuit, according to the DPS manual. But “the decision of when to abandon a chase can only be made by the officer involved,” the manual states. “Each of our troopers have been trained and they have the discretion to make these judgment calls,” said Carter. DPS declined a request for a detailed interview about the pursuit policy and resulting collisions. The agency also did not provide information about the number of troopers assigned to El Paso County and the amount of Operation Lone Star funding spent along the border here. El Paso is the most populated city on the border and high speed chases can result in crashes in neighborhoods. The speed during a pursuit ranges from 60 to 133 miles an hour according to DPS data. Many of the chases ending in a collision reached speeds of 100 miles an hour or more. Pursuits last a few minutes or go on for up to half an hour and the distance they cover can extend up to 20 miles. One chase ended across the street from Alex Perez’s house in Central El Paso with a van crashing into a rock wall. “I hope it doesn’t happen again,” he said. DPS requires troopers consider several factors before chasing a suspect including population density, road conditions, weather and visibility. The type of crime and whether a suspect can be apprehended later are also weighed into the decision to pursue. James McLaughlin, executive director of the Texas Police Chiefs Association, said most law enforcement agencies require supervisors to be involved in decisions to continue or end pursuits. “The supervisor should be aware of the dangers,” he said. “If that supervisor, if he or she determines that the pursuit needs to be called off, they would. If not, they wouldn’t.” McLauglin said the surroundings should factor into law enforcement\'s decision to pursue a suspect on the road. “You need to be aware of everything going on around you.

The American Civil Liberties Union has called on the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate Texas’ Operation Lone Star. The civil rights group filed a complaint last year citing at least 30 deaths and 71 injuries related to DPS chases near the border. It also alleges DPS traffic traffic stops disproportionately target Latino drivers. This year the Border Network for Human Rights in its annual report on alleged civil and human rights abuses included concerns about DPS troopers. “We are asking legislators to create some sort of commission to bring about accountability to DPS,” he said. “It is a rogue agency.” Garcia calls Operation Lone Star “political theater,” pointing out the number of migrants crossing the border has sharply declined since the lifting of Title 42 in May.

Germany. Patitz died recently at the age of 56. (Alexander Koerner/Getty Images for Chanel) Supermodel Tatjana Patitz has died. She was 56 years old. >> Read more trending news Patitz was featured on magazine covers in the 1980s and 1990s, The Associated Press reported. She also appeared in George Michael’s music video for “Freedom” alongside Cindy Crawford, Linda Evangelista and Naomi Campbell, Harper’s Bazaar reported in 2020. When talking about the music video, Patitz told the publication, “It represents an era in pop culture, and it was at the height of the early ‘90s when the fashion, film and music industries blended together. MTV was huge at the time with all the incredible music videos. I became more recognizable in a different way I think.” In addition to the “Freedom” video, she also appeared in Duran Duran’s “Skin Trade” video, and as a murder victim in 1993′s “Rising Sun” starring Sean Connery, the Mirror reported. She was frequently photographed by Peter Lindbergh, who used her for his 1988 photo, “White Shirts: Six Supermodels in Malibu,” and for a cover for British Vogue in January 1990, the AP reported. Vogue called Patitz “the quietest and perhaps the most intense of the original supermodels” in her obituary, saying that she “never seemed to be part of ‘the pack.’” Patitz was born in Germany and raised in Sweden, by an Estonian mother and a German father. She was a tomboy and competitive horse rider in 1983 when she entered a modeling contest in Stockholm, earning third place in all of Sweden and winning a trip to Paris and a limited-time contract where she struggled, not getting work for a year, Vogue reported. But when Lindbergh found her, her world changed with Vogue calling him “the fairy godfather of Patitz’s career.” Condé Nast chief content officer Anna Wintour called Patitz’s beauty, “always the European symbol of chic, like Romy Schneider-meets-Monica Vitti. “She was far less visible than her peers—more mysterious, more grown-up, more unattainable—and that had its own appeal.” Patitz acknowledged her individual look in a 1988 Vogue profile, saying, “people always said that I looked special; that I didn’t look like anyone else. And I was going to make it because of that.” Patitz spent her downtime at her home in California, away from the lights of Paris or New York, and closer to nature and animals. By 2006, Patitz said the golden era of supermodels had ended, the AP reported. “There was a real era, and the reason that happened was because glamour was brought into it,” she told Prestige Hong Kong magazine, according to the AP. “Now the celebrities and actresses have taken over, and the models are in the backseat completely.” She also had strong words for the newer models, saying the women of her era had healthier physiques, the AP reported. “Women were healthy, not these scrawny little models that nobody knows their names anymore,” Patitz said. Patitz had dated several entertainers over the years including Seal, Pierce Brosnan and Nick Kamen, the Mirror reported. According to her New York agent, Corinne Nicolas from the Model CoOp agency, Patitz’s died in Santa Barbara, California, from an illness, but the specific illness and other details, including when exactly she died, were not released, the AP reported. Patitz leaves behind her son Jonah, whom she shared with ex-husband Jason Johnson, the Mirror reported. She had called Jonah her “source of happiness.” Through the years Model Tatjana Patitz (Photo by George Chinsee/WWD/Penske Media via Getty Images) (WWD/Penske Media via Getty Images) Sign up below to be added to our mailing list for the latest news updates, access to exclusive contests, and more!

concerns about the management of the Post Oak Savannah Groundwater Conservation District. Dr. Curtis Chubb, who is a member of the Central Texas Aquifer Coalition, said that the management of Post Oak Savannah has been too eager to hand out water well permits to large scale water marketers. Chubb told the Giddings Times that water marketers, such as the Vista Ridge Project, which is northeast of the Lee County line, are pumping billions of gallons of water to other areas of the state. In one instance, Vista Ridge is sending water from the Simsboro and Carrizo Aquifers through a 142-mile pipeline to San Antonio. The pipeline supplied 194,100 homes, or 14% of the city’s total water usage. Dr. Chubb said that the rate that the aquifers are being drained is unsustainable.

However, Michael’s Traffic cone costume made me laugh out loud because I wasn’t expecting to see a life-size traffic cone on my TV screen that day so seeing him pop up on my screen with a serious face in his traffic cone costume was just a treat! I literally laughed out loud and said “Freaking Michael!” It was such a simple costume but it just made sense! And sometimes the most simple costumes can turn out to be the best! After the Good Morning El Paso team finished their morning shift they all got together for a group photo that featured Hillary Floren as Buddy the Elf, Saul Seinz as a captain, and the rest of the behind-the-scenes crew joined in on the fun as well! Avery Goes From ‘Being Mindful’ To Being Doppler Doppelganger: But the icing on this Halloween cake had to have been KVIA’s ‘Be Mindful’ reporter, Avery Martinez, and his take on the man, the myth, the legend: Doppler Dave Speelman. During ABC-7 at Noon, Avery popped up to wrap up the show with the final forecast dressed as Chief Meteorologist, Doppler Dave Speelman. I saw the clip of his forecast on Instagram and again, I found myself laughing out loud! From his hair to his clothing, to his voice and long pauses, Avery was on point with his Doppler Dave impersonation! Avery even made sure to have props to complete the costume: A bag of pecans (Because Doppler has a pecan farm) and a Luby’s menu (Because Doppler LOVES Luby’s.) Hi Barbie! Even the evening news team got in on the action with Stephanie Valle dressing up as “News Anchor Barbie.” She was rocking a bright pink outfit, pink earrings, and her straight hair that looked AMAZING! Nothing Cheesy about this costume! KVIA’s evening reporter and storm tracker, Sarah Coria, also joined in on the fun with her take on everyone’s favorite dish, Macaroni & Cheese! Seeing the KVIA team let loose and get into the holiday spirit was a welcomed change of pace and It just goes to show that even in the world of bad news, there's always room for a little Halloween fun. Thanks for brightening our day, ABC-7 team! Next year, can someone dress up as me? I’ll provide the Mija T-shirt, but you’re on your own with the anxiety meds!""}]"

Later on, Trump referred to himself as ""a very proud election denier."" Authoritarian rhetoric has been central to Trump\'s political trajectory - and his time as president.

She points to a New York Times report that Trump is looking for potential appointees who will not stymie his attempts at greater executive power. Authoritarianism, in fact, has been found to be key to Trump\'s political success. In a 2016 study, political scientist Matthew MacWilliams found that belief in authoritarian ideas was the greatest predictor of support for Trump in that Republican primary. And even in America\'s heretofore stable democracy, authoritarianism is relatively popular – MacWilliams later found that around 4 in 10 Americans have authoritarian preferences. ""What we have witnessed from Trump over the last few weeks is something new,"" said Robert Jones, founder of the Public Religion Research Institute, or PRRI. ""Trump has clearly crossed into the domain of Nazi ideology openly."" Jones also pointed to a recent interview with the far-right website The National Pulse, in which Trump said that immigration is ""a very sad thing for our country; it\'s poisoning the blood of our country."" The Trump campaign firmly denies any connection to Nazi rhetoric. In a statement, spokesman Steven Cheung told NPR: ""Everything President Trump is saying is true. It\'s honestly despicable and racist for any news organization to make disgusting connections as they have done in the past few days."" He added, ""There has been no bigger ally to Israel and the Jewish people than President Trump."" Many people listening to his speech or that National Pulse interview might not realize that Trump\'s language echoes language Hitler used. But Jones argues that that\'s not the only reason Trump\'s language matters: ""This language of rooting out vermin – the reason why authoritarian leaders use that is because it does dehumanize their political opponents,"" he explained. ""The dehumanization of political opponents are the bricks that pave the road to political violence,"" Jones said. PRRI recently found that 23 percent of voters, including one-third of Republicans, agreed that ""true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country."" That poll also found that 38 percent of Americans, including nearly half of Republicans, agree that the U.S. needs a leader who ""is willing to break some rules if that is what it takes to set things right."" Jones sees this as a clear indication of authoritarian sentiment. Othering an entire group, whether it\'s immigrants or political opponents, is powerful for authoritarians, says Ben-Ghiat. ""You need to get people to feel they have an existential threat facing them,"" she said. ""And the more they feel uncertain and fearful, the more the strongmen can appear and say, \'I alone can fix it.\'"" And ""I alone can fix it"" is a sentiment Americans have heard before – Trump said exactly that when he first accepted the Republican nomination in 2016.

The earthquake that struck around 4:30 a.m. Central northwest of Pecos is tied for the fourth strongest recorded in Texas, according to the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin, and could be felt as far away as El Paso and Roswell, New Mexico. The number and strength of earthquakes in West Texas has dramatically increased after years of hydraulic fracturing activity in the region. A routine practice of injecting the contaminated, salty water that comes up during the oil production process deep underground has been linked by scientists to the increase in seismic activity in oilfields. Years of pumping millions and millions of gallons of the so-called produced water back underground as a disposal method has likely increased pressure and awakened ancient fault lines, scientists have told the Tribune. There are almost 80 injection wells in the Culberson County and Reeves County areas, according to data from the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the state\'s oil and gas industry. The quake is the second 5.0 magnitude or greater earthquake to occur in the area in just over a year. Such strong earthquakes in Texas used to be quite rare, scientists said. “It’s not just this earthquake,” said Alexandros Savvaidis, a senior research scientist at the Bureau of Economic Geology at UT-Austin. He pointed to a recent 4.0 magnitude quake that occurred in the same region at the end of August, and several other 3.5 magnitude or higher quakes that shook Culberson and Reeves counties in the summer and fall. “There have been other earthquakes and seismicity ramping up again recently in the last few months,” Savvaidis said. In late 2021, state regulators determined that the “unprecedented frequency” of significant earthquakes in Culberson and Reeves counties was likely being caused by the injection of salty water underground. The state Railroad Commission ordered companies in the region to create a plan to reduce the amount of water they were injecting underground in that area. The plan was supposed to ensure that the frequency of 3.5 magnitude or higher earthquakes was decreasing after 18 months, which would have been in September. A Railroad Commission inspector was sent to the area Wednesday to inspect disposal wells in the area, according to R.J. DeSilva, a spokesperson for the commission. ""The RRC has been working with operators in the area to limit volumes of produced water injected into disposal wells to reduce the intensity and frequency of earthquakes in the region,"" DeSilva said. He added that the agency will decide whether to take further action based on inspections, data, and meetings with oilfield operators and the Bureau of Economic Geology at UT-Austin. Still, Justin Rubinstein, a research geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey, said that he doesn\'t necessarily expect that the number and strength of earthquakes will decline in the area even as water injections slow. “Obviously, the changes have not resulted in a reduced earthquake rate yet,” Rubinstein said. Other areas where water injections caused seismic activity show that earthquakes can persist for years after injections cease, he said. “We can make forecasts, but the Earth is incredibly complex,” he added. After a 5.4 magnitude earthquake occurred last November, Railroad Commission staff expanded the region where injections would be restricted and asked companies to further reduce the volume of water being injected underground in the area to 162,000 barrels per day, or about 6.8 million gallons a day. That’s a 68% decrease from the volume injected in January 2022, according to the agency.

In April, the Queens of the Stone Age bandleader revealed he\'d been diagnosed with a form of cancer in 2022 without specifying what kind. He\'s since recovered after a successful operation to remove it — a hopeful outcome after he experienced the 2022 deaths of his former bandmate in Queens of the Stone Age, the Screaming Trees\' Mark Lanegan, and his friend Taylor Hawkins, the late drummer of Foo Fighters.

she had lost three pounds the other morning. I cringe even writing that. I’ve purposely made it a point to not weigh myself in front of her and to not talk about weight gain or loss in front of her. I have fought hard to display a healthy body image of myself, knowing she is watching. But the truth is these efforts don’t matter because we live in a world where girls and women are constantly reminded of what is considered beautiful, what kind of bodies are desired and wanted. We live in a world where a well-meaning doctor, at last week’s well-child check, tries to discreetly tell you your daughter’s BMI is slightly elevated, mentions COVID has played a part and she understands but encourages you to serve more veggies. Except … she wasn’t as discreet as she thought and your daughter bursts into tears the moment you step out of the office doors, clinging to you as her tears and face press into your own “soft” belly. Unfortunately, I know this world myself. When I became an accidental runner (a story for another time) I watched my body shrink the more miles I logged. So, I embraced my all or nothing mentality, running more and eating less. I met new goals, ran a half marathon and still compared myself to thinner versions of myself. Would it ever be enough? Do you sometimes struggle with your parenting decisions? Check out “Stop Worrying about Parental Errors” with Rebecca St. James. A few years ago after a major career change for my husband and a life change for our family, I began to feel as if I was drowning. I decided to do some good work. Except it wasn’t on a trail, with Weight Watchers, or in my fitness app, instead it was in a counselor’s office. Ironically, this acceptance of myself has been off-putting to others. Even those close to me, their words cutting deep. I’ve shed tears. I’ve even tried to shed some weight, but all the efforts I made previously just aren’t cutting it and the same all or nothing motivation isn’t there. I spent a better portion of my childhood feeling like I didn’t measure up. I had shattered self-esteem. The first decade of marriage and motherhood felt like a blur, and I kept walking into each new season the best I knew how to. I stepped – … until I stopped trying to be better. I wanted to just be. I did deep work, spending hours on a worn couch, working through the junk I had been holding. I may not have been training for a marathon, but it was hard work. Yet, I’m still reminded of a fallen world that places more value on outward appearance than what is inside the heart. A verse I spent a lot of time meditating on a few years ago was Deuteronomy 6:5. “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might” (ESV). If we aren’t emotionally healthy, how can we love with all our souls? Of course, we should steward the bodies God has given us well. But how many of us are trying to move our bodies, and somewhat watch what we eat, and still carry extra weight? How many of us: My daughter eats the same thing I feed her older brothers and is practically more active than they are, and still, she has to carry this memory and the way it made her feel for years to come. Maybe they do, maybe they don’t, but what may be truer is that they could be walking through their own emotional junk, whether they realize it or not. So when my daughter came into the kitchen smiling and pulled me down to whisper her words of achievement in my ear, my heart dropped along with my head, wondering what to say. I wanted to affirm her excitement but not in a way that made her think she needed to lose weight. I wanted to tell her all scales are different, and it didn’t matter. I wanted to tell her it’s what is on the inside that counts. I wanted to tell her God made her just the way she is. The way I wish those who have hurt me with their words would have done when the topic of “weight gain” came up. The way I know my Father in Heaven does. And I said a prayer, thanking God for meeting me in the midst of working through my emotional baggage, for having a deeper relationship with Him because of it and for being where I am today, extra weight and all. So, if you don’t have anyone to say this to you, let it be me. God cares deeply about your heart and your emotional health. It can be daunting to dive into something that feels so layered. I promise you the work is worth it. Steward your body as well as you can, but more importantly steward your heart well. And when others’ hurtful words leave you feeling bitter and resentful, be diligent to pray about it, understanding you don’t want to carry that resentment, remembering you want to keep your heart healthy. You are good, and you are wanted by Him, flaws and all. Sarah Nichols is a writer who loves encouraging women by sharing hope-filled stories that point others to Jesus.

Even though it carries a name that might appeal to some Texans, it has nothing to do with the University of Texas or the Great State of Texas... yet. The Asian Longhorned Tick, however, is in the Great State of Arkansas along with 18 other states, and it\'s spreading fast. Information gleaned from the Arkansas Department of Agriculture states that on June 5, 2018, the presence of the longhorned tick (Haemaphysalis longicornis) in Arkansas was officially confirmed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory. The confirmation stemmed from a specimen obtained from a dog in Benton County, submitted as part of a research project at Oklahoma State University (OSU). Utilizing a photograph and molecular typing conducted at OSU, NVSL verified the identity of the longhorned tick. Ongoing epidemiological investigations are being conducted in collaboration with the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Originating from East Asia, the longhorned tick is considered exotic and is linked to bacterial and viral tickborne diseases affecting animals and humans globally. Recognized as a significant threat to livestock by the USDA, heavy infestations of these ticks can lead to issues such as stunted growth, reduced production, and even animal fatalities. In various countries, the longhorned tick has been associated with human diseases, including severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Similar to deer ticks, the nymphs of the longhorned tick are minute, resembling tiny spiders, making them easily overlooked on both animals and humans. This tick species is known to infest a diverse range of hosts, posing a potential threat to North American wildlife species, as well as humans, dogs, cats, and livestock. Vigilant monitoring and further research are imperative to understand and address the implications of the longhorned tick\'s presence in Arkansas. According to the Arkansas Department of Agriculture, these are the ""need to know"" items about the Asian Longhorned Tick: Not even joking here, they want to see your ticks. If you find ticks on yourself or on your animals, these mad scientists want to see them. There are specific ways to submit your tick, click below to learn how.

This is known as the “singles tax.” For example, according to the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center, in Missouri, the cost of a year’s worth of typical expenses before taxes for a single-person household is $29,880 a year. The cost for a two-person household is $47,483 a year. Splitting expenses for a two-person household is more than $6,000 cheaper than the entire expenses for a single-person household. In turn, single people often have to find supplemental income to stay on par with their two-person household counterparts, many of whom turn to roommates to cover that cost. Married couples also get advantages when it comes to income taxes that single individuals are not privy to such as the marriage tax penalty or bonus. According to CNBC, the “marriage tax penalty” is when a couple combines their incomes and enters a higher tax bracket. “The ‘marriage tax bonus’ occurs when couples pay less in income taxes when they file jointly than they would have as individuals,” CNBC notes. Tax laws were made to benefit two household incomes as opposed to someone filing alone. The biggest expense for singles living alone is the cost of housing, which seems to rise every year. If you’re single, the best but often most difficult decision is to get a roommate or downsize as much as you can. “It’s even more important for you to budget, to understand how much money you’re making, how much money you’re spending, where is your money going,” financial planner Kamila Elliott, told CNBC. “Think about yourself integrating into a community and identifying ways to help minimize some of your day-to-day expenses.” Of course, living alone has some benefits. Financial freedom to spend your money only on yourself is an amazing feeling, but is it worth it when every year more and more of your bread has to go to rent or groceries?

Fixer to Fabulous have built and remodeled hundreds of homes over the last two decades, creating joyful, warm, and thoughtful makeovers in each one. They believe your home should be beautiful – not based on how the latest trends define beauty, but as a reflection of who you are. They joined Family Life Radio’s Morning Show in a conversation about Jenny’s new book, “House + Love = Home: Creating Warm, Intentional Spaces for a Beautiful Life.” We’re sharing a sample of the book here with you and invite you to watch the conversation. Excerpted from House + Love = Home by Jenny Marrs. The Porch Swing Our older daughter, Sylvie, is adopted. Her birth country is in central Africa and her journey into our family was tumultuous to say the least. Dave and I had to fight bureaucracy, red tape, and political posturing for two very long, very hard years to bring her home. During the wait, I spent countless hours sitting on our front porch swing, praying for her health and safety and for the miracle to take place that would finally bring her home to us. Our porch swing was the site of every photograph that marked an important milestone during those difficult years of waiting. We have a photo of her brothers sitting on the swing, holding a sign announcing Sylvie’s adoption, which we shared with the wider circles of our families. A year or so later, Sylvie had still not reached us. Another photo: her brothers sitting on the swing, holding up a photo of her in Africa alongside an ultrasound photo of the joyful, albeit unexpected, pregnancy of her soon-to-arrive younger sister. Only three years old then, Nate and Ben were so excited by the idea of these two new sisters whom they had not yet met. Months later, as we continued to wait for Sylvie, we all sat on the swing again for a photo, this time holding our newborn daughter, Charlotte, and another updated photo of Sylvie. Finally, after 602 days of clinging to hope, our daughter arrived on U.S. soil and came to us, by which time we had moved to our current home, where we had a large porch swing built by Dave, perfect for more photographs. As long as I live, I will never forget the thrill of that first morning with Sylvie. She and I were both restless. I eventually gave up on sleep and scooped her up, tiptoeing to the front door. I quietly turned the knob and we stepped out together onto the front porch. The sun was breaking through the horizon, as she clung to me. I took a seat on that much-used swing. The rays of sunlight warmed my bare feet. The air was still, and the world was hushed. It seemed as if the birds even refrained from their typical morning chatter. Time felt suspended as I held my girl and gently rocked her back and forth. We didn’t speak. We simply sat together holding on to each other. She hadn’t been in my arms since the summer before when I had had to leave her behind at the end of a visit. In the many months since, I had been haunted by the memory of her tears as she was ripped from my embrace in the dark, sweltering summer night back in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I had often wondered if I would ever feel the weight of her toddler frame again. That morning, under the glow of a summer’s sunrise, I rubbed her back and my tears fell. She was indeed here: This was real. The porch swing that had held so many tears of sorrow and grief and utter helplessness now held tears of sheer joy and unimaginable gratitude. To me, the front porch isn’t a space to overlook on the way into a home, it is an extension of the home itself. It’s the place where I start my day, on my beloved porch swing, piping hot coffee in hand, watching the world awaken around me. It’s the place for midsummer afternoon naps, the soft breeze gently lulling me to sleep. It’s the place where our family gathers at the end of a long day, our very own watchtower from which to witness the sky shift from soft hues of blue to vibrant pinks and burning reds as the sun dips below the horizon. It’s the place where Dave and I will sip a glass of full-bodied red wine and listen to the high-pitched tune of the cicadas’ song after tucking all the kids into bed. The rhythm of my day is calibrated by stepping out my front door and onto my front porch. I begin and end most days here and find myself exhaling with gratitude as I look out above the handrail. Of all the beautiful places I’ve seen in the world, the view from my front porch will always be my favorite. I’ve witnessed so much change from here. We created a farm where there was once wild, unruly vines and brush. We now have a pasture full of animals and a pond they meander to throughout the day. We marvel as we watch brand-new mommas coax their shaky-legged newborn lambs to their feet. After growing up in Florida, where the seasons consisted of hot and very hot, I am constantly in awe of the beauty of this place; my view changes with the four seasons. The vibrant green of spring turns to the deep, lush landscape of summer. Fall brings golden light and changing leaves before the magical, soft, white hush of a winter’s snow appears. Yes, the kitchen is often called the heart of the home. Yet I believe the front porch is the soul. It’s often more still. But if ever there were a space to represent hospitality, it is the front porch. It is the first welcoming place, a threshold to cross when entering a home. It’s also a place to gather. I couldn’t possibly count the number of deep, authentic conversations about community or parenting or faith we have shared with friends on our front porch. When Dave and I first moved to our farmhouse, I felt isolated. We had been living in our town’s historic downtown area, where we could easily walk to friends’ houses and guests would spontaneously drop by while on a walk in the evening or for coffee in the morning. I loved it. I loved every unexpected visitor and the constant presence of our little community within the walls of our home. When we moved to the farmhouse on the outskirts of town, we were too far away for walking-past, dropping-by friends to pop over. The days were long with a newborn, a toddler, and twin four-year-olds at home. Dave was working, building our business, while I had left my career to focus on our littles for a season. I craved adult interaction and missed having impromptu company. Our eldest daughter was newly home from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and most days our home felt like a triage center. I was juggling Sylvie’s needs with the constant demands of newborn Charlotte, along with our preschool boys who had just had their entire world flipped upside down. I was burned out and certainly didn’t shower consistently. Our house was never clean and laundry piles were the only constant. The thought of inviting friends over for a dinner party seemed exhausting and absurd. Yet, one Sunday afternoon I ignored the absurdity and sent out an SOS text to three of my dearest friends. They showed up with the makings of dinner—Corrie brought a Caesar salad, Erin brought chili and fresh bread, and Melissa brought her mom’s famous fudge pie and a bottle of wine. Their husbands and kids came along and, before I knew it, our home was full of laughter and the sounds of glasses clinking. We pushed aside the craft projects on the kitchen table, lit a few candles, and ladled soup into bowls. The kids went to eat on the porch while the adults sat around the table. As I lowered myself into the chair, I exhaled a sigh of deep gratitude to be gathered again with our people. That Sunday became the first of a long-standing series of Sunday dinners that lasted for years. After dinner, we would carry our plates of dessert out to the front porch swings—we now have two—and rocking chairs. A few of us would spill over onto the stoop. The kiddos would run around in the yard, chasing after the flickering light of fireflies. Sometimes they’d be entertained by the baby lambs leaping in the pasture or by tumbling down the hay bales that they fruitlessly tried to ascend.

Maddow says there\'s a reason to know this history now because calculated efforts to undermine democracy, foment a coup and spread disinformation.

Maddow for 14 years hosted MSNBC\'s flagship show before cutting back last year to devote more time to deeply reported longform projects like ""Ultra."" At the time when Rachel Maddow spoke to Terry last December, it had been announced that Steven Spielberg\'s production company optioned the movie rights for ""Ultra."" (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) TERRY GROSS: Rachel Maddow, welcome back to FRESH AIR. And congratulations on the news that Steven Spielberg optioned your podcast for a movie, which makes perfect sense \'cause it\'s about World War II and it\'s about antisemitism. RACHEL MADDOW: Oh, Terry, thank you so much for having me. It is - even just hearing you say those words - the words Steven Spielberg associated with something that I\'m working on, it\'s very overwhelming. It\'s hard to believe. But I\'m really excited. GROSS: Well, I hope they get to pick your brain (laughter) for the movie \'cause you know so much. So let\'s talk about the podcast. It\'s - I learned so much from it. I found it so remarkable, as I\'m sure all your listeners did, that there were sitting congressmen and senators in collusion with an agent from Hitler\'s Germany, somebody who they knew was an agent from Hitler\'s Germany. What did Hitler\'s government want from the congressmen? MADDOW: Very good question and one of the things that I think is oddly and sort of disturbingly most relevant to what\'s happened in our world in recent years. What they wanted in most instrumental terms was for the United States to not enter World War II. And so they wanted to make us distrust and dislike and lose support for our allies, particularly Britain. By the summer of 1940, Britain was sort of the last man standing in fighting Germany. And there was - I don\'t think there was a reasonable expectation either way in terms of whether or not Britain was going to survive. And so Germany wanted to make sure that Americans, who in a native way didn\'t necessarily want to get involved in another war, felt like getting involved would be hopeless, felt like the Germans were inevitable victors in the war. And then you get to the sort of next stages, which is that they wanted Americans to think that it wouldn\'t be so bad if Germany won. And that meant not only softening up any hard feelings we might have toward Germany in the way that we knew Hitler was behaving both in Europe and toward his own people, but also feeling more inclined toward fascism ourselves. GROSS: Did I overstate it when I said that the members of Congress who dealt with this German spy knew that he was a spy for Hitler\'s Germany? MADDOW: George Sylvester Viereck was a very high-profile German agent. There is no way that American members of Congress in the Senate who were dealing with him in World War II didn\'t know that he was a representative of Hitler\'s government. In World War I, for example, Viereck had been the source of national scandal when it appeared in some pro-German publications he was running at the time that he had advanced knowledge that the Lusitania was going to be sunk, which of course was a precipitating event for the U.S. joining World War I and killed lots of Americans and lots of other civilians. He was also prosecuted as a Nazi agent successfully during this period. So members of Congress who were working for him couldn\'t have mistaken him for a random publicist who walked in their door offering to write their speeches. GROSS: So what are some of the things that this Nazi spy, George Viereck, asked the congresspeople who he was in cahoots with to do, and what did the congressmen get in return? MADDOW: Congressmen, in many instances, got paid, which is depressing to me, that that may have been part of the motivation for some of what they did. But they - a number of them did get paid. And a number of them got paid kind of a lot of money. What he would do is he would either write himself - or more often get propaganda tracts from the Hitler government in Berlin - and he would effectively ask members of Congress and senators to deliver that material as speeches in the House or the Senate or to publish them under his publishing house imprint, which was paid for by the German government, or to otherwise have those things inserted in the Congressional record. And the reason it was important to either have them delivered in the House of the Senate or inserted in the Congressional record is because then that brought into force something called the franking privilege, which is a very boring term, but it means that a member of the Senate or a member of the House can send out, free of charge, infinite numbers of copies of anything that was set on the Senate floor or the House floor or put in the Congressional record. You can mail it out for free. And Viereck realized that and used that congressional privilege to effectively charge the American taxpayers for the privilege of Hitler\'s government propaganda being sent out under the name of various senators and congressmen by the millions of pieces into American homes cost-free to the Germans and paid for by the U.S. taxpayer, arranged by a Nazi agent. GROSS: So some of the congressmen who were colluding with this Nazi propagandist, agent, spy - some of these congressmen were members of the America First Committee. What was the committee? MADDOW: The America First Committee was the biggest and most influential American political group in the country in the immediate lead-up to World War II. They were very respectable. They were founded by a bunch of titans of industry and by very well-connected young men who had - came from good families and had great connections. And they grew very fast between 1940 and 1941 to have about a million members and chapters in every state in the country and individual chapters in cities within those states. They were huge and very influential. And they faced charges from the beginning that they were pro-German, but they took great strides to make sure that they didn\'t seem too German, that they were just a patriotic organization. They were hurt, ultimately, I think, when their leadership in particular, Charles Lindbergh, the famous aviator who became their leading spokesman, started to speak more bluntly in antisemitic terms. And a lot of their membership had that hang up and had a tendency to talk in those terms. But when it started happening from the top, when Lindbergh started blaming the Jews for wanting us to get into World War II, their support started to get hollowed out a little bit. GROSS: And their meetings had Nazi salutes and swastikas and really horrible rhetoric. How did the congressmen participate in the America First Committee? Like, what was their role in the committee? MADDOW: There were mostly speakers. So the America First Committee would do big rallies, the famous ones in Madison Square Garden and places like that in New York City. But they\'d have major events all around the country, all up and - coast to coast and all over the Midwest. And they\'d bring in, like, an excellent high-profile senator or speaker, like a Burton K. Wheeler from Montana - Democratic senator from Montana, who was a very, very high-profile senator and a very good speaker. And he\'d come in as their headliner. And he\'d lead these rallies. And he did that for dozens of America First events. And lots of other members of Congress did that.

XXL has reached out to Polo G\'s attorney and the Los Angeles Police Department for comment. This is the latest in multiple incidents Trench Baby has been charged with in California. On Aug. 23, Polo G\'s Los Angeles home was raided, with police arresting Polo G and Trench Baby at the home. They were both charged with kidnapping, robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. Following the arrest, Polo G\'s attorney Bradford Cohen released the following statement to XXL: ""The incident surrounded someone staying in Polo\'s home and not Polo directly. The officers have detained Polo to \'verify\' that he is not a convicted felon, as they assert a firearm was found in the home. It is widely known that Polo is not a convicted felon and never was a convicted felon. I personally got all his charges in Miami dismissed when he was in our opinion wrongfully arrested and charged. They have refused to allow us access to our client which is also an illegal and unethical practice and someone will have to answer for these new wrongful actions."" It was later reported seven guns were discovered in Polo G\'s home. The robbery charge is reportedly in connection to Trench Baby allegedly robbing a man on Aug. 15 at a Granada Hills, Calif. music video shoot. The alleged victim, the video director, told police Trench Baby approached him and demanded the money off his person and also made the director wire Trench Baby more funds.'}]"

his brother\'s grave. As he grieved the loss of his brother, he said he became so depressed he lost all interest in life and wanted to die. ""I felt that we are unheard,"" Alnaouq told Morning Edition. ""That people don\'t care about us, that our stories are not heard, that our suffering is not noticed from anyone in the world, especially the West."" One day, Alnaouq heard from one of his American journalist friends, who asked how he was really doing. He started crying, and said he was spending his time in the graveyard. She told him he should write about how he feels in English. At first, he didn\'t think it was a good idea. ""I told her, why would I do that? They will not care about our stories. They look at us as subhumans. That we are all terrorists,"" he said. But he eventually decided to pen his story, and he got a positive response from readers. ""They read my story and they care about me. It made me feel better that I was wrong. Some people care about us. Not all the listeners think of us as subhumans,"" he said. After going through the process of sharing his own personal story, Alnaouq wanted to offer an outlet for other young Palestinian writers to do the same. He started training writers from Gaza and pairing them up with international mentors to help them write their stories in English. The project then grew into him founding the organization We Are Not Numbers, and he\'s been working for the project ever since. Since 2015, We Are Not Numbers has published hundreds of stories, poems and features telling the stories of Palestinians. Over time, they\'ve expanded to include writers from the West Bank, Lebanon, and Palestinians from all over the world – with Alnaouq moving from Gaza to London in the years since launching the project. After October 7, most of their writers have lost internet connection and electricity. We Are Not Numbers has managed to get some stories out from writers who have been able to briefly connect to the internet. And Alnaouq says the stories that do get out make a difference. ""I think Israel knows that citizen journalists in Palestine are making a huge difference by talking and posting about what\'s going on in Palestine. And that\'s why they are cutting the telecommunications in Gaza. Because they don\'t want the world to know what they are actually doing [on] the ground,"" said Alnaouq. He says it\'s more difficult to get stories out of Gaza than ever. ""Three of our writers have been killed already. Some of our writers lost their loved ones. Many of our writers lost their mothers, their fathers, their brothers and sisters. Many of them had to flee their homes and move south to live in a hospital or in a school,"" said Alnaouq. The UN Secretary General\'s office released a statement on Monday calling the humanitarian situation in Gaza a ""catastrophe"" that is ""getting worse by the day."" Over a million people have been displaced from their homes in Gaza, sleeping in crowded school classrooms and hospitals to shelter from Israeli bombardment. ""No words can actually describe the horror that they are seeing now in Gaza,"" said Alnaouq. Alnaouq never imagined an Israeli airstrike would hit his family home in South Gaza because Israel had been asking people to evacuate to the area. Alnaouq said his father, two brothers, three sisters, and 14 nieces and nephews were killed on October 22nd. The only two who survived were his sister-in-law and nephew. His brother, who was next to them on the same bed, was killed. ""They were peaceful people who just wanted to live in peace, and wanted to have a good life,"" Alnaouq said. ""They were sleeping in my home when they were bombed and killed."" The only family Alnaouq has left in Gaza are two sisters. He says he forces himself to check in on them every two days, although he dreads the call. ""The last time I talked to my sister two days ago, she told me that her children are starving, they don\'t have food, they don\'t have fresh water,"" he said. ""Two days ago, she told me that Israel just bombed her home. Every time I talk to them, they tell me some harsh news that I can\'t deal with."" Alnaouq says he is a different person now. ""I\'m changed forever. No words can actually describe what I am feeling, what I\'m going through right now,"" said Alnaouq. ""My home, where I grew up, where I went to school, where I had all my memories. It\'s all gone in one minute."" _________________________________________________ Alnaouq remembers his family in the tribute below. ""My father was a very, very gentle man. Very kind person, very compassionate. He did not have dreams, to be honest. He was a very simple man who just wanted to live with his children and his safe home.
