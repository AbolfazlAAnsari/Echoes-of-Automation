instrument that was aided by a husband-and-wife team of journalists helped reunite Beatles star Paul McCartney with the distinctive violin-shaped 1961 electric Höfner that went missing a half century ago and is estimated to be worth 10 million pounds ($12.6 million). McCartney had asked Höfner to help find the missing instrument that helped launch Beatlemania across the universe, Scott Jones, a journalist who teamed up with Höfner executive Nick Wass to track it down, said Friday. “Paul said to me, ‘Hey, because you’re from Höfner, couldn’t you help find my bass?’” Wass said. “And that’s what sparked this great hunt. Sitting there, seeing what the lost bass means to Paul, I was determined to solve the mystery.” McCartney bought the bass for about 30 pounds ($37) in 1961 when The Beatles were developing their chops during a series of residencies in Hamburg, Germany. The instrument was played on the Beatles first two records and featured on hits such as “Love Me Do,” “Twist and Shout,” and “She Loves You.” “Because I was left-handed, it looked less daft because it was symmetrical,” McCartney once said. ""I got into that. And once I bought it, I fell in love with it.” It was rumored to have been stolen around the time The Beatles were recording their final album, “Let it Be,” in 1969. But no one was sure when it went missing. What began as a long and winding road for Wass to track down the bass picked up speed when Jones serendipitously joined the hunt after seeing McCartney headline the Glastonbury Festival in 2022. The stage lights at one point seemed to illuminate nothing but the sunburst pattern on his bass and Jones wondered if it was the same instrument McCartney had played in the early \'60s. When he later searched the internet he was stunned to find the original bass was missing and there was a search for it. “I was staggered, I was amazed,” Jones said. “I think we live in a world where The Beatles could do almost anything and it would get a lot of attention.” Jones and his wife, Naomi, both journalists and researchers, got in touch with Wass to spread the word more broadly. After hitting a dead end following a lead about a roadie for The Who, they relaunched The Lost Bass Project in September and within 48 hours were inundated with 600 emails that contained the “little gems that led us to where we are today,"" Jones said. One of those emails came from sound engineer Ian Horne, who had worked with McCartney’s band Wings, and was the first big breakthrough in the hunt. Horne said the bass had been swiped from the back of his van one night in the Notting Hill section of London in 1972. The researchers published the new information on their website in October, adding that Horne said McCartney told him not to worry about the theft and that he continued working for him for another six years. “But I’ve carried the guilt all my life,” Horne said. After publishing that update, a bigger break came when they were contacted by a person who said their father had stolen the bass. The man didn\'t set out to steal McCartney\'s instrument and panicked when he realized what he had, Jones said. The thief, who was not named, ended up selling it to Ron Guest, landlord of the Admiral Blake pub, for a few pounds and some beers. As the Joneses were starting to look for relatives of Guest, word had already reached his family. His daughter-in-law contacted McCartney\'s studio. Cathy Guest said that the old bass that had been in her attic for years looked like the one they were looking for. It had been passed from Ron Guest to his oldest son, who died in a car wreck, and then to a younger son, Haydn Guest, who was married to Cathy and died in 2020. The instrument was returned to McCartney in December and then it took about two months to authenticate it. The project had planned to announce the news but were upstaged by Cathy Guest\'s son, Ruaidhri Guest, a 21-year-old film student who posted photos Tuesday of the guitar on X, formerly Twitter, and wrote: “I inherited this item which has been returned to Paul McCartney. Share the news.” He posted a message Friday saying the family had been inundated with interview requests and would tell its story eventually. The estimated value of the instrument is based on the fact that a Gibson acoustic guitar Kurt Cobain played on MTV Unplugged sold for $6 million (4.7 million pounds), Jones said. But it held almost no value during the past half century. “The thief couldn’t sell it,” Jones said. “Clearly, the Guest family never tried to sell it. It’s a red alert because the minute you come forward someone’s going to go, \'That’s Paul McCartney\'s guitar.\'” It is now McCartney\'s once again. His official website posted a message announcing its return, saying “Paul is incredibly grateful to all those involved.” Share this story: Get exclusive music and faith content and enter contests with our weekly email!

zoo after an emergency C-section. (Fort Worth Zoo/Fort Worth Zoo) FORT WORTH, Texas — Earlier this week, a zoo in Fort Worth, Texas, announced that in January, a baby gorilla was born prematurely. >> Read more trending news The Fort Worth Zoo announced on Valentine’s Day that the zoo had recently welcomed a premature female gorilla baby. The baby gorilla was born on Jan. 5, People magazine reported. She weighed 3 pounds, 1 ounce at birth and now weighs approximately 5 pounds. The reason the baby was born prematurely was that her mother, Sekani, was diagnosed with preeclampsia. The staff at the zoo worked with veterinarians as well as a local obstetrician and neonatologist to figure out the best course of action, which ultimately ended up being an emergency C-section, the zoo said. Before her C-section, zoo staff had noticed that the mother had “started holding her head and that can be a sign of a headache in a gorilla,” Associate Veterinarian Sarah Cannizzo said, according to KXAS. Sekani has since made a full recovery, according to People. “We have affectionately named the female baby Jameela, which means “beautiful” in Swahili,” the zoo said in a Facebook post. “Taking part in delivering Sekani’s infant via cesarean section was one of the highlights of my entire career as an OB-GYN. It is an honor and privilege to assist with care for this endangered species and to share my expertise with the veterinary staff at the Fort Worth Zoo. I was amazed at how Sekani’s anatomy matched that of my human patients,” Dr. Jamie Erwin, OB-GYN consultant for the Fort Worth Zoo since 2016 said, according to the zoo. Erwin had delivered hundreds of human babies but the baby gorilla was a first for her, KXAS reported. “Definitely a first for me. This is a once-in-a-lifetime I’m guessing,” Erwin said. “It was incredible how similar this mother-infant pair was compared to what I see in the hospital for babies born under similar circumstances. The baby needed critical respiratory support for a few hours post-delivery, but as she transitioned to life outside the womb, she stabilized quite nicely. She had so many features typical of a slightly premature human baby. The Zoo’s care team was incredible. Their ability to adapt to the care needs of a medically fragile infant was amazing to watch,” Dr. Robert Ursprung, Neonatologist and National Director of Quality and Safety for Neonatology said, according to the zoo. More information about Jameela can be found on the zoo’s website. © 2024 Cox Media Group It’s Copa America 2024 and Michelob Ultra has your tickets to the biggest matches in Orlando and Miami!

campaign trail, and using them as a launching point for attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris. ""It\'s either gonna be me, or it\'s gonna be Kamala Harris,"" Haley warned while campaigning in Orangeburg, S.C. last weekend. ""Do we really want to have a country in disarray, and a world on fire, and have two 80-year-olds as our candidates?"" Haley asked the crowd, as she campaigned ahead of South Carolina\'s Republican primary on Feb. 24. The idea that she represents a new generation of leadership has been a major theme of her campaign. Haley has been focusing many of her attacks on both Biden, 81, and former President Trump, 77, pointing out their ages and recent lapses. In Orangeburg, Haley referred to last week\'s special counsel report, which questioned Biden\'s memory. ""I wish him well. I do. But this is serious,"" Haley said. ""And we need to be very cautious of what\'s happening, because Russia, China and Iran are paying attention to every bit of this."" And then, Haley made a bold — and unsubstantiated — claim. ""My bet is 30 days from now, I don\'t think Joe Biden\'s gonna be the nominee,"" Haley predicted. ""You\'re gonna have a female president of the United States."" To be clear, Biden is almost certain to be the Democratic nominee. Haley provided no evidence for her speculation that he will step aside — nor for the suggestion that Harris is poised to step in anytime soon. Asked about Haley\'s prediction by NPR\'s Tamara Keith during a White House press briefing on Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre she had to be cautious about commenting on the campaign as a federal employee. ""The president is, obviously, you know his intentions for 2024,"" Jean-Pierre said. As for Haley: ""I\'m not sure what crystal ball she\'s looking at, but it\'s not the one we have,"" Jean-Pierre added. It\'s a theme Haley has brought up repeatedly in recent months, warning Republican audiences about the prospect of Harris stepping in. In January, campaigning in Conway, S.C., Haley said the thought of a Harris presidency ""should send a chill up every person\'s spine."" By doing so, Haley is highlighting Biden\'s age and Harris\' high disapproval ratings among Republican primary voters, says Ange-Marie Hancock, a political scientist at Ohio State University. ""Republican primary voters are primed with negative views of Kamala Harris,"" explained Hancock, who\'s also the curator of the Kamala Harris Project, a group of scholars studying Harris\' vice presidency. Hancock points to what she calls a ""drumbeat"" of attacks on Harris in right-wing circles, including Trump\'s use of racist birther theories to falsely suggest Harris may not be eligible to be vice president. Trump has directed similar false attacks at Haley. Hancock says Haley appears to be drawing on those themes as she campaigns for Republican primary votes. ""So she\'s using dog whistles to counteract some dog whistles that may be levied against her,"" Hancock said. That strategy appears unlikely to work for Haley, who\'s been polling far behind Trump in her home state. But Hancock says it may offer a preview of the kinds of general election messages that Trump and other Republicans will be using against Biden and Harris in the months to come. A Haley campaign spokeswoman noted in a statement to NPR that Harris has been tasked with the administration\'s border security policy and said, ""It\'s not surprising that she is viewed even more unfavorably [than] Joe Biden.""

An unidentified source told CNN that the AR-15 she carried into the church had the words “Free Palestine” written on it, although it was not immediately clear whether the shooting was politically motivated. A warrant was issued for a home connected to Moreno in Conroe after she claimed to have had a bomb on Sunday, the Houston Chronicle reported. In the warrant, officials said Moreno shot and injured a man with an AR-15 rifle before pointing the gun at off-duty officers who were working as security at the church. The officers shot and killed her, according to the Chronicle. The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission confirmed Monday that one of its off-duty agents, identified as Adrian Herrera, was among the two officers who engaged the shooter on Sunday. Herrera, who has worked for TABC for about five years, was placed on paid administrative leave pending an internal investigation into the shooting. “While we are still gathering the facts on what took place at Lakewood Church, I can say that I’m extremely proud of the quick response of our agent as well as the other law enforcement agents on the scene,” TABC Chairman Kevin Lilly said. “These officers likely prevented a much greater tragedy through their brave actions.” A 5-year-old child brought to the church by Moreno was critically injured in Sunday’s shooting. On Monday, a spokesperson for the Montgomery County District Attorney’s Office told the Chronicle that the child is not expected to survive their wounds. The relationship between the child and Moreno remained unclear on Monday. A man was also shot in the hip on Sunday. He was last listed in stable condition at a hospital. Lakewood Church was founded by celebrity pastor Joel Osteen’s father in 1959. On Sunday, Osteen said he was “devastated” by the shooting. “In the face of such darkness, we must hold onto our faith and remember evil will not prevail,” he said. “Together, we will rise above this tragedy and stand firm in our commitment to love and support one another.” Authorities continue to investigate. © 2024 Cox Media Group Sign up below to be added to our mailing list for the latest news updates, access to exclusive contests, and more!

An Amish man enlisted his horses to help dislodge an SUV stuck in a ditch during a snowstorm. (DAVID ARMENT/Getty Images/iStockphoto) ETHRIDGE, Tenn. — An Amish man in south-central Tennessee showed off his own version of horsepower. >> Read more trending news In a video shared by Facebook user Sandra Sam Newton, an Amish man pitched in to help dislodge an SUV trapped in a ditch during a snowstorm in the town of Ethridge, WSMV-TV reported. Newton told the television station that the man, who was not identified, decided to connect his horses to the SUV with a strap to help out. While the horses pulled, other people pushed the front end of the SUV as snow continued to fall. The horses were definitely the heroes of the day. “We’re gonna see if this horsepower works,” a woman can be heard saying on the video. “Amish wrecker service.” Finally, the combination of the horses and people power muscled the SUV out of a ditch. No tow truck was needed. “We got her done,” the woman said. © 2024 Cox Media Group Sign up below to be added to our mailing list for the latest news updates, access to exclusive contests, and more!

In a statement tonight, Ukraine's top military commander said he would withdraw troops from Avdiivka, a key stronghold for Ukraine, to avoid being encircled by Russian troops. It is Russia's first big gain since May. Meanwhile, additional U.S. aid to Ukraine is hung up in the House of Representatives. And comments by former and possible future President Donald Trump are still reverberating. Trump invited Russia to attack NATO members who, in his view, do not spend enough on their defense. As Teri Schultz reports, it's that last item that has European leaders talking more about moving beyond their military reliance on the U.S. TERI SCHULTZ, BYLINE: Donald Trump's comments favoring the Kremlin over low-spending NATO allies may have been more of a shock than a surprise, given the former president's frequent criticism of the alliance and some of the countries in it. Kurt Volker, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO under George W. Bush and Trump's envoy for Ukraine, says the remarks are dangerous. KURT VOLKER: NATO's purpose - it is to prevent war. And what Trump is suggesting is encouraging one of our adversaries to create a war and attack a NATO ally. That is completely outrageous and unacceptable. Somebody like Vladimir Putin is delighted to see that there are these kinds of divisions and disagreements and pressures going on with inside the alliance. SCHULTZ: NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg underscored that point several times over the last week in a sharp, immediate response to Trump and in meetings with NATO defense ministers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JENS STOLTENBERG: NATO continues to ensure there is no room for miscalculation in Moscow about our readiness to protect all allies. SCHULTZ: NATO's readiness to protect is what convinced its newest member, Finland, to join in light of Russia's aggression in the neighborhood. I checked out how Trump's Russia comments were playing in Helsinki with Minna Alander from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. She said Finns are feeling great concern. MINNA ALANDER: Finland was somewhat late to the party to join NATO. And now you sort of get the feeling like, are we missing the whole party, actually, if Trump is now sort of just wrecking NATO entirely with his kind of understanding of the whole alliance as some sort of a criminal racket or something? SCHULTZ: Alander is referring to what's often called Trump's pay-to-play approach to collective security. The more he perceives NATO members paying - that is spending on their own militaries - the more willing he would be to expend U.S. resources to protect them. Actually, the countries along NATO's eastern flank, including Finland, are among the biggest investors in their own defense in terms of GDP. Poland, for example, even outspends the U.S. when measured against the size of its economy. But allies still couldn't protect themselves without the U.S. at this point. And Minna Alander says they should have thought about that earlier. ALANDER: European countries should have considered this contingency more seriously, immediately, two years ago, and started working harder immediately on replenishing own stocks and making sure that we have some sort of capability in Europe on our own. SCHULTZ: Camille Grand was NATO's top official overseeing defense investment during the Trump presidency. Grand just co-wrote an article about whether Europe could Trump-proof itself. Here are his main recommendations. CAMILLE GRAND: Keep calm and carry on. Do the job. Think through what are the gaps that you might have in your military apparatus. Invest and invest faster in your defense. Doing this is good for - in case Trump is reelected. It would mitigate the consequences of his election, might even convince him that, you know, by the way, you haven't noticed, but, yes, the Europeans have been stepping up. SCHULTZ: Secretary-General Stoltenberg is doing his best to make sure Trump does notice. At multiple press conferences this week, he highlighted how many more billions of dollars NATO countries are spending now compared to the last time they were targets of Trump's ire.

anti-satellite weapons that has been shared in recent weeks with the upper echelons of government, according to four people who have been briefed on the intelligence. The people, who were not authorized to comment publicly, said the capability was not yet operational. The intelligence sparked an urgent but vague warning Wednesday from the Republican head of the House Intelligence Committee, who urged the Biden administration to declassify information about what he called a serious national security threat. Rep. Mike Turner gave no details about the nature of the threat, and the Biden administration also declined to address it. But several leading lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, cautioned against being overly alarmed. A congressional aide said he understood that the threat relates to a space-deployed Russian anti-satellite weapon. Such a weapon could pose a major danger to U.S. satellites that transmit billions of bytes of data each hour. The aide, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said it was not yet clear if the Russian weapon has nuclear capability, but said that is the fear. The threat Turner raised concerns about is not an active capability, according to U.S. officials familiar with the intelligence. One added that intelligence officials consider the threat to be significant, but it should not cause panic. Turner issued a statement urging the administration to declassify the information so the U.S. and its allies can openly discuss how to respond. He also sent an email to members of Congress saying his committee had “identified an urgent matter with regard to a destabilizing foreign military capability” that should be known to all congressional policy makers. He encouraged them to come to a SCIF, a secure area, to review the intelligence. Turner has been a voice for stronger U.S. national security, putting him at odds with some Republican colleagues who favor a more isolationist approach. He has called for the renewal of a key U.S. government surveillance tool while some fellow Republicans and liberal Democrats have raised privacy objections. And he supports continuing U.S. military aid for Ukraine in its war against Russia at a time that the funding remains uncertain because of opposition in the Republican-led House. Johnson said he was not at liberty to disclose the classified information. “But we just want to assure everyone steady hands are at the wheel. We’re working on it and there’s no need for alarm,” he told reporters at the Capitol. Democratic Rep. Jim Himes, the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that the classified information is “significant” but “not a cause for panic.” The Senate Intelligence Committee said it has been tracking the issue. “We continue to take this matter seriously and are discussing an appropriate response with the administration,” Sen. Mark Warner, the Democratic committee chairman, and Sen. Marco Rubio, the Republican vice chairman, said in a statement. ""In the meantime, we must be cautious about potentially disclosing sources and methods that may be key to preserving a range of options for U.S. action.” The rapidly evolving threat in space was one of the primary reasons that the U.S. Space Force was established in 2019. A lot of that threat has to do with new capabilities that China and Russia have already developed that can interfere with critical satellite-based U.S. communications, such as GPS and the ability to quickly detect missile launches. In recent years the U.S. has seen both China and Russia pursue new ways to jam satellites, intercept their feeds, blind them, shoot them down and even potentially grab them with a robotic arm to pull them out of their programmed orbits. One of the key missions of the Space Force is to train troops skilled in detecting and defending against those threats. In its 2020 Defense Space Strategy, the Pentagon said China and Russia presented the greatest strategic threat in space due to their aggressive development of counterspace abilities, and their military doctrine calling for extending conflict to space. The White House and lawmakers expressed frustration at how Turner raised his concerns. His announcement appeared to catch the Biden administration off-guard. National security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House that he already had been due to brief Turner and other senior congressional leaders on Thursday. Sullivan did not disclose the topic or provide any other details related to Turner’s statement. “I’m focused on going to see him, sit with him as well as the other House members of the Gang of Eight, tomorrow,” Sullivan said. “And I’m not in a position to say anything further from this podium at this time.” He acknowledged it was not standard practice to offer such a briefing. “I’ll just say that I personally reached out to the Gang of Eight. It is highly unusual, in fact, for the national security adviser to do that,"" Sullivan said. He said he had reached out earlier this week. Johnson said he sent a letter last month to the White House requesting a meeting with the president to discuss “the serious national security issue that is classified.” He said Sullivan\'s meeting was in response to his request. ___ Lee reported from Munich.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'The Florida House passed a bill in January requiring social media companies to ban accounts belonging to kids under 16. A similar bill is currently in the Florida Senate. Tech companies say the measure is unconstitutional, and Gov. Ron DeSantis has expressed concern over the bill’s “breadth.” Rep. Tyler Sirois, the House bill’s co-sponsor, and Aaron Mackey with the Electronic Frontier Foundation spoke about the measure Friday with Tom Hudson on The Florida Roundup. Sirois explained why he believes his bill doesn’t violate First Amendment rights. “This bill is not about the content that is on these platforms. This bill is based on addictive features, the things that are intentionally designed to produce basically a dopamine hit in our kids,” Sirois said. Some examples he gave of addictive features include auto scroll, autoplay and push notifications. “There are things that are being designed and intentionally deployed to modify the way that our kids behave, to take advantage of child development and capturing their and holding their attention.” Mackey, however, disagreed with Sirois’ point about the bill’s constitutionality. “That\'s like saying a bill that bans access to movie theaters for anyone under 16 or bans access to bookstores for anyone under 16 is not about the content of the movies or the books. This is fundamentally about the content, and those facial designs of the law, courts will easily see past that,” Mackey said. He also spoke on the cultural consequences of banning kids from social platforms. “… fundamentally, what this does is it deprives children of access to probably the most diverse platform for users to engage in speech and to learn about the world around us,” Mackey said. Sirois said his measure isn’t about whether social media is good or bad, but protecting kids from harm. “We\'re seeing soaring suicide rates, we\'re seeing increased incidence of self-harm, hospital admissions for self-harm are increasing. And we understand, based on testimony that we received here in Tallahassee, that on our present course, it\'s going to be normal for American girls to suffer from depression,"" Sirois explained. ""So that is something that I find alarming, and it doesn\'t have to be that way. And all of the data that we have points to social media as being a main contributor.” Opting out of features on social platforms, Sirois added, wouldn’t be enough either. He pointed to parents who aren’t tech-savvy and young children who don’t understand how their personal data will be used. “So I think that what we\'re doing here is recognizing that the magnitude of this problem, and the harm that these platforms are doing to our youth, is simply beyond a lot of parents’ ability, a lot of families’ ability to be able to step in and handle it,” Sirois said. If the House bill becomes law, Florida’s attorney general would be empowered to “pursue unfair and deceptive trade practices against companies that are violating the law,” according to Sirois. Parents could sue a social media platform if it unlawfully enrolls a minor. The bill would also require platforms to verify someone’s age using personal information like a driver’s license or birth certificate. Mackey said all users would have to undergo the same process. “So it affects not just children, but all adults, and the Supreme Court and federal courts across the country have routinely held that this type of scheme that requires everyone to pass through an age verification gate is unconstitutional, because you can\'t put those types of restrictions on adults and children\'s ability to access the internet,” Mackey said. He noted other ways Florida can protect children without, as he said, violating the First Amendment, like implementing third-party software for parents to filter and monitor their kids’ devices. “… there are legitimate concerns here and people, children are being harmed,” Mackey added. “The question is, is this going to actually help them? And will it actually be enforced?” Copyright 2024 WUSF 89.7. To see more, visit WUSF 89.7.'}]"

Brian allegedly explained Gabby’s absence as her needing time to work on her website and staying in a hotel for safety reasons. The depositions shed light on the family dynamics surrounding the tragic case. Call In Line: 941-460-1530 Copyright 2024, WENG 98.1FM, 107.5FM & 1530AM by Fiorini Broadcasting, LLC.
