update on the criminal charges against a South Haven man accused of trafficking a 14-year-old girl from Washington. 30-year-old Keith Freerksen is facing nine charges in relation to the missing girl: Van Buren County Sheriff Daniel Abbott and County Prosecutor Susan Zuiderveen gave updates on the case and fielded questions from the media. Freerksen was arrested by deputies Wednesday night and arraigned Friday at 1 p.m. He is currently being held in Van Buren County Jail. He was denied bond, considered by the court to be a danger to the public and a flight risk. Abbott said that they identified the suspect\'s vehicle and waited for it to return to the property before executing the search warrant. When deputies arrested Freerksen, they also found the missing teen on the property. Authorities said the suspect vehicle traveled from Michigan to Washington, then back to Michigan again. Freerksen is also expected to be charged with crimes in Washington as well. Deputies also found other individuals on the property at the time of Freerksen\'s arrest, but there are no additional charges against any other people at this time. The mother of the missing teen also spoke at the press conference, thanking authorities for the return of her daughter and advocating for more accountability from online social media platforms. “Fortunately for us, she is coming home safe. The past three weeks have been nothing short of nightmare, and one I hope no other parents have to experience,"" the mother of the victim said. ""This is a call to action: This predator was able to use social media platforms to reach my child from across the country. He was able to use these platforms to groom my child over an extended period of time. How many more children have to be victimized before these social media platforms are held to a higher standard? How many more families have to suffer the way mine has? The lack of accountability not only puts my child at risk for online predation, but leaves all children at the mercy of those who seek them out online. This is a time for change. And I hope that there are more people who are lucky to come home safe, but unfortunately, not everyone has that story.” RELATED: South Haven man facing slew of charges after missing 14-year-old found in his home ►Make it easy to keep up to date with more stories like this.

Harris kicked off this re-election year tour in California and last week she visited the swing state of Wisconsin which now has a 20-week abortion ban. Her next stop is Georgia which has a 6-week abortion ban. Anti-abortion groups call the effort a distraction. Emily Erin Davis is with Susan B.

Major League Baseball postponed games in New York and Philadelphia on Wednesday night because of poor air quality caused by smoke from Canadian wildfires. It\'s Judge\'s first time being picked for the honor, while it was Ledecky\'s second time being chosen. Josh Donaldson hit a 10th-inning sacrifice fly, and the New York Yankees came from behind twice to beat the Detroit Tigers 5-4 on Sunday to reach the one-third mark of the season at 39-15, the best in the major leagues in 21 years. Miguel Cabrera was set to stroll to the plate and fans rose to their feet and roared, hoping to witness his 3,000th hit. This week\'s Baseball Report looks at the Chicago White Sox\'s early-season success, the New York Yankees\' COVID outbreak and Albert Pujols\' return with the Dodgers. The New York Yankees have the worst record in the American League, while the Oakland A\'s have pulled out of their early-season slump, winning eight straight. Forbes estimates the New York Yankees are baseball\'s most valuable franchise at $5 billion, up 9% over last year and 47% more than the No. 2 Los Angeles Dodgers at $3.4 billion. Gerrit Cole gave up homers on consecutive pitches to Detroit\'s Travis Demeritte and Miguel Cabrera in the first inning on Thursday. The Yankees, who won the AL East in 2019 despite injuries, already face Spring Training concerns with Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton ailing. The offseason has been eventful, but not in the way that MLB commissioner Rob Manfred would like. It\'s been an injury-plagued season for the Yankees — slugger Giancarlo Stanton has played only nine games. Encarnación missed 30 games with a broken right wrist after he was hit by pitch from Boston\'s Josh Smith on Aug. 3. The New York Yankees and Detroit Tigers were rained out Wednesday night, and the game was rescheduled as part of a doubleheader Thursday. Sabathia, who has dealt with right knee problems this season, had his start pushed back to the second game of the twinbill. ""When a team hits six homers and gives you 11 runs, you have to win the game,"" Yankees opener Nelson Cortez Jr. said. ""We let those guys down. There\'s no way around it."" The home runs keep flying, with Major League teams hitting them out at a rate that far exceeds the 2017 record-setting season. The New York Yankees, who just swept the San Francisco Giants, are 9-1 in their last 10 games, even as their injuries continue to mount. The Yankees swung over slider after slider from Matthew Boyd, setting a franchise swing-and-miss record. Dustin Peterson\'s parents were right there in the Yankee Stadium stands to see his first major league hit — a tiebreaking rocket off one of baseball\'s best closers. The New York Yankees added Giancarlo Stanton and Miguel Andujar to the injured list, and CC Sabathia is soon to follow. Giancarlo Stanton and Miguel Andujar had already joined the Yankees\' long injured list when Aaron Judge sprinted into right-center field and made a spectacular, sprawling grab on Niko Goodrum\'s hard-hit liner to preserve a two-run lead in the eighth inning. Doctors inserted a stent after a blockage was found in an artery from his heart. A postseason share on World Series champion Boston was worth $416,838, down from a record $438,902 for Houston in 2017. Aaron Judge and the New York Yankees couldn\'t wait to get back home.

The news was first shared by The Portal 305 on Instagram. Bridgewater announced in December that this year would be his last in the NFL, and that he intended to become a coach once he officially hung up his cleats. Now that dream of a second career for Bridgewater has quickly become a reality. The 31-year-old began his NFL career as a first-round pick in 2014 with the Minnesota Vikings, but his time in the NFL went sideways when he severely injured his knee during training camp ahead of the ’16 season. Bridgewater tore his ACL and dislocated his knee, leading to a long recovery process. He was never quite the same after the injury, but was serviceable enough to have a spot on multiple NFL rosters. Lon Horwedel-USA TODAY Sports Bridgewater played in 79 career games, including 65 starts. He completed 66.4% of his passes for 15,120 yards and 75 touchdowns to 47 interceptions in his career, which included stops with the Vikings, Lions, New Orleans Saints, Carolina Panthers, Denver Broncos and Miami Dolphins.'}]"

guilty on all 34 felony charges in his historic hush money criminal trial. by SEUNG MIN KIM Associated Press TOPICS: WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden joined grieving families at Dover Air Force Base on a gray, chilly Friday to honor the three American service members killed in a drone attack in Jordan. The Bidens met privately with the families before the roughly 15-minute solemn ritual, called a dignified transfer, that has become relatively uncommon in recent years as the U.S. has withdrawn from conflicts abroad. An Air Force chaplain offered a short prayer before white-gloved, members of the Army carry team transferred the flag-draped cases holding the soldiers\' remains from a C-5 Galaxy military transport aircraft to a waiting vehicle. The carry team after placing the last of three cases in the vehicle offered a final salute to the soldiers. President Biden, with his right hand over his heart, looked on somberly. The soldiers were returned to America as the U.S. military prepared a response to the deadly drone attack that American officials say was carried out by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iran-backed militias that includes the group Kataib Hezbollah. The White House has said the retaliation will not be a ""one-off"" strike. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Gen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were among the Defense Department and administration officials who joined the Bidens for the proceedings. The service members killed Sunday were all from Georgia — Sgt. William Jerome Rivers of Carrollton, Sgt. Kennedy Sanders of Waycross and Sgt. Breonna Moffett of Savannah. Sanders and Moffett were posthumously promoted to sergeant rank. The three were assigned to the 926th Engineer Battalion, 926th Engineer Brigade, based at Fort Moore, Ga. The deaths were the first U.S. fatalities blamed on Iran-backed militia groups, who for months have been intensifying their attacks on American forces in the region following the onset of the Israel-Hamas war in October. Separately, two Navy SEALs died during a January mission to board an unflagged ship that was carrying illicit Iranian-made weapons to Yemen. ""These service members embodied the very best of our nation: Unwavering in their bravery. Unflinching in their duty. Unbending in their commitment to our country — risking their own safety for the safety of their fellow Americans, and our allies and partners with whom we stand in the fight against terrorism,"" Biden said earlier this week. ""It is a fight we will not cease."" Sanders\' father, Shawn, in a posting on Facebook on Friday morning said that ""kindness and outpouring of love"" was ""the only thing holding me up"" since his daughter\'s death. ""This is not the homecoming for Kennedy I dreamed about,"" he said in the post. ""Now, I can\'t stop reliving this nightmare."" At Thursday\'s National Prayer Breakfast at the Capitol, Biden acknowledged Rivers, Moffett and Sanders by name, again vowing to never forget their sacrifice to the nation. ""They risked it all,"" the president said. Rivers, Sanders and Moffett hailed from different corners of Georgia but were brought together in the same company of Army engineers that was based in Fort Moore. Sanders and Moffett, in particular, were close friends who regularly popped in on each other\'s phone calls with their families back home. Moffett had turned 23 years old just nine days before she was killed. She had joined the Army Reserves in 2019, but also worked for a home care provider to cook, clean and run errands for people with disabilities. Sanders, 24, worked at a pharmacy while studying to become an X-ray technician and coached children\'s soccer and basketball. She had volunteered for the deployment because she wanted to see different parts of the world, according to her parents. Rivers, who was 46 years old and went by Jerome, joined the Army Reserve in New Jersey in 2011 and served a nine-month tour in Iraq in 2018. According to the Defense Department, no other service members have been killed as a result of hostile action since 2021. Thirteen service members were killed during the fall of Kabul in Afghanistan, when a suicide bomber at the airport\'s Abbey Gate killed 11 Marines, one sailor and one soldier. Nine service members were killed as a result of hostile action in 2020. Friday is the second dignified transfer Biden attended as president. In August 2021, he took part in the ritual for the 13 service members killed during the suicide bombing in Kabul. As vice president, Biden in 2016 attended a dignified transfer for two U.S. soldiers killed in a suicide blast at Bagram Airfield. He also attended one as a senator in 2008 after the family requested his presence and the Pentagon gave him permission to do so. The U.S. government said this week that the Iran-backed militants had planned, resourced and facilitated the overnight drone attack. While Biden and White House officials have stressed that they don\'t want a broader war with Iran, the administration has also warned that it will respond to the deadly assault. More than 40 troops were also injured in the Sunday drone attack at Tower 22, a secretive U.S. military desert outpost whose location allows U.S. forces to infiltrate and quietly leave Syria.'}]"
