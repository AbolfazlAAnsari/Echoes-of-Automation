numbers were just as dismal as they were in Chesapeake Bay. In an article by Jim Hutchinson in New Jersey Fisherman Magazine, he reported the young of the year count for the Hudson River was the lowest since the 1980s. In reading the graph, I would say it was between a one and a two. New York samples 13 sites biweekly along the lower Hudson River from May until November. These dismal numbers track right along with the numbers reported from Maryland and Virginia. It seems, according to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, that recent winters have been warm and dry with little snowfall. This has resulted in less snowmelt to cool the rivers and streams where striped bass spawn. The warmer water does not produce the number of zooplankton the striped bass fry need to survive. Even if the fish produce plenty of young stripers, there would not be enough food for them to eat. Also, in Chesapeake Bay, blue catfish have become so numerous that they have become a danger to the fry and can eat great numbers of them in the spring when other food sources are not available. None of this information is good news for striped bass. While it is true we have had long runs of poor production in the past followed by large year classes that carried us through another period of poor reproduction, this time the reasons for the down slope are troubling. Warm winters with a lack of snowfall are not going to go away. They are a result of climate change caused by an abundance of carbon dioxide in the air. The CO2 is a result of burning fossil fuel, and we won’t wean ourselves off of that for many years. On top of that, it seems striped bass are moving north. There are more spawning-size females in the Hudson River every year and fewer in Chesapeake Bay. I think this is due to the warmer water in the south and cooler water in the north. We have seen southern fish such as sheepshead, triggerfish, spadefish and pompano move into our waters, so why should we be surprised when striped bass move to the north? The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission has already placed emergency regulations on striped bass with a 28- to 31-inch slot limit for stripers caught from the ocean. They will meet again later in January, when I expect that regulation to become permanent. From what we saw this fall and early winter, there are plenty of big striped bass stretched from northern New Jersey all the way down to Virginia Beach. I was getting reports with photos from all of these locations at the same time. That ended about two weeks ago when this series of storms and cold temperatures arrived. It will be interesting to see if any remain once the weather settles down. There is so much we have learned about striped bass in recent years. We believed they stayed close to the coast during their migration north in the spring and south in the fall. Recent tagging results prove some of them go as far east as the Hudson Canyon once they leave the Hudson River, and then they hang out on the Nantucket Shoals during the summer. Others do stay closer to shore. There is so much more we have to learn. The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control has announced the closure of Newton Pond for the construction of two 120-foot-long aluminum fishing piers that will be installed parallel to the shoreline to allow for better access to the pond for trout and other fishing. Currently, the steep banks must be overcome to access the water. The new piers will make access in this area much easier, especially for us old folks. Construction began Dec. 26 and is expected to be complete by Feb. 14. If weather delays slow construction, the job will be done in time for the opening day of trout season March 2. If you have fished Newton Pond, you know how steep the banks are and how difficult it can be to fish from them. I can only fish from the one pier that is available and have had very poor results from that spot. Having two more piers along the banks will be a great help for everyone who fishes there. Eric Burnley is a Delaware native who has fished and hunted the state from an early age. Since 1978 he has written countless articles about hunting and fishing in Delaware and elsewhere along the Atlantic Coast. He has been the regional editor for several publications and was the founding editor of the Mid-Atlantic Fisherman magazine. Eric is the author of three books: Surf Fishing the Atlantic Coast, The Ultimate Guide to Striped Bass Fishing and Fishing Saltwater Baits. He and his wife Barbara live near Milton, Delaware.

Wes Moore and other state officials expressed anger and disappointment Wednesday that Baltimore Orioles chairman and CEO John Angelos did not inform them of his plans to sell the team – but they also indicated they’re pleased with the outcome of the sale anyway. News of the sale to billionaire Baltimore native David Rubenstein emerged Tuesday, less than two months after the state and the Orioles reached an agreement to keep the team in downtown Baltimore for at least 15 years. The deal marked the end of a fraught, drawn-out negotiation and came weeks before the team’s lease at the state-owned Oriole Park at Camden Yards was set to expire. While Rubenstein was first linked to the Orioles in December, he was not involved in negotiating the lease, state officials told reporters on Wednesday. It was unclear if Rubenstein had been consulted by Angelos during the talks. State officials also said they were unaware during the lease negotiations that a sale to Rubenstein was pending. “The transparency that was required – it was not there,” Moore said. “And it\'s disappointing.” State Treasurer Dereck Davis told reporters Angelos previously gave officials “a flat denial” that the team would be sold. Davis said he learned of the sale “in the papers, like everybody else.” Efforts by Capital News Service to reach Angelos for comment were not immediately successful. “If John can hear me now, ‘It’s deeply disappointing and troubling that you could look your state in the eye and outright lie to us about your intentions,’” Davis said during a meeting Wednesday of the Board of Public Works. “We had a right to know, given the amount of investment we were committing to this.” Filling General Assembly vacancies: \'Voters should pick\': Maryland lawmakers consider how to fill General Assembly vacancies Even with their dismay at the process of the sale, state officials on Wednesday expressed optimism about the new ownership group, led by Rubenstein, a 74-year-old who co-founded the private equity firm The Carlyle Group and described himself as a lifelong Orioles fan. He is worth $3.7 billion, according to Forbes. Some officials said they know little about Rubenstein, who confirmed the sale Wednesday. Davis said he has never met him. Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson, D-Baltimore City, said he has only encountered Rubenstein at a tour for the billionaire’s book, “The American Experiment: Dialogues on a Dream.” But there was hope that a new, locally based ownership might invest – in both a burgeoning young team and in downtown Baltimore – in ways Angelos was criticized for not doing. “We want to make sure that everything is finalized … but at the end of the day, this is a really great result for not only the team, but importantly, Baltimore, the region, the state,” Ferguson told reporters as he left the Senate floor on Wednesday. “Where we’ve landed is the best-case scenario because we’ve locked in the team for at least 15 years, but likely 30, and we’ve set up the opportunity for a local owner to infuse new capital into the team, into the surrounding area,” Ferguson added. “It’s the best possible result.” Delmar player wins big in lottery: Maryland Lottery player, a retired woman, wins big with scratch-off ticket from Delmar Moore’s office confirmed to Capital News Service that the ownership group also includes former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke, New York businessman Mike Arougheti, basketball Hall of Famer Grant Hill and Orioles legend Cal Ripken Jr. The group will purchase the Orioles for $1.725 billion, according to multiple news reports. Officials reiterated that the change in ownership would not impact the lease agreement. Ferguson described that deal as “ironclad” and said it accounted for the possibility of a sale. The deal prohibits the Orioles from relocating during the term of the lease, according to a summary of the agreement. If the sale is finalized, it will mark the end of more than 30 years of the Angelos family owning the team. John Angelos’ father, Peter, purchased the Orioles in 1993. “While there were some bumpy moments, we’re really set up for success,” Ferguson said, reflecting on Angelos’ tenure. “We’ve got a great young team, we’ve got potential for new ownership, we’ve got a long-term deal in place … a great farm system. I think we’ll look back and realize that over the last few years, it\'s really been set up for a good moment. And that’s to John’s credit for leading us to this point.” Gov. Moore later on Wednesday released a statement offering his support for the sale. ""Governor Moore, the Maryland Stadium Authority, and the entire Moore-Miller Administration send their congratulations to Baltimore native David Rubenstein, Michael Bloomberg, Kurt Schmoke, Mike Arougheti, NBA legend Grant Hill, and Maryland native and Orioles legend Cal Ripken Jr. on their deal to purchase the Baltimore Orioles,"" the governor said in his statement.

and gone, but one thing hasn\'t changed: Delaware\'s stories must continue to be told now more than ever. Throughout 2023, we uncovered stories that you wanted and needed to hear. From lead in school drinking water and a botched police response, to the complicated nature of attempting to treat mental illness in the criminal justice system and a dark state secret — our reporting touched it all. And the stories aren\'t easy. They required reporters to spend days sifting through public archives, fighting for documents and interviews, and asking hard questions, even when repeatedly rebuffed. It\'s this work though that got so many members of our staff into journalism: work that challenges us and the work we know makes a difference to and for Delaware. They\'re the stories that make you feel, that challenge your expectations and that get you talking around your dinner table. And they\'re the stories that only Delaware Online/The News Journal can bring you. Here are eight stories we believe made an impact on Delaware this past year. Maybe you\'ve read some of them or maybe you\'ve read them all. They showcase just a slice of the dogged work Delaware Online/The News Journal reporters do every day to bring you the stories you deserve and ought to hear about, especially in the communities in which you live. And while they\'re not all easy to stomach or accept, they remind us of the importance journalism serves in our democracy and that truth matters. This is the second of what will continue to be an annual report on the impact of Delaware Online/The News Journal and its journalism. It’s not a comprehensive list of our best work. Instead, it represents a selection of our stories that reflect our core mission. Thank you for coming back to us again and again for your news. We couldn\'t do this work without you. Brittany Horn, news director, Delaware Online/The News Journal As Delaware’s population ages, more and more people are finding themselves needing the help of an assisted living facility and even more are struggling with dementia, something many of these facilities are just not equipped to handle — despite advertising that they are. Delaware Online/The News Journal continued its coverage of gut-wrenching stories featuring families who trusted these facilities with their loved ones, only to watch them suffer harm within these places and eventually die. Reporter Meredith Newman\'s investigation uncovered that Delaware has failed to police these types of facilities in the past decade, even as high numbers of abuse, neglect and falls are reported to the Division of Health Care Quality. It’s also left families with little recourse other than to sue the state and demand change for future families, even as legislation fails to make headway. Additionally, Delaware Online/The News Journal was able to make the inspection reports Meredith fought to obtain available to the public through a database. Everyone has their secrets, but Delaware’s role in the country’s eugenics movement is an especially forgotten one — unless your family felt its impact. That’s what reporter Meredith Newman spent months digging into, getting to know people whose mothers and grandmothers were forcibly sterilized at the Delaware Colony for the Feeble Minded and uncovering the long-lasting damage these acts caused. In her reporting, she also uncovered that some of Delaware’s most prominent names played a role in these decisions, actions that until this past fall remained legal in Delaware code. In addition to the moving deep-dive Meredith took readers on, she also penned a “How we reported this” column that gives readers a glimpse into the nuance and challenges that came with investigating this story and piecing it all together. This story is a reminder that without the bravery of Delawareans willing to share their story and reporters willing to listen, many of these accounts would go untold. After dogged reporting by Delaware Online/The News Journal revealed the state botched water sampling for lead in schools during the pandemic, the EPA got involved and forced the state to not only admit its “missteps” but also redo the testing in a much more public manner this time. Along the way, this watchdog reporting laid bare the negligence and failures that contributed to these efforts, all while Delaware children were at risk from the water in their schools. Reporter Amanda Fries has fought for records, revealed overgeneralizations in state reports and shined a light on an issue that too many Delaware communities didn’t realize was affecting its children. In May, the state announced it will spend $3.8M to install water filters in schools statewide — a move that lead advocates credit Amanda’s reporting for wholeheartedly. “Any progress we have made in the last year has been a direct result of your reporting. We are forever grateful,” one of the leading advocates wrote in an email. And the reporting is far from over, as the state continues to tackle this issue that extends far beyond schools. THE IMPACT: This Wilmington child was lead poisoned. How it could have been prevented About a decade ago, the state of Delaware set out to redevelop a former military fort that had fallen into disarray. Single-family homes, a hotel and shops would be paired with a new marina to create a “vibrant” waterfront community. The development project proceeded for years without scrutiny as a quasi-public body created by the state took control of hundreds of acres of land and received millions in taxpayer dollars. It began to show cracks last year when the director of the project abruptly resigned. In the time since, Brandon Holveck\'s reporting revealed that the development group had sold protected space to a private developer, rented properties to employees for below market rate and faced little state oversight, and the director of the project had a trail of tax liens of other financial issues from previous business. READ THE FULL STORY: How Delaware\'s plan to resurrect Fort DuPont as a \'vibrant\' riverfront haven went wrong When a caller threatened to kill Delaware students just before dismissal, the head of school did what anyone would — lock down the school and call 911. But what happens when police don’t come? A total of 19 calls were placed to 911, but state police didn\'t show up for 76 minutes, leaving school leaders to deal with the fear of imminent danger and frantic parents distressed over what was happening and trying to take their children home. Rather than send officers, a dispatcher accused the school of holding kids “hostage” and a teacher was assaulted. Reporter Isabel Hughes spent months reviewing 911 audio, examining phone records and surveillance footage, and battling for public records to piece together what went wrong on Oct. 24, 2022, and why things failed to improve in the weeks that followed. Her reporting also shined a light on the stress both educators and police find themselves under in an effort to keep kids safe. READ THE TWO-PART INVESTIGATION: A caller threatened to kill Delaware students. It took police 76 minutes to respond. We all see people experiencing homelessness on the streets, some more frequently depending on where we live or where we drive. But what happens when society criminalizes homelessness, the act of asking for money or more importantly, mental illness that often contributes to those life circumstances? And furthermore, what happens to those people when they end up in the criminal justice system? Reporter Xerxes Wilson spent weeks unraveling one woman’s story of spending a year in jail after begging for money in two of Wilmington’s upscale dining experiences and the challenges she faced in a system that was designed to help her but could only keep her locked in jail for a long time. The story is complicated though, showing that while everyone said they had her interests in mind, no one was truly able to help her. The result? You’ll have to read the story here. First, a student protest rocked campus, as hundreds of Delaware State students left classes, flooded a university street, and protested for better campus security and handling of sexual assault cases in January 2023. Protesters made noise in Dover that would lead to community meetings, news coverage and discussion during a state budget hearing for the public HBCU. The Safe Space Coalition, central to President Tony Allen’s response to campus unrest, was formed in late January to assess existing protocols on safety, sexual violence, response services and more. Then, students felt that very catalyst was muzzled. Delaware State made any student who wished to join the Safe Space Coalition, through the core membership or nine steering committees, sign a confidentiality agreement. Shortly after Delaware Online/The News Journal reporter Kelly Powers reported about these agreements in the spring, free speech organizations wrote to the Dover institution. Both the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and ACLU-DE condemned the documents, citing the condition ""plainly violates"" student rights. Delaware State rolled back.

""Sen. Tom Carper, D-Delaware, calls the earned income tax credit program one of the smartest things ever done to the United States tax system. “Yet, not everyone who is eligible knows about it,” he said during a Jan. 12 visit to First State Community Action Agency in Georgetown. Carper was joined by Bernice Edwards, First State executive director, and Sarah Cha Cha Carter of United Way to spread the message about the tax credit and programs helping low-income Sussex County residents. The tax credit gives low- to moderate-income families a tax break to use the credit to reduce taxes and possibly increase the amount of a refund. The maximum amounts increase dramatically for families with children: $600 without children; $3,995 with one child; $6,604 with two children; and $7,430 with three or more children. Carper said several groups by and large don't take advantage of the tax credit, including veterans, grandparents raising children, people in rural areas and modest-income workers who have a marital change. The senator said those who qualify must file a return even if they owe no taxes. Edwards said one of the many programs offered by First State is tax preparation at no cost for those who qualify. She said more than 665 returns were prepared last year that qualified for the earned income tax credit. It's also Poverty in America Awareness Month. Edwards said First State is Delaware’s anti-poverty agency. “Our mission is to help low-income people become self-sufficient. But it takes all of us to lift people out of poverty,” she said. The poverty rate in 2022 in Delaware was 9.4%, which is a decrease from previous years. In Sussex County, the rate is 12%. The U.S. government sets the poverty line at $23,000 per year earned by a single parent with two children. Edwards said training, transportation and finding affordable housing are the three major factors contributing to poverty in Sussex County. Last year, First State provided workforce development programs including education and training to 1,225 families and helped 127 families get homes. The agency also sponsors a culinary arts program to train people in the hospitality industry. Carper said the nation's unemployment rate at 3.7% is the lowest in 50 years. He said the solution to lowering that number is better ways to connect people with available jobs, with more training and better transportation options. He said there are currently 2 million unfilled jobs. Carter, program manager and coach for the United Way of Delaware Stand By Me program, said 7,200 clients took part in the financial empowerment program in 2023, with 34% living below and 20% just above the poverty threshold. “We provide coaching, and our clients have increased their credit scores by an average of 104% and saved an average of $4,200. We get to teach skills to help people fit into the world,” she said. Professional coaches provide free and private training to help people reach their financial goals, and manage their income and expenses to make smart financial decisions. Since the program started in 2011, 84% of the clients have improved their credit, 77% have increased their savings and 73% have reduced their debt. In addition, more than half of the clients have reached their goals of purchasing a home (1,040 so far) or a vehicle (942 so far). She said the program is partnering with First State Community Action Agency. Carter can relate to those who are struggling with their finances. “I grew up in poverty and was taken away from my mother for not going to school,” she said. She was adopted and graduated from Cape Henlopen High School. “I had a lot of help from nonprofits and family members in Delaware,” she said.
