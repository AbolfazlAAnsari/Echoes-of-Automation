'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'By: Kim Sutton Paulding County Bicentennial Committee Part of a series PAULDING – All aboard as we travel through a brief history of Paulding County’s railroads and some of the communities that sprang up beside them. Over time, the names of the railroad companies changed through mergers and acquisitions. To avoid confusion, this article will limit the names to those most commonly known and referred to on maps. Let us start with the Toledo, Wabash & Western, the first railroad built through our county. Most commonly known as the Wabash RR, it passed through the townships of Emerald, Crane, Carryall and Harrison. The line was built from Toledo, west to the Indiana state line, then to connect with the Great Western Railroad and on to the Mississippi River. This line was constructed mainly due to the determined efforts of the citizens of Defiance, who recognized the advantages of having a railroad through Defiance. It also had beneficial results for Paulding County as well, opening the first railroad commerce with the large commercial centers of the country both east and west. The line running from Toledo to Fort Wayne was completed in 1856. Paulding County’s portion was completed in 1855. General W.H. Gibson and General James B. Steedman had charge of its construction between Defiance and Fort Wayne. The Wabash Railroad entered Paulding County at Section 1 of Emerald Township and continued in a southwesterly direction to the Indiana state line at Section 7 in Harrison Township. The trains passed through the following communities: Renollet, Emmett (also known as Emerald), Cecil, Knoxdale and Antwerp. Three of these towns no longer exist. They are the forgotten towns and will be the focus of this article. Our first stop will be a small community known as Renollet in Section 2, Emerald Township, located at the crossroads of Roads 139 and 236. This little burg was named for the Renollet family who were landholders around this location. The settlement was never incorporated so it is difficult to say exactly when it started; however, an article found in the Paulding Democrat newspaper of December 15, 1910, states as follows: “Renollet Station. The new station on the Wabash railroad in Emerald Township, 3 miles east of Emmett, is now in shape for business as a grain and produce shipping point. The railroad has put in a side track, and Nutter & Russell of Paulding, grain dealers, have erected a grain warehouse for the buying and shipping of grain there. They got their scales for the weighing in of grain finished and in position for use last Friday. Renollet will also be available as a shipping point for sugar beets. John Nutter has moved his family over there from here and will make his home there for business purposes.” Renollet continued to expand and within a few years it consisted of the elevator, a general store, blacksmith shop and several residences. Tragically, Renollet was literally wiped off the map by a tornado on Sunday evening, March 28, 1920. Six lives were claimed, including four of John Nutter’s children. Once a happy, little community with hopeful anticipation of growing, Renollet would not survive the horrific disaster that leveled the settlement. Our next stop along the Wabash Railroad will be Emmett; however, only the post office carried this name. The settlement was known as Emerald or Emerald Station. The name is for Ireland, the Emerald Isle, and the homeland of many Emerald Township settlers. This little village was established about 1857 along the tracks at the crossroads of CR 115 and TR 228. Although never incorporated, it was quite a flourishing community. It served as the closest railroad station and operated a daily hack line to the village of Paulding, the county seat. A hack line was simply horse-drawn wagons and carriages for hire. Nearly all of the freight and passenger traffic for Paulding came through Emerald Station. The town had a telegraph and express office, a hotel, two general stores, a post office and several homes. The post office was active from 1858 to 1905. The railroad not only created the towns of the county, but also roads. In the Paulding Independent newspaper of March 1, 1860, the editor tells us: “We notice with pleasure, that the road from Emerald Station to the canal is being improved… We hope that a liberal outlay of funds may be made on this road, which without exaggeration we may say is a very important one to the interest of Paulding County…” This road ran between Emerald Station and Tate’s Landing on the Wabash & Erie Canal. Today, we know this road as County Road 115 or Emerald Road. When the Paulding & Cecil railroad line opened in 1880, connecting Paulding to the Wabash Railroad, Emerald fell into decline. The telegraph and express office was moved to Cecil and the hack line from Emerald to Paulding was discontinued. By 1892, only one small grocery store and the post office were still open. The other merchants had turned to farming for their existence. While the headline of the Paulding County Republican on January 12, 1905, read “Ohio Electoral College Votes for Roosevelt,” the other news was: “The post office of Emmett has been discontinued. The patrons of this office will be served by rural route carrier from Cecil.” The Gowdy family continued to run the small store until the 1940s. As we continue our ride along the Wabash Railroad, after passing through Cecil and before arriving in Antwerp, we will stop at Knoxdale (sometimes called Knox), located on TR 69 at the railroad tracks. The unincorporated community had a train station, general store, blacksmith shop, school, a small elevator and about 69 families resided here. The Paulding Democrat newspaper dated August 16, 1888, states: “A post office has been established at Knox, a small station on the Wabash railroad, in Crane Township, this county, to be known as Knoxdale with Frank Shaw as postmaster.” The Knoxdale community news was kept track of by the Antwerp Argus with a column called “Knoxdale Notes.” However, many newspapers reported the huge fire on April 9, 1910. The Knoxdale elevator caught fire and burned to the ground. A westbound fast passenger train started it with a spark from the locomotive. On June 10, 1911, the post office was discontinued and the residents were notified that they would receive their mail by rural mail delivery. By 1920, all the businesses of Knoxdale had closed their doors. However, the little town hung on in memory for another 30 years as the newspaper’s society columns commonly referenced people as being “from Knoxdale,” or events taking place “over near Knoxdale,” as if everyone in the county would know exactly where that is. Today, there are no signs the town had ever existed. The Wabash Railroad started its decline in the 1960s when railroad passenger services were no longer popular. The tracks still remain today and are owned by R&W Ventures LLC. Next time: We will continue with part two of the Railroads and Their Forgotten Towns.

That decision ensures the newspapers can continue seven-day a week publication, which was at risk after the Federal Communications Commission allowed Apollo to buy Cox’s TV stations only if it stopped publishing a daily newspaper in the Dayton market. “This is the best possible outcome for the newspapers, and it means we will continue to publish a printed newspaper seven days a week, uninterrupted,” said Jana Collier, interim operations leader for the Ohio newspapers. “Our commitment to important local journalism has never waned, and we will continue to serve our communities going forward.” Cox Enterprises was founded by James M. Cox, the former governor of Ohio who bought the Dayton Evening News in 1898 and renamed it the Dayton Daily News. Cox Enterprises owned the Dayton, Springfield and Butler County papers until December 2019. The current president and CEO of Cox Enterprises is Alex Taylor, great-grandson of Gov. Cox. “We couldn’t be happier,” Taylor said Monday when asked about the sale. He said the Cox family has “a deep affinity for the Dayton Daily News and the superior news product it has produced for over a century,” as well as the Springfield News-Sun and Journal-News. “Dayton, Ohio is a big part of the Cox DNA,” he said. “It’s where our family is from and where our company was founded,” said Taylor. “So it is with great excitement that we continue publishing these papers as we have for more than 100 years.” Cox Enterprises is based in Atlanta but maintains deep ties locally. Before going to Atlanta in 2011, Taylor worked in Dayton and oversaw the integration of the local newspaper, television and radio stations. Since 2011, the Cox Foundation has donated more than $2.4 million to local causes, such as the downtown River Run Project and most recently tornado cleanup. Local impact The sale bucks a national trend toward media consolidation. Cox Enterprises once controlled a sprawling media empire, but today only owns the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Much of the multi-billion dollar company’s business today is in cable and support for the automotive industry. Sandy Schwartz, president of Cox Automotive, visited the Dayton newsroom Monday and said Cox Enterprises made every decision — from selling the newspapers to keep them converged with WHIO-TV to buying them back to avoid going to three days a week — based on what they thought was best for the local community. “We will invest in the newspapers but we want to support the community,” he said. “Our hope is to own this paper for a long, long, long time and to transition it into the new world because we believe in journalism and we believe in what it does for communities.” Schwartz said there are no plans to eliminate local jobs. Dayton Daily News staff will stay in Dayton at 1611 S. Main Street but will move to a different floor of the building. Springfield News-Sun and Journal-News staff will stay at their current locations. After the deal closes in coming weeks, the newspapers will operate separately and be owned by Cox Enterprises. WHIO-TV and the Ohio radio stations will be owned by Apollo, which is using the name Cox Media Group for its broadcast business. “These newspapers are important assets to the communities they serve, and we are thrilled to have found a partner with a long and successful history of promoting freedom of the press and preserving print journalism,” said Cox Media Group CEO Kim Guthrie. “(Cox Enterprises) is the best possible partner for this sale to not only ensure continued daily print publication for the newspapers, but to also keep so many talented people doing what they do best — providing daily news coverage in our Ohio communities.” News of the sale was well-received by people who had expressed concern about the newspapers’ fate. Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley co-wrote an editorial in the USA Today in January expressing concern about Dayton losing a daily newspaper. “Daytonians deserve in-depth local news coverage and I am so glad to see that the Dayton Daily News will continue to dig into important local stories every day,” Whaley said of the sale Monday. “Cox Enterprises has been a part of our community for many years, and going forward I hope they will work to find new, innovative ways to be responsive to Daytonians’ evolving need for thoughtful, comprehensive stories about everything going on in our community – good and bad.” Ellis Jacobs is part of a local coalition of people who expressed concern about the Apollo deal’s impact on local journalism. He called the Cox Enterprises purchase “the best outcome that could have been hoped for under these circumstances.” “I hope that Cox is in it for the long run because having a superb local newspaper is really important for the community,” he said. Ownership rule forced sale In 2018, Cox Enterprises put most of its media outlets up for sale, including those in Ohio — WHIO-TV, the Dayton Daily News, the Springfield News-Sun and the Journal-News plus K99.1 FM, WHIO Radio and WZLR. Those Ohio businesses have operated as one entity for a decade and were long owned by Cox. When Cox agreed to sell its media outlets to Apollo Global Management last year, FCC rules allowed one company to own TV stations and newspapers in the same market. But in September 2019, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the FCC’s rules were invalid, in effect prohibiting Apollo from owning WHIO-TV and the Dayton Daily News. In November, the FCC approved the Cox-Apollo sale, but it required Apollo to reduce the daily newspapers to three days or sell them. David Sambur, co-lead partner of private equity at Apollo Global Management Inc., said “Apollo is committed to strengthening local media. When faced with the unfortunate requirements of an antiquated regulation, we would not accept an outcome that reduced local news coverage for the people of Dayton, Springfield and Butler County.” Rob Rohr, who has served as publisher of the newspapers and market vice president of Cox Media Group Ohio, will stay with Cox Media Group and continue to lead WHIO-TV and the radio stations. “I’m incredibly proud of the unique, multi-media business operation that our talented team built to serve our region over the last 10 years,” Rohr said. “As we look forward, we will carry the learnings and experiences we shared to support these businesses as they embark on separate but equally exciting and successful futures. “We applaud the FCC for working with us and providing us the flexibility to find a stable, long-term buyer who is committed to providing the citizens of Ohio with award winning journalism.” About the Author'}]"

Michael Semple Ivanka Trump, daughter of President Donald Trump, signs autographs for supporters after speaking Saturday at the “Make America Great Again!” rally at the Mahoning County Career and Technical Center on Palmyra Road in Canfield. The outdoor event drew about 400 people. CANFIELD — Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and a White House adviser, said her father has moved the country in the right direction during his first term in office and to change leadership would be a disaster. Of President Donald Trump, his daughter said, “Now more than ever America needs four more years of a warrior in the White House. My father fights so hard every single day for each of us. Now we have an opportunity to fight for him and fight for the future of this country.” She spoke for about 35 minutes Saturday at the Mahoning County Career and Technical Center in Canfield with about 400 people attending outdoors on a soggy and muddy lawn. Most of the attendees weren’t wearing face masks, and chairs were set up next to one another even though an announcement urged people to wear masks and socially distance because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The state has experienced its highest numbers of cases during the past 12 days. Ivanka told the audience: “With your help, your voice and your vote on Nov. 3, we will win another historic victory, and we will make America greater than ever before.” She added that her father “made me and countless Americans ask ourselves what we believe, what are our convictions, what do we stand for, what kind of America do we want to leave for our children? I’m more certain than ever before that we want an America that believe in America’s greatness. We want a society where each child can live in a safe community and go to a great school of their choice. We want a culture where differences of opinion and debate are encouraged, not canceled, where law enforcement is respected, where our country’s rich diversity is celebrated.” She criticized Democrat Joe Biden as “another empty vessel who will do what the media and the fringe of his party demands.” Polls show a close race in Ohio between Trump and Biden. Ivanka was the second Trump family member to campaign for the president in Mahoning County last week. Donald Trump Jr., the president’s oldest son, had a Monday rally at The Maronite Center in Youngstown with about 400 people in attendance. While Ohio and the nation is experiencing record-high numbers of COVID-19 cases, Ivanka praised her father for taking “early and aggressive actions to stop travel from China and Europe,” which she contended saved about 2 million lives. She also said the nation is on track to have a vaccine for the virus by the end of the year. “When my father makes a promise, he keeps a promise,” Ivanka said. In the Oct. 22 debate with Biden, Trump claimed a vaccine was ready and would be announced “within weeks.” A month earlier, he said a vaccine would be ready by Election Day. Alyssa Farah, a White House aide, acknowledged Friday that Election Day was “kind of an arbitrary deadline.” Ivanka said, “President Trump will never surrender to the virus.” In response to Ivanka’s visit, Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said, “You can’t spin failure with a photo op. Donald Trump promised to save Ohioans’ jobs, protect our health care and keep us safe from COVID-19. Instead, he’s overseen a cratering economy, he’s suing to strip health coverage away from hundreds of thousands of Ohioans and he’s surrendering to the pandemic even as cases reach a record high.” Ivanka also said among her father’s accomplishments are brokering peace treaties in the Middle East, fixing bad trade deals and bringing jobs back to “America and Ohio.” “President Trump has done more for Ohio in 47 months than Joe Biden did in 47 years,” she said. But Pepper pointed to statistics from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that show 2019 — before the pandemic — was the worst year for job growth in Ohio in a decade at just 0.3 percent. Before Ivanka, U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, a Cincinnati-area Republican, addressed the crowd and spoke of the president helping to bring jobs to the former General Motors complex that closed in March 2019. When it stopped operating, GM was down to a single shift with about 1,500 workers. Since then, GM sold the facility to Lordstown Motors Corp. to build its all-electric Endurance vehicle and GM is teaming up with LG Chem to build a battery plant nearby. Portman said, “Now we have 2,000 good-paying jobs on that campus already with the hope of much more.” But there aren’t more than 200 employees at Lordstown Motors. At full capacity by September 2021, that facility is expected to have 800 jobs. Construction recently began on the Ultium Cells facility — the GM / LG Chem battery plant — and it plans to open by January 2022 and employ about 1,200.

have written a letter to ABC denouncing the new series ""Big Sky,"" for its exclusion of Native American characters, saying they were concerned about ""cultural insensitivity"" and ""appropriation."" Set in Montana and filmed in Canada, the thriller series follows the investigation of two sisters who are kidnapped. But tribal leaders and organizations condemned the show, which premiered Tuesday, for ignoring Indigenous women, who go missing and are killed at disproportionately high rates in Montana and Canada. ""To ignore this fact, and to portray this devastation with a white female face, is the height of cultural insensitivity, made even more egregious given the national awakening to the need for racial justice,"" the letter, dated Tuesday, reads. ABC did not immediately respond to the Tribune\'s request for comment Friday afternoon. About 84% of Native women experience violence in their lifetimes, and more than one in three Indigenous women experienced violence in the past year, according to a 2016 National Institute of Justice report. Native Americans account for 6.7% of Montana\'s population; yet they comprise, on average, 26% of the state\'s missing persons cases at a given time. The missing and murdered Indigenous women epidemic is so prevalent, it has its own acronym, MMIW. Related: Big Sky television premiere doesn\'t hit home William Snell, executive director of the Rocky Mountain Tribal Leaders Council (an organization that represents all tribes in Montana as well as some in Idaho and Wyoming), David Sickey, chairman of the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana and Tom Rodgers, president of the Global Indigenous Council, wrote the letter Tuesday to ABC executives and David E. Kelley, who created the show. Snell, Rodgers and Sickey are all executive producers of ""Somebody\'s Daughter,"" a documentary on the MMIW crisis that features scenes from Browning that premiered last January. The organizations urge the executives and Kelley to ""enter into a dialogue with us to discuss including an information frame at the end of future \'Big Sky\' show credits that directs viewers to the \'Somebody\'s Daughter\' documentary and factual information."" The letter contends that ignoring the MMIW crisis is a missed opportunity and harmful towards communities who work to raise awareness for it. More: \'Somebody\'s Daughter\' documentary premieres Annita Lucchesi, executive director of the Sovereign Bodies Institute, which collects data and provides resources on violence against Indigenous women, said ""Big Sky"" represents an inaccurate portrayal of Montana and MMIW. ""They could have highlighted MMIW and chose not to. It\'s not only disappointing, offensive and inaccurate; it\'s also insensitive to the families. It doesn\'t give us anything,"" she said. Crystal Echo Hawk, founder and president of IllumiNative, said the exclusion of Native characters not only misses an opportunity to educate viewers but also contributes to the erasure of Native peoples. Echo Hawk said IllumiNative research found 78% of Americans know little to nothing about Native people, and Indigenous representation in television is low. ""When television shows neglect to include Native peoples, stories and issues, they perpetuate the invisibility of Native peoples. This invisibility impacts the mental, emotional and physical health of our people, but also non-Native viewers as well,"" she said in a statement to the Tribune. Jason Begay, associate professor at the University of Montana School of Journalism, said the show would be ""richer, deeper and more nuanced"" if the show had cast a Native American as any character. He said Native Americans are often portrayed in media as either victims of violence and poverty or as magical, with abilities to talk to animals or sense weather patterns. ""It gives people this image that all Native Americans fit in these boxes, and that makes it easy to dismiss real problems, like MMIW,"" said Begay, who is Navajo and a co-teacher at the university\'s Native-News Project. ""You almost never see Native Americans in big roles just doing their job, just being successful and living their lives."" Begay noted the show also missed an opportunity in excluding Native American characters cast as a police officer, statistician or epidemiologist. ""It\'s healthy for people to see Native Americans in roles we aren\'t used to seeing them in,"" he said. ""We don\'t get to see Native Americans as experts or academics in American society. We only see them as experts in Native American society, which means in the eyes of people who aren\'t familiar, they don\'t think Native Americans can be successful in greater America.""

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 4:18 am At this point in your life, chances are you’ve had to read American classics like “1984” and “To Kill a Mockingbird.” Although many high schools require their students to read these books, others have banned them from being read or carried by their students. In our technologically advanced world, information is available with just a few taps. So why are we still limiting the education of our nation’s youth by banning books? Since they’ve existed, books have been challenged, banned and destroyed by those who’ve sought to control access to them. In America, having a book banned locally means more than forbidding its possession or distribution in that area. It can also permit the postal service to limit shipments of that book within the country, an action made legal by the Comstock Act, said Mike Hennessey, an educator assistant professor in UC’s English Department. “Beyond governmental or civic authorities banning books, there's also a long history of religious organizations imposing similar limitations, like the Vatican's Index Librorum Prohibitorum [a list of publications deemed heretical or contrary to morality that Catholics were forbidden from reading], which existed for more than 400 years and only ended in the mid-1960s,” Hennessey said. “It might even take the form of individuals stealing, hiding, or throwing out copies of books from libraries so that others can't have access to them.” This was the case recently in Iowa, where a man burned four LGBTQ themed children’s books because they conflicted with the beliefs of the religious group he was affiliated with, according to nwestiowa.com and the American Library Association (ALA). The ALA is the oldest and largest library association in the world and promotes library and library education at an international level. This nonprofit organization regularly updates its list of challenged and banned books, with genres ranging from children to classics. According to the ALA, numerous books in the “Captain Underpants” series have been challenged for encouraging disruptive behavior, violence and depicting a same-sex couple. While classics like “Slaughterhouse Five,” “Of Mice and Men,” “To Kill a Mockingbird” and “The Catcher in the Rye” have accumulated dozens of challenges and bannings for an even greater number of reasons. While these allegations seem outlandish to the greater population, it doesn’t take much of an uproar for school boards to ban even the most harmless of books. Even modern authors like J.K. Rowling and John Green have had their books challenged for various reasons. Shelby Hatton — a second-year UC student studying Neuroscience and Biology — went to a Catholic elementary school, where “To Kill a Mockingbird” and “The Catcher in the Rye” were banned because school officials didn’t think that they were appropriate for children. “Most people think books should be banned because of the content,” Hatton said. “But that's the real world. The world can be ugly and harsh and that is knowledge that shouldn't be hidden to children but taught to them so that they may be prepared.” This outlook is shared by second-year Psychology student Kaylor Gause, who said banning books may cause children less inclined to read to never experience that author’s art. Students who aren’t allowed to read certain books – especially those with heavier themes – would also miss out on the life lessons that those books touche on, making them further unprepared for the real world. “Reading opens mental doors,” Gause said. “Even if it is fiction, you see the world through a different perspective with every book you read, which helps you be more sensitive or open minded in the real world.” Though Hennessey disagrees with an external authority banning books, he does acknowledge that some books are inappropriate for children. This, he said, is where parents need to make individual decisions about what their child can and can’t handle. There has been a recent trend of challenging books that have any trace of LGBTQ content, said Hennessey. Incidents similar to the book burning in Iowa can make it harder for children and teens struggling with their sexual orientation to find book characters facing the same issues as them. A connection that can save lives, said Hennessey. “I also think we sell kids short in terms of what they already know and what they can handle,” Hennessey said. “Books are frequently challenged for things like profanity, drugs and alcohol, or sexual content, as if the mere presence of such things would destroy their character.

have been on hold for several years amid legal challenges were dealt another blow this week. The Ohio Supreme Court jas declined to hear the appeal of Rocky Ridge Development, LLC, the owners of the site, who were looking to overturn a permanent injunction against the application of spent lime at the former Stoneco quarry in Benton Township. Residents of Benton Township represented by Ottawa County Prosecutor James VanEerten sued Rocky Ridge Development to stop the company from dumping the waste there in 2017. Residents who lived near the quarry expressed concerns about chemicals contaminating their water. More: Quarry neighbors irate about dumping, water quality The ongoing legal dispute has been going back and forth through the court system over the past several years. In August, the Ohio Sixth District Court of Appeals issued a ruling that upheld a prior decision by the Ottawa County Common Pleas Court granting the permanent injunction. Rocky Ridge Development subsequently filed an appeal in early October. The Ohio Supreme Court issued its ruling pn Tuesday declining to take up the case, citing the court’s rules regarding determination of jurisdiction. Attorneys for Rocky Ridge Development argued that the Ohio Supreme Court should hear the case because it presented “an issue of public or great general interest.” In their appeal, they stated that the Ottawa County court’s injunction, later affirmed by the Sixth District Court of Appeals, “frustrates” the Ohio legislature’s intention to “establish a comprehensive statewide scheme governing environmental matters.” They also noted that includes the “beneficial use of solid wastes,” which is exclusively administered by the Ohio EPA, and that the injunction upends that authority and “supplants it with the public policies of townships.” Attorneys for Benton Township argued that there are no questions of public or great general interest with this case. In response, they contended that the appeal is over a “garden-variety zoning dispute,” which is of interest primarily to only the parties involved in the case. They stated that the dispute merely rehashes a question that has already been answered multiple times, which is whether a permit issued by the Ohio EPA is subject to local zoning, and that the matter needs no further interpretation from the Ohio Supreme Court. The state high court ultimately voted 5-2 to decline hearing the case. Justice Sharon Kennedy and Justice Judith French dissented. French cited that she would have accepted hearing the appeal based on the proposition of law related to local zoning regulations. Rocky Ridge Development bought the limestone quarry in 2014, intending to turn what was an abandoned site into a place to deposit spent lime sludge from Toledo’s Collins Park Water Treatment Plant. However, the county prosecutor and Benton Township alleged that the company’s activity violated local zoning laws. Rocky Ridge Development representatives have insisted they were safely disposing of the spent lime sludge and that they were following the conditions of their permit from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. Activity at the quarry eventually halted in March 2017 when Judge Bruce Winters of Ottawa County Common Pleas Court issued an injunction. Then after Benton Township later motioned for a summary judgment in the case, Winters granted a permanent injunction in March 2019, which Rocky Ridge Development had looked to overturn on appeal. jstinchcom@gannett.com 419-680-4897 Twitter: @JonDBN'}]"

[See the related June 2020 Heights Observer article, “A look back and ahead at the Bradford cinder path,” by Marian Morton and Peggy Spaeth.] The volunteers plan to partner with the city and its neighbors to preserve the path’s mature trees and replace invasive plants with carefully selected native trees and shrubs. They intend to retain the path’s shady beauty, and create a long-term plan for the maintenance of this much-loved path. A small, recent change was the removal of invasive plants from around two large red oak trees (Quercus rubra) in the Princeton-Canterbury section of the path. Measurements were taken of the circumference of both trees, and the volunteers confidently report that these two trees have been in place much longer than the path. The current estimate is that the oak at the Canterbury end of the path is more than 200 years old; based on its diameter, it could be 230 years old. Most of the plants removed were buckthorn, brought by Europeans to America as an ornamental shrub. This is one of the most-invasive plants in Ohio, and the Bradford path is overrun with it. It grows in a variety of conditions and crowds out native plants. It is spread by seeds, and can grow as tall as 20 feet. Its leaves emerge early, and it keeps its leaves longer than other plants in the fall, further crowding them out. Buckthorn also is not a source of nutrients to native birds, bees and other pollinators. For them, a stand of buckthorn is a green desert, and buckthorn berries have a laxative effect that can cause death in birds. Cutting the plant back doesn’t help, because it will just vigorously grow back. Specific techniques have been developed to remove it. They include pulling out small buckthorns, including the roots; using a special tool called a Weed Wrench (one can be borrowed from the Home Repair Resource Center's tool library); and smothering the plant by covering it with heavy black plastic, to block all light. Removing buckthorn from the cinder path is going to be a long process. As it is removed, volunteers will be planting suitable alternative native shrubbery. For more information about the Bradford Cinder Path, and to volunteer, contact Friends of the Bradford Cinder Path by e-mail, at friends.bradford.cinder.path@gmail.com. Debra Franke is a five-year resident of Cleveland Heights. She and her husband selected Cleveland Heights as their retirement home, and moved here from York, Pa. In retirement, Franke has time to indulge her interest in gardening.""}]"

After the stabbing, Gonzalez also made a threatening statement to a witness at the scene of the homicide in the West End Community. Gonzalez was initially charged with one felony count each of aggravated murder and murder, as well as one misdemeanor count of aggravated menacing. The death penalty was not on the table in the case. It was not until July 2017 that Gonzalez ultimately pleaded guilty to Villalon’s murder and was promptly sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after serving a minimum of 15 years. Gonzalez is scheduled to have his first parole hearing in August 2029.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': ""Flyer News: Univ. of Dayton's Student Newspaper Garrett Reese Archives Columnist Editor’s note: This article details streaking, which is a criminal offense, on campus in the 70s. Specifically, there is one incident that is discussed that likely was sexual misconduct. The last two adventures into UD’s Archive and the old issues of the Flyer News have been on two serious topics – the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 and Watergate and the Nixon Presidency. I figured it was time for a more light-hearted subject. Luckily, something caught my eye while researching Flyer News’ coverage of the student reactions to Watergate and Nixon. On March 5, 1974, underneath a bright full moon, Flyer News reported on six separate instances of streaking on the University of Dayton campus. It was not the headline ‘Nudist craze hits campus’ that caught my eye while flipping through the old, yellowing copies of Flyer News, but the picture that accompanied the article. The black-and-white photo showed a figure throwing what appears to be a coat or jacket over their face to obscure their identity. Their backside, however, was left exposed for a Flyer News photographer’s camera to capture. Editor’s note: Standards have changed since the 70s, so we will not be including the nude photo that was included in the March 1974 print edition in this article. According to the article, published in the March 8 edition of the Flyer News, the streaking was clustered around Marycrest and Founders. It occurred at Marycrest, which was only for female students at the time, from around 12:30 a.m. to 2:30 a.m. and at Founders, which was all-male, between 1 a.m. to 2 a.m. One of the instances of streaking involved a group of young men clad only in long Army coats, which were quickly discarded as they ran past Marycrest and the ROTC building bare to the world. One girl, a second-year education major, said of the event, “It was terrible. At first I thought it was a rally.” Another remarked that they thought it was some initiation for a fraternity before realizing it was just for laughs. Another group of men decided to stand outside Marycrest and “[serenade] females watching from their windows, requesting undergarments,” as the article put it. Some of these young women decided to acquiesce the men, tossing various articles of underwear to them. One Marycrest resident, however, had a different gift for the men. She tossed a bundle of bound copies of Flyer News from her window and struck one young man on the head. Flyer News reported he was “stunned momentarily” but otherwise okay. At Founders later that evening, a black 1967 Pontiac rolled up to the front of the building. Two young women, clad only in underwear, were in the car. They proceeded to take off their bras, “hang their breasts out the window,” and called out to the men of Founders Hall. An Arts and Science second-year reported that when crowds began to form around the car, the young women took off, “tooting their horn.” The second-year also reported seeing a girl undressing behind the ROTC building until a group of young men began to chase her, and she took off back toward the safety of Marycrest. This sentence was reported with a casual tone that I found a tad unnerving. While the article made it appear that this was a fun event that didn’t cause any harm, this eyewitness account suggests otherwise. Timothy Fenlon, who was director of campus security at the time, said that any streaker who was caught would be charged, depending on the situation. But he said a definite policy would be put in place if streaking were to become more frequent. Unfortunately for Fenlon and campus security, it would become a commonplace event. On the front page of the March 12, 1974 issue of Flyer News, a headline declares the charge Fenlon had decided on: “Campus Police to consider streaking indecent exposure.” The tone of the previous article had been light and jovial, discussing a matter that many, though not all, thought was a humorous situation. That feeling was gone in this new article. Fenlon reported that any streaker caught would be arrested and charged with a violation of the public indecency code. Fenlon noted, however, that he was beginning to worry not just about the streaking but also about events that seemed to be following the streaking. In one incident, an ambulance was blocked from getting up to Stuart Hill by a crowd that had come to witness a group of streakers being chased by a car. One student, a first year, fell out of the car while it was chasing the streakers and was waiting on the ambulance to take him to St. Elizabeth’s Hospital (now known as the Medical Center at Elizabeth Place). Another night, a student went as far as calling in a bomb threat at Marycrest in what Fenlon believed was an attempt to empty the building. The women of Marycrest were becoming increasingly fed up with the streaking, according to the Marycrest resident director Kathy Shea, who said that they were finding the incidents “offensive especially after Wednesday night.” What happened Wednesday night? At around midnight, approximately 350 people gathered on the front lawn of Marycrest to witness two men streak. The crowd of 350 people were predominantly male, according to Flyer News. “I came here for a Catholic education,” one of the streakers is reported to have said, all the while striking various poses for photographers before adding, “It’s national streaking week,” as if that explained the strange display. The two streakers would perform gymnastics and put on what the student journalist called a “burlesque type show.” The crowd, apparently, was not impressed. After Fenlon and campus security declared their intent to charge any streaker who was caught, streaking seemed to slowly fade from UD’s campus. A few cartoons popped up in the Flyer News in the following weeks, but after the article declaring the potential charges, there were no more articles written about instances of streaking. For a few hectic weeks, however, it seemed to dominate campus nightlife. This took place during a significant time of change on UD’s campus. ROTC, which had been mandatory for first and second-year men, was now voluntary. Marycrest would become a co-ed dorm a few months after this streaking craze, a move that many found shocking and indecent. UD students, like many college students across the nation, were finding their voices and protesting injustices they saw in the world and at home. It was not just at UD that streaking became a fad – incidences were being reported from across the country. In this YouTube video from WFAA, the ABC affiliate in Dallas, a glimpse into the year 1974 and the streaking fad that hit Southern Methodist University shows that streaking was captivating the minds of college students nationwide. Beyond the world of college campuses, there is one notable instance of streaking that the entire nation got to see together while sitting comfortably at home. During the 46th Academy Awards in April 1974, Robert Opal attempted to steal the show by running across the stage naked, flashing the crowd literally but also flashing a peace sign in a very 1970s move. The host of the Awards quipped, “Just think, the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off his clothes and showing his shortcomings.” By years end, the streaking fad had largely faded from college campuses, but it still continues on at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Students annually gather at the campus library, Davis Library, to witness a mass streaking of their peers. The ritual began during the 1974 fad but has continued on and become a tradition on the southern campus. According to an article by The Daily Tar Heel, UNC’s student newspaper, the tradition was cemented in 1977 for one reason – to honor finals. It is for that reason the tradition continues on. While streaking was something that delighted and entertained students across UD, Flyer News reporting shows other students found it distressing and deeply inappropriate. Perhaps streaking was just another, albeit strange, attempt to push the boundaries of change that were going on around the country and on campus. While earning a few laughs, a UD student could also push back against authority. All it took was removing a few articles of clothing and running as fast as possible.

When we’re sleep deprived we’re likely to consume on average an extra 300 calories per day. If there is a surplus amount of 3,500 calories that aren’t burnt, this will lead to a weight gain of 1 lb. If we consume 300 additional calories per day, we could see ourselves putting on 1 lb every 11 days and a whopping 2 stone a year! When we’re tired we instinctively reach for caffeine laden drinks and fatty foods as an energy boost to see us through the day. Comfort food is often craved when tired as we feel more vulnerable when we’re not fully alert. It’s a vicious cycle – you leave work tired and hungry and don’t have the energy to cook so you may find yourself eating a takeaway or ready meal. Our metabolism slows down when we’re tired in order to conserve energy. Our body’s natural ability to then burn calories throughout the day diminishes and is more likely to absorb calories than get rid of them. When we are tired and lose our ability to function, it makes situations more stressful. When we are stressed, the hormone cortisol is increased and this has been known to increase hunger and appetite. Although a healthy eating and exercise plan will enable you to lose weight, sleep also plays a pivotal factor in this. To keep the pounds off, we need to make sure we’re getting enough shut eye at night. It’s easy to cut sleep to fulfill all the demands of our work and social life but “me time” and sleep time is important and vital to our health. To give yourself the best chance of a good night’s sleep, create an environment which encourages sleep. Relax and unwind with a hot bath, drink or a book and turn off all electrical devices. LCD lighting from electrical devices can actually affect our body’s circadian rhythm and disturbing our natural sleep pattern. If you’re tossing and turning in the night, it may be time for a new mattress. Mattresses should be changed every seven years. Mattresses that aren’t giving you the right support can disturb your sleep. Likewise if you’re sharing a bed, consider whether it’s big enough for the two of you to move in the night. Creating a bedtime routine is just as important as setting time aside to go to the gym and to cook a healthy meal. However sleeping is a much easier way of enabling your body to lose weight!

Steffen Baldwin, former chief humane agent for the Union County Humane Society, shown above, has been indicted for allegedly killing dogs and stealing from those looking to help the animals. (Photo submitted) Former U.C. Humane Society official in custody after being charged with felonies The former chief humane agent for the Union County Humane Society could now be facing more than eight decades in prison for allegedly killing dogs and stealing from their owners. The Union County Grand Jury has indicted Steffen Evan Baldwin, also known as Steffen Finkelstein, 39, of 32035 Mountain Shadow Road, Acton, CA. Baldwin is charged with engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, bribery, 15 counts of telecommunications fraud, 13 cases of cruelty to animals, six counts of tampering with records, two counts of grand theft, two counts of falsification, and one count each of grand theft of a firearm and impersonation of a peace officer. Included in the court documents is the allegation that Baldwin “did negligently, needlessly kill” at least eight dogs. “I am not sure we are ever going to know the total number of animals he killed,” said Union County Prosecutor Dave Phillips. “I certainly think the total exceeds the number of indictments.” Baldwin served as director of the Union County Humane Society and helped start the Animal Cruelty Task Force of Ohio. Baldwin was the Chief Humane Agent for the Union County Humane Society. He founded the Animal Cruelty Task Force of Ohio (ACT Ohio), and co-founded the Ohioans Against Breed Discrimination, a Political Action Committee. Phillips said investigators began looking into Baldwin. “Shortly thereafter, he left the state and went to California,” Phillips said. In California, Baldwin started Save Them Dog Training, which focused on reactive dogs with bite histories. He also helped found Underdog Alliance to advocated for dogs with severe behavioral problems. Phillips said Baldwin would allegedly tell people he was taking dogs in to rescue or adopt them. “Then he would raise money for these dogs – for their care, for their adoption, for their training – but had allegedly euthanized them,” Phillips said. He said Baldwin had, “a pattern of lying to people to raise money.” The indictments indicate Baldwin took funds from a variety of animal shelters, organizations and individuals throughout the state and nation. “The allegations indicate the money he raised for the animals, even after they were euthanized, were used for his personal expenses,” Phillips said, listing gifts for his girlfriend as well as strip clubs. The indictments also allege Baldwin lied on his resume to get his position in Union County and that he lied on court documents, saying he was bit by an aggressive dog. Also included in the indictment is the allegation that he stole a handgun from an animal rescue task force. Phillips said local investigators worked with police in California. He said that when it was time to serve the indictment and arrest Baldwin, police in California invited Baldwin to conduct an animal training for the department. When Baldwin arrived, U.S. Marshals arrested him. Baldwin is currently in a Los Angeles County jail and has been denied bail. He has said he will not fight his extradition to Ohio. If convicted on all counts, Baldwin could face more than 81 years in prison. One of the euthanized dogs named in the indictments is Remington, also known as Remi. Remington’s former owner has been vocal on social media about her anger toward Baldwin. The woman said she trusted Baldwin and “when Remi was sent there, because Steffen said he would have his Dangerous Dog designation removed, I sent part of myself to him.” She said she and her husband paid Baldwin $1,000 to work with Remi, starting in September 2016. She said Baldwin promised to rehabilitate the dog and find a permanent home for the dog. The woman wrote that based on Baldwin’s connections, she had no reason to doubt him. According to court documents, Remington was euthanized in December 2016. “We were led to believe for months that he was alive and well,” Remi’s owner wrote on social media. In fact, in April 2017, Baldwin bought a dangerous dog license for Remi. The dog’s owner said she and her husband also paid for medications and a surgery. When the owner eventually learned that Remi had been euthanized, she said she was told it was because the dog attacked one of Baldwin’s other animals. The dog’s owner said she and her husband, “knew Remi and we knew the story that Steffen was telling us could not be the truth.” “We didn’t know the whole truth until much later when the police became involved,” the owner wrote. “It was plain as day that the story that was being told by Steffen Baldwin did not add up. But, Steffen’s network continued to grow and they all chose to ignore Remi’s story and not even attempt to ask questions about what really happened.” The woman wrote that, “in the end, Steffen Baldwin killed the wrong dog.” Comments are closed.

spread of coronavirus and keep the park open for people observing the British government's guidance of social distancing, only using parks for dog walking, one form of exercise a day, like a run, walk, or cycle alone or with members of the same household. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham) Here are summaries of the latest worldwide stories on the coronavirus pandemic, including: — British Prime Minister Johnson admitted to a hospital with the coronavirus. — Louisiana health officials: 68 coronavirus-related deaths — France: 357 deaths in hospitals from the virus in a single day but signs that spread is slowing. — Fauci: Very good chance coronavirus “will assume a seasonal nature.” — Palm Sunday services in some Kentucky churches in defiance of Gov. Andy Beshear’s warning against in-person worship. ___ LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been admitted to a hospital with the new coronavirus. Johnson’s office says he is being admitted for tests because he still has symptoms, 10 days after testing positive for the virus. Downing St. says the hospitalization is a “precautionary step” and he remains in charge of the government. Johnson, 55, has been quarantined in his Downing St. residence since being diagnosed with COVID-19 on March 26. ___ Louisiana health officials reported 68 coronavirus-related deaths today, marking the state’s biggest jump in reported deaths since the outbreak began. The Louisiana Department of Health reported the figures on its website today. The number of infections reported to the state also increased by more than 500 cases from 12,496 to 13,010. Before today, the largest number of deaths reported in a single day was 60. The numbers represent when the tests were reported to the state, not necessarily when the infections or deaths occurred. Louisiana and the New Orleans area have been an epicenter for the virus, and Gov. John Bel Edwards has repeatedly warned of looming shortages for ventilators and intensive care units. ___ SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — The ACLU says it is seeking an injunction to block part of Puerto Rico’s strict curfew against the new coronavirus and argues that some of its restrictions are unconstitutional. The curfew imposed March 15 has shuttered non-essential businesses in the U.S. territory and ordered people to stay home from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. and remain there even outside those hours unless they have to buy food or medicine, go to the bank or have an emergency or health-related situation. Violators face a $5,000 fine or a six-month jail term, and police have cited hundreds of people. A spokesman for the U.S. territory’s Justice Department said today there was no immediate comment. It is the first time the ACLU has decided to file a lawsuit in a U.S. jurisdiction related to a coronavirus curfew. ___ Defense Secretary Mark Esper has issued new requirements for those visiting or working on Department of Defense installations regarding the use of cloth face coverings. Esper says that “to the extent practical,” all individuals on DOD property “will wear” the face coverings when they cannot maintain 6 feet of social distance from others. The guidance is effective immediately. It follows a recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that encourages people, especially in areas hit hard by the spread of the coronavirus, to use rudimentary coverings such as T-shirts, bandannas and non-medical masks to cover their faces while outdoors. Esper outlined the new requirements in a memorandum to senior military leaders today. Esper said the requirement doesn’t apply to a service member’s personal residence on a military installation. But it does apply to work centers and other public areas. He says exceptions may be approved by local commanders or supervisors and then submitted up the chain of command for awareness. ___ PARIS — France reported 357 deaths in hospitals from the virus in a single day today but showed signs that its spread is slowing after 20 days of national confinement. The country remains among the hardest hit in the world, with 8,078 confirmed deaths since the virus arrived in January. More than a quarter of those who died were in nursing homes, according to figures from the national health service tonight. France’s intensive care units continue to fill up fast, with 390 new arrivals since Saturday for a total of 6,978 people in critical care beds. But the daily growth has been slowing, and 250 people left intensive care in the same one-day period. Most of those in intensive care are older, but 106 are under 30 years old. While still high, the number of new deaths in hospitals dropped today for the second day straight and was the lowest since March 29. France continued today to transport critically ill patients out of saturated regions to those with more hospital space and has brought in hundreds of medical personnel to help in the overwhelmed Paris region. ___ WASHINGTON — Dr. Anthony Fauci says there a very good chance the new coronavirus “will assume a seasonal nature” because it is unlikely to be under control globally. Fauci is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He says the virus is unlikely to be completely eradicated from the planet this year. That means the U.S. could see the “beginning of a resurgence” during the next flu season. Fauci says the prospect of a resurgence is the reason the U.S. is working so hard to get its preparedness “better than it was.” He says that includes working to develop a vaccine and conducting clinical trials on therapeutic interventions. Fauci also says states that don’t have stay-at-home orders are not putting the rest of the country at risk as much as they are putting themselves at risk. Fauci spoke on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” ___ LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Some Kentucky churches held Palm Sunday services in defiance of Gov. Andy Beshear’s warning against in-person worship. Dozens of people were at Maryville Baptist Church in Louisville today, news outlets reported. A video showed a pianist playing and choir members singing during the late morning service. Louisville’s Our Savior Lutheran Church streamed its in-person service live on YouTube. The church had required online registration beforehand and restricted seating to every other pew. The video stream did not show the audience. Beshear warned during his daily briefing on Saturday that mass gatherings “are spreading the coronavirus. “We care about each other in this state, and our faith guides us and gives us the wisdom to do the right thing to protect each other.” Some states, including Florida, have made exemptions to allow religious gatherings to proceed during the coronavirus. Kentucky does not have that exemption. ___ RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and evangelical backers declared today a day of prayer and fasting against the spread of the new coronavirus, and a small group gathered outside his official residence in the capital, Brasilia, to pray. A day earlier, he posted on social media a video of himself with about a dozen pastors calling for the fasting and prayer. The Rev. Marco Feliciano said the purpose is so that “all the bad predictions made here in Brazil fall to the ground.” Bolsonaro has distanced himself from most world leaders and many members of his own government by repeatedly minimizing the risks posed by COVID-19 and saying younger and healthy people should not self-isolate at home but get back to work. Some of the pastors appearing in the video had previously criticized state governors who introduced quarantines that prevented them from opening their churches. ___ ROME — Italy has registered its lowest day-to-day increase in deaths of patients with the coronavirus in more than two weeks. Angelo Borrelli, the head of the national Civil Protection agency today, said there were 525 deaths in the 24-hour period since Saturday evening. That’s the lowest such figure since 427 deaths were registered on March 19. Italy has a total of 15,887 deaths and nearly 130,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19. A day shy of one month under national lockdown that the government ordered to try to contain the wildly spreading contagion, the lower count of day-to-day deaths brought some encouragement. The number of intensive care beds occupied by COVID-19 patients has also showed a decrease in the past few days, including in northern Lombardy, Italy’s most stricken region. ___ JERUSALEM — The Israeli Defense Ministry says it has helped arrange an airlift of critically needed medical equipment from China to help fight the country’s coronavirus outbreak.

He knew it was his duty to see that justice was done. And he knew the accusers of the man in front of him were acting out of jealousy. His wife had even sent him a special message just a few minutes ago: “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much over him today in a dream.” But he wanted peace; he wanted the local power brokers on his side. He tried again, “What evil has he done?” Their answer was all about words and meanings and offenses against their sacred values. The murmuring of the orchestrated mob was becoming vehement. A riot was forming. Above all, he wanted to avoid any unpleasant use of force. He decided to jettison his principles. Calling for a basin of water, he washed his hands ceremonially. “I am innocent of this man’s blood,” he proclaimed. Then, proving the opposite, he delivered over the victim into the hands of those determined to enforce their own brand of justice. He had no doubt about what that would be. But sometimes sacrifices had to be made – in the interest of the common good, of course. Purging the undesirable from our midst is an age-old temptation. “Righteous anger” is not hard to stir up, when we turn a blind eye to our own failings. Social pressure to enforce conformity to certain rules or standards is very effective when begun early. In our schools today, this shaping process is called “socio-emotional learning.” One aim is to mold easily manipulated “change agents,” armies of activists. Influence over children in their formative years is crucial for any revolution to take root. In 2007, Venezuela’s President Hugo Chavez and his education minister, also his brother, declared that “the old values of individualism, capitalism, and egoism must be demolished.” To accomplish this, they were instituting a new type of educational system, “red, very red.” Their goal was “to create the new man,” a phrase lifted from Ernesto “Che” Guevara’s Cuban revolutionary days. (Fatherland, Socialism or Death, The Economist, 10/11/2007) According to Guevara’s theory, society was divided into two groups, “the enlightened elite, possessing a higher consciousness and a true ideology: Marxism-Leninism” and “the sleeping masses that needed to be woken up, educated, mobilized, and pushed….” The latter “must be subject to incentives and pressure of a certain intensity.” The youth were “the malleable clay from which the new person can be built with none of the old defects.” (Che Guevara and the Making of the New Man, Erasmo Calzadilla, Havana Times, 10/30/2012) The shaping of youth in the Hitler-Jugend, aka the Hitler Youth, was the route to domination by the Third Reich. Designed to eradicate the traditional structures of German society, its aim was to replace parental instruction and other sources of influence like church youth groups and the Boy Scouts. Instead, ruthlessness and blind dedication to the Fuhrer and his goal of a pure master race, were the new requirements. In order to create the ideal new man, the “impure” had to be eradicated. Strangely resonant today, the targeted group were herded together and quarantined, under the pretext of being spreaders of dangerous disease. Deportations to the death camps came later. During the National Socialist (Nazi) occupation of France, an entire shadow government of collaborationists operated out of Vichy, a deceptively charming spa town. There, amidst the gardened villas and tree-lined lanes, toadying locals aided their German masters in an ethnic version of “contact tracing,” to further their Final Solution for the racially “impure.” Scapegoating has a long history. It is much easier to project fault onto others, than to recognize it in ourselves. Virtue signaling with a “Hate has no home here” sign in the front yard may aim to localize evil elsewhere, but our neighbors know better. As Solzhenitsyn, who survived the Soviet gulags, concluded, “The line separating good from evil runs…right through every human heart” (my italics). The crushing of individual autonomy in the name of some superior system, results only in oppression and misery. In the end, only fear will keep people in line with goals that disregard their personhood and ignore their self-interest. The power of fear to enforce conformity to an imposed ideology is apparent here now, in the sudden appearance of Black Lives Matter signs, placed in windows by nervous shop owners. A coup of sorts is underway. BLM’s founders are avowed Marxists, as expressed in the words of Patrisse Cullors. She told The Real News Network in 2015 that she and co-founder, Alicia Garza, are “trained Marxists…super versed on ideological theories.” Marxist theory predicts that a better society will somehow rise from the ashes of the violent destruction of the old one. BLM’s goals are more about bringing down the pillars of society, than about valuing Black lives. Recent events have made it clear that BLM works in concert with Antifa, an anarchist group, to sow chaos and destruction, generally in the Black communities that it claims to want to help. (If You Really Believe Black Lives Matter, Stop Supporting Black Lives Matter, July 3, 2020, The Federalist). Members show no concern about the vast majority of Black murders that are not attributed to the police, 90% of which are by people of their own race. (Race and Homicide in America, U.S. News & World Report, 9/29/2016). Certainly, there are flaws in our current system. No reasonable person justifies unnecessary police violence or mistreatment. However, as the police are forced to pull back, the evidence is that crime and murder rates jump. The statistics analyzed by Black Harvard economics professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr., show that unjustified police killings are extremely rare, and not racially unbalanced (What the Data Say about the Police, WSJ 6/22/2020). Consider for a moment the enormous number of police officers throughout our nation, and the huge number of interactions that they have with people of less than law abiding, peaceful intent. “Let he who is without sin among you cast the first stone.” This is not to say that we should not strive for improvement. That has always been America’s strength. Senator Tim Scott, a Black Republican, has crafted a police reform bill in consultation with many advisors – but been blocked by opposition forces, which prefer to keep the outrage alive. Encouraging lawlessness and disorder to continue only increases the need for a strong police presence. We must support practical reform efforts, especially as regards excessive police union protections, while being heartily grateful to those still willing to daily put themselves in harm’s way to stand between us and that harm.
