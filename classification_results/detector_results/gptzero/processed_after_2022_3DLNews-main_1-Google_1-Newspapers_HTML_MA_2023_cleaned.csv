There had been a February storm, and Noriega was on his way to apply ice melt at a condominium for his work. He was running late. The lights of a Maynard police cruiser flashed in his rearview mirror. When he paid the $105 speeding ticket, Noriega didn’t notice that the officer had written a “W” in the box on the citation labeled “RACE,” logging him as white. “White? I’m not white,” Noriega, who is from Guatemala, said with a laugh when told about the designation. “I’m Spanish.” Police across Massachusetts have for years routinely labeled men with Hispanic surnames as white on traffic citations, a USA TODAY Network investigation by the Cape Cod Times, Worcester Telegram & Gazette and USA TODAY has found. The erasure skews statistics that can expose bias in the most common interaction between police and the public: traffic stops. The news organizations’ analysis of documented traffic stops statewide between 2014 and 2020 revealed that in 28% of stops — more than 1 in 4 — involving male drivers with Hispanic last names, police identified the driver as white on their citations. The analysis found that identifying likely Hispanic drivers as white can obscure state and local data used to monitor racial profiling. As written, police citations indicated that Hispanic men made up 14% of traffic stops of male Massachusetts residents, already more than their 11% share of the state’s adult male population. The USA TODAY Network analysis identified thousands of drivers marked as white whose last name indicates they likely are Hispanic. If those drivers had been identified as Hispanic, 19% of those stopped would have been Hispanic men, nearly double their share of the male population. At the local police department level, some agencies showed a wider difference than others. Holyoke provides a stark example. There, police data indicates that about a quarter of stops of the city’s adult male residents were of Hispanic men. If those with Hispanic last names had been identified as Hispanic instead of white, their share of stops would have risen threefold to nearly three-quarters. Traffic stops are a major pipeline into the Massachusetts criminal system, where the rate of incarceration of Hispanics is four times that of whites — the greatest disparity in the nation, according to the Sentencing Project. Unlicensed driving, driving with a suspended license and driving without auto insurance have been the top three criminal charges across the state each year since 2018, according to Trial Court data. Experts in criminal defense say what the news organizations found means it is harder for drivers to challenge charges they allege stemmed from discriminatory stops in court. “The fact that criminal traffic enforcement is the most common type of law enforcement action in our state highlights how impactful it is for police to be systematically miscounting the race or ethnicity of the drivers who they are pulling over,” said Joshua Raisler Cohn, a public defense attorney who has researched racial profiling litigation in the state. Massachusetts traffic tickets don’t allow police to mark both a driver’s race and ethnicity. Instead, the ticket only has a field for “race.” While Hispanic is widely considered an ethnicity, not a race, it is one of the six racial categories from which officers choose when ticketing a driver. Police chiefs were reluctant to fault officers for the patterns identified by the USA TODAY Network. “I don’t know how you discern, from officer to officer, what the motivation was,” said Mark K. Leahy, executive director of the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association. Leahy and other law enforcement leaders argued that in an increasingly diverse society, drivers should self-report demographic information to the state when they get their driver’s license. Requiring police to mark their perception of a driver’s race with little to no training, they say, is a recipe for mistakes and inaccurate data. Some experts questioned whether poor training and genuine mistakes were wholly to blame. “Based on what I’ve seen and what I know, I don’t think it’s possible that this is not a deliberate misidentification of people,” said Luis Jiménez, an associate professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts, Boston who specializes in Hispanic and Latino politics. The Executive Office of Public Safety & Security, which oversees Massachusetts law enforcement, declined to comment on the USA TODAY Network findings that men with Hispanic surnames were routinely labeled as non-Hispanic white on citations. The news organizations identified more than 51,000 stops of men with Hispanic surnames between 2014 and 2020 when police marked the driver as white on traffic citations — a discovery possible only because the Registry of Motor Vehicles mistakenly released drivers’ surnames in response to a public records request. The analysis considered a surname Hispanic if at least 80% of people with the same name identified as Hispanic in the U.S. Census, and it focused on men because traditional marriage conventions make men most likely to retain their parents' name. That allowed reporters to pinpoint dozens of communities where mislabeling appears to be routine. In Bourne, the gateway to Cape Cod, police marked men with Hispanic surnames as white in 65% of stops. In South Hadley, a woodsy town in Western Massachusetts, police recorded the driver as white in 80% of those stops. And in Barnstable, home to the Kennedy family compound in Hyannisport, the rate was 68%. “This absolutely needs to change,” said Adriana Paz, an Afro-Latina community advocate in Lynn. “We're literally taking away the voice of those who have been discriminated against because they cannot tell their story without the data.

their float displayed a Palestine flag. When the float was in front of the Macy’s Store, someone unfurled and held up a small Palestinian flag as they moved up 34th Street. The person could be seen standing behind others in the back row of the float with the flag above their head until NBC broadcast cameras panned away. The act made headlines across the nation and even internationally with articles in several major publications. In a post to X, formerly known as Twitter, the Council on American-Islamic Relations thanked the tribe for their apparent show of solidarity with Palestinian people. The individual has yet to be identified, but the Tribe made it clear in a statement released later that day that they do not endorse the person’s actions. “It’s unfortunate that we are not focused on the beautiful display of our culture and history at the Macy’s Day Parade, but rather on the actions of an individual tribal citizen. We want to make it very clear that the Tribe takes no stance on the conflicts overseas,” the statement read. This was the second year in a row that the tribe, known as “People of the First Light,” was featured in the parade. Powwow Princess Jenaya “Precious Healing Star” Perry also appeared on the float with Mashpee National Environmental Youth Ambassadors. A statement on the incident from the Tribe’s official website continued: “Our Tribal Nation remains focused on the issues we face on our ancestral homeland. While we cannot speak for an individual’s actions, his actions were not a Tribal decision. Our governing tribal body, along with the other tribal citizens on the float were not involved with his actions.” Social media posts across many platforms took the individual’s choice to wave the flag as the Tribe acting in solidarity with Palestine. Some were in favor of the show of unity while others opposed or distanced themselves from the action, including the Tribe. Log In Keep it Clean.

by Harvard experts. EVEscape uses evolutionary and biological information to predict how a virus could change to escape the immune system. Anti-vaxxers, others benefited from mistrust engendered by early stumbles in messaging about virus, prevention, says New York Times health and science reporter Apoorva Mandavilli. Some worry a treatment that kills SARS-CoV-2 by helping it mutate could spawn a super virus. New research weighs in on its “evolutionary safety.” William Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology, talks about hybrid protection, vulnerability of older people, and the wisdom of Taylor Swift. A new study suggests we are as vulnerable as ever to the emergence of another virus as deadly, or even more so, than COVID-19. Through a national survey, researchers identified prevalent work overload, burnout, and intent to leave health care professions among nurses, clinical staff, and non-clinical staff, including housekeeping, administrative staff, lab technicians, and food service workers. COVID-19 isn’t going away, but one day may be as severe as the common cold, says epidemiologist Larry Brilliant. Harvard epidemiologist looks back and ahead. Findings suggest that simple lifestyle changes, such as having adequate sleep and maintaining a healthy body weight could prevent long COVID symptoms. Scientists have designed a mathematical model that can predict COVID-19 vaccines’ effectiveness over the long term in healthy individuals and those who have cancer or suppressed immune responses. Researchers have linked the molecular signatures underlying brain aging with the cognitive decline observed in patients with severe COVID-19. A team led by investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital has determined that Omicron BA.2 is weaker than both Delta and the original Omicron variant. Harvard faculty discuss changes to views on school, work, winter’s likely surge, danger of “lethal inflexibility.” Too soon or an artistic imperative? Fiction writers reflect on the history, power, challenges of stories in which real life is a dominant character. Depression, anxiety, worry, perceived stress, and loneliness measured before infection with COVID-19 were associated with up to 45 percent increased risk of developing long COVID. MGH, Broad researchers develop Big Data tool that can predict which COVID variants will likely become dominant. Those who experienced discrimination early in the pandemic had increased odds of moderate to severe depression and suicidal ideation, compared to those who reported no discrimination. Reductions in surgical procedures precipitated by SARS-CoV-2 have not fully returned to their pre-pandemic levels, resulting in severe backlogs and deferred surgeries. Traffic stats show that roadway deaths spiked during the pandemic. Can it be that we were not only distracted and frustrated, but also out of practice? Marianna Yang, a clinical instructor at the Family and Domestic Violence Law Clinic at WilmerHale Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School, discusses the rise of domestic violence during the pandemic. As studies signal serious health consequences, specialists scramble to treat acute cases and reinforce limits that define moderate use. For Harvard student Phiroze Parasnis and his family, isolated in Mumbai, time spent together made up for lost time. Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Professor William Hanage explains how to stay on guard against subvariants, noting role of protective measures in transition to new pandemic phase. Anastasia Onyango, her nurse mother, rising first-year sister wrestled with COVID anxieties, cabin fever, reckoning over race — and brother’s board games. Before COVID, a cancer diagnosis. Here’s how one Harvard student and his family grew closer even as the world seemed to come apart. Harvard scientists give their read on recent COVID data from the U.S. and South Africa. Coronavirus Advisory Group cites low campus rates of severe illness, hospitalizations, and a shift in pandemic phase. Psychiatric epidemiologist warns crisis too recent for conclusive results but shares some surprising, troubling early indications. Harvard experts say loneliness, isolation raise risk of depression, anxiety, heart ills. Scientists conducted a simulation study that projected the future of the COVID-19 pandemic in every state. Subvariant is rising in the region, but no sign of dramatic surge in cases that other nations have experienced. Experts trying to unravel why patients who recover from COVID-19 find they still have brain fog as part of their long COVID experience. Researchers have learned that nerve damage experienced by some long COVID patients may be caused by infection-triggered immune dysfunction, which is potentially treatable.

El Planeta Noticias en español desde Boston, Massachusetts Por Irene Sarabia M. | El Tiempo Latino Nike, el gigante de la ropa deportiva, conmemora el Mes de la Herencia Latina con el lanzamiento de una colección exclusiva de zapatillas. Las nuevas Air Max 1 ‘Familia’, la última creación de Nike, siguen al éxito de las ‘Puerto Rico’ lanzadas en junio para coincidir con el Desfile Nacional del Día de Puerto Rico. Mantente informado con los temas más relevantes de política, economía, comunidad latina y salud. Suscríbete aquí a nuestros newsletters. La edición especial del Mes de la Herencia Hispana muestra un lienzo de colores dinámicos, encarnando la naturaleza enérgica y festiva de la comunidad latinoamericana. La revista GQ, en su reseña del próximo lanzamiento, previsto para el 15 de septiembre, coincidiendo con el inicio del Mes de la Herencia Hispana, llama la atención sobre la llamativa base de piel «Sanddrift» de la zapatilla. Esta base neutra contrasta con los atrevidos detalles en amarillo y los ribetes en rojo intenso. El diseño de la zapatilla se realza aún más con elementos de pana verde y ante rosa que cubren la zona del guardabarros y se extienden hacia el Swoosh y el talón. La edición Air Max 1 LHM incluye las inscripciones «Nike Air Max» y «Familia ’23» en las etiquetas de la lengüeta de las zapatillas izquierda y derecha respectivamente, y la plantilla presenta una paleta de colores tan viva como el exterior de la zapatilla. Esta edición limitada va más allá de un par de zapatillas. Se complementa con una caja de zapatos única, decorada en colores vibrantes, e incluye cordones y otros accesorios exclusivos. Además, las Air Max 1 ‘Familia’ no son sólo un homenaje al Mes de la Herencia Hispana. También rinde homenaje al Día de los Muertos, una festividad que se celebra a principios de noviembre para recordar y honrar a los que ya no están. Aunque el Día de los Muertos se celebra principalmente en México, también se celebra en otros países como Ecuador, Guatemala, Filipinas, El Salvador, Brasil y España. Aún no se ha revelado el precio oficial de la edición del Mes de la Herencia Hispana, pero se prevé que su precio de venta al público sea de unos 120 euros.

Spectacular Bridges To Grace Stamps The U.S. Postal Service issued four new Presorted First-Class Mail stamps featuring striking photographs of bridges. The structures range from modern to historic, pedestrian to car-carrying, and all are important landmarks in their communities. The Bridges stamps are intended for business mail users and are sold in self-adhesive coils of 3,000 and 10,000. Use of these stamps requires a special permit and a minimum quantity of 500 letters. The stamp art features four bridges completed between 1938 and 2022: the multi-span steel through arch Arrigoni Bridge connecting the Connecticut municipalities of Middletown and Portland; the S-curved cable-stayed Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge between Council Bluffs, IA, and Omaha, NE; the steel truss Skydance Bridge topped by a public sculpture in Oklahoma City; and the basket-handle twin arch Iowa-Illinois Memorial Bridge connecting Bettendorf, IA, and Moline, IL. Bridges are among the oldest structures created by humans. In ancient times, simple slabs of stone spanned slow moving rivers. And in modern times, concrete and steel are used to cover vast distances. While the materials and designs have evolved from utilitarian structures to engineering marvels, bridges remain integral parts of American life, with over 600,000 bridges in the United States. The construction of bridges is a way to reinvigorate communities economically as well as create landmarks of regional pride. Many modern bridges are designed for use by cyclists and pedestrians as well as motorists, capturing the imagination of human possibility. Whether simply improving transit or vibrantly lighting the night with color-changing light displays, bridges remain vital connectors drawing together people, cities and the nation. Ethel Kessler, an art director for USPS, used existing photographs to design these stamps. Sept. is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month September is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, a crucial time to raise awareness, remove stigmas, and provide education about suicide. Having conversations about suicide is important because it reduces the stigma associated with the topic. By allowing for more open and honest communication, individuals with suicidal ideations can feel more empowered to seek help and are less likely to feel alone. Currently, suicide is the 11th leading cause of death in the United States. For ages 10-44, suicide is the second leading cause of death. Anyone can participate in Suicide Prevention Awareness Month. There are activities that individuals, schools, offices, churches, and all types of organizations can conduct to bring awareness to suicide prevention. Visit www.jasonfoundation.com to download our Suicide Prevention Awareness Month Informational Packet. Look for Suicide Prevention Month under the How to Get Involved tab. Within the packet, there are ideas on how businesses, schools, religious institutions, athletic organizations, and even your family can become involved in spreading the message of suicide prevention.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 8:53 pm ANDOVER — The 13th annual Run for the Troops 5K was a lot like the first-ever event created by Bill Pennington in 2011. Just over 1,600 runners and walkers, including 170 military veterans, participated in the annual 3.1-mile event Sunday. “The excitement was over the top, maybe the best ever, like our first-ever race,” Pennington recalled. “We had heroes all over the place, including four veterans in their 80s, like John Doherty, who had four Purple Hearts from injuries he suffered in Vietnam. We had the color guard. We had young people from Junior ROTC holding flags and cheering on runners and walkers throughout the course. “We finally are getting back to our pre-COVID numbers and you could tell,” he said. “This was the best we’ve ever had. A day later and I’m still emotional.” The race helped put the event over $700,000 in proceeds that go toward veteran-related activities, programs, and in some cases, homes. Pennington noted that it’s not only those in the military who make sacrifices. Families do, too, and they were well-represented at the dinner Saturday night, which sold out in early August, and at the race Sunday. “You have to also remember the families because they also serve indirectly. When their significant others and parents are away serving, they run the house,” said Pennington, the son of two veterans. “In some ways, they serve too.” The proceeds raised will help veterans at Ironstone Farm, Homeland Heroes and Run to Home Base. “Our vets deserve to be treated with dignity and respect,” Pennington said. “It’s not just giving things away. It’s have a pizza and beer night. It’s hosting vets at a golf course. These kinds of things mean the world to our heroes. As long as I’m around, I’m going to make sure they get what they deserve.” Gold Star mother Robin Abbott, who lost her son to suicide, spoke at the dinner Saturday.

for the council on aging, as well as the town’s renewed focus on developing affordable housing. But for a short time this summer, other stories took a back seat to a troubling racial incident that captured the attention of the town and region. A 14-year-old teen was indicted by a Barnstable County grand jury for attempted murder on Aug. 31 for a July 19 incident at Goose Pond. The boy, who is white, was alleged to have tried to drown another teen, who is Black, while both the indicted teen and another boy uttered racial taunts. The boy, who had attended Monomoy High School before moving to Florida sometime after the alleged incident, pleaded not guilty to the charges and was initially held before being released to his family. The alleged incident touched off a discussion of racial issues both in town and beyond, with some noting how it highlighted behavior that often goes under the radar. Local human rights organizations as well as social justice organizations weighed in and vowed to work toward healing within the community. The failure to find a new home for the council on aging bookended the year. The proposal to build a new center for active living — the rebranded senior center — at 1610 Main St. in West Chatham came back before voters at the May annual town meeting after failing to get the necessary two-thirds majority in 2021. Construction of the $10.6 million, 10,965-square-foot facility drew controversy on several fronts; some opposed it because the land was being donated by developer William Marsh, others criticized it for being too large and too expensive. COA advocates pointed to the existing center for active living on Stepping Stones Road as being inadequate for the agency’s needs as well as its structural and space problems. When it came to the vote, the measure failed to reach the two-thirds threshold by a single vote. A revote that same night had, remarkably, the same result. A subsequent ballot question to approve borrowing of the funds for the facility won voters approval, leading advocates to keep the proposal alive. A special town meeting was called for September, and the plans for the facility were retooled, adding space for an emergency warming session. The price tag also went up to $11 million. Although it drew the highest town meeting turnout in Chatham history — 1,395 voters showed up at Monomoy Middle School, forcing Moderator William Litchfield to split the crowd between three rooms — it wasn’t enough. The proposal once again lost due to the need for a two-thirds majority, this time falling 105 votes short. Proponents were disappointed, to say the least, but vowed to move forward with finding a way to provide a viable space for the COA and the town’s seniors. In November, the select board authorized Town Manager Jill Goldsmith to hire a consultant to conduct a structural analysis of the current center for active living and provide a cost estimate for addressing deficiencies as a first step toward figuring out how to proceed. If there was another theme to the year, it was affordable housing: the lack of it and efforts by the town to get three major housing projects underway. Several forums were held to start the planning process for two parcels, on Route 137 in South Chatham and Route 28 in West Chatham. Residents commented on different scenarios for the number and type of units as well as the building style. Members of the select board expressed a desire for each site to host at least 25 units, preferably more, in a mix of income-restricted affordable housing as well as “attainable” or workforce housing. Near the end of the year, the affordable housing trust board agreed to buy another parcel to add to the land along Route 28, increasing the number of units that could be built in that location. The select board also agreed to pursue affordable housing on former school department land along Stepping Stones Road and hired a consultant to come up with options for housing on the former water department property on Old Harbor Road. In other news, the May annual town meeting — the one that rejected the COA facility — was the first at which electronic voting was used. The system was not without its glitches, but most agreed that the quick results shown on a screen to all helped with transparency and efficiency. The town completed a major renovation of the south jog area of the municipal fish pier, including new walkways to improve pedestrian safety at the town’s most popular tourist attraction. Delays occurred when crews ran into an unknown obstruction which prevented a section of bulkhead from being driven as far underground as other sections. In a break from tradition, the select board authorized the police department to leave paper parking tickets in the past and begin issuing tickets electronically beginning in 2024. For the first time last summer, a team of community service officers patrolled downtown, helping with traffic and parking enforcement and working with merchants. St. Christopher’s Episcopal Church established an emergency shelter at the Main Street house of worship to keep both parishioners and residents warm in the event of a long-term power outage. The tall ship Lynx paid a visit to Stage Harbor, and with sadness, officials announced that an iconic tree in front of the Eldredge Public Library will be removed as part of an accessibility upgrade. The town implemented regulations governing short-term rentals as concern grew that investors were snatching up homes in order to cash in on the lucrative summer rental market. Chatham received national attention after former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson passed away in his Chathamport home. He had a long connection to the Cape, including playing in the Cape Cod Baseball League as a college student, and made many friends locally during his time in town. An August report confirmed what most of us know: the Cape, including Chatham, is a great white shark hotspot. Shark researchers continued their weekly expeditions out of Chatham, tagging 34 great white sharks during 22 trips from July to October. Since Dr. Greg Skomal and his team began tagging white sharks off the Cape, a total of 304 individual sharks have been tagged, according to the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy. Finally, Netflix commandeered a Chathamport neighborhood and space at the Northport Plaza for filming of a six-episode mini-series based on Erin Hildebrand’s novel “The Perfect Couple.” Set on Nantucket, the show included Nicole Kidman, Liev Schreiber and Isabelle Adjani. Much of the filming took place at an Eastward Point estate, while space at the plaza was converted to resemble the Nantucket Police Station. There was little interaction with the local community, although many local businesses benefited from the production. Filming was halted in June when members of the striking Writer’s Guild of America picketed the locations, shutting down production. A release date for the show has yet to be announced.

situations on the Island. For example, I had a hard freeze over last weekend while a house less than a half-mile away did not. My friend Sharlee, who lives on Chappy, is always either ahead or behind me with temperature and rainfall. I tend to make up reasons but really have no idea. I have a fully-blooming forsythia. It’s especially odd in that it has all its leaves. In the spring, the flowers appear on the bare branches. Again, I struggle to find the cause of this quirk. People, please rethink any decision to put rosa rugosa on your property unless you actually live at the beach. At a job site recently, I spent some time cutting them to the quick. They looked ghastly. Sadly, they will be back next spring, stronger than ever. I spent the evening trying to remove the invisible thorns from my fingers. Sigh! At the hospital, take the left road to Oak Bluffs. You can avoid the strange cut-out on the right. You will be rewarded by seeing a small house with a purple door flanked by two bright red burning bushes. I know they are invasive and should not be planted but they certainly make a statement at this time of year! At the old Marjorie Rogers property on Indian Hill Road, there are several large white geese. On Tuesday I drove past and every one was resting with its head tucked under a wing. It’s time to once again share my favorite palindrome: Do Geese See God. Often I use vinca in window boxes and ornamental pots. They always come back. I had the not-so-bright idea to put a few in the garden several years ago. Words fail me to describe what happened. They took over a huge area, covering all the existing plants, several inches above everything else. This is because I have a problem with saving anything that has the slightest potential for life. When I was born, seven of my eight great-grandparents were alive. I remember six of them. My grandfather’s parents lived with them the entire time my mother grew up. Great-grandmother Mum was quite a gardener. During the Depression she had my mother and her four siblings dig a huge root cellar under the house. I remind my children and grandchildren of this when they complain of helping me with some of my harebrained ideas. My two most important kitchen items are the freezer and the crockpot. I like to cook, especially with food I grow. I just don’t like to do it every day. Since I no longer prepare meals for a family, I still make the same amounts. Then single servings can be popped into the freezer, put into a crock pot on low in the morning and voila: dinner awaits after a long day of activities. In the late ‘60s I lived in our nation’s capital, doing my part in the anti-war effort. One time I was hauled into a courtroom. Even in the most rebellious time of my young life, I knew better than to talk smack about the judge. By the way, that judge was John Sirica, who later became known for his role in the Watergate trials. It’s obvious where I am going with this. I cannot decide if Donald Trump thinks he has a strategy or if he is so narcissistic that he thinks he’s right. Hopefully, I will never know what he thinks. Plus, the endless name calling is soooo boring. For his own good he should stop it. Someone could actually get hurt.

detractors liked to rank it, well we hippie ragamuffins devoured it front to back. It spoke our language, the F-laden part included, and it was as underground as the music we toked to. But we soon realized, as the paper’s circulation rapidly doubled and tripled, that there were more of us than we thought. The Valley Advocate, reflective of our attitudes on music, nukes, race, global warming and Nixon, Nixon, Nixon, had an audience. Our paper had arrived. They were copy editors, Geoff Robinson and Ed Matys, both in their early 20s, putting out the Hartford Courant five nights a week, grousing over what a conventional daily paper covers and what it does not. “Classic example,” said Linda Matys O’Connell, who was married to Ed Matys at the time. “Ed calls me. The paper sent a reporter to cover the anti-nuke protests at the Millstone plant. But the edited story ended up with no quotes from the protesters, only officials and a spokesman for an opposing group. That was it right there.” “We had no idea that the Boston Phoenix or the Village Voice existed,” said Geoff Robinson. “Then my sister at Cal Berkeley sent me a copy of the San Francisco Bay Guardian — ‘Did you ever see anything like this?’ — I was blown away, so was Ed. Over that winter of ’72-’73 we just decided to give it a go and break out of the daily.” Robinson, and Ed and Linda Matys each kicked in $1,500. “The odds were that it’d go belly up and we’d figure what to do next.” They found digs in Amherst. “320 North Pleasant, in the basement of good old Bob Brown’s insurance agency,” said Robinson. “By basement, we mean basement, no windows, no air, desks all squeezed together. And it’s not like we hopped onto the computer and started typing — we were still working with hot lead and setting lines of type.” That late spring and summer found the pair scouring for equipment and advertisers while Linda held down a job at UMass to keep things afloat. “Soon as I got out of work I was down in the basement, the Orifice, as we called it, all the time writing stories,” said Matys O’Connell. “I love it!” cried the late Steve Vogel, owner of Faces of the Earth, the iconic shop of quirkiness once tucked away in the center of Amherst, behind Ren’s Mobil. “I’m on board!” “After that it just came flowing into us,” said Robinson. “We’re thinking, sell this many ads, we can hire, expand and pay the phone bill.” Naming the thing took some time. “We came from traditional newspaper backgrounds,” said Robinson, “we knew all the daily names, the Journal, the Courier. We wanted it to have meaning — to go out there and state a case and try to advance a principle. We were fighting for gay rights and advocating for transparency.” The “Valley” part, on the other hand, came as a sign. “No one we knew referred to this place as the Valley,” said Robinson. “Then we saw this road sign, Route 2, I think: Entering the Pioneer Valley. We had no idea. Nobody had heard of it. That’s going to tie the whole thing together with all three counties!” The next brainstorm concerned arts and entertainment listings. “We saw it as a good way to anchor the paper,” said Robinson. “There was a vacancy, especially with live music. There was no such thing as a calendar — you had posters on light posts.” STAFF PHOTO/CAROL LOLLISValley Advocate co-founder, Geoffrey Robinson, talks at his home in Montague about the early days of the paper. The first office was in Amherst: “320 North Pleasant, in the basement of good old Bob Brown’s insurance agency,” said Robinson. “By basement, we mean basement, no windows, no air, desks all squeezed together. And it’s not like we hopped onto the computer and started typing — we were still working with hot lead and setting lines of type.” The paper would hit newsstands on Thursdays, giving readers ample time to choose a good night out. Open to the “Beer n’ Boogie” pages in ’73 and you’d be flipping heads or tails: NRBQ at the Rusty Nail, Ed Vadas at the Zodiac Lounge, Fat at the Hideway, Clean Living at the Crazy Horse Club, Randy Newnan, Chick Corea and Donovan, yes, Donovan at the Sanderson Theatre. And for the whole family: “Room of Chains” and “Teenage Tramp” at the Red Rock Drive-In. Robinson’s brother, a calligrapher, designed the logo, and out went the Valley Advocate, “The Alternative in the Pioneer Valley,” September 19, 1973 — to college campuses and selected retail outlets, not to mention a bundle of 50 for Faces of the Earth. People soon figured out where you could grab the Advocate. To have the original 1973 issue in your hand is to be astounded by the size of it, like Moses with the Ten Commandments, coupled with the itty-bitty type required to fit a ton of fully reported long-form copy into its 24 pages. No wonder we all need glasses now. Its cover story on Michael Metelica and the demise of the Brotherhood of the Spirit commune in Leyden has the legendary self-promoter decreeing that all commune members find employment. Half of them fled. When the Brotherhood and all its holdings were attempting to ease its way into Turners Falls, the resistance from town officials — who may or may not have read “Helter Skelter” — was rife with roadblocks. But later, when Northeast Utilities targeted Montague as an ideal location for a nuclear power plant, most of the town’s then 900 residents, according to Dorothea Katzenstein’s article, thought it was great — the tax base alone! “There’s nothing to worry about,” said one elected official, quelling any concern over accidents and radiation releases. “They wouldn’t build ‘em if they weren’t safe.” STAFF PHOTO/CAROL LOLLISThe cover of the first issue of the Valley Advocate, “The Alternative in the Pioneer Valley,” September 19, 1973. Then the power company erected a 550-foot weather tower to test wind direction if there were such a leak, which compelled Sam Lovejoy of the Montague Farm Commune to fell the thing with a crowbar and turn himself in to police. The Advocate gave the trial full coverage: “Jury selection took a day and a half. At least a quarter of the people interviewed worked for the power company, had relatives who worked for it, or owned stock in it.” Advocate reporters did not shy away from editorializing in news stories, a thing discouraged in conventional dailies. Wrote Don St. Pierre: “At one time (Montague) was a busting mill town complete with canals, child labor and a bar at every corner … what’s left is a group of people ready to take the first thing that’s offered.” Other voices, like the Union of Concerned Scientists, sited waste disposal and expensive breakdowns associated with the plants, and people leaned in and paid attention (environmentalists were only just beginning to gain credibility in 1974). From Harvey Wasserman’s coverage: “If Lovejoy is found innocent (he was) it must be interpreted as a loosening of the legal boundaries on civil disobedience in general and on nuclear power plants in particular.” “We had a No Nukes movement before you knew it,” said Robinson, “emanating from here.” Those in power began to take the Advocate seriously. One headline sticks in Robinson’s mind 40 years later: “‘45 Minutes to Kill.’ Springfield cops had a man in custody and took 45 minutes to get him to a hospital where he died. Talk about shock waves. I can’t say that’s when things changed in the Springfield PD, but it got traction on the issue.” In the paper’s two-bit Ads department, meanwhile: “No Nukes bumper stickers — Box 30, Montague.” ‘These were not even issues on anyone’s horizon,” said Robinson, paging through a bound copy of year one. “Women’s rights are taken for granted now but we were putting that in front of people — rent discrimination, child care, shelters.” In a ’73 story about a shakeup in area rental practices, especially the discrimination of single women, one landlord wondered: “Why aren’t they home with their parents?” Another, thinking of women as helpless, rented only to married couples for upkeep purposes — “Who’s gonna shovel and mow?” Like many of the Advocate scribes initially hired, journalism was a learn-as-you-go proposition, peppered with a 1960s skepticism. “I didn’t even know what a byline was,” laughed Chip Ainsworth, who had a sports and general assignment beat for years. “The brainstorming sessions were amazing — we’re pitching stories no one would touch.

'version': '2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'By Peter Chianca One thing you can say about Boston.com readers: They have diverse tastes. Among the list of most-read stories on the site from 2023, you’ll find breaking news, in-depth features, sports, travel, celebrity news, and even a national story or two. Plus at least one article about rotisserie chickens. Check out the top 20 below: 1. “At this Mass. house, trick-or-treaters could choose between a full-size candy bar or Market Basket rotisserie chicken.” Yes, there was actual news that happened this year. But what Boston.com readers were really looking for was a feel-good Halloween story that also happened to involve Market Basket, and (checks notes) rotisserie chickens. And this Nov. 2 story by Heather Alterisio fit the bill on all counts. 2. “Live updates: Tracking the Ana Walshe case.” One of several high-profile crime stories we covered this year — Lindsay Clancy and Karen Read would be two of the others — our ongoing updates on the murder case against Brian Walshe (he of the unfortunate Google searches), along with a summary of initial reports and a timeline of the case, garnered the most attention from readers in 2023. 3. “Kristen Bell, Dax Shepard respond to backlash over Logan Airport Instagram posts.” Celebrities, they’re just like us: They spend $600 on makeshift beds after getting stuck at Logan Airport before getting kicked out by airport staff, and then post on Instagram about it. At least that’s what happened to Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard — and then they had to respond to all the people complaining about the posts. 4. “Here’s what AccuWeather says New England can expect for winter 2023-2024.” Clearly concerned that global warming may have eliminated snow altogether, readers flocked to October’s annual forecast from AccuWeather (who, for what it’s worth, predicted possible “hefty snowfall amounts” in January and February). Also popular: Reports on predictions from the Farmers’ Almanac and the other Farmer’s Almanac. 5. “Boston.com readers share why they aren’t going to Cape Cod this year.” Readers were more than willing to share — and other readers were more than willing to read — their reasons for eschewing Cape vacations these days. (Many of which could be summed up by the Yogi Berra quote, “Nobody goes there anymore. It’s too crowded.”) 6. “A Mass. campground is adding luxury cabins, a water park in 2023.” Being the world travelers that they are, Boston.com readers always seem to be on the lookout for new additions to their favorite travel destinations — and this story by Kristi Palma about a popular local campground particularly struck a nerve among the camping contingent. (If you want to find out which campground it was, click the link!) 7. “Tom Brady has a message for Deion Sanders’s son after Colorado’s upset win over TCU.” Tom Brady — why can’t we quit him? He hasn’t played for the Patriots since 2019, but Boston.com readers can’t get enough of the GOAT. (And in their defense, we keep writing about him.) This story by Khari Thompson, about Brady’s praise for pro football and baseball wunderkind turned college coach Deion Sanders and his progeny, was the most-read sports story this year. 8. “Live updates: Massachusetts reacts to Israel-Hamas war.” It’s a global conflict, but with far-reaching effects that stretch all the way into Massachusetts — as evidenced by the protests, marches, outcries, and other developments covered by our ongoing local look into the repercussions of the Israel-Hamas war. 9 “Why do some New Englanders call sprinkles ‘jimmies’?” For our ongoing “Wickedpedia” feature — “Your unserious questions, seriously answered” — we answered a lot of unserious questions in 2023, but the one that drew the most attention involved those little bits of candy sprinkled atop ice cream in New England and thereabouts. (One finding from Abby Patkin’s story: The term is not racist, thankfully.) 10. “Mac Jones reportedly asked for outside help and an angry Bill Belichick addressed him.” Khari Thompson’s trouble-in-paradise tale involving now-erstwhile Pats quarterback Mac Jones and his grumpy coach came out all the way back in January, which probably should have given us a clue that things might not go swimmingly for the team this year. 11. “Boston Public Library shares list of its 10 most borrowed books in 2022.” It warms our hearts to think that something as quaint as a list of borrowed books would be so popular as to make our list of most-read stories, but sure enough it did. (And the top book even had “library” in the title. That’s not suspicious at all.) The BPL released its 2023 list early this year, so you can see that one here. 12. “Tom Brady unretiring again? NFL commentator suggests TB12 could join a Patriots AFC East foe.” Remember what we said about Tom Brady back in No. 7? Well, here we go again. (Also, in case you were wondering: He did not unretire again.) 13. “Report: Jayson Tatum held players-only meeting to address Jrue Holiday trade.” See, Boston.com’s sports-fan readers don’t just care about what Tom Brady had for breakfast. This behind-the-scenes Celtics story from November by Luke Scotchie, about the team grappling with a surplus of potential starters, was a big hit as well. 14. “10 pressing questions facing the Patriots entering the 2023 season.” Regardless of what the questions were in this pre-season story by Conor Ryan from September, we’re pretty sure the answers were “no.” 15. “Over 100 Connecticut state troopers accused of faking traffic stops.” This September story out of neighboring Connecticut, via The New York Times News Service, apparently struck a chord with Boston.com readers who were relieved to see that we’re not the only state with some sketchy state troopers. 16. “Rob Gronkowski’s missed field goal in live Super Bowl commercial left many confused.” Did the kick go in? Did it miss? Do we get any money in free FanDuel bets? Is Rob Gronkowski still retired? So many questions. 17. “Proud Boys’ Enrique Tarrio gets record 22 years in prison for Jan. 6 seditious conspiracy.” There were a bunch of local arrests and prosecutions stemming from the Jan. 6, 2020 Capitol riots — including a couple from Worcester, a former Boston cop, and an Ashland doctor — but it was this national story about the massive prison sentence for a prominent Proud Boy that got the most attention from readers in 2023. 18. “A South Shore man forgot a $3M lottery ticket, and the clerk claimed the prize. Now she and a coworker are facing charges.” You can read this June story by Abby Patkin for the details — they’re fairly complicated, involving a burned ticket, an alleged extortion attempt, a ride to Dorchester, and a bag of chips, not necessarily in that order. 19. “Where does the Boston accent come from?” This Wickedpedia story by Ross Cristantiello from March includes everything you ever (“evah”) wanted to know about the Boston accent but were afraid to ask. Other Wickedpedia topics that made an impression in 2023: “Why is there no Terminal D at Logan Airport?”; “What’s the deal with those Pleasure Island Road signs on Route 128 in Wakefield?”; and “What’s the shortest distance between two Dunkin’s in Mass.?” 20. “White supremacist signs posted in Oak Bluffs under investigation.” Sadly, as evidenced by Katelyn Umholtz’s report on signs apparently placed by “one of the most active hate groups in the region,” even the Vineyard isn’t immune from racists.

I think there will come a time they will lift the ban on the term “genocide” when the term “genocide” will benefit the real power too.

Photo by Kyle Daudelin Photography. By J.D. O’Gara A place children can discover, imagine, and grow, through play and exploration – closer to home. The Children’s Museum of Franklin, an idea sparked by Franklin Moms Erin Gallagher and Meg Hagen, is gaining momentum. The newly approved 501 c3 nonprofit aims to, eventually, secure a permanent location in downtown Franklin. Even without a location, however, the children’s museum is planning a pop-up museum to be held on a bi-weekly basis in the new year in Franklin and surrounding towns. “Once we acquire a permanent space, we’ll build exhibits for children aged 10 and under, with classroom and lab space for additional programming, STEM programming for elementary and middle school-aged kids, and leadership/internship opportunities for high school and college students,” says Hagen. The idea for the children’s museum began, say the founders, as a shared dream. “Meg and I were at a mutual friend’s house for brunch in June, talking about the Davis Thayer location as our original dream location,” says Gallagher, “We laughed about it, but when we left, we said, ‘Let’s really do this.’ Between us, Meg and I have five young kids, all seven years and younger. We are pursuing this with the goal of creating a common space for kids to learn andplay both for our children and their peers—a spot where people can build community and foster connections, and really grow together. Having raised kids, especially through the pandemic, so many of our kids lost out on connection. This is an opportunity to bring that back.” The closest children’s museums, about 45 minutes away, routinely draw patrons from an hour away. A Children’s Museum in the heart of town “would increase the vitality of the downtown and the pull of the community,” says Hagen. Drawing families to “the downtown space would support the local economy and local businesses. We want to give back to the town.” Both women, who’ve previously worked together as founding members of local support group Franklin Area Moms, already make supporting the town a priority. Erin, a mom of three young children with a marketing and communications background, is currently Franklin Area Moms President. She also serves on the Franklin School Committee, is a member of the Franklin Master Plan Committee and is a volunteer foster care case reviewer for the Department of Children and Families. Meg, a native of Raynham with a doctorate in pharmacy who lived five years abroad in Australia before settling in Franklin, holds a seat on the Franklin Conservation Commission and the Franklin Master Plan Committee. In the last several years, Meg has also taught preschool at the Franklin Children’s School on top of being a mom to two young sons. Facilitating Franklin Area Moms “gave us a sense of running a nonprofit, working with boards, building a network, and building a community,” says Meg, “A lot of our mission and vision includes working in partnership and collaboration throughout the community.” The two have enlisted elementary and early childhood education consultants for their board to design what the children’s museum will look like, as well as an occupational therapist to ensure that space is inclusive for children of all abilities and sensory needs. In their planning process, they’ve sought feedback from various members of Town Council and officials from the Town, Dean College, and Franklin Public Schools. Although exhibit space will be designed for 10 and under, The Children’s Museum of Franklin plans to offer clubs and programming through middle school, perhaps even supplementing an area of need. “School budget issues have come up in one of the areas they had to cut for the time being – the funding for middle school clubs. We would love to be able to offer some programming for those gaps,” says Erin. One of the first programs they’re planning to roll out will be “Lean in Girls,” which aims to empower young girls as they transition from middle school years into high school.. A lack of space isn’t stopping the two. The partners have looked to Tri-county Regional Vocational Technical High School carpentry students to build mobile exhibits for their pop-up Indoor Mobile Museum at different venues around town. “They’re building these really cool car ramps,” says Erin, “The students are really excited that what they’re building is going to make a lasting impact on the community.” The Children’s Museum of Franklin has the following Pop-Up Indoor Mobile Museum events planned, with more to come: • January 21, 2023, Franklin Elks, 1-4 p.m., 1077 Pond St., Franklin • February 10, 2023, Downtown Sports, 3-6 p.m., 240 Cottage St, Franklin • February 19, 2023, Downtown Sports, 9 a.m. – 12 p.m., 240 Cottage St., Franklin Of course, fundraising will be essential to making this dream happen, and the duo have a four-part strategy that includes: • A Founding Families program: Those local families that provide a minimum $1,000 donation will be featured permanently on Children’s Museum of Franklin website and later, in the future permanent space. • Grassroots fundraising: The Children’s Museum will host various fundraising events, such as a gala dinner coming up in late February, early March. • Corporate Fundraising: Hagen and Gallagher will reach out to potential corporate funders. • Grants: Now that the Children’s Museum of Franklin is an official 501 c3 nonprofit, the founders can apply for grants on the state and federal level, as well as to various foundations, depending on the space it finds.

In December 2022, the WBJ Editorial staff made 10 bold predictions for news events to happen in Central Massachusetts throughout the year. Turns out, we missed the mark on all but two. Gannett, the corporate owner of Worcester’s newspaper of record, sold a number of smaller Central Massachusetts publications in 2022. While Gannett doesn’t appear to be too interested in investing into the Telegram & Gazette’s news operations, it didn’t sell the publication either. Regardless of corporate interest, the Telegram’s news content appears to have been reinvigorated under new Executive Editor Michael McDermott. [Related: Check out the WBJ newsroom's predictions for 2024.] After neighbors successfully sued a Hudson warehouse from happening, it appeared the overcrowding and traffic concerns in MetroWest would lead to more developments falling by the wayside. While some may have scrapped their plans quietly, only one publicly fell to NIMBY efforts: 300 proposed apartments off Assabet River Trail in Marlborough. Of the 50 largest employers in the region, six (Waters Corp., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, College of the Holy Cross, Quinsigamond Community College, Community Healthlink, AbbVie, and Digital Federal Credit Union) were led by a person of color at the start of 2023. As of Dec. 18, zero companies joined that elite group, and the president of Community Healthlink resigned, with a successor yet to be named. After years of rapid expansion, the legal marijuana industry faced contraction in 2023. A number of businesses closed operations, such as Trulieve closing Worcester and Framingham operations as it exited the state, and CommCan closing its Southborough dispensary. Despite the contraction, the number of closures never hit 10. Two Central Massachusetts companies – Ascend Elements in Westborough and Aspen Aerogels in Northborough – in 2022 announced plans for nearly $2 billion in investment to serve the EV battery market. While other companies took notice, such as Marlborough laser manufacturer IPG Photonics, this year didn’t bring significantly more entries into the EV market. Two local college presidents did step down in 2023: Fitchburg State University President Richard Lapidus said in October he will resign at the end of the school year. At Nichols College, former President Glenn Sulmasy was forced to resign in October after a CNN investigation uncovered allegations of misconduct when he was previously an instructor at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. The Worcester neighborhood remains in transition in the wake of the Polar Park baseball stadium opening in 2021, with businesses moving in and out, along with properties being bought and sold. While a handful of smaller businesses closed their spaces in the Worcester Public Market, including the high-profile retailer Worcester Wares, the number of closures never reached a dozen. The Framingham and Natick healthcare facilities saw plenty of transitions in 2023, including its CEO resigning after less than six months on the job, but Dallas-based Tenet still owns the facility, where operations appear to have stabilized. In December, the former Worcester location of Smokestack Urban Barbecue was put back on the market, ostensibly ending a planned 375-unit development. This came after the Franklin Lofts development reduced its planned 421-unit complex by 14% and a proposed development at 153 Green St. cut 10 of its units. A number of the other 4,000+ proposed units in various stages of development remain in limbo, as high construction costs and interest rates make financials more uncertain for developers. We initially predicted more labor unions at Starbucks, Amazon facilities, and colleges in the region, expecting they would build off of union efforts at those organizations in 2022. While those didn’t happen, union drives did happen at Planned Parenthood in Marlborough and Worcester, along with Framingham Union Hospital. Stay connected!

Low around 50F. Winds light and variable.. A few passing clouds. Low around 50F. Winds light and variable. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:06 pm Tragedy was averted late Tuesday afternoon when a van crashed into a Hockomock Area YMCA child watch facility, hitting four children with flying glass but not causing more serious injuries, officials said. “The kids were inside playing. It was kind of a light day with not as many kids the day after Christmas. It was kind of a Christmas miracle’,’ Foxboro Fire Chief Michael Kelleher said. There were five children, mostly 5 or younger, inside when the transportation van went from a parking lot through the side of the 67 Mechanic St. building about 4:30 p.m., Kelleher and Police Chief Michael Grace said. The van ran over a bollard post, which is designed to stop vehicles, according to Jim Downs, CEO of the Hockomock Area YMCA. The post jammed underneath the van and prevented it from going further into the building, he said. The crash occurred in an area where parents who are using the YMCA can drop off their children for a few hours or less, said Juri Love, a reporter for The Sun Chronicle and The Foxboro Reporter whose daughter was injured in the incident. Normally, there would be many more children inside the facility but fewer children were there because of Christmas vacation week, officials and a witness said. The 51-year male driver and a passenger in the van were not injured, Grace said. The van is not owned by or affiliated with the YMCA, according to the police chief. The passenger was being taken to the YMCA when the crash occurred, he said. Two of the children were taken to Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, one was taken to Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Providence as a precaution, and one was brought to Sturdy Memorial Hospital in Attleboro. The fire chief said their injuries were minor and not life threatening, and were mostly due to flying glass. Love, a Foxboro resident, had just dropped off her 7-year-old daughter, Jayla Onwuakor, at the child watch center and was in the YMCA lobby when the accident occurred. “It was really loud. It sounded like a gas explosion. The building shook,” Love said in a telephone interview from Sturdy, where her daughter was being treated for cuts. Love said her daughter saw a “flash of light” as the van approached the building and covered her face with her arm to block the glass and prevent shards from getting in her eyes. “I’m so glad the car didn’t hit my daughter,” she said, struggling to contain her emotions. Love said her daughter was coloring at a table and suffered cuts to her arms. After the crash, Love ran toward the child watch center and, when she saw the van, realized it was not an explosion that she heard. “I saw my daughter running toward me. She was shaking,” Love said. “I said ‘call 911, call 911. We need help.’ Everyone was crying and screaming. It was like a war zone,” Love said, adding that the children were bleeding, one from the mouth. The van went almost entirely inside the child watch area, with only the back end and rear wheels outside the building. It came to a stop in an area of children’s tables. The fire chief and police chief praised the YMCA staff for quickly helping the children, giving them first aid prior to the arrival of rescue personnel. “They sprang into action,” Kelleher said. Love said there were two staff members in the child watch area when the crash occurred. She praised them and police and firefighters, who she said arrived at the YMCA about five minutes after the van hit the building. The Sharon Fire Department assisted local firefighters at the scene and took two of the children to Newton-Wellesley Hospital, according to the fire chief. The YMCA closed after the crash and will reopen Wednesday. The area of the crash was surrounded by yellow plastic crime scene tape. The police chief said the cause of the accident has not been determined and that the driver was cooperating with investigators. The cause of the crash was under investigation by local police with the help of state police accident reconstruction experts, Grace said. David Linton may be reached at 508-236-0338.

humanitarian consequences and relief efforts, based on Lillian Avedian’s on-the-ground reporting from Armenia in October 2023. On Mike’s first day of preschool, Azerbaijani soldiers attacked his village in Artsakh. Mike was born just after the end of the 44-day war in Artsakh in the fall of 2020. His parents did not know if they should celebrate his arrival as a miracle in the aftermath of war or grieve the birth of their first son, who one day might join the thousands of Armenian soldiers killed that autumn. On September 19, 2023, Mike and his classmates were woken up from their afternoon nap time by Azerbaijani shelling near Berdashen village in the Martuni district of Artsakh. The teachers did not have time to change the children out of their pajamas before rushing them to a bunker. Mike’s mom Sirun, a 37-year-old history teacher at the local school, was escorting her students to a bunker. Yet her own children consumed her fear. Twice she started to run to the preschool building, but the principal stopped her. When the shelling started, Sirun’s mother-in-law, 76-year-old Svetlana, stuck her head out of the window of their home and screamed her grandchildren’s names between sobs. Her son beseeched her to go to a bunker, but she refused. She walked around the village for three hours searching for her grandkids. The bombardment was in closer proximity to Berdashen than any attacks the family had witnessed during the 2020 war. The sound of the first shell knocked one of Svetlana’s grandchildren off her feet. I met the family in Armenia three weeks after the attack. Mike and his two sisters had just started to talk again, after the shelling had stunned them into weeks of silence. “Everyone was surprised I named him Mike,” Sirun told me. “They said I should have given him an Armenian name like Tigran, one of our Armenian kings. Maybe my heart knew I would go abroad, leave Artsakh for another country.” On September 19, Azerbaijan launched a full-scale military offensive on Artsakh, or Nagorno-Karabakh. The Artsakh Defense Army, which did not have the military support of Armenia, was outgunned and outnumbered by the Azerbaijani forces. After 24 hours of intense fighting and shelling, which caused widespread destruction to civilian homes and settlements, the de facto Armenian authorities of Artsakh signed a Russian-brokered ceasefire agreement with Azerbaijan, under which they agreed to disband and disarm the Artsakh Defense Army. A week later, they announced the dissolution of all state institutions, which had governed Artsakh since Armenia’s victory in the first Artsakh War in the 1990s, by January 1, 2024. At least 200 Artsakh soldiers and two dozen civilians were killed in the offensive. The attack came after a near 10-month blockade imposed on Artsakh by Azerbaijan, which created severe shortages of food, medicine, hygiene products and other basic necessities and precipitated a humanitarian crisis for the region’s Armenian population. In the days following Artsakh’s surrender, over 100,000 Armenians fled from Artsakh to seek refuge in Armenia. Only a few dozen Armenians remain in Artsakh, according to Artsakh officials. During his visit to an emptied Stepanakert, Artsakh’s capital, on October 15, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said that Azerbaijan “got our lands back, restored our territorial integrity and at the same time restored our dignity.” “Their goal was ethnic cleansing. Just like Talaat Pasha said from the beginning, we will leave behind one Armenian, and only in a museum,” Sirun said, referring to the Ottoman leader and one of the architects of the Armenian Genocide that started in 1915. Sirun thinks of the Azerbaijani attack differently. She calls it ethnic cleansing. “Their goal was ethnic cleansing. Just like Talaat Pasha said from the beginning, we will leave behind one Armenian, and only in a museum,” Sirun said, referring to the Ottoman leader and one of the architects of the Armenian Genocide that started in 1915. Sirun is eloquent and well-read. She oscillates between rage over the failure of the international community and Armenian leadership to protect Artsakh and detached political analysis. Berdashen is one of many Artsakh villages that was encircled by Azerbaijani soldiers from September 19-24, making it impossible to evacuate their local populations. The villages were completely cut off from access to electricity, food and medicine, leaving their residents in the dark, both literally and figuratively, as they could not communicate with other villages and towns in Artsakh or receive information from the authorities. For four nights, Sirun’s family sat indoors with the lights shut off. The residents of towns and villages outside of the capital that were not blockaded by Azerbaijani soldiers were evacuated to the base of the Russian peacekeeping mission in Artsakh, which operated out of the Stepanakert airport. There was little food or water at the airport. The Russian peacekeepers offered some bread that had been delivered from Azerbaijan, yet many people refused to eat it. “They kill our children, and then we eat their bread?” one woman told me. “It’s better to go hungry than eat their flour. Didn’t we endure for nine months?” She’s the 36-year-old mother of teenagers Babken and Ani. She and her family spent four days at the airport. They slept in their car at night, because the airport was so crowded, there was no room to lie down. “You couldn’t breathe. I was suffocating,” she said. Two of her nephews died in the September 19 attack. 19-year-old Arsen was killed in the shelling. The doctors amputated both of his legs, yet two hours later he died in the hospital. Arsen’s cousin, who got married two months ago, was also killed. “He was a beautiful boy,” she said, showing me a picture of Arsen in a soldier’s uniform on Facebook. His face was youthful but stern. “If a dog had been in our place, it would have died. It was unbearable,” another woman told me, who stayed at the airport for two days with her kids, Sashka and Agnessa. They wailed the whole time along with the other children. They are still frightened by loud noises, reminiscent of bombs. In Stepanakert, residents watched the influx of people into the city and waited. 62-year-old Susanna made cheese from some milk on an outdoor wood stove to distribute to kids in the bunkers. Her niece Mariam, who is 26, walked through the streets beneath the shelling to find her neighbors’ kids and take them to safety. Mariam has already lived through three wars in her young life. Two of her classmates and one of her cousins died serving in the 44-day war in 2020. She talks about war calmly, as if it is an unremarkable topic of conversation. “We’re used to bombings. We’ve adapted to everything,” Susanna said. A year after Mariam’s cousin was killed in the 2020 war, her family removed his body from his grave in Artsakh and transported it to Yerablur, the military cemetery in Yerevan, Armenia. His mom worried that Azerbaijani forces could destroy his grave in case of the outbreak of a new war. Susanna related her family’s losses without agitation, yet when she spoke about abandoning her mother’s gravestone in Artsakh, she wept. Her mom passed away two years ago. During the 44-day war, Susanna took her mother, who at the time was aging and ailing, to Armenia. “When we returned to Artsakh, my mom said to me, Susanna, please don’t leave me alone. I responded, what are you talking about? Now, I’ve realized this is what she was talking about,” Susanna said. “There was hope at the time that we would return,” Susanna added, referring to the 44-day war. “We’ll go back one day. There’s hope,” Mariam assured. “We’ll go back,” Mariam’s mom Mary repeated, mocking and incredulous. “God willing. Our houses, our graves. I don’t think about the homes as much as the graves,” Susanna said. “They’ll destroy them. They’ll flatten the graves.” Since the fall of Artsakh, experts have warned that Azerbaijan will likely destroy Armenian cultural heritage in Artsakh, in efforts to eliminate evidence of ancient Armenian presence and sever Armenians’ connection to the land. In Nakhichevan, Azerbaijan’s exclave, Azerbaijan engaged in systemic destruction of the region’s Armenian cultural heritage over the past three decades, demolishing 90 medieval churches, 5,840 cross-stones and 22,000 tombstones. Sirun never envisioned that her family would leave Artsakh. Even in the days following Azerbaijan’s attack, when they “weren’t alive,” in Sirun’s words, they baked lavash bread for the coming weeks. During the near 10-month blockade, they had stored vegetable preserves in preparation for the winter. “Berdashen is a beautiful village. Our village’s story dates back to the seventh century. We have a statue that is like Mother Armenia, holding a branch that symbolizes freedom and independence,” she said with pride tinged with longing.

This word would probably be a fitting description for the cannabis industry in general during 2023 and don’t expect that chaos to dissipate in 2024. The September suspension of chair Shannon O’Brien at the industry regulator Cannabis Control Commission and the subsequent lawsuit she filed have rocked the state’s marijuana industry. With executive director Shawn Collins resigning in December and rumors swirling about more key departures from the agency, 2024 is shaping up to be either the year that the commission rights itself, or the year that state lawmakers intervene with reforms or more oversight. Hundreds of local cannabis industry workers lost their jobs in 2023, and companies who provide services to canna-businesses have struggled to collect payments. Municipalities have become more reliant on taxes and other revenue raised from cannabis businesses. As more cannabis companies struggle with crashing prices and oversaturation, don’t expect the fallout to be confined to just business owners. Every state bordering Massachusetts – except New Hampshire – has legalized cannabis for adult use, eliminating the need for out-of-state consumers to travel to the Bay State to their marijuana. New state markets aren't the only threats to the profits of local cannabis business owners: Changes to federal laws have allowed manufacturers to extract THC from federally legal hemp plants and sell intoxicating products across state lines, undermining the state’s control of the cannabis economy.

As per a recent Bankrate survey, almost half of all U.S. adults (48 %) say they have enough emergency savings to cover three months’ worth of expenses, while a majority (57%) are uncomfortable with their current level of emergency savings. More than a third (36%) of Americans have more credit card debt than emergency savings – the highest level not seen since 2011. In recent decades, media pundits and personal finance gurus like Dave Ramsey have educated the public on how to crawl out of debt sinkholes and rebuild their lives. Some debate Ramsey’s relevance to younger generations today, arguing his recommendations need updating to stay feasible with current living costs. Yet some advisors find timeless value in his approach. “There are several good components to the Ramsey Baby Steps formula, and step two is to pay debts off via the snowball method,” says Jen Swindler, CFP, AFC, Senior Wealth Manager at Vincere Wealth Management. “I almost always recommend the avalanche method – highest interest rate first, rather than the smallest balance first, because the cost savings can be astronomical. However, there are cases where the snowball approach works better for certain clients.” Behind The Wheel Cars are one product that can drive up debt levels for consumers. According to data from the New York Fed, auto loan debt is the third largest debt type for American households, behind mortgages and student loans. Although car prices this year have retreated somewhat from last year’s dizzying highs, they are still much more expensive than before the pandemic. Most consumers need to borrow to buy a vehicle. Strategies like the 20/4/10 Rule can streamline car debt. The idea is a 20% down payment, take only four years to pay off the car loan, and keep car costs to less than 10% of monthly income. The framework offers guardrails for purchasing vehicles, and can be helpful to ensure you ‘drive within your means.’ “Cars have become ludicrously expensive… However, you don’t need a brand-new Bronco to get to work,” says Verring. “The 20/4/10 rule is a great starting point but isn’t always possible for some.” Going Deeper Debt strategies to pay down one’s debt often take the form of a numbers game. Start small, start big; at the end of the day, you have to pay it off to make it go away. Yet, sometimes the roots of the problem go much deeper or go beyond the individual. “Debt is as much a sociological problem as it is financial,” says Vering. “People finance lifestyles they can’t afford with debt. Until we temper the cultural fixation with flaunting the bank’s money this problem is not going away.” It’s also important to remember that not all forms of debt are negative. While all forms of debt act as liabilities in the short term, those allow the borrower to eventually acquire assets can be constructive in the long run. “One should think about debt as an instrument to ultimately create more wealth for themselves. For example, building equity in a home using a mortgage,” Herring says. Debt is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that goes beyond the pure realm of finance and into behavioral psychology, sociology and others. This makes debt an interesting phenomenon to study and may act as a research topic for those who are interested in pursuing finance as a career. Yet for the average Joe, it is about the dollars and cents of everyday living and monthly budgets. By keeping informed and being ready with some appropriate strategies, individuals can go far to keep the debt-collector wolves from the door.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:11 pm NEWBURYPORT — Days after what was called a cyberattack shut down Anna Jaques Hospital’s health record system on Christmas, hospital administrators are saying little about what caused the massive failure or whether the problem has been remedied. “Upon discovery, we immediately secured our environment and engaged cybersecurity professionals to assist in the investigation. While there may be some delays in receiving services, patient safety remains our top priority,” a hospital spokesperson said on Wednesday. At the height of the crisis, Anna Jaques Hospital staff were turning away ambulance crews from delivering patients to its emergency department and diverting them to area hospitals. “We have resumed admitting new patients from ambulance service in the emergency department after diverting ambulance arrivals on Dec. 25. We are in the early stages of our investigation and will provide updates as new information becomes available. We appreciate the community’s patience as we work through this investigation,” the spokesperson said. Newburyport Mayor Sean Reardon said he was informed on Christmas that the hospital’s electronic health record system was down and staff were diverting ambulances to other facilities. “I think anytime a cyberattack has occurred in our community, it is incredibly concerning especially when the health of our residents is at stake. I know the hospital is working extremely hard to get things back up to normal,” Reardon wrote in a Thursday email. Asked for more details on the nature of the crisis and whether it was a targeted cyberattack, the same hospital spokesperson did not answer. “We made the decision to temporarily divert ambulance service to ensure safe and effective care for every patient. Service was resumed on the afternoon of Dec. 26. We alerted other hospitals within the Beth Israel-Lahey Health system, including Exeter Hospital and Beverly Hospital, to be available to accept new patients from Anna Jaques’ service are,” the spokesperson said, in response. The spokesperson on Thursday said recovery efforts are still in progress.

Bay will be vacated and moved elsewhere. Notice of the move was given at the direction of Governor Maura T. Healey’s office, but it is unclear where exactly the families will go after leaving. The decision was announced in a memo last Friday, December 1, from Patrick J. Brown, a legislative affairs liaison for Gov. Healey. The memo said all displaced families that have been living at the Eastern Inn will be moved out on Thursday, December 14, “in an effort to consolidate supplemental shelter sites.” “All 26 families will be transferred, and the Eastern Inn will no longer operate as a supplemental shelter,” Mr. Brown’s memo said. The memo did not state where the families will be moved. Kevin Connor, spokesman for the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities, was able to provide some additional clarity during a phone interview with the Enterprise on Tuesday. The decision to relocate the families, he said, was made in the interest of consolidating shelter services provided by the state. Mr. Connor explained that the state had to rapidly expand shelter locations this summer and into the early fall with the arrival of migrant families to the area. As a result of that expansion, he said, shelters popped up across more than 90 communities. “This is a kind of concerted effort now to make sure that we can consolidate it into more less-dispersed areas,” he said. “Just as a general principle, it’s easier to provide shelter services to a large group of people in more-congregate settings rather than in dispersed locations.” Mr. Connor added that the families being removed from the Eastern Inn will not be moved to another location in Bourne, but as to where exactly the families are being relocated to he was not sure. He did, however, share that the families would not be moved out of state, unless they decide on their own to seek shelter or housing outside the commonwealth. Mr. O’Connor confirmed yesterday that the families have been notified of next week’s move. “Once the families are transitioned out of the Eastern Inn, I do not believe there will be any remaining hotels in Bourne,” he said, confirming that there are no current plans to move the families housed on Joint Base Cape Cod. The decision to consolidate sheltering services came just ahead of approval being given to a $3.1 billion spending bill that includes $250 million for the state’s emergency shelter system. On Monday the House adopted the compromise bill on a 105 to 14 vote. The Senate followed with its approval several hours later by a vote of 20 to 3. Both branches then gave the measure final approval, sending it to Gov. Healey’s desk for her signature. She signed it soon after. Mr. Connor said the $250 million earmarked for the emergency shelter program will be used “to fund continuing operations.” The money does not go toward expanding shelterings, so the governor’s decision to consolidate services was not a financial one, he said. “The decision to transfer families into larger, congregate hotels is based upon wanting to concentrate our shelter services on less-dispersed locations,” Mr. Connor said, “that’s the primary motivator.” Mr. Brown’s memo announcing that the families in the Eastern Inn will be moved was shared with Bourne town officials by state Representative Steven Xiarhos (R-5th Barnstable). Rep. Xiarhos, along with a dozen other state representatives, recently filed a bill seeking to amend the state’s Right to Shelter Act. He said the bill is still in hearings at the State House. The bill, titled An Act Ensuring Fair Housing For Homeless Families, would amend the Massachusetts Right to Shelter Act, which guarantees emergency housing to homeless families and pregnant women, but not homeless individuals. The act currently defines a resident as “any person in the Commonwealth, even if they didn’t intend on staying permanently.” The bill filed by Rep. Xiarhos and his colleagues narrows eligibility to US citizens. It stipulates that, unless countermanded by another law, rule or regulation, the state’s emergency housing assistance program established in the Right to Shelter Act “shall be available only to residents of the commonwealth who are citizens of the United States.” In an email response to a request for comment on the families being moved out of Bourne, Rep. Xiarhos did not remark, specifically, on the governor’s decision. He did, however, reiterate his belief that the Right to Shelter Act, in its present form, is flawed. “I continue to believe that our state’s Right to Shelter Law should be clarified to confirm that it applies only to United States citizens, as I believe it always was intended to be,” he said. Rep. Xiarhos added that he is concerned about the state spending “hundreds of millions of dollars to house and support migrants without any plan whatsoever for them long term.” He argued that there are homeless veterans and families in his district, the 5th Barnstable District, “who are full United States citizens and who need support.” “I simply can’t justify diverting taxpayer dollars away from their needs to house migrants at taxpayer expense in hotels, motels, and at Joint Base Cape Cod,” he said. “It’s not fair and it’s not financially responsible.” Log In The Enterprise Comment Policy Keep it clean, keep it honest, keep it kind.

Roads leading to two of the nation’s busiest airports in New York and Los Angeles were temporarily blocked Wednesday by pro-Palestinian demonstrators demanding an end to the war in Gaza, prompting some travelers to reach terminals by foot. In the middle of the hectic holiday travel season, traffic on the expressway to John F. Kennedy Airport in New York came to a halt for 20 minutes as protesters locked arms and held banners. Video posted on social media showed passengers, some carrying suitcases, leaving vehicles behind and stepping over barriers onto the highway median. Officials later arranged for buses to take stranded travelers to the airport. At around the same time, activists snarled driving conditions on the road that feeds into Los Angeles International Airport by dragging blocks of concrete, tree branches, construction debris and other objects into the roadway, according to L.A. police. Police said in a social media post that protesters threw an officer to the ground and attacked uninvolved passersby in their vehicles, adding that ""this was not a peaceful demonstration.\'\' Authorities said 26 people were arrested at the JFK protest and 36 at LAX, including one for battery of a police officer. Both airports ranked among the nation’s top-six in boardings last year with more than 26 million each. War in Gaza: Israeli adviser to meet with US official Developments: ∎ Israeli rockets rained down on central and southern Gaza early Wednesday, hammering areas where Palestinians fleeing fighting in northern Gaza had gathered on orders from the Israeli military. ∎ Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen threatened the leader of the militant Hezbollah group in Lebanon, saying Hassan Nasrallah “must understand that he’s next.” A Hezbollah strike Tuesday wounded 11 people in northern Israel. ∎ The U.N. and member countries have spent $622 million in aid to Gaza and the West Bank, 51% of the $1.2 billion flash appeal sought by the U.N. when the war began. ∎ The Palestinian casualty toll rose to 21,110 dead and 55,243 injured after almost 200 people were killed in the last 24 hours, the Gaza Health Ministry said. Israeli authorities, who have generally confirmed the ministry\'s death tolls, said the fatalities include 8,000 Hamas operatives − in addition to 1,000 militants killed during and immediately after the Oct. 7 attacks. ∎ Palestinian telecommunications officials said internet and telephone services are being restored across Gaza after a nearly total blackout that severely hampered rescue and aid operations. It was at least the sixth major outage since the war began. Nearly 100 people gathered at The Boardwalk in Dearborn, Michigan, on Wednesday evening to honor and mourn journalists killed in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel since the war started. Former and current journalists called for media organizations in the U.S. and elsewhere to hold to account those responsible for the deaths of dozens of journalists during the conflict. So far, at least 68 journalists have died, according to The Committee to Protect Journalists. Barbara Weinberg-Barefield told USA TODAY she’s heartbroken for the slain journalists’ families and for people who looked to them for information about events in Gaza and the West Bank. She expressed anger at Israel for what she called a massacre. “As a Jewish person, it\'s horrifying to me that this is going on,” she said. She and others at the vigil organized by Project 1948, Wayne State University’s Students for Justice in Palestine and other organizations chanted “Free Palestine” and called for a permanent cease-fire. − Krystal Nurse The communications blackout in Gaza from Tuesday into Wednesday further complicated the United Nations\' attempts to distribute aid, an already Herculean task amid the fighting. “Operational challenges due to insecurity, blocked roads and a scarcity of fuel are also hampering the humanitarian response,” said the U.N. humanitarian office, known as OCHA. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recently said the conditions required for an effective aid operation − including a safe staff, logistical capacity and commercial activity − are missing in Gaza. OCHA said the U.N. World Food Program still dispensed wheat, food parcels and other means of nourishment to about half a million displaced Gazans between Dec. 23 and Dec. 26, but the need is vast. According to Guterres, 80% of “the hungriest people anywhere in the world” are in Gaza. An Iranian general on Wednesday walked back his claim that the deadly Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel was “revenge” for the assassination of an Iranian general nearly four years ago, telling Al-Araby his comments earlier in the day were “incompletely conveyed” and misunderstood. Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps spokesman Ramazan Sharif had linked the Hamas attack, dubbed Operation Al-Aqsa Storm, to a U.S. drone strike in Iraq on Jan. 2, 2020, that killed Gen. Qasem Soleimani. Sharif also said the killing of a top Iranian military adviser by Israel this week in Syria would draw a military response from Iran “directly or indirectly.” The U.S. Justice Department, in a heavily redacted 2020 memorandum, said Soleimani had commanded the guard’s elite Quds Force since the late 1990s and was a “key architect of lran’s campaign of terrorism, assassinations and violence throughout the Middle East.” The Iranian government, which helps fund Hamas, has repeatedly denied involvement in the October attack that killed 1,200 Israelis in communities along the Gaza border. Hamas issued a statement Wednesday rejecting Sharif’s claim linking the rampage to Iran, saying the assault was primarily a response to “dangers that threaten al-Aqsa Mosque” in Jerusalem, which had seen clashes between Israeli settlers and Muslim worshippers. Sharif, however, did not retreat from his pledge of a military response for the killing of Iranian Brig. Gen. Razi Mousavi, targeted Monday in an Israeli airstrike on his Damascus home. Israel had accused Mousavi of being a key player in Tehran’s efforts to supply weapons to Hamas and Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah. “Iran will take harsh and strong revenge,” Sharif said, accusing Israel of killing Mousavi as a way of “escaping from its defeat in Gaza and its failures there, and to divert the world’s attention from a war crime.” Turkish and Israeli leaders engaged in a war of words Wednesday over Israeli actions against Hamas militants in Gaza described by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as “no different” from those of Adolf Hitler. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu struck back, accusing Erdogan of carrying out a genocide against Kurds and holding a “world record number” of opposition journalists in jails. “Erdogan … is the last person who can preach morality to us,” Netanyahu said on social media, adding that Israel has “the most moral army in the world.” War Cabinet minister Benny Gantz, a political foe of Netanyahu, dismissed Erdogan’s remarks as “blatant distortions of reality and a desecration of the Holocaust’s memory.” A 15-year-old Muslim girl was pepper-sprayed and insulted in a Brooklyn neighborhood in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime. New York City police say the girl was approached last week by an unidentified woman who made ""anti-ethnic remarks to the victim, then pepper sprayed the victim in the face."" The woman fled the scene and police are searching for her, releasing a photo with her image. New York TV station WPIX said the woman called the teen a ""terrorist,\'\' among the latest in the sharply rising number of hate incidents against Muslim and Palestinians reported since the war started. − Christopher Cann The U.S. is at risk of being dragged into an ""all-out regional war"" in the Middle East, and the Biden administration must secure a cease-fire instead of ""blindly supporting Israel\'s disastrous war in Gaza,"" the National Iranian American Council, an advocacy group that supports democratic change in Iran, said in a statement released Wednesday. A cease-fire can provide time for diplomacy to address the underlying issues fueling the war, the council said. ""The alternative increasingly looks like a broader conflict that spills across multiple borders and pulls in the United States,"" it said. ""President Biden must act before it is too late.” The Israeli Air Force chief of staff on Wednesday firmly rejected repeated global claims that Israel’s airstrikes in Gaza are indiscriminate. Brig. Gen. Omer Tischler said the Israeli military is conducting a ""precise, focused"" military campaign stressing the protection of civilians. Evacuations are ordered in advance and munitions designed to minimize collateral damage are used, he said. And assaults are monitored in real time and can be aborted if the dangers to civilians become too great, he said. But Israel has acknowledged that its campaign in Gaza has killed more civilians than the militants it is targeting. On numerous occasions, civilians have fled to safety zones at Israel\'s urging, only to find those areas under attack too. ""In war, mistakes can happen,"" Tischler said. ""While they are exceptional, they are still made. We study them, learn from them, and make changes to our process as a result."" Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Israel\'s parliament the war'}]"

Among such people is Jason Takhtadjian, a news anchor for KCAU-TV in Sioux City, Iowa. Takhtadjian was born in Glendale, California and moved to Las Vegas during his elementary school years. He remembers Glendale as a beautiful mosaic of diversity. He faced culture shock in Las Vegas, where it seemed like nobody spoke Armenian, while his tatik and papik (grandparents) spoke Armenian at home. His home was always filled with the Armenian language, customs and foods. Takhtadjian was always fascinated with history, math, science, sports and geography, and his grandfathers introduced him to soccer. He joined the Armenian Church Youth Organization in Las Vegas as its Armenian population grew. Takhtadjian enrolled in the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where he planned to study mechanical engineering, since he was enamored with aerospace engineering, space and flights. After a semester, he knew it was not the route for him. He returned to sports and switched his major to journalism. He started his own podcast for the UNLV radio station and worked in anchoring, producing, editing, filming and writing. Takhtadjian was part of an Armenian duo (along with David Stepanian) providing color and play-by-play commentary for UNLV Runnin’ Rebels men’s basketball games. He was one of the few thousand people in attendance during the first Las Vegas Raiders home game during the pandemic, and his first NFL game as a journalist. Since no fans could attend, only players, owners and media personnel were present. After graduating in May of 2020, just as the COVID-19 pandemic was in full effect, he started working at KCAU 9, Sioux City, Iowa. After a year, he was also appointed as the weekend anchor and producer. There are some Armenians in Des Moines, Iowa, but Takhtadjian has only met a couple of Armenians in Sioux City. His first experience with reporting on Armenian issues was in 2022, when he did a weekend piece on the Armenian Genocide. Takhtadjian tried to localize the issue by focusing on local politicians and their recognition of the Armenian Genocide. During the blockade of Artsakh, he connected the 120,000 people living in Sioux City and surrounding areas to the 120,000 Armenians of Artsakh and looked for voices of solidarity. Takhtadjian told the Weekly that it was challenging to move away from his family to Sioux City, which is nearly 2,000 miles away from Las Vegas. Sioux City is very quiet and peaceful, but he misses the Armenian community. While he enjoys reporting the news, he would love to return to his real passion: sports. He hopes to move closer to Las Vegas or Los Angeles but is open to relocating anywhere to pursue sports journalism. This slideshow requires JavaScript. Takhtadjian is also a contributor to the Armenian Sports News page that started in 2021 on Instagram, run by Weekly contributor Andre Khachaturian. He connects sports with Armenian culture and interviews athletes. He interviewed the basketball player Andre Mkrtchyan Spight at UNLV in 2017 and again this year before the Pan Armenian games. He also interviewed Rex Kalamian, the Pro Player Personnel Scout for the Brooklyn Nets and head coach of the Armenian national basketball team. Another important interview was with the head of Armenian National Committee of Artsakh, Gev Iskajyan, during the forced displacement of the indigenous people of Artsakh. They had planned a Zoom call, but it didn’t work out because of the poor internet connection under blockade. Instead, Takhtadjian asked questions via WhatsApp, and Iskajyan responded with audio files. Takhtadjian said it was rewarding to get to the voice of the people from a primary source during such a difficult time. He also used information from Mary Asatryan, who was the assistant to the Artsakh Ombudsman. Takhtadjian’s advice to those pursuing journalism is not to be a one trick pony. Journalists need to learn how to run social media, use a camera, utilize radio, and most importantly, write well. During the NBA Summer League in 2017, he had the privilege to speak with sports journalist Stephen A. Smith. Smith told Takhtadjian to develop multiple skills and showcase his versatility as a journalist. “You can be witty and be handsome or pretty, but you need to make sure that you can write well,” Takhtadjian said. Takhtadjian is grateful for all the opportunities he has had working as a journalist in Sioux City as well as within the Armenian community. He loves the growth of Armenian journalists and meaningful content about Armenian issues. “We have an opportunity to share the message of Armenians in a positive light. Right now, we need to see more positivity. It’s interesting to see all of the Armenian content that is out there,” Takhtadjian said. Takhtadjian will make us even more proud in the future with his passion for incorporating sports, news and Armenia. Your email address will not be published.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:07 pm WILMINGTON — The Select Board considered requests from the 4th of July Committee, among others, along with their communications, before their announcements and the Salute to Service. 4th of July Committee Chair Patrick Giroux presented three requests to the board. The first was for the annual holiday tree lighting on the town common, this year scheduled for Saturday, Dec. 2 from 4 to 7 p.m. He also sought approval for the 2024 Fall Fest, either on Sept. 28 or Oct. 5, with longer hours: 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. They hoped to see the event increase and add features including a road race. Giroux’s third re\xadquest was for the 2024 annual tree lighting which they would redesign to include a holiday vendor market and other events from 12 to 8 p.m. on the town common. The board quickly ap\xadproved the 2023 tree lighting request. Regarding the 2024 re\xadquests, Kevin Caira commented that he wasn’t comfortable confirming the location of fall fest or the tree lighting festival in light of construction for the new town hall/school administration building. He highlighted safety concerns and suggested an\xadother location at the Tex\xadtron property. Giroux assured the board the 4th of July Committee meets regularly with town officials and public safety, and their 2024 events didn’t need to use the municipal parking lot. Town Manager Jeff Hull pointed out that while Fall Fest was a success, there was a cost paid by the town in the amount of $6,000. The board moved to ap\xadprove Fall Fest and the Tree Lighting in 2024, setting the dates but es\xadtablishing the locations were to be determined. Chair Gary DePalma and Frank West both commented that the Fall Fest went well. Several memos that night came from Town Manager Jeff Hull, DPW Director Jamie Magaldi, Police Chief Joe Desmond, Fire Chief Bill Cavanaugh, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Hull wrote to the board to suggest they establish a town building repurpos\xading committee to evaluate the possible reuse or disposition of to-be-vaca\xadted buildings. West re\xadplied he’d like to represent the board on this committee. Greg Bendel asked what the next step would be, and DePalma clarified they would first form the committee by vote at their next meeting. Another memo from Hull stated that at no time did he direct any town employees or department heads to receive the COVID-19 vaccine at the risk of losing their jobs. He also described the town’s de\xadductible for insur\xadance costs is currently $175,000. He wrote that the town is active with risk management and regularly earns rewards with their current insurance provider. Hull’s third memo, sent in combination with the superintendent of schools, indicated a desire to convene a group to discuss initial steps for a long-term plan for a new elementary school to be created on the west side of town. This group would include the Select Board, the School Committee, and the Finance Commit\xadtee. Caira said he did not like the pitting of one side against another side. He also pointed out there was already a Facilities Master Plan created which the town had been following, and it didn’t make sense to start planning another school with three ongoing construction projects. DePalma said that personally he thought they should move forward with discussions at no cost to the town. He suggested they discuss whether the MSBA waiting period would be worth the potential financial assistance. Magaldi informed the board about a grant re\xadceived for athletic field improvements which would be put toward as\xadsessment of fields and addressing any issues. Desmond and Cavanaugh both sent statements to the board confirming that no employee in their department was required to re\xadceive the COVID-19 vaccine in order to remain em\xadployed. The EPA notified the board of an upcoming public form on Nov. 1 for Wilmington residents. The board voted in fa\xadvor of ratifying Dennis Kelley as a member of the Per\xadmanent Building Commit\xadtee. Hull established Kel\xadley would re\xadplace George Hooper once he retires. They also approved the date for a board meeting to receive the town manager’s budget presentation as Jan. 29. Hull said this would give the temporary town manager more time to finalize the budget process while still being 90 days before the annual Town Meeting. They moved to pass over the establishment of Lou Cimaglia as temporary town manager, as they already voted on this matter. However, they then voted in favor of the terms and conditions resulting from negotiations with Ci\xadmaglia. Hull mentioned town counsel would have an employment contract ready by the end of the week. The board approved a request for the Wilming\xadton Little League Parade scheduled for April 29, 2025. Caira suggested they hold the date but not necessarily the location. They also voted in favor of the agreement to hire Ellen M. Hutchinson as special counsel regarding a property tax matter with Reading Municipal Light Department. Hull reminded the board the issue came up because KP|Law also represents RMLD. A public comment from Paul Chalifour informed the board he would be interested in serving on the committee regarding the repurposing of public buildings soon to be vacated. Veterans Director Lou Cimaglia also notified the board the Veterans Day ceremony would be taking place on Saturday, Nov. 11. In announcements, West gave a shoutout to an El\xadvis tribute that took place at the middle school. He also shared the current MBTA schedule where the train stations, along with many others, are flag stops at certain times of the day, meaning the train doesn’t stop if no one is being picked up or drop\xadped off there. Bendel shared that the new senior center project would be breaking ground on Oct. 25 at 12 p.m. He congratulated the building committee for reaching this point. Caira commented that it was unfortunate the ground\xadbreaking was scheduled in the middle of the day on a Wednesday. Hull took personal of\xadfense to this comment, saying Caira accused him of nefarious scheduling. He in\xadformed the board the Senior Center Building Committee themselves set the date and time. Caira and Hull then went back and forth. Caira called out Hull for chiming in at this moment and not during public comment. Hull said he knew Caira hadn’t liked some of his actions recently. He also brought up things he claimed Caira called him in the past, including a dictator, a player’s coach, and “the worst town manager [he’d] ever seen.” Caira in return called Hull a liar. The Salute to Service that night went out to Corporal Orlando Colleameno. Ben\xaddel highlighted Colleame\xadno’s service in the US Air Force from 1946 until he was honorably discharged in 1947. He also shared condolences to Colleameno’s family with the salute to his service, as Colleameno passed away in September of this year. The Select Board’s next meeting is set to be Oct. 30.

Marlborough battery-technology firm Ambri will lay off 105 workers, 89 residing in Massachusetts, unless it can raise sufficient funding on or before Nov. 13. Ambri submitted a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice addressed to the Massachusetts Division of Career Services, Marlborough Mayor Arthur Vigeant, and Marlborough City Council President Michael Ossing on Sept. 15 announcing the potential layoffs. “As of the date of this memorandum, the company believes that it will need to undertake this reduction in force, but the company is seeking additional financing, which could potentially eliminate the need for the reduction-in force or reduce its scope,” Ambri Director of Human Resources Kerrin Corrieri wrote in the WARN notice submitted on Sept. 15. The Boston Business Journal first reported news of the layoffs. “As a long-term business, we are prudently adapting our approach in response to the unusually challenging investment environment for hard-tech, pre-revenue companies,” Ambri Executive Chairman Dan Leff said in a statement sent to WBJ on Thursday. “This is not a decision we take lightly, but we believe it is the right choice to put us in a strong position as the market recovers and we secure additional investment.” In June 2022 Ambri announced that it leased a 140,000-square-foot space at a retail plaza in Milford with the intention of building a manufacturing facility. When asked about the status of the Milford facility, Ambri wrote in a Wednesday email to WBJ: “We are considering a range of options for the future commercialisation of our technology to be able to refocus our commercial strategy in response to the needs of our investors, business, and people.” Ambri specializes in renewable energy storage technology and produces a long-duration liquid metal battery.

El Planeta Noticias en español desde Boston, Massachusetts Freddy Torres y su familia llegaron al Boston Logan International Airport un día muy frío de diciembre del año pasado, sin saber qué pasaría después. Por Sarah Bentancourt Torres, su esposa, Adriana, y sus dos hijos pequeños habían huido de Colombia en busca de asilo político, cruzando a Estados Unidos desde México. Ahora en Boston, tenían un lugar para quedarse por una noche a través de un amigo y $1,200 en sus bolsillos. Mantente informado con los temas más relevantes de política, economía, comunidad latina y salud. Suscríbete aquí a nuestros newsletters. “Fue difícil y estaba muy nerviosa”, dijo Torres a GBH News recientemente en español. Dijo que se preguntó a sí mismo: “¿Por qué vine? ¿Qué hice? ¿Qué está sucediendo? ¿Qué pasa con los niños? La familia Torres es parte de un flujo constante de inmigrantes que llegan a Massachusetts, un número que se ha disparado a medida que las personas de América del Sur y el Caribe huyen de la violencia y la agitación política. Llamándolo una crisis humanitaria, la gobernadora Maura Healey activó la Guardia Nacional para apoyar a los migrantes en la Base Conjunta de Cape Cod y abrió dos centros de bienvenida en Boston y Quincy. Pero la afluencia de personas desesperadas es tan grande que las familias están inundando las organizaciones sin fines de lucro y los hospitales locales. Ahora, siete meses después, la familia Torres tiene vivienda a través del sistema de refugio estatal en Dorchester. Freddy y Adriana, los padres, tienen varios trabajos para llegar a fin de mes mientras esperan una audiencia de inmigración en noviembre. Se sienten bendecidos por estar a salvo y agradecidos por los trabajadores y defensores de la ciudad que los han ayudado a encontrar vivienda y educación para sus hijos. Pero las emociones iniciales que experimentaron al llegar son algo que también sienten otros migrantes: confusión, miedo y trauma. La familia Torres encontró un apartamento con la ayuda de FamilyAid, una organización sin fines de lucro con sede en Boston. Larry Seamans, el presidente del grupo, dice que quiere ayudar a todos los nuevos inmigrantes que llegan a Boston. Pero compara la creciente necesidad con un “desastre natural” que ha inundado el estado. “Las necesidades de las familias que vienen ahora parecen ser mayores porque el volumen es mayor”, dijo. “Parte de esto es descubrir cómo manejar la crisis”. Torres, de 42 años, dice que huyó de Colombia con su familia porque temía la persecución de la nueva administración de Gustavo Petro. El presidente es un exmiembro del grupo guerrillero M-19, similar a los que Torres investigó alguna vez como parte de su trabajo en el ejército colombiano. La familia también buscó ayuda para sus dos hijos: su hija de 14 años, Zhayreth, tiene diabetes y su hijo de 8 años, Freydar, tiene síndrome de Down y autismo. Salieron de Colombia en diciembre y volaron a Cancún, México en avión. Una vez allí, Torres contrató a un traficante de personas conocido como «coyote» para que los condujera a la Ciudad Juárez, en frontera con Texas. Torres recuerda lo nervioso que estaba cuando el coyote llegó inesperadamente con otros dos hombres para guiarlos. “En México antes de cruzar no se duerme. Te preocupas por tus hijos, que le pase algo a tu esposa, que los maten, que los secuestren”, dijo. A pesar de sus preocupaciones, dice, cruzaron la frontera sin incidentes y se presentaron a los oficiales de la patrulla fronteriza para pedir asilo. La familia pasó dos días bajo la custodia de U.S. Customs & Border Patrol en Texas antes de ser liberada con libertad condicional humanitaria, un estatus migratorio que permite a los inmigrantes permanecer temporalmente en los Estados Unidos. La administración de la alcaldesa Michelle Wu ha anticipado durante mucho tiempo la llegada de más inmigrantes como la familia Torres. Yusufi Vali, subjefe de personal de la oficina de Wu, le dijo a GBH News en junio que la ciudad había intervenido para que la gente entrara en refugios temporales y hoteles mientras los inmigrantes trabajaban en sus solicitudes para el sistema de refugio estatal a través del Departamento de Asistencia Transitoria. La Oficina Ejecutiva de Vivienda y Comunidades Habitables del estado de Massachusetts, o EOHLC, administra un sistema de refugio de emergencia para familias, trabajando en conjunto con el Departamento de Asistencia de Transición del estado para llevar a cabo ese trabajo. Pero los números crecientes han expuesto la necesidad de más servicios, lo que llevó a la ciudad a involucrarse más. “Ese es el papel que hemos visto jugando aquí y simplemente tratando de, nuevamente, llenar los vacíos a medida que el estado presenta una estrategia regional más sostenible”, dijo Vali. Por lo general, dijo Vali, el proceso comienza cuando las familias llegan a los hospitales y departamentos de policía locales. Otras veces, un residente puede llamar al 311 y simplemente decir: «Tenemos una familia aquí», dijo. Ahí es cuando uno de los dos enlaces vecinales con habilidades en criollo haitiano y español se involucra. La familia Torres fue conectada con la enlace Gladys Oliveros después de que terminaron en la sucursal de East Boston del Departamento de Policía de Boston, dirigida por lugareños de la estación Maverick MBTA. Oliveros, de 58 años, pasa sus días trabajando con las comunidades latinas de Boston, especialmente con los inmigrantes que acaban de llegar y necesitan conectarse a los servicios. Ella dice que pregunta sobre las necesidades médicas, si han comido y llama a la ciudad para organizar alojamiento en un hotel a corto plazo. Luego, ella los lleva allí. “Cuando me encuentro con personas, tienen miedo, no saben qué hacer, pero cuando hablo español, de repente se sienten cómodos y tienen la energía para abrirse y hablar”, dijo. Oliveros dice que comprende su difícil situación porque ingresó a los Estados Unidos sin documentación oficial hace 32 años. “Me veo en ellos. Estoy muy feliz de estar allí y ayudarlos”, dijo, comenzando a llorar mientras explicaba por qué su trabajo significa tanto para ella. “Una vez estuve en esa posición”. Oliveros ayudó a la familia Torres a hospedarse en un hotel por algunas noches. Luego les pidió que se reuniera con ella en una oficina del Departamento de Asistencia Transitoria en Nubian Square. La pareja dice que llenaron una «montaña» de papeleo y les dijeron que se encontraban afuera de un supermercado esa noche, donde un Lyft los llevó a un apartamento en Dorchester. Allí conocieron a la trabajadora social Paola Batista de FamilyAid. “Fue una bendición”, dijo Freddy Torres. “Paola nos dijo que no nos preocupáramos y nos habló de los niños y de nuestra situación migratoria. No había miedo de que nos desalojaran de la noche a la mañana”. La familia puede quedarse en el apartamento de Dorchester de tres habitaciones mientras obtienen la autorización de trabajo y ganan lo suficiente para no calificar para un refugio de emergencia financiado por el estado, según FamilyAid. La ciudad de Boston está contratando a dos enlaces comunitarios más para ayudar a los migrantes a navegar los sistemas de vivienda y refugio de emergencia. Además de la vivienda, muchos necesitan ayuda con el empleo, las escuelas y el seguro médico. Batista ayudó a la familia Torres a inscribirse en un seguro de salud en el Centro Médico de Boston y a asegurar citas médicas. Mientras estaba allí, el nivel de azúcar en la sangre de su hija se disparó porque había estado sin insulina durante días, lo que la enfermó gravemente. Se quedó en el hospital durante el fin de semana. “Pasamos Año Nuevo en el hospital”, dijo Torres. Durante el invierno estuvieron conectados con East Boston Community Soup Kitchen para obtener comida. Ese es un oasis para alimentos gratuitos y saludables de Our Savior’s Lutheran Church en Maverick Square. Descubrieron que Adriana estaba embarazada y comenzaron a ir a las citas prenatales. A través de un amigo, pudieron encontrar trabajo a corto plazo paleando nieve. Batista dice que las familias en situaciones similares tienden a quedarse al menos un año. La familia Torres comparte el departamento con un sobrino, un adulto joven que tiene su propia habitación.

Find the best places within Sudbury. From local businesses to food to medical to legal services. Michael Marcantognini stepped up to challenge a defender and quickly won possession of the ball. “In all three phases of the game, you want to feel like you are in the driver’s seat where you don’t want to be reacting, you want to be under control,” Antonello said. “As young players it is tough for them because they don’t have the experience to gauge who exactly they are playing,” Basawa said The Greater Sudbury Soccer Club Impact U17 boys are defying conventional wisdom. Sudbury hosts Unionville Milliken SC at Cambrian on Saturday War is coming to the \'Game of Thrones\' prequel While the show is stupid, it also makes a few good points about dating and relationships Let’s talk about sex, readers. Sex in songs, to be specific. Tech toys are not just reserved for humans – your pet may love gadgets as much as you do This week is my green week so I spent time last weekend between the rain drops trying to weed, deadhead and cut back as much as I could to send off for composting. For a start, I suggest you put some Marvin Gaye on the music player before you continue this column. The first time I read about a wine being referred to as “sexy” was in the Wine Advocate, the publication created by American wine critic Robert Parker. I thought it was a goofy descriptor at the time, it wasn’t People Magazine’s Sexiest Wine of the Year after all, it’s just wine. That was about 25 years ago, and I’ve seen it used many times since, and yes, I’ve used it on occasion, typically when I’m talking about a good bottle of pinot noir. If, by sexy, it means the wine has allure and a beguiling charm, stimulates good conversation and is at its best in the company of good food, then sexy it is. As the local asparagus season winds down, I\'m looking for ways to enjoy this versatile vegetable in as many dishes as possible. It\'s Father\'s Day weekend and here\'s a six-pack of beer styles that\'ll satisfy dad\'s thirst for knowledge: Gardeners love blue blooms. Blue is viewed as peaceful and relaxing. It represents the sky, water, and even the far horizon. It is not a coincidence that the blue flower was a core symbol for the Romanticism movement of the 1800s where it stood, and still does, for desire, love, the sacred longing and aspiration for the infinite, the unattainable, and perhaps the unknowing. Blue is the soul of the poet in all of us. Scientists are concerned about the potential health risks of eating titanium dioxide in foods such as frozen pizzas and candies Two important international meetings last week underscored how Canada is becoming increasingly irrelevant on the world stage, as our federal government fails to live up to our defence obligations. Six years ago, then-Ontario premier Kathleen Wynne opened a candidates\' debate with the memorable sentiment: ""Sorry, not sorry."" Using a principled philosophy around hiring and firing talent is not only fair, it could be your key to success Even before the final results were in from all of the 27 European Union countries that voted in the EU elections last weekend, President Emmanuel Macron had called national elections in France for the end of this month. What does he know that other European leaders don’t? I have this warm, faint memory of having breakfast with my dad in a restaurant. I was pretty young. It was the first time I had one of those small, one-serving packages of cereal. I think I had Frosted Flakes. It felt good to have breakfast with my dad. Maybe that’s how I learned to like eating in restaurants. I get to recapture that moment. Get a dash of perspective along with the trending news of the day in a very readable format.

Partners, rcently celebrated the topping off of 100 Hood Park Drive. Women and men from the building trades and greater Charlestown community were invited to sign the ceremonial beam, marking completion of vertical construction on the project. 100 Hood Park Drive will serve as an anchor for Hood Park, a 20-acre, Class A urban campus located in the heart of Boston’s Charlestown neighborhood that will include 1.8M square feet of office and laboratory space, 100,000 square feet of retail and 335 residential units upon completion. With immediate proximity to Kendall Square, Assembly Row and several MBTA Orange Line Stations, Hood Park has quickly become Boston’s next life science cluster, attracting leading life science companies such as Bluebird Bio, Mori, Solid Biosciences, Indigo, and Advent Technologies and serving as a catalyst for continued life science investment in the area. Current and future tenants and visitors of all ages enjoy access to the campus’ pedestrian friendly local retail vendors, which include Landry’s Bicycles, Tradesman Coffee Shop and Lounge, The Handle Bar, Element Hair Salon and Spa, and Boston Veterinary Clinic. Hood Park’s vibrant on-site amenity base includes over an acre of publicly accessible green space and frequent on-site community events including a beer garden held in partnership with Aeronaut Brewing every Thursday during summer months and an inaugural Spring Fest held May 13th that saw over 500 people from the Charlestown community in attendance. Designed by Cambridge-based design firm SMAA, 100 Hood Park Drive’s existing 7-story mixed use building was completed in 2020 and is comprised of 61,139 SF of lab on the second floor, a 900-space garage with 50 EV chargers, and approximately 40,000 SF of ground level retail. Today’s topping off celebrates the tower addition of 100 Hood Park Drive, which will add 5 stories of office and laboratory space totaling 186,000 RSF with floor plates averaging 37,000 RSF-capable of providing a 60/40 lab split. Once complete, the building will be 13 stories and total over 287,000 RSF of lab, office and retail. “Strategically situated just north of Downtown Boston and east of Kendall Square, 100 Hood Park Drive is the perfect home for a life science company looking to join Hood Park’s diverse ecosystem of innovative companies, academic institutions, and curated retail,” said Chris Kaneb, Manager of Hood Park LLC. “We are grateful for the hard work of the individuals at every stage of the development process-from design to construction, who have made our vision for the Hood Park neighborhood come to life.” Hood Park is a dynamic, mixed-use urban campus in the heart of Boston’s vibrant and historic Charlestown neighborhood. Originally home to the New England dairy company H.P. Hood and Sons, the 20-acre site has been completely reimagined as an innovation district and community destination for residents, employees and visitors to live, work, play and gather. Hood Park includes first-class lab and office space, a dynamic mix of activated retail, luxury apartment living and publicly-accessible open spaces including Hood Green, a one-acre lawn and focal point of the development. Pedestrian friendly and transit oriented, Hood Park is conveniently located steps away from the MBTA Orange Line and Interstate 93, and is quickly accessible from Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville.

is moving towards a jury trial. Tree House Brewing Company is known for its specialty beers, world-renowned IPAs and stouts, but lately, in addition to beers, the company has been brewing legal trouble and tension among shareholders. In mid-November, Eric Granger, a two-percent shareholder in the company, filed suit against Tree House, alleging the owners have conspired to deny him and other shareholders benefits from the company’s success. Now, Tree House owners Nathan P. Lanier and Damien L. Goudreau have denied all allegations of financial wrongdoings and said Mr. Granger’s shares in the company have earned him more than $850,000 to date. Lawyers for the company appeared in court on December 21, to request that the case be dismissed. Tree House Brewing was founded in August 2011 in Brimfield, by Mr. Lanier and Mr. Goudreau. Since then, the company has grown exponentially. It now owns and operates six facilities across New England, including a taproom and brewery on Town Neck Road in Sandwich. According to Mr. Granger, the company is one of the top beer companies in the world. As of December 26, the company has seven of the top 35 beers in the world ranked on beeradvocate.com. Mr. Granger invested $10,000 in the company in May of 2012. In his complaint, Mr. Granger said that in 2015, he was tricked into signing a document converting Tree House LLC. into Tree House Brewing, Inc. and converting his shares in the company into Class B non-voting shares. Mr. Lanier and Mr. Goudreau were then the only voting shareholders. Mr. Granger alleges the pair used this power to appoint themselves as CEO, president, secretary and treasurer, and to deny other shareholders access to the company. He added that in 2020, the pair stopped holding meetings with Mr. Granger and the other Class B shareholders and refused to give them any information on the company’s finances. The number of shareholders has dwindled since. Mr. Granger is now the only minority shareholder, as the others have all accepted buyouts from Mr. Lanier and Mr. Goudreau. Mr. Lanier and Mr. Goudreau now each own a 49 percent stake in the company, while Mr. Granger holds a two percent stake. Mr. Granger said having control of the company allowed the pair to reap the benefits of the company’s financial success, all while denying him dividends. He claims they have issued themselves large salaries, excessive bonuses and purchased multiple luxury vehicles, while denying him access to the company’s financial records and refusing to issue any dividends to minority shareholders. Tree House also withheld IRS schedule statements, which Mr. Granger claims caused him to incur personal tax penalties. In addition to refusing to issue dividends, Mr. Granger alleges that Mr. Lanier and Mr. Goudreau have conspired to devalue his shares. In 2016, the pair created Landreau Realty LLC; in 2018, they created Pride and Purpose LLC. Mr. Granger claims the real estate companies have been used to acquire over $13 million worth of land and have been purchasing the properties Tree House has been renting and leasing it back to the brewing company. In 2020, Landreau Realty purchased 98 Town Neck Road for $1.3 million in order to open the Sandwich taproom. The company also purchased 5 Freeman Avenue, a three-bedroom house right next to the brewery, for $1.1 million. “The lease payments to Landreau Realty LLC., and Pride and Purpose LLC., were and are above market value and did not serve any legitimate business purpose,” wrote Geoffrey R. Farrington, Mr. Granger’s attorney, in the complaint. “The leases were created to divert corporate assets away from Tree House… for the benefit of only Lanier and Goudreau and to the detriment of the remaining shareholders of Tree House.” The complaint alleges that Mr. Landreau and Mr. Goudreau created other companies to divert funds and assets from Tree House Brewing as well. These companies include Landreau Transport LLC., Tree House Motors LLC., and Tree House Orchard & Farm Fermentary LLC. Mr. Granger is suing for $50,000 in damages, a retroactive issuance of dividends and legal fees. He has requested a trial by jury. Mr. Lanier and Mr. Goudreau are denying all allegations. In response to Mr. Granger’s complaint, lawyers for the company said that Mr. Granger has been paid more than fairly for his investment. “In 2012, Granger made a passive investment in the amount of $10,000 for two percent… Since then, he has received over $850,000 in distributions from Treehouse,” wrote William H. Paine, Tree House attorney. Mr. Granger’s dividends have equaled a 2,500 percent return on his investment. In the response, Mr. Paine added that in October, a month before the complaint was filed, Mr. Granger received a letter stating he would receive a $20,000 dividend each year. Regarding excessive salaries and bonuses, Mr. Paine wrote that the company has never employed Mr. Granger. Thus, he has never received a salary like Mr. Lanier and Mr. Goudreau, becaude they work in the company’s day-to-day operations. “Lanier and Goudreau have for more than a decade worked day and night on weekdays, weekends and holidays to make Tree House a success. Granger is a passive investor who has never been employed by Tree House,” Mr. Paine wrote. He also wrote that Mr. Granger was fully aware that his shares gave no voting rights in the company and that the phrase “non-voting member” was clearly written next to Mr. Granger’s name when he signed the company merging document. He added that Mr. Lanier and Mr. Goudreau have offered to buy Mr. Granger’s shares at fair market value multiple times over the years, and Mr. Granger has always refused. Tree House held shareholder meetings to discuss finances in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Mr. Paine admitted the company stopped holding these meetings in 2020 but denied that it was done to hide information from shareholders. He wrote that the COVID-19 pandemic was the reason. An agenda and meeting minutes from the 2016 shareholder meeting attached to the document show that Landreau Realty and the other companies created by Mr. Lanier and Mr. Goudreau were discussed with the shareholders as a way to “remove liabilities that would otherwise fall on Tree House” and decrease the risk to the company and other shareholders. Mr. Paine wrote that Tree House agrees to a trial by jury on any triable matter but requests the court dismiss the case entirely, because no conspiracy has occurred and Mr. Granger has been paid well for his investment.

suitable state intervention,” said Senator Collins. “Now is the time to pursue new, creative ideas to address a humanitarian crisis affecting thousands of people and families throughout the area. The Floating Hospital would provide our healthcare professionals with a state-of-the-art facility in which to provide care, all while addressing the pressing public health and safety needs of the city.” The fiscal year 2023 state budget allocated $597 million dollars for opioid recovery, harm reduction, and other addiction-oriented policies and programs. The state also contributed $40 million toward attempted interventions in the area known as Mass and Cass last year. Senator Collins’ amendment would consult the Naval Construction and Marine Engineering program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as to the feasibility of converting a cruise ship into a floating hospital for mental health, substance abuse, recovery services. In February, MIT produced a feasibility study commissioned by the United State Navy on converting a cruise ship to affordable housing. This medical vessel would have all the facilities needed to respond to patients’ acute and chronic health needs, provide for primary and specialty care, mental and behavioral health and dental services. Furthermore, it will provide stable temporary housing with wrap-around services while ensuring a secure setting equipped with food services, health and recreation facilities. There is precedent for the state creating a floating medical facility. Beginning in 1894, medical professionals in Boston came together to operate The Boston Floating Hospital to serve poor children battling illness by treating them on a medical vessel in Boston Harbor. This resource helped create a health care facility for the most vulnerable patients in the city. By providing a clean environment and compassion-based treatment, they were able to care for those most at risk, while decreasing risk of infection across the city.

There’s no shortage of proposed new housing and other large-scale developments in Central Massachusetts. There’s also no shortage of commentary regarding out-of-control rent prices, homelessness, and the impact of new development of all types on existing infrastructure. Real estate remains an economic driver of the region, so expect the debate over the impact of growth to intensify in 2024. You’ll be hard pressed to find any experts who think the factors causing rising construction costs will suddenly dissipate in the coming year. There’s no shortage of need for housing, but if the financial numbers don’t make sense, we probably shouldn’t expect developers to keep building. Until costs come down, more builders will likely press the pause button or scale back existing plans. Next year will be the first year Worcester property owners will see a 1.5% Community Preservation Act surcharge included in their tax bills. Passed by voters in 2022, funds from this surcharge are meant to support efforts like building community housing and new parks, as well as protecting historical buildings. Expect plenty of debate over the use of these funds, as other Central Massachusetts municipalities considering their own CPA watch closely. In a modern age where online shopping is ubiquitous, more companies are abandoning massive retail storefronts, forcing landlords to get creative to fill these spaces. Don’t be surprised to see more stories about pickleball facilities and other unique businesses filling spaces formerly housing big box brands.

generations. By Christopher Haraden As contractors began taking down the former Atlantic Aquarium building on Friday, two Hullonians closely associated with the short-lived venture made sure that artifacts from the landmark building were preserved. Greg Sandonato and Skip Tull, who helped bring the aquarium to life 50 years ago, saved two large photographs that hung on the wall of the former dolphin tank from the wrecking crews. And both men recognized themselves in the images. As demolition crews began taking down the former Atlantic Aquarium building on Friday, former assistant director Greg Sandonato, assisted by fellow aquarium associate Skip Tull, rescued a large photo of Lucky the dolphin that survived on the back wall of the building for 50 years. Sandonato is pointing to a younger version of himself in the 1973 image, which is set to be restored. [Skip Tull photos] Sandonato, who served as the assistant director alongside owner Kenneth Tong, is visible in the large photo showing employees and others lowering Lucky, one of the three performing dolphins at the aquarium, into the main tank. Lucky, Lady, and Sprite were flown from Florida just prior to the facility’s grand opening in May 1973. When they arrived in Boston, a State Police escort brought their specially outfitted truck from Logan Airport to their new home in Hull. The photograph, mounted on wood, hung on the back wall of the aquarium and remained there, untouched for decades, even as the building was transformed from the aquarium into a restaurant, hotel, and charter school. Those other uses did not extend into all of the dolphin pool area, leaving that section of the two-story building a time capsule until the remaining stadium seating and marine-related equipment was cleared out to prepare the property for sale. Curious about the history of the aquarium building? Click here for the full story! Tull, whose photographs are featured each week in The Hull Times, said he was involved in the early days of the aquarium and is very likely in the photo. However, the person bearing closest resemblance to him is not looking directly at the camera, so a positive identification is difficult. Brookline developer Jonathan Leavitt, a principal of 120 Nantasket Avenue LLC, is constructing a four-story, 21-unit residential building on the existing aquarium foundation. The aquarium was open from 1973 through 1975. After an eight-year dormant period through the early 1980s, the building was purchased by the Nardo family and converted into the Atlantic Inn and Elaine’s Seaside Restaurant. After the Nardos closed the hotel and restaurant, it was leased to the South Shore Charter School until 2004 and has been empty since then. Plans for a performing arts center and marijuana cultivation facility were proposed over the years but never materialized. On Friday, Sandonato and Tull, with the help of Hull High graduate Sean Rafterty and other members of the construction crew, carried the photos out of the building and loaded them onto the bed of Sandonato’s pickup truck. He brought them to the Paragon Boardwalk for storage while plans are finalized for their restoration. Do you have an opinion on this issue? Click here to write a Letter to the Editor.

Woody was a member of the fabled Tuskegee Airmen. That group of all black airmen flew over 15,000 missions and shot down 112 enemy airplanes during World War II. Woody, who is an active member of the Mission Hill Post 327 is my upstairs neighbor, and I am privileged to be his friend. I was honored to attend the City of Boston Veterans Day Ceremony at Freedom Hall on Nov. 10, which was chaired by our own Col. George Rollins. The following morning it was great seeing a photo of Woody and Air Force veteran Tony Broccoli on the front page of the Boston Herald from the event. Kudos go to Randace Rauscher, director of external affairs of the Executive Office of Veteran Services, who helped organize the terrific event. The next day the Mission Hill Post held their Veterans Day Ceremony at the Brigham Circle Memorial site. This is where the names of all Mission Hill veterans who were killed in the line of duty are engraved on two headstones. Our Post Commander Col. George Rollins presided over the ceremony which included a moment of silence for our fallen soldiers and our M.I.As. Bugle player Garret Savluk passionately played “Amazing Grace”. Boston City Councilor Sharon Durkan attended the ceremony, and it was nice that she joined us after the ceremony at “The Mission” for a fine meal. It was great to see “Big Jim” Moynihan in the Brigham Circle gathering. Big Jim is a U.S. Army veteran, from the Mission Hill project and a former long-distance runner who completed eight Boston Marathons. Thanks to Maria Weinograd of Mike’s Donuts who supplied the delicious coffee, donuts and muffins prior to the ceremony. The Curran family and Mission Hill mourned the loss of beloved Robert Curran last month. Robert, a decorated Vietnam veteran, passed away unexpectedly two weeks after the death of his older brother, Richard Curran. Robert, a lifelong Mission Hill resident, was the father of six and the husband of his loving wife, Mary (Casey) Curran. Robert’s son, David Curran beautifully eulogized his dad at his funeral mass at Mission Church, remembering his father as a hard-working cement worker with Local 534 and reminiscing about when Robert was an inspiring coach in the Mission Hill Little League. Robert had more stories than Walt Disney, and I heard most of them upon my walking by his home on Pontiac Street hundreds of times. Some days I’d stay for hours listening to his absorbing tales. Bernie Fitzgerald was Robert’s classmate from first grade through high school and he succinctly encapsulated his life: “Robert was a good man and a great father.” Under a brilliant sunshine dozens of golfers teed off Oct. 28 at the Norwood Country Club for the Mission Hill Post Golf Fundraiser after several rainout days. Nobody won the $10,000 grand prize, a hole in one on the 7th hole, but by the long arm of coincidence, John Marroni earned high-fives and fist-bumps for his hole in one on the 8th hole. The golfers and the many $100 club donations were appreciated for this noble cause and thanks to sponsors Nancy Ross, Sharon Durkan, Kenzie Bok, Robert Bennet, and Col. Rollins’s granddaughter, Teagan Condon. Also thanks to Donato and Mattie and Mission Bar & Grill proprietors, Harry Walsh and Michel Soltani, the owner of Brendan Behan’s in J.P. for their contributions. The Behan is a nice place to warm up on cold days, particularly in the cozy refurbished back patio that is well heated. I was happy to see John Fitzgerald get elected to the Boston City Council from District 5 in Dorchester. John, the son of the late Kevin Fitzgerald and Tricia (MacDougall) Fitzgerald from Mission Hill, is bright and street smart savvy. Congrats to Henry Santana who won a City Council at-Large seat. Henry grew up in Mission Hill after migrating from the Dominican Republic. Sharon Durkan has done excellent work representing Mission Hill and she was reelected to another term on the City Council. It was nice chatting with Kervin, the polite and personable cashier at the Brigham Circle Walgreens. His regular customers call him “Swervin, Kervin.” Patty Cosby stopped by Mike’s Donuts for a pleasant chat. Patty, a pretty woman from Mission Hill is a realtor working for Coldwell Banker and she has helped several of our local residents who have purchased homes. Condolences to the family of Carol Healy who passed away last month. Carol, from a Mission Hill family of nine children, is a Mission High School graduate. The Healys are a terrific family. I didn’t know Carol, but I’m friends with Bobby Healy and Father John Healy, going back to the Mission Hill project days. R.I.P. , Carol. Thanks to the New England Baptist Hospital for donating 30 Thanksgiving turkey dinners to residents at Charlesbank Apartments in Mission Hill, and it was kind of Pam Carthy and her staff at Penguin Pizza who skillfully prepared the turkeys. Why did the turkey join the band ? Because he had his own drumsticks. Maurice can be reached at [email protected] Your email address will not be published.
