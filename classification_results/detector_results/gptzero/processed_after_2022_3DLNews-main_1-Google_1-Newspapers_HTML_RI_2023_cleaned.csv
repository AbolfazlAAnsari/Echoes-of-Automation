where he grew up. “I look forward to all of the wonderful things that we’re going to do at Blackrock,” David Gesualdi — or “Dr. G,” as some know him — told school committee members during their June 22 meeting. “I’m looking forward to the new journey.” Blackrock, one of Coventry’s five public elementary schools, has seen a number of different people in the principal’s chair over recent years, Supt. Don Cowart said. Following Alicia Reniere’s departure from the school in 2019, Paula Jacquard served as Blackrock’s principal before moving to the same position at Washington Oak Elementary. The role was then filled briefly by Dennis DelBarone until he relocated to another state last year. “Looking for stability for that building is a key goal for [Asst. Supt. Amy Anzalone] and I,” Cowart said. “There’s so much happening at the elementary level that we need a good, strong leader there.” Gesualdi had been working in a different role within the education industry when he learned that the Coventry school district was seeking an interim principal for Blackrock. He’d been missing serving as a school principal, Cowart said, and decided to apply for the job. Gesualdi did a “great job” closing the school for the summer, Cowart said. “Which is not easy to do by any account,” he added. Out of fairness, Cowart said, a job posting was made to fill the school’s principal position permanently. Gesualdi was one of several applicants. “I think he had fallen in love with the building and with the opportunity to be their principal,” Cowart said of Gesualdi’s time in the interim role. Gesualdi interviewed well, he added, and was ultimately selected. Gesualdi said he so far has enjoyed his experience with Coventry Public Schools. “It’s been a great road; I’ve really enjoyed being here as the interim,” said Gesualdi, who grew up in Rhode Island and whose parents live in Coventry. Cowart called Gesualdi’s resume “very interesting,” noting that it boasts professional positions in Washington D.C. as well as outside of the United States. “I think he brings something to the table that is not typical of candidates that we interview,” the superintendent said of Gesualdi, who speaks Spanish fluently. According to his LinkedIn profile, Gesualdi holds a Bachelor of Education in Teacher Education from James Madison University, a Masters in Education from the University of Virginia, and a Doctorate in Education, Executive Leadership, K-12 Administration and Supervision from William and Mary. He spent three years teaching in Paraguay, before moving to Washington D.C. for an education policy fellowship. He worked for the District of Columbia Public Schools in positions including teacher leader and dean, and then as leader of a school in Colombia. Having worked most recently as a director for The College Board, primarily serving Connecticut and Maine, Gesualdi said he knew his heart “was with working with kids on a day-to-day basis.” “Now I’ve had that taste over the last few weeks,” he said, thanking Cowart and Anzelone for taking a chance on him as he looks to move back into school leadership. “I’ve really enjoyed it.” Log In Keep it Clean.

AWCT Executive Director Mary-Kate O’Leary said, “Often, people don’t realize they are donating to help make dreams come true for children with a life-threatening illness. This event features more than 5,000 people willing to head into the water and be ‘freezin’ for a reason’. This past year, we granted 43 wishes, the highest in the history of AWCT. We did not anticipate the great need but are happy that we could grant these wishes thanks to the incredible support of the community. “We are especially grateful to the people who made this event so successful for two decades,” said O’Leary, who will be one of the plungers. “The money we raise from this event goes toward helping children and their families find an opportunity for joy as well as helping the family get back on their feet during this long and challenging journey.” There are several ways the public can help, according to O’Leary. Sponsors can help financially starting at $100 with a “Freezin’ for a Reason” level with other sponsors for $250 (Polar) $500 (Bronze) $1,000 (Silver) $2,500 (Gold) and $5,000 (Presenting) with accompanying benefits at each level. Most importantly we want people to attend and have a great time. Plungers will be encouraged to give $25 to take the big plunge. In addition, there will be t-shirts, towels and blankets for sale.

The North Kingstown High School’s fine arts department presents a musical production of “Grease.” Six performances will be presented over two weekends on March 3rd, 4th, 5th, and March 10th, 11th and 12th including Friday and Saturday evening shows (7PM) and two Sunday matinees (2PM) in the auditorium at North Kingstown High School. Tickets will be sold in advance at Dave’s Marketplace in Wickford and Quonset. McQuades in Jamestown, and North Kingstown High School. Tickets are $15 in advance and $18 at the door. North Kingstown drama production of ‘Grease’ set to open NORTH KINGSTOWN — The skids are greased for the start of North Kingstown High School’s annual student theater production, which this year will be the acclaimed musical “Grease.” The setting in the 1950s is about rebellious and experimenting teens tapping into idealism in adolescence as well as that time in post-war American culture comes to life through the contributions of students of all ages learning about the many working parts of a production. “We were hoping to do something that would be fun with a lot of roles this year because we have a large senior class. We were looking for a show that didn’t depend on one or two characters but was more of an ensemble show,” said Norma Caiazza, choir and orchestra director who oversees the annual production. “When Olivia Newton-John passed away, we thought it might be fun to do this year. We are not a fan of the message, but the music and characters suit our students well this year. They are learning a lot about the 1950s and all the differences they are dealing with now,” she added. It’s 1959, and Rydell High School’s senior class is in rare form. The too-cool-for-school “Burger Palace Boys” are stealing hub-caps and acting tough and their gum-snapping, chain-smoking “Pink Ladies” are looking hot in bobby sox and pedal pushers, as Stageagent explained the popular musical also released in 1978 as a feature-length film. The 1950s high school dream is about to explode in this rollicking musical that is both an homage to the idealism of the fifties and a satire of high schoolers’ age-old desire to be rebellious and provocative. At the heart of the story is the romance between hot-rodding gangster Danny Zuko and the sweet new girl in town, Sandy Dumbrowski. They had a secret romance in the summer, but now back in the context of school, peer pressure and cliques make their love a bit more complicated. There’s the cool dude image Danny has to maintain while still drawing in the demure Sandy his girl. The ensemble’s songs and dance embroiders the feelings about the romance, evoking emotion and even memories for the older audience members who have lived through that time in their lives. Songs summon the sounds of music from Buddy Holly, Little Richard and Elvis Presley — icons of that generation. It still draws teens with the connections so much a part of young lives. Caroline Ranucci, a senior, plays Patty Simcox and accented that point. “I am performing in Grease because I love the community that participating in the musical has provided me with and because of the amazing work that happens in the NKHS theater program,” she said. “Grease excites me because of its energy and the opportunity to really let the excitement fly! “ she added. Mackenzie North, a senior, said, “Many things have changed since the time period of Grease, and I think it’s important to honor that era. Mrs. Caiazza tells us that as performers we are there to transport the audience back to 1959.” “Performing a show from a different era means we have to study the mannerisms true to the times, so not only is this a performance, but sort of a history lesson! There’s something so exciting about seeing all of the moving parts of theater come together,” North explained. Senior Drew Kardos plays Danny Zuko in this production that takes students some 65 years back in time. Yet, all learning comes from contradiction and that is certainly appearing for many students like Kardos. “Doing Grease in 2023 came with a multitude of new unfamiliar challenges, like tackling normality of the 50s that can be controversial and sometimes offensive in today’s world and trying to implement (it) into our performance,” he said. “The excitement of theater lives in these challenges, for it gives actors like me an opportunity to dip into history and revive characteristics of specific time periods. I am very excited for the final product of this great show, and to perform alongside all of my favorite people,” he said. Daniel Macari is a senior and is involved with his sixth show. “I have had the opportunity to be a part of these productions since I was in seventh grade due to “Beauty and the Beast” needing extra singers, “ he said, noting his older brother, Matthew, and friend Cooper Cardone convinced to let him become involved with other shows. “Multitasking between singing, dancing, learning lines, and helping out our tech crew with some minor jobs are all bits that go into creating a fantastic show for our audiences’ pleasure. There is a certain calling that attracts me back to it every year,” he said. Beyond just providing fun, theater production for students — like those in North Kingstown who traditionally each year do a play and musical — taps into a variety of learning experiences beyond historical comparisons. American Alliance of Theatre and Education points to numerous studies that have demonstrated a correlation between drama involvement and academic achievement. In addition to having higher standardized test scores than their peers who do not experience the arts, students who participate in drama often experience improved reading comprehension, maintain better attendance records, and stay generally more engaged in school than their non-arts counterparts.

Murdoch called false voter fraud claims “damaging” in a text following a press conference from Trump allies Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, according to filings.

In an open letter, Mukesh Jain, senior vice president for health affairs and dean of medicine and biological sciences, wrote that “rankings do not adequately capture the quality of education nor the level of support provided to students at any medical school.” We applaud the administration’s decision — this change is an important step toward aligning the University’s practices with its ideals. But let’s not stop at medical school rankings. Jain stated that after extensive consideration, the administration at Warren Alpert “reached the conclusion that the approach upheld by the U.S. News rankings simply does not align with our institutional values.” But only considering medical school rankings through this lens sets a double standard. Undergraduate college rankings are equally flawed and deserve the same criticism Jain levies on medical school rankings. They arbitrarily assign numerical values to institutions of higher education and feed a vision of college as a hierarchical rat race. And yet, in a recent press release, the University boasted its high placement across lists ranking undergraduate student experiences and high-impact instruction. Are the values of Warren Alpert so different from those of the College? U.S. News’s college rankings are perhaps the most followed; they help to color popular perceptions of prestige and quality. In theory, rankings might be a good idea. Navigating the American college landscape can be overwhelming because there is such great diversity among institutions, from large, research-heavy state schools to small, liberal arts colleges. Ordering the vast world of higher education could help confused high school seniors prioritize their interests. Schools like Brown also benefit extensively from these rankings — they keep attention focused on us. And our allegiance to U.S. News paid off this year: Brown achieved its highest rank since 1997. But it is exactly the attempt to standardize this variety that is concerning. U.S. News assigns varying weights and percentages to different elements of college life. There are many factors in these rankings that should give readers pause. A reputational survey, which asks administrators for their opinions on peer institutions, comprises a whopping 20 percent of schools’ scores. While those working in higher education should theoretically have a better sense of their peers’ quality, it seems methodologically dicey to ask them to numerically rank dozens of institutions. This metric serves to reinforce prior conceptions of a premium education and leaves little room for newcomers. Additionally, U.S. News factors in faculty salaries, per-student spending and alumni donations, which are essentially just measures of institutional wealth. It also considers student SAT scores, which detractors have argued are tied to higher incomes. Rankings also rely on universities to submit data, which can lead to unreliable figures. The numbers under the hood, evidently, have severe flaws. The weight of these factors on rankings shifts frequently, leading to huge swings from year to year. The educational quality of these colleges isn’t significantly changing in the span of 12 months, yet schools can rise and fall with alarming speed. Rankings are thus not only subjective but also unstable. U.S. News continues to adjust its process in an attempt to respond to critiques. It has placed more weight on outcomes in recent years. But rankings fundamentally make college a zero-sum game. This year, minor tweaks led to large public universities moving up significantly. Of course, these changes came at the expense of other schools, which have criticized the latest rankings. Any shift in measurement will not be enough to fairly quantify hundreds of schools. There’s momentum across higher education in support of ending rankings participation. Warren Alpert followed a host of peers in law and medicine and we wouldn’t be the first to leave undergraduate rankings, either. Reed College pulled out of undergraduate rankings in 1995. In the past year, Bard College, Colorado College, Columbia and the Rhode Island School of Design departed as well. U.S. News will likely continue to rank Brown, as it did with those who left, regardless of the University’s decision. But it’s a matter of values. Halting active administrative participation in the rankings would be an important symbolic move and could catalyze movement among our peers. We’ve led the way before — we were one of the first universities to grapple with our institution’s ties to slavery. And we upended the traditional model of higher education with the open curriculum. Why should a school with a long and storied history of bucking convention be afraid of a single online magazine?

Consultants and airport representatives outnumbered residents Thursday evening to view the proposed $100 million plan to relocate and expand air cargo facilities from the Airport Road side of the terminal south to an area once used for long term parking. But, that didn’t mean the plans weren’t questioned or modifications weren’t suggested. As consultants folded up easels at the end of the three-hour session, held at the Sawtooth building in Apponaug, the most vocal critic of the plan, Richard Langseth, concluded “it’s no such a bad deal.” Asked later for an explanation, Langseth said the plan addressed concerns he raised over trailer trucks crossing in front of the terminal arrival area to access Post Road and the Coronado Street Bridge to Jefferson Boulevard. The plan calls for the trucks to access the Airport Connector to Route 95 and from there exits on Jefferson Boulevard. In additional discussions, he said the City Council would need to abandon portions of Strawberry Field Road, Murray Street and Field View Drive to build a noise and visual protection berm. He said this should be used as leverage to gain guarantees from the Rhode Island Airport Corporation including limits on additional expansion. However,on Monday, John Goodman, RIAC Assistant Vice President of Media Relations wrote in an email, “We do know that the FAA does not see the need for the wall since data shows that it is not needed for noise mitigation. The recent bid which is contingent on funding approval puts the cost of the wall at approximately $1.76 million. This is a significant cost. RIAC and the City of Warwick believe that it is needed to shield the neighborhood from the operations at the cargo facility. Therefore, both entities are requesting the FAA and our congressional delegation to help us fund this wall.” Langseth is skeptical of federal funding for the barrier and concerned about the location of proposed expanded air cargo facilities. “Future expansion of the scope beyond what is now envisioned needs to be reigned in or we may be buzzing with air cargo all day and night,” reads an email he sent over the weekend. He hopes to meet with the mayor, city planner and council members to outline proposed measures the city should take. Langseth is not alone in asking how the city benefits from this development that, according to the environmental assessment prepared by AECOM, could start construction this summer and be fully operational by 2025. In response to an inquiry on what comes next, Goodman wrote in an email, “The Federal Aviation Administration will review the EA and issue a determination, likely during this summer. Depending on the determination, the FAA could issue a grant approval in August, which would allow grading and site work for the project to commence in September of 2023.” On Thursday evening that all seems very fast to Ron and Kim Hawkins and Bruce and Michele Hanson who congregated in a hallway after viewing plans and submitting recorded comments. They learned of the meeting from a Rhode Island Airport Corporation email notification. “They really didn’t have any dialogue,” Ron Hawkins said of the event. He termed recording individual comments rather than conducting an open meeting where attendees could make statements and ask questions, “a cowardly way to do it.” He said he is concerned by increased emissions even if the volume of flights has reduced from 2019 as well as pollution levels of Warwick Pond that is east of the airport. Why not Quonset? The Hawkins and Hansons asked why the city hadn’t taken a more active role in vetting the air cargo plan and talked about forming a group to question the proposed project. They asked what the city would be getting out of the project. They also questioned why air freight operations weren’t being located in Quonset with its easy highway access. Michael Zarum, who closely follows airport developments and had joined the group discussion, said to satisfy FAA classification as a commercial airport, a runway extension would be required compromising Quonset as a deep water port. The explanation given in the environmental assessment is: ““Quonset is a general aviation airport and is not certificated for scheduled airline operations. Even if the improvements could be made to bring the airport up to commercial service standards, the cost, schedule, and environmental impacts to do so would be far greater than the Proposed Action.” Would additional funding flow to the city? The plan doesn’t propose that. Emissions and noise from aircraft and trucks were foremost for Stan Smyzyk, who has lived on Strawberry Field Road west since 1971. His house faces the long term parking lot that will partially be converted into an access road to facilities housing FedEx and UPS and will serve as a pad for aircraft. To shield houses on Strawberry Field Road and Palace Avenue, the plan calls for construction of a berm topped by a wall and hidden by trees. Smyzyk would be happen with that only that the shield falls short of his house. It stops before reaching Post Road. Smyzyk made that observation to AECOM and RIAC personnel when the air cargo project was outlined in a similar January session. Bryan Oscarson Associate Vice President/Aviation at AECOM said Thursday that aspect of the plan hadn’t changed. Ward 3 Councilman Timothy Howe stood alongside Smyzyk to reinforce extending the berm to Post Road. He related how some years ago he stood on Smyzyk’s porch while an idling Alligant jet sent an obnoxious plume of exhaust their way. Howe was not put off by the absence of an open public forum. Rather, he pointed out Thursday’s session was conducted at a public venue, not the airport, adding, “We do have a voice in comments.” He noted the different components of the environmental assessment and how they were summarized at various stations in the Sawtooth atrium. Although personally impacted by the airport, Howe considers the development as a positive. Wants airport to succeed “We have this airport, do we want it to succeed?” he asks rhetorically. He points to airport infrastructure improvements including the people mover, saying those investments have helped the airport to attract carriers like Breeze Airways that plans to make Green a base of operations. He feels new air cargo facilities is a reaction to market demand that the state should take advantage of. “The bulk of the project is to accommodate FedEx,” said Oscarson. He explained Green Airport would help address a “weak spot” in their coverage of Providence and the “south Boston area.” “Boston is a huge market and there’s no more growth up there,” he said. Oscarson ruled out the construction of the giant Amazon distribution center in Johnston or the 500,000 square foot warehouse off Airport Road as impacting the decision for new air cargo facilities. “They have nothing to do with this project,” he said. The facility is expected to increase the number of daily FedEx air cargo flights by two arrivals and two departures daily, however since FedEx plans to switch from Boeing 757 to 767 aircraft, which are wider and capable of carrying 60% more cargo He estimated truck traffic to the air cargo facility at between 30 to 40 vehicles daily.

'version': '2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Growing up in a pretty conservative and homophobic environment, it took me a while to come out. In the time before I could embrace my identity and find my community, I remember queer representation in media being super important for me. I would eat up anything with even a little LGBTQ+ subtext, whether that be a show as explicitly queer as “RuPaul’s Drag Race” or a film that at least had a gay person in it, like “Mean Girls.” The pickings were a little basic, for sure; I couldn’t be expected to have the taste of RISD’s artsiest film student as a preteen. To a young, uninformed me, these forms of media gave me an insight into the queer culture I wanted to be a part of so badly. Unfortunately, I quickly found that this representation — which I hoped would feature the entire culture and community — was near exclusively focused on cisgender white gay men. Though this was an issue in my childhood, I had hoped it would be mostly solved by the time I had grown up. I was a bit too optimistic. According to a GLAAD report on LGBTQ+ representation in film this past year, most queer characters featured were white, most were men, and only 22 of the 292 characters counted were trans or nonbinary. Not to mention, only 28.5% of the 350 films counted even had queer characters, with the majority having less than five minutes of screentime. With queer representation still being so rare and surface-level, the fact that the characters included are disproportionately white, cisgender and male is more than a little disappointing. This selective representation becomes especially evident when looking at the most popular queer stories in film and TV. “Heartstopper” and “Red, White, & Royal Blue” were both huge recent successes for their respective streaming platforms, and both feature British white men as their protagonists. While encouraging more queer stories to be told is obviously important, it should be equally important that these stories are diverse across the board. Now, it certainly isn’t true that there are no stories about broader queer experiences being made. FX’s “Pose,” centered around Black and brown queer people, particularly trans women, ran for three seasons. Back in 2017, Barry Jenkins’s “Moonlight,” which focuses on the experiences of a Black gay man, won the Academy Award for Best Picture (though, that might not be what you remember most from that night). And, in my very qualified opinion, “Bottoms” is not only the greatest work of cinema of 2023, but of all time. However, it is rare that these stories get the same amount of funding, support and attention as the Brokeback Mountains of the world. In fact, a ranking of box office performances of LBGTQ+ movies reveals that a majority of the most successful queer movies are about white gay men. And in terms of promotion, it’s hard not to question why a romcom about gay men like “Bros” got a wide theater release and an estimated $40 million marketing budget while “Bottoms,” a romcom about gay women, was initially given a limited release in only ten theaters and a much smaller budget. However, depressing statistics about the homogeneity of queer media shouldn’t be necessary to justify wanting more diverse representation. In fact, even if the majority of gay movies made this year were about, say, trans lesbians of color, I’d say we should still have more of those movies made and less whose footage could be used for a Troye Sivan music video. We are contending with an overwhelmingly unjust history of intersectional queer experiences being underrepresented, neglected and sidelined. This itself is a reflection of the disproportionate levels of oppression that people of these identities have faced for decades. This should be reason enough for the directors, writers and producers of Hollywood to avoid creating more media that compounds this lack of representation. When a new LGBTQ+ movie comes out that near exclusively features cis white men, like “Strange Way of Life,” I can’t help but feel like the casting decision was a moral failure. Sure, there are stories that are specifically about the white cis gay male experience, but is it really necessary for those to be the ones told at this point in history? Is the need for these exclusionary stories so great that they should be made instead of one that, perhaps, highlights a character that isn’t a white man? I say no. Of course, tokenism in representation can be just as harmful, and I’m certainly not suggesting some clunky quota system be enforced. Moreover, I don’t think a solution would be to boycott something like “Heartstopper” and sabotage the rare pieces of queer media we do get. The issue of representation in Hollywood is a big one that requires a level of structural change and diversification of the workforce both in front of and behind the camera. A good solution, though, is to support the pieces of media that center a more inclusive understanding of queerness. For example, Netflix recently launched a new series, “First Kill,” that centered on a lesbian relationship, but then canceled it after one season due to lack of viewership. That is exactly what we, as viewers, need to prevent from happening. If enough people watch these projects, then studios should get the message that making more shows like “Pose” or movies like “Moonlight” would be profitable for them. We can at least economically encourage what should already be the obvious right thing. So, go rummage through those online lists of LGBTQ+ films and shows and make sure you give the stories that feature intersectional queerness some love. We need more of them.

Privacy | Terms of Use | Your Privacy Choices | Notice at Collection From multimillion-dollar home sales across the state to high-profile and sometimes controversial real estate developments, corporate leadership shakeups and layoffs, to a sudden bridge closing and breakthroughs in cancer research, the most-read stories of 2023 left an enduring mark on Providence Business News readers and the region. Below is a month-by-month recap of the most-read stories on PBN.com: January: 2023 started off with Lifespan Corp. announcing a ""breakthrough"" in brain cancer research. Researchers with Lifespan’s Cancer Institute said the Phase III of the DCVax-L vaccine showed improved survival rates for patients with returning and newly diagnosed glioblastoma, which is the most common and lethal form of brain cancer. The cancer affects about three out of every 100,000 people, but rates are higher than average in Rhode Island with doctors at Rhode Island Hospital seeing 60 to 70 cases per year. Treatments include chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy with survival rates ranging 15-17 months from diagnosis. But during the trial, Lifespan researchers found that newly diagnosed patients treated with the DCVax-L vaccine survived for a median of 22.4 months from surgery, which is several months longer than typical treatment and the 5-year survival rate for patients also increased from 5% to 13%. On top of this, the vaccine also showed minimal side effects. “This is a very easy protocol, has very limited toxicity that we’ve seen thus far, minimum immune reaction problems,” said Dr. Steven A. Toms, director of the brain tumor and stereotactic radiosurgery program director at Lifespan and vice chair of the department of neurosurgery at Rhode Island Hospital . “It’s potentially a huge breakthrough for patients with glioblastoma and potentially with other cancers down the road.” Read the story here.

Kent County Memorial Hospital, Newport Hospital, Our Lady of Fatima Hospital and The Miriam Hospital also each earned a “B” while Rhode Island Hospital and Roger Williams Medical Center earned a “C.” Savonnah Briggs, a former Citizens Bank employee, pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit bank fraud in connection with her role in a bank fraud scheme to create fraudulent personal and business checks. Briggs was one of 11 people involved in the conspiracy who created and deposited approximately $330,000 worth of counterfeit checks, according to court documents. As part of a $635 million lease-back deal, Bally’s Corp. sold the properties and buildings of Bally\'s Tiverton Casino & Hotel and Bally’s Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Biloxi to Gaming Leisure Properties Inc. While Gaming and Leisure will take over ownership of the land and buildings Bally’s continues to own, control and manage all the gaming operations. February: Providence received a $27 million federal grant that could cover the cost of former Mayor Jorge O. Elorza’s “urban trail” network. However, Mayor Brett P. Smiley pumped the brakes on taking action with the funds. Elorza, who applied for the grant before departing office, had championed his plan for a 78-mile network of protected bike lanes even amid pushback from businesses and a lawsuit threat from state transportation officials. However, Smiley has ridden the middle ground on the issue as he’s not against bike lanes, but opted to conduct a review of infrastructure upgrades and gather more community input before moving forward.

March: A vacant restaurant building that was the former home of Agaves Mexican Grill was sold for $2.25 million to a Chicago-based limited liability company called 444 Quaker Lane LLC. The company is affiliated with Green Thumb Industries Inc., a national marijuana products company that owns multiple marijuana businesses in Rhode Island including RISEand CanWell. The one-story building was constructed in 2001 and was formerly home to a 99 Restaurant before it was occupied by Agaves Mexican Grill from 2011 through 2017.

The Warwick School Committee has joined a national lawsuit suing major social media companies Meta, TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat, doing so in a 4-0 vote taken during Nov. 14’s School Committee meeting, following discussion in closed session. The lawsuit is being filed by a consortium consisting of Beasley Allen Law Firm, Goza Honnold Trial Lawyers and Wagstaff & Cartmel. Warwick is one of four school districts in the state signed onto this suit, joining East Greenwich, Smithfield and West Warwick Public Schools. Andrew Henneous, a partner at Henneous Carroll Lombardo LLC and the Warwick School Committee’s attorney, said the school committee decided to join onto the national suit because of social media-related experiences that had cost the school department money. “I think it’s definitely worth looking into,” Henneous said. “It’s a good investment with very few potential drawbacks.” According to School Committee Chair David Testa, the suit is modeled after one filed against vaping company Juul Labs, which ended in a $462 million dollar settlement and a loss for the company of over $3 billion, according to the New York Times. That lawsuit came following allegations that Juul was marketing their products, which contain nicotine, to minors. Similarly, Beasley Allen alleges the four social media companies named in the suit have specifically targeted and addicted minors. “Everything about these products—from inadequate age verification measures, insufficient parental controls, endless scrolling, constant notifications, and targeted algorithms—have been designed to addict teen and adolescent users,” Beasley Allen’s National Social Media Litigation Team said in a pamphlet shared with the Beacon. Davis Vaughn, a Beasley Allen lawyer who assisted multiple committees in that case, is currently one of the lawyers involved in this case. According to him, Beasley Allen first started investigating in 2021, after Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen alleged that the company had designed their sites to addict children and placed a greater value on profit than consumer safety. “More time equals more dollars,” Vaughn said. “The more time these kids spend on social media, the more data they can extract, and the more data they can extract, the more money they can make.” At that time, Vaughn was working with both individual plaintiffs suing social media companies and school districts suing Juul. When he and other lawyers began talking with schools about the effects of social media on their campuses, they realized just how much it had affected classrooms. Proving a social media addiction is a harder task than proving an addiction to nicotine. However, according to Vaughn, social media companies have taken very similar tacks of creating a “lifelong customer,” and research has shown the reality of social media addiction. Additionally, trends such as the “devious lick,” popular on TikTok in 2021, have led to vandalism and overall damages to school property. According to records from the Warwick Police Department, a bathroom sink at Toll Gate High School was ripped off of the wall in November of that year. While that isn’t Vaughn’s main focus, he said it helps cement exactly why the suit is being conducted, and shows how schools are on the “front lines” when it comes to mental health. “All of this comes at an enormous cost to school districts, who are already operating with declining budgets,” Vaughn said. “I don’t know of any school department in this country that just has money waiting to be spent on stuff like this, and it’s a diversion of resources instead of a school’s primary purpose of teaching students.” According to Vaughn, the Warwick School Committee has not officially filed their suit yet, but he anticipates that the suit will be filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court (JCCP). Beasley Allen said that school departments that join in on the lawsuit will not have to make upfront payments, and will only need to pay expenses if they win money in the suit. Vaughn said that it’s tough to say how much the School Committee would owe should the suit be successful since the case is in discovery at this point, meaning it has yet to begin, but whatever they would owe would be a portion of the money that they receive in damages. Overall, Vaughn expects about 1,500 school departments nationwide to sign on to the suit- a similar number to their suit against Juul. Currently, approximately 475 school departments around the country have joined in.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Sunday, June 2, 2024 A four-year saga came to an apparent end on Dec. 18 when the Newport Zoning Board of Review rejected the commercial redevelopment of Waites Wharf in a split vote. The proposal from Harbour Realty, Waites Wharf Realty Association, and owner Thomas B. Abruzese called for the construction of a hotel and wedding destination on the wharf. The application required a regulatory and dimensional variance to construct the 118-room hotel on property that allowed for only 91 rooms, according to the local zoning code. A special use permit was also required to build a transient guest facility in the waterfront zone. About 1,800 square feet of retail space, a kayak rental option, a water taxi service stop and “increased” public access on two new sidewalks on the north and south sides of the wharf, according to the applicants, were also envisioned as part of the project. Had the proposal been approved, many of the existing buildings, including a restaurant/bar and nightclub, would have been demolished to make way for the new build, while the existing marina would have remained. Originally submitted in 2019, the application underwent multiple revisions after the Planning Board voted numerous times to recommend its denial to the Zoning Board, citing noncompliance with the city’s comprehensive land use plan and a lack of mixed-use that is intended for the area. The Planning Board most recently recommended denial in March. On Dec. 18, the Zoning Board of Review rejected the proposal after hosting three special meetings beginning in October and taking hours of testimony from expert witnesses and the public. The denial came despite an unanimously approved condition that should the application be approved, a gated egress on the southwestern side of the property be used only for emergency vehicles and situations to prevent traffic increases into the surrounding residential area. Here is how the vote went. Chair Samuel Goldblatt, Opposed Goldblatt said that by law the harbor promotes a mixed-use development pattern consisting of housing, retail, offices, restaurants, boatbuilding, boat repair, fish and seafood receiving and shipping. “There’s no reference in that definition to hotels,” he said. “There are multiple references to housing.” The project was viewed by Goldblatt under two different potential impacts, the first being on the public and the second being on the surrounding neighborhood. “There’s a discreet, recognizable neighborhood adjacent and to the south of the proposed development that is primarily residential in character and no less deserving of protection from adverse impacts than any other residential neighborhood,” he said. “We must strike a balance and be careful not to trample on and damage those neighborhoods . . . This proposal threatens that balance.” He said the applicant failed to demonstrate a required hardship for the allowance of the extra rooms and that the plan did not conform to the comprehensive land use plan. Goldblatt agreed with the Planning Board’s recommendation. “In the judgment of the Planning Board, this project is not the type of mixed-use project [they] envision,” he said. “The [recommendation from the Planning Board] spoke to a larger concept of mixeduse, something broader than a mixed-use that focused economically on hotels and support of the tourism industry.” Russell Johnson, Opposed The combination of vehicles and increased pedestrians at the Thames Street-Waites Wharf intersection posed a safety threat, according to Johnson. The proposal differs from other recently constructed hotels, such as The Brenton Hotel or The Gardiner House, because those hotels have more means of egress, Johnson said. He concluded the additional rooms were not the least relief necessary and agreed that the proposal would alter the character of the surrounding neighborhood. “I would support a hotel with the allowable number of hotel rooms, a smaller seating capacity for the banquet capacity and a reduced size, scale and volume of the hotel buildings to be less massive,” he said. David Riley, Opposed Riley also had pedestrian safety concerns. “I was not persuaded by the testimony,” he said. “Both experts put the width of Waites Wharf at 16 to 17 feet, far from ideal to accommodate the width of two vehicles heading in opposite directions. With no sidewalks on Waites Wharf until you get to the subject property, pedestrians and vehicles sharing the road, as proposed, would pose a significant hazard to pedestrians.” Riley cited one portion of the Zoning Code when analyzing the proposal’s compliance with the comprehensive land use plan. “This petition, although showing some retail space and an incidental kayak operation, primarily is a large hotel and wedding venue,” he said. “In my opinion, it does not meet the intended use of the waterfront business zone.” Vice Chair Wick Rudd, Approved According to Rudd, the proposal would have increased housing because there is a lack of needed transient rooms for visitors to the city. If the hotel was built, the demand for short-term rentals, namely formerly residential Airbnbs, would have decreased. “I think Airbnbs] have hurt this city in many ways,” he said. “We want affordable housing in this city. The short-term rentals are changing the whole dynamic of what housing costs to buy and to rent. We have dark houses in the wintertime here, and we don’t have enough hotel rooms. For that reason, I think [the proposal] does conform with the land use plan.” Rudd approved of granting the variance to construct the additional rooms not allowed by right on the property because the general business zone allows for one transient room per 400 square feet, while the waterfront business district allows for one transient room every 1,500 square feet. “The best that I could come up with [for that difference] was that the people who were living in the waterfront district when the Zoning Code was created in 1977 didn’t want their views disrupted,” he said. Bart Grimes, Approved There were “divergent interests” at play because the property sits between a business zone and a residential zone, Grimes said. “There is an underlying theme of no more hotels in the residential district versus energizing this area for economic reasons. You can see the conflict,” he said. “The current property is tired and in need of improvements.” Grimes referenced testimony showing that the only form of traffic that would be significantly increased was pedestrians, not motor vehicles. “Generally, this is a good problem to have in a business district,” he said.
