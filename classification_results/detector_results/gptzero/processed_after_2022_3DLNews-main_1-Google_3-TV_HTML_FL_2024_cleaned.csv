(News 12 New Jersey) - A New Jersey firefighter died in the line of duty Friday morning while battling a house fire. The 32-year-old had only been with the department for two years. Now, the community of Plainfield is in mourning. Firefighter Marques Hudson was a father to three children. He was born and raised in the city of Plainfield. At 8:15 a.m. on Friday, Hudson answered the call for a house fire along Emerson Avenue. The fire was in a room in the rear of the attic in the two-family house. “He was injured that he either fell through the floor or fell down the stairs, and we don’t know the circumstances at this time,” Plainfield Mayor Adrian Mapp said. City officials confirmed there was a mayday call made by Hudson just before he was rescued. Once pulled from the house, he was rushed to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick where doctors worked for over an hour to try and save his life. “We suffered a great loss today and the city suffered a great loss,” Ken Childress, the Plainfield fire director, said. Three other firefighters were also injured in the fire and sent to the hospital. State fire marshals along with the ATF are leading a major investigation into Hudson’s death. “His firefighting career had only yet begun, but he will be remembered,” Childress added. While a cause for the fire has not been determined, neighbors believe a space heater was to blame. “This is just a stark reminder every day when the men and women of the New Jersey fire service don our gear, this is a reality that is in the back of our minds,” Ed Donnolly, with the New Jersey Firefighters Mutual Benevolent Association, said.

This week, it issued a Level 2 advisory for travelers planning to go to the Bahamas. The Level 2 advisory warns people to “exercise increased caution” -- especially on the islands of New Providence and Grand Bahama. The advisory is tied to deadly gang violence. If you’re planning a trip, you’ll want to be careful about parts of the Caribbean. The Dominican Republic and Turks and Caicos are also under Level 2 advisories because of crime. Meanwhile, the State Department says you should reconsider travel to Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. And it says you should not travel to Haiti because of kidnapping, crime and civil unrest. No matter where you travel, the State Department recommends that you sign up for the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program. Start your morning with our daily forecast, trending news and stories curated by The Morning Show team. It’s a free service that sends you all of the latest information about safety conditions in your destination. It also makes it easier for the U.S. Embassy to reach you if there is a dangerous situation while you are there, like a natural disaster or civil unrest, or if there is a family emergency you should know about. The assault prevention group RAINN also recommends you familiarize yourself with your destination and transportation. It suggests researching taxi and ridesharing companies and even using Google Maps to scout and familiarize yourself with the area where you’ll be staying. Also, beware of “vacation brain.” It’s nice to relax, but don’t let your guard down too much. Many destinations can create a false sense of security. Don’t trust people too quickly. Always be aware of your surroundings and keep track of your drink, and always have a backup plan. That means having a portable charger in case your phone dies, a map in case your GPS doesn’t work, and a hard copy of important phone numbers and addresses. And make sure you protect your passport.

According to a study from AAA, the number of fatalities is nearly four times higher than originally reported in national crash data. “This is a much bigger problem than many people even realized,” Company spokesperson Mark Jenkins said. He said 123 roadside assistance providers died on the job between 2015 and 2021. “These are people with families. I mean, nobody really wants to be on the roadside but they’re doing the job of a hero and helping others get back out on the road safely,” Jenkins said.

The decision upholds the secretary of state’s decision to disqualify the senators from the ballot under a voter-approved measure aimed at stopping such boycotts. Measure 113, passed by voters in 2022, amended the state constitution to bar lawmakers from reelection if they have more than 10 unexcused absences. Last year’s boycott lasted six weeks — the longest in state history — and paralyzed the legislative session, stalling hundreds of bills. Five lawmakers sued over the secretary of state’s decision — Sens. Tim Knopp, Daniel Bonham, Suzanne Weber, Dennis Linthicum and Lynn Findley. They were among the 10 GOP senators who racked up more than 10 absences. “We obviously disagree with the Supreme Court’s ruling,” said Knopp, the chamber’s minority leader. “But more importantly, we are deeply disturbed by the chilling impact this decision will have to crush dissent.” Democratic Senate President Rob Wagner welcomed the decision. “Today’s ruling by the Oregon Supreme Court means that legislators and the public now know how Measure 113 will be applied, and that is good for our state,” he said in a statement. During oral arguments before the Oregon Supreme Court in December, attorneys for the senators and the state wrestled over the grammar and syntax of the language that was added to the state constitution after Measure 113 was approved by voters. The amendment says a lawmaker is not allowed to run “for the term following the election after the member’s current term is completed.” The debate was over when that ineligibility kicks in: If a senator’s term ends in January 2025, they would typically seek reelection in November 2024. The “election after the member’s current term is completed” would not be until November 2028, the Republican senators argued, so they could run for reelection this year and then hold office for another term before becoming ineligible. The court disagreed, saying that while the language of the amendment was ambiguous, the information provided to voters in the ballot title and explanatory statement made clear that the intent was to bar truant lawmakers from holding office in the next term. “Those other materials expressly and uniformly informed voters that the amendment would apply to a legislator’s immediate next terms of office, indicating that the voters so understood and intended that meaning,” the justices wrote. The senators’ lawsuit was filed against Secretary of State LaVonne Griffin-Valade, who last August said the boycotting senators were disqualified from seeking reelection. She directed her office’s elections division to implement an administrative rule based on her stance. All parties in the suit had sought clarity on the issue before the March 2024 filing deadline for candidates who want to run in this year’s election. The 2023 walkout paralyzed the Legislature for weeks and only ended after Republicans forced concessions from Democrats on a sweeping bill related to expanding access to abortion and transgender health care and another measure regarding the manufacture and transfer of undetectable firearms, known as ghost guns. Oregon voters approved Measure 113 by a wide margin following Republican walkouts in the Legislature in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.'}]"

Brandon Hogan, Digital Editor JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis held a news conference Thursday morning at an airport in Jacksonville, announcing the Florida National Guard and State Guard would deploy to Texas amid what he calls an invasion at the U.S.-Mexico border. The Florida State Guard, made up of civilian volunteers, first existed as a WWII-era state defense force active from 1944 to 1947, re-established in 2022 to bolster Florida’s ability to conduct disaster recovery and response efforts. A bill approved last week in a state House committee seeks to allow the State Guard to operate outside of the state any time DeSantis deems necessary, yet it appears the governor isn’t waiting to be demonstrative. “If Texas is helping to erect barriers, putting up razor wire, doing other things to keep illegal aliens out, I want to be helpful with them doing that, I don’t want to be part of the federal government trying to tear down these barriers and let more people in illegally,” DeSantis said, claiming 10 million illegal immigrants have entered the U.S. since President Joe Biden was sworn in. The operation — which will include up to one Florida National Guard battalion and also mark the Florida State Guard’s first ever such deployment — will take place “relatively shortly,” DeSantis said.

The upcoming deployment will also be in response to Texas’ EMAC summons, according to the governor. “The goal is to help Texas fortify this border, help them strengthen the barricades, help them add barriers, help them add the wire that they need to so that we can stop this invasion once and for all. The states have to band together to be able to defend the rule of law, and we see the problems, the drugs, the crime, just the sheer number of people,” DeSantis said. DeSantis was joined at Cecil Airport by Florida State Guard Director Mark Thieme, Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles Executive Director Dave Kerner and John D. Haas, adjutant general of the Florida National Guard. Haas went into further detail regarding the business, past and present, that Florida has in Texas. “The Florida National Guard was the first in the nation to mobilize rotational units to the southwest border in support of Operation Lone Star. During the deployment, the Florida National Guard supplied over 700 soldiers to support border security operations and today, as directed by our governor and commander in chief, we’re again mobilizing the Florida National Guard to provide up to a battalion-size multipurpose task force to support the security operations along the Texas border while continuing to provide critical support to our citizens in the state by conducting ongoing security efforts and related mission sets here in Florida, to include interdiction missions, supporting the Florida Highway Patrol, continued staff support with the Department of Corrections and sustained aviation support in the Florida Keys,” Haas said. DeSantis on Wednesday prevailed in a court battle brought by the Walt Disney Company, granting the state’s motion to dismiss a free speech lawsuit accusing the governor of retaliation over the company’s criticism of Florida’s Parental Rights in Education law after he signed a bill transferring control of Disney’s long-standing special taxing district to a state-appointed board. U.S. District Judge Allen Winsor ruled Disney did not have standing to sue the governor and can’t challenge a facially constitutional action by claiming such a motive. Disney will appeal the decision, according to a statement. When asked Thursday for a comment on the decision, DeSantis said he was shocked Disney intends to appeal, urging the company to move on. “My wife and I believe and I think the vast, vast majority of parents in Florida and throughout the country believe kids should be able to just be kids. You go to school, you’re not having an agenda shoved down your throat, you’re not being told that you can switch genders, you’re focusing on the basics, and so ultimately the initial fight was about that, you know? Disney was against it, they were wrong, we were right and we did that,” DeSantis said. “I’m shocked that they’re saying they’re going to appeal it. I think that’s a mistake. I think that they should just kind of move on. You’re in the state that’s No. 1 for business in America right now. We have the lowest unemployment amongst large states, highest GDP growth amongst large states. Is it so bad that you actually have to live under the same laws as everybody else, including your competitors? Of course not. This is not a matter of high principle for them. This is a matter of them trying to claw back special privileges that they were never entitled to in the first place.” DeSantis also responded to a question regarding his administration’s recent reversal of a policy that allowed Floridians to obtain a driver’s license reflecting their gender identity. Carlos Guillermo Smith, a former Democrat member of the state House, is among critics of the change, having stated in his current capacity as a senior policy analyst for LGBTQ-advocacy group Equality Florida that “these policies are intended to make the transgender community feel unsafe and unwelcome in Florida, and to push them out of public life entirely.” The governor, denying that the move targeted transgender people, harped Thursday on “objective biological realities.” “It’s not targeting anybody. It’s just, we got to recognize, what’s the fact, OK? You’re born one way or another. There’s only two, OK? You know, I (hear) this, like, thing where people say, you know, you have a baby and it’s like a gender assigned at birth? No, no, no, no. I mean, God’s been doing this a while, OK? It’s either one or the other and that’s just what it is,” DeSantis said. “Now, how someone can see to themselves and all that, that is subjective, OK? And so I think what we have to do from the state perspective is just focus on the objective biological realities because the minute you go off of that, the minute it can be subjective. Well, what else can be subjective?” See Thursday’s news conference again in the media player below: Get today’s headlines in minutes with Your Florida Daily: Copyright 2024 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.

29, 2024, 1:23 PM Updated: February 2, 2024, 6:01 PM Mike Holfeld, Investigative Reporter ORLANDO, Fla. – A Central Florida man, who asked not to be identified, fell victim to a random text from a beautiful woman that led to a romance-investment scheme that cost him $50,000 wired to two international banks. The victim told News 6 that a woman who called herself “Lilli” traded photographs with him and started a relationship that went from friendship to romance to an opportunity to make $5,000 dollars a day on a $50,000 investment in Ethereum, a decentralized blockchain platform that establishes a peer-to-peer network. “After a while, she said she wanted to live with me and we’d be together forever,” the victim told News 6. “She told me it was safe, and I trusted her.” The retired Air Force veteran said he was close to retirement and hoped to build his account with the Ethereum investment and then travel with his new love. He said he missed the deadline to capitalize on the $5,000 dollar a day offer and never saw a single dollar in growth. The last day he heard from Lilli was Veterans Day 2023. “I tried to figure out what she saw in an older person like me,” the man told News 6. “I guess it was the money.” Bank records obtained by News 6 confirmed that the funds were wired to banks in Vietnam and Hong Kong. The photos of a young Korean woman used in the scheme appear to be of a Korean model. News 6 was able to track more than 20 photographs of the woman, but there were various names and settings and no evidence that the model is linked to the scheme. News 6 presented the records to the U.S. Secret Service Field Office in Orlando to determine if the funds could be traced. Special Agent in Charge Caroline O’Brien-Buster said the lost funds are just a small part of what is likely an elaborate international investment scheme. “He’s not going to get the money back. All of his money went overseas,” O’Brien-Buster said. “They’ll blast out hundreds, thousands of these accidental texts in hopes to get one or two people to respond back to them. It’s a business for these guys.” The U.S. Secret Service urges anyone that receives investment opportunities to use the internet for some basic research. “If somebody were to present you with a company that is offering high-yield returns, just do a simple Google search on them,” O’Brien-Buster told News 6. “(Don’t use) the link they are giving you, just take the name of the company. You would be so thankful if you did that rather than fall for one of these scams.” The Federal Trade Commission reported that consumers lost $8.8 billion to scams in 2022, with $3.8 billion of that specifically lost to investment schemes. In the first nine months of 2023, the FTC reported that $3.7 billion lost in investment-related scams, with cryptocurrency used as the top payment method.
