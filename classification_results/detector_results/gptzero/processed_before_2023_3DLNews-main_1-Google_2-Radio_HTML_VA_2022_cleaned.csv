Hey babes, I know you’re all sweating and stressing right now thinking: What music am I gonna play while grilling for my wife and kids!?. Fret not, sweet child, for I come to you today with the best albums for all of your memorial day grilling needs. To clarify, these albums don’t necessarily represent patriotism (or America, for that matter). These picks have more of an emphasis on the barbecue itself. I decided to focus on this subject to make it more inclusive to those who celebrate American holidays not for their history, but to exploit any instance to engage in the rare joy of throwing some shit on the grill.

Very cinematic, definitely reminds me of Applesauce Tears (who are also on the label). It's at its best when it's playing with L/R audio switches and swells, but sometimes it can fall into the trap of sounding like a pretty average jam band. Instrumentation is about what you would expect, standard drums, reverb-y guitar, little bass for texture. Definitely suffers from a lack of variety as a whole but makes up for it with being surprisingly interesting at points and nice to just space out to.
