Dave Miller: This is Think Out Loud on OPB. I’m Dave Miller. It has been a busy year in Oregon news. 2023 saw the longest legislative walkout in state history and the first ever teachers’ strike in Portland Public Schools. Oregon’s Secretary of State Shemia Fagan, who was next in line to be governor, resigned amid an ethics scandal. Voters seemed to sour on the drug decriminalization measure they passed just three years ago. And the national media soured on Portland, a city they could not get enough of a decade ago. What’s more, the first psilocybin service centers in the country are now open and the storied Pac-12 imploded. We’re going to talk about all of these stories and more over the next hour.

The nonprofit focuses on empowering Black and other communities in Oregon and Southwest Washington. Welcome to all three of you. Scott Bruun: Thank you. Anna Griffin: Hey, Dave. Nkenge Harmon Johnson: Thanks, Dave. Miller: I want to start with Measure 110, the ballot measure that Oregon voters overwhelmingly approved in 2020. It decriminalized the possession of small amounts of drugs like heroin and fentanyl and meth. And it funneled cannabis money to a wide variety of addiction treatment services. 2023 was a fascinating year for Measure 110 because a lot of that money finally started getting out the door. And at the same time, according to various polls, large numbers of Oregonians turned against the measure, Scott, what happened? Bruun: Well, I think people drove or walked through the streets of Portland - not just Portland but Salem and Medford and other towns and cities across the state - and realized that the public use of drugs, the crime, the vandalism, the homelessness that’s directly related to that didn’t work. And I think a lot of Oregonians felt they were sold a bill of goods with Measure 110 three years ago. Miller: Draw the line for us between Measure 110 and what you’re saying people all over the state saw? What is the direct connection for you? And what are you assuming the connection is for other people? Bruun: I think the most obvious connection is… I’ll give you an example. Last Friday, a week ago today, my wife and I were [in] downtown [Portland] for a Christmas breakfast event. And the parking structure where we parked, we get into the elevator, and this was actually a quote unquote “nice” part of town. In the elevator was a gentleman stooped over completely. I mean, conscious and all that but drugged out. And I think that’s just not uncommon anymore. And I think that keeps people from going into the bigger cities, especially Portland. I think it’s a challenge. I think one of the lost parts of the conversation of all this is what has changed with kind of the drug epidemic that we’re currently dealing with. We’ve always had drug abuse, we’ve always had overdoses. But what we’re seeing right now with Measure 110 in Portland, other cities, is something that we’ve never seen before. Not only do we have the addictions and the overdoses - and people have always died from overdoses, don’t get me wrong - the exponential increase in just flat-out death is unprecedented. And so Measure 110 took, I think, some tired old notions, some tired dogmas, some old way of dealing with things, at the same time that fentanyl and carfentanyl and these other things, synthetics - I mean, fentanyl’s 50 times as strong as heroin - are coming onto the market. So it just simply doesn’t work. Miller: Nkenge, how do you think a huge policy change like drug decriminalization should be assessed? I mean, what, to you, is the data that matters or what are the outcomes that you think we should be paying the most attention to? Harmon Johnson: Well, Dave, I’ll start with the fact that the fentanyl crisis and drug overdoses are up all across America. You walk through any city in America, you will see the kinds of things that my colleague here was just talking about. It’s not special to Portland, but Measure 110, in decriminalizing drugs, is special to Portland. So it’s not as if those places that are still hard on drugs and really fighting the war against drugs in the old fashioned way, have different outcomes. So I want to be clear with our listeners today that Measure 110 didn’t cause what we’re seeing on our streets. Fentanyl has caused what we’re seeing in our streets. Beyond that, a lack of treatment for people caused what we’re seeing in our streets. And I think it’s really important for us to pay attention to that. In terms of what metrics I would like to see… before the pandemic and it’s the last time I’m familiar with this number [audio cuts out], we are a high addiction, low treatment state and then [audio cuts out] alcohol, not drugs, alcohol. And when some of us attempted to pass a tax on [inaudible] in our state so that we could pay for more addiction treatment, there was huge pushback from the industry. I understand why. But other big industries and chambers of commerce were silent about it. They didn’t have the outrage that they have currently found Measure 110. So I would love to see, frankly, what the numbers are now in terms of the number of Oregonians who die each day because of addiction, both drugs and alcohol. Let’s be clear, the number was already much too high, and alcohol was the bigger threat to health and safety of Oregonians. And we did nothing about it. But suddenly, now that certain people have to see the scourge in their elevators and in their downtown and the places that they love that used to be free of such images, [audio cuts out] helpful ways, they just want to sort of recriminate and go back to the old-fashioned stuff that we know doesn’t work that way. We were already losing some Oregonians [each] day. They can’t tell me that the idea of recriminalizing, doing some of these new things that they’re about to pump a lot of money into convincing Oregonians are gonna work, will actually work because we’ve tried them before and people [were] dying. Miller: Nkenge, we’re gonna work on your connection because you were cutting out a little bit here and there. Anne, one of the things that both Nkenge and Scott were talking about there, is this confluence of the voter-passed Measure 110. And I remember hearing a little bit about fentanyl before 2020, but nothing like today. And the numbers bear that out. I mean, how much of what we’re talking about here is bad luck? The timing of the flood of fentanyl hitting around the country right when Measure 110 was taking effect? Griffin: Yeah, I think that’s such a smart point because it’s far too simple to say drug decriminalization is the reason we are seeing so much public drug use, is the reason overdoses are up, is the reason the world is falling apart. Measure 110 was pushed on Oregon by outside groups that saw this as a place where they could pilot decriminalization, where there were voters willing to say yes to that. Advocates for the recovery community in Oregon, when Measure 110 was on the ballot, were saying “We are not ready for this. We do not have the programs in place. It is not gonna work the way you think it’s gonna work.” That is exactly what has happened. It’s not just Measure 110 and a rise in fentanyl. It is [also] a state that does not have the systems in place to provide recovery services for people. And so I think it’s way too simplistic to say it’s drug decriminalization. I also think it’s way too simplistic to say it’s fentanyl. The reality is we don’t have the network of supports to do what we said we’re going to do. That’s why we’re in the mess that we’re in. Miller: Well, I want to turn, Scott, to this. The second half of Measure 110, which has absolutely'}]"

Actually, technically, the committee won’t speak until the 2023 Heisman Trophy is announced Saturday night. But the votes are in! While we don’t know who will walk away with hardware, we do know the four finalists who traveled to New York City to claim their prize: Simply put, every star listed could’ve been a Heisman front-runner in different seasons. All of them have legitimate claims to the award in 2023, and if it wasn’t obvious, that is a ridiculous amount of talent packed into four players taking over NYC. With this year’s Heisman presentation nearly upon us, it’s time for one last review of the field, as well as one final prediction. *Hit the Oregon Sports News comments to share your winner before Saturday’s 2023 Heisman Trophy presentation. **You can watch the presentation live on ESPN Saturday, starting at 5 p.m. PT. Team: Ohio State Buckeyes Year: Junior Position: WR Preseason Odds: +2,000 (13th — DraftKings) Current Odds: +20,000 (4th — SI) Marvin Harrison Jr might be the name that resonated most with fans this season. Between Harrison’s legendary NFL namesake and his ridiculous stat lines—not to mention a fierce trading card market—the junior wide receiver was easy to gawk at while scrolling highlights every Saturday. Everyone knew his name. The problem? Heisman Trophies belong to quarterbacks. At least, they do historically. And so far, there’s little reason to believe 800-plus voters will buck that trend this year. The good news for Harrison is that he still checks in as ESPN’s No. 1 talent for the 2024 NFL Draft. That’s more important than the Heisman for an up-and-coming pro, right? Ultimately, Heisman or no Heisman, Harrison deserves his flowers. He’s earned them for this past season, but it’s also for an entire three-year career as a wide receiver with the Buckeyes. This receiver is going to make noise at the next level. And that’s whether he has a Heisman to his name or not when he gets there. Team: Oregon Ducks Year: Senior Position: QB Preseason Odds: +1800 (10th) Current Odds: +1500 (3rd) Remember the concerns around Bo Nix during his transfer to Oregon? Do you recall his first game in 2022 against the Georgia Bulldogs and how he … wait … … neither do I. “Bodacious” Bo. That’s where we stand today. Almost immediately after Game 1 of his Ducks career, Nix started control-alt-DELETING skepticism. Ball control and decision-making became staples of Bo’s game. In no time, he and Dan Lanning looked like locked-in complements sprinting into Year 2. Then, Nix had what felt like a storybook season in 2023…all despite two critical red marks on his record. Losing to Washington and Michael Penix Jr. twice this year was tough. Ultimately, it’ll likely prove the death knell for Bo’s Heisman. Although, the case for his candidacy remains obvious. Bo’s 40 passing touchdowns this season tied LSU’s Jayden Daniels for most across FBS. His 77.2 percent completion rate wasn’t just the second-best in college football—it was the second-best in college football ever. Nix also threw just three interceptions, which can’t be ignored, even by those who claim a dink-and-dunk system diminished him as a Ducks quarterback. Frankly, Bo was the definition of consistent these past 13 games. He was reliable and efficient, both passing and running the ball. More importantly, he commanded the Ducks’ offense and seemed to make everyone around him better game after game. In 2023, Nix was the example of season-long consistency, and from the Pac-12 to the SEC, there haven’t been many before him to do it like this. But that might not do it, necessarily, in the eyes of voters. Not when the competition is so stiff. And not when Oregon—including Bo himself—came up short when it mattered most. Team: Washington Huskies Year: Senior Position: QB Preseason 2023 Heisman Trophy Odds: +1600 (7th) Current Odds: +900 (2nd) Michael Penix Jr. did something no other quarterback did this season. He beat Bo Nix. In fact, he beat him twice. That played into voters’ Heisman decisions. The question, of course, is how much voters weighed those two wins and the final rankings against season-long individual bodies of work. Penix’s 4,218 passing yards were the best in the nation this season. That’s a check for season-long body of work, no doubt. Also, his 33 touchdowns were met by just nine interceptions. Those numbers, however, happened to be the worst totals among all three Heisman-leading quarterbacks. While Washington escaped death during the second half of the season, proving mettle in close games, it still showed vulnerability. The Huskies will take that if it leads to a Sugar Bowl win on Jan. 1. But it might not be the evidence Penix needs to bring home his own trophy come Saturday. Team: LSU Tigers Year: Senior Position: QB Preseason 2023 Heisman Trophy Odds: +1100 (2nd) Current Odds: -1200 (1st) What is there to say about this guy other than sheeesh? As much praise as you have for Bo Nix and his body of work, Jayden Daniels finished atop FBS with 4,946 yards of total offense. That’s 573 more yards than Bo, despite Daniels playing one fewer game than Nix over the course of the season. Like Nix, Daniels also landed a stat in the “second-best ever” category this season. His 11.7 yards per attempt were exactly that—the second-best ever—and his 40 passing touchdowns were also met with 1,134 yards rushing yards. This guy was an absolute video game. And as soon as Bo Nix took his second L of the year to none other than Penix and the Huskies, Daniels’ Heisman stock rose significantly. Of course, it seems three losses are something the committee can look past when the two other leaders in the category cancel each other out. That’s a tough reality for both Nix and Pennix. Do we have four capable Heisman winners here? You bet. Of course, we do. But, like every season, there can only be one. This year, the 2023 Heisman Trophy goes to… WINNER: Jayden Daniels, QB — LSU No. 2: Bo Nix, QB — Oregon No. 3: Michael Penix Jr., QB — Washington No. 4: Marvin Harrison Jr., WR — Ohio State This is the only outcome we can expect at this point. You saw the odds above. No one is coming through with the upset over Daniels. For Nix, it’s impossible to know what the parallel universe looks like. The universe where Oregon wins the Pac-12, and both he and the Ducks storm toward a national championship. Odds are, Nix is your 2023 Heisman favorite in that universe. But alas, here we are. Penix’s inconsistencies against his overall body of work are worth a bronze medal—not runner-up status. So we have Daniels No. 1, Nix second, Penix third, and Harrison finishing fourth. The final, official tally will be fascinating. It will reveal a lot about how the committee leans: toward individual and season-long success or winning at the right time to contend for a national championship. Either way, this will likely be another way Bo Nix came up short. But that’s not to take away from his season, and, of course, it’s not to take away from his time at Oregon. “Bodacious” Bo should, and will, go down as one of the greatest Ducks of all time. The quarterback just came up a win short, as so many Oregon greats before him have. @750TheGame | @OregonSportNews An error occurred while subscribing you to the newsletter.
