Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:31 am BERNARDSVILLE – Anyone looking to buy a piece of local history in a quiet residential neighborhood will soon have the opportunity to acquire the house where Academy Award winning actress Meryl Streep once lived as a teen-ager. Beth and Dennis McConnell say they are planning to sell their four-bedroom home at 21 Old Fort Road after 32 years. While the McConnells raised their own two children here – and have lived in the house much longer than any previous owner – it’s still known by many as “the Meryl Streep house’’ from a time more than a half century ago when the world-famous actress was honing her skills on the Bernards High School stage. And the McConnells are fine with that. When they purchased the home back in 1989, the Realtor used the celebrity connection to market the property. Asked if they planned to do the same, Dennis McConnell didn’t hesitate. “How can you not?’’ he said with a smile. “Everyone in town knows Meryl Streep grew up in Bernardsville. I think it’s pretty common knowledge.’’ It’s been 54 years since Streep, now 72, was graduated in 1967 from Bernards High, where she was a cheerleader, homecoming queen and lead actress in “Li’l Abner.’’ Mary Louise “Meryl’’ Streep, was born on June 22, 1949, in Summit. She then lived in Basking Ridge before her parents, artist Mary Wilkinson Streep and pharmaceutical executive Harry William Streep Jr., built the house on Old Fort Road in 1963. She has two younger brothers, Harry William Streep III and Dana David Streep, who used to play ball with neighborhood kids. Her parents, now deceased, left Bernardsville when retiring to Connecticut in 1976. Their famous daughter hasn’t made many public appearances locally since, but that hasn’t diminished her star power. “When we first purchased the home, a tour bus would come by every once in a while,’’ Dennis McConnell remembered. “It blew me away.’’ He had no idea where the bus originated. “I don’t know where they came from. They’d come around the corner and stop at the end of the driveway and look. I guess they probably also went up to Mike Tyson’s place,’’ he speculated, referring to the former world heavyweight boxing champ who also called Bernardsville home for a short spell. “It was pretty funny.’’ Unexpected Visits Over the years, the McConnells had a few unexpected visitors. “Every once in a while, someone would come up the driveway while I was working and ask if this was Meryl Streep’s house,’’ Dennis said. “In the beginning there were a lot more people who would stop by and want to know.’’ They recalled one instance about a decade ago when a vehicle stopped by. Meryl and her family were known to be attending a wedding at the Somerset Hills Country Club here in town. “I walked down to the end of the driveway and I introduce myself and say, ‘Hey can I help you?’’ Dennis said. “They said, ‘Oh, we’re just looking at the house.’’ “There was a guy driving and a girl in the passenger seat who looked just like Meryl,’’ he continued. “I think it was her daughter – her daughter looks just like her. I assume it was her uncle, one of Meryl’s brothers, and they were just driving around looking at stuff, reminiscing. He was mentioning how he used to live here.’’ Beth McConnell said one of last unexpected visits occurred around 2001. She thinks it was a former high school boyfriend from Meryl’s teen-age days stopping by. “He drove by as I was getting out of the car to get the mail,’’ she said. “He said, ‘Do you know whose house you’re living in’? I said yes, and he then went into how he used to date her when they were in school. I said is your name Mike? He said yes. I said I have a letter that you wrote – would you like to see it? He said, sure! He came in and we chatted for while. He was a nice guy.’’ The letter is one of the few mementos left behind by the actress. According to the McConnells, the previous owners of the house discovered the letter – handwritten in pencil – behind a bedroom mirror. Dated Aug. 12, 1963, with an 8 cent stamp, it was addressed to Meryl Streep, Old Fort Road. They passed it on to the McConnells, who have since had it framed. “Meryl, I’m out of money already so I don’t think I’ll call,’’ the writer, Mike, wrote. “I might have have enough to talk for 3 minutes or so.’’ “I haven’t had any dates but I’ve been to a few parties and dances,’’ he continued. “How’s your promise doing? I’m afraid to ask. I hope you keep it.’’ “This isn’t much of a letter but it’s late and I’m tired,’’ he concluded. “I miss you.’’ The McConnells now display it inside their home. There were few other physical reminders left behind by the Streep family. One was simply name “Meryl’’ handwritten on a window screen. “We know which room was Meryl’s because they used to have wood screens that went into the windows,’’ Dennis said. “And in her room, ‘Meryl’ was written on the top part of the screen. It looked like something her father would do, so when he took the screens out, he knew exactly where they’d go.’’ ‘Every One’ The McConnells are both fans of Streep’s movies and rattled off several when asked if they have a favorite: “Kramer vs. Kramer, Sophie’s Choice, Out of Africa...’’ “I’ve seen every one of them, absolutely,’’ Dennis said. “But we’re not stalkers.’’ Beth remarked. “She’s just such a great actress.’’ Still, after having lived here for more than three decades, they say they don’t dwell on the fact that one of one of America’s greatest living actresses once lived here. “I guess we don’t really think about it because we’ve been here so long,’’ Beth said. “Until somebody brings it up.’’ Which happens on occasion. “We were always introduced as, ‘Oh, they live in Meryl Streep’s house,’ “ Dennis McConnell said. “It’s always been a great cocktail party mention.’’ Despite the passage of time, the current owners don’t want their abode to be known as the McConnell house. “It’s got to remain the Streep house for marketing purposes,’’ Dennis laughed. They haven’t put the house on the market yet, but recently expressed their intent to sell on Facebook. The reaction was swift. “People made amazing, wonderful comments,’’ Beth said. She said they have no definitive future plans but expect to “stay in the area just because of our jobs right now.’’ Beth works with Raritan Headwater Association in donor relations and events. Dennis is executive vice president at Jones Lang LaSalle IP, Inc., (JLL) a commercial real estate firm in Parsippany. “We probably won’t buy anything else right now,’’ Beth said. “Our next move will probably be some place where our kids will like to vacation instead of coming back to the neighborhood.’’ Their children, Greyson, 30, and Waverly, 27, are both on their own, but enjoy coming home, she noted. The McConnells say they were first attracted to the area when they attended the Far Hills Race Meeting while in their 20s. “We used to go to the hunt when we were young,’’ Beth said. “We used to come out and just drive around, pick up a copy of The Bernardsville News and look at the houses,’’ Dennis recalled. They say Old Fort Road remains a great place to raise a family. “It’s right in the middle of everything,’’ Dennis said. “You’re two minutes from Shop-Rite, you’re a minute from the high school, the middle school, the town pool. “So if you have kids, they can walk everywhere,’’ Beth said. “But it’s still private.’’ “You have to give Harry Streep credit,’’ Dennis added. “He picked a good location.’’ Log In BE YOURSELF.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:31 am THE CHATHAMS – The School District of the Chathams kicked off the 2021-22 school year on Monday, Aug. 30. For the first time in more than 18 months, all students in the district were in person, following a traditional live instruction schedule. The first day of school 2021 was markedly different than 2020. When the buildings opened on Monday, students had full access to all facilities such cafeterias, libraries, art and music rooms, playgrounds and lockers, which were largely closed all of last year. This year, the district will continue to utilize outdoor spaces for classroom instruction, physical education and snack/lunch whenever the weather permits. On Monday, students were eager to see friends and were enthusiastic about returning to the classroom. Teachers were excited to have full in person classrooms and no longer required to provide live and virtual instruction simultaneously. Parents were ecstatic to have their children in school for a full day, even if some were adjusting to the pre-Labor Day start of the year. A rainbow arching over Chatham High School provided a picturesque ending to the day following a power outage which had impacted a majority of the schools. Log In BE YOURSELF.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:31 am FLORHAM PARK - The police department welcomed two new officers at a Borough Council meeting Thursday, Dec. 9, one a Florham Park native. Mathew Liberato, 21, of Florham Park, and Ryan Cassidy, 22, of Marlboro, were sworn in as the newest members of the department following unanimous votes from the Borough Council. Liberato, a graduate of Hanover Park Regional High School, where he was a star wrestler, moved to town with his family eight years ago. After attending West Virginia University on a wrestling scholarship for about a year, he returned home, bought into his father’s seal-coating business and began attending the County College of Morris, he said. “It’s very exciting,” he said of joining his hometown police department prior to the meeting. “I’m excited to help out in the community that I live in.” Both he and Cassidy will join the police department effective Jan. 1, after which they will undergo training at the Morris County Public Safety Academy beginning Jan. 10. They will earn starting salaries of $27,145, Borough Clerk Sheila Williams said after the meeting. Cassidy was born in Staten Island before his family moved to Marlboro, he said. He is a graduate of Marlboro High School and The College of New Jersey, where he played football and earned a degree in health and exercise science. “This is a great opportunity here in a great place to live and a great department, from everybody I’ve met,” he said prior to the meeting. “So, I’m just really excited to get started.” Several members of the police department attended the meeting, including Chief Joe Orlando, who invited Liberato and Cassidy to introduce themselves to the council. The two received rounds of applause from the council and crowd, as well as hugs from family members, after swearing their oaths of office.

New Zealand plans to ban young people from ever buying cigarettes in their lifetime in one of the world's toughest crackdowns on the tobacco industry, arguing that other efforts to extinguish smoking were taking too long. Steps to end smoking in Atlantic City’s casinos were endorsed by the state Assembly’s deputy speaker Tuesday. Assemblyman Paul Moriarty, D-Gloucester, Camden, issued a statement supporting legislation to end smoking in the casinos. The proposed bill also has support from other lawmakers as casino workers continue to pressure Trenton into enacting the law they say will protect their health. “It is unconscionable that any workers in New Jersey would knowingly be subjected to carcinogens in the workplace,” said Moriarty, who also Tuesday announced himself as the bill’s fourth sponsor. “It is time for New Jersey to treat casino employees as equal to other service industry workers and prohibit smoking in casinos.” New Jersey banned casino smoking temporarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but workers and unions have campaigned for a permanent ban to the practice. Casinos in surrounding states have already banned smoking in their buildings. Earlier this year, Philadelphia’s Parx Casino, the state’s highest-grossing casino in 2019, extended its smoke-free policies implemented due to the pandemic, Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights said. ATLANTIC CITY — Even before New Jersey residents voted to legalize marijuana in 2020, suppor… Last week, dozens of casino workers traveled to Trenton for a protest seeking to incite lawmakers to pass the anti-smoking bill while they mulled potential tax breaks for casinos. The smoking-ban bill has lingered in Trenton for more than a year, jumping in and out of committees without formal action. Gov. Phil Murphy has said he intends to sign the bill once it arrives at his desk. Many casino workers want the ban passed to create safe work environments, specifically those with preexisting health conditions or pregnant employees. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health says casino workers are at greater risk for lung and heart disease because of secondhand smoke exposure, and a study in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine found casino air to potentially have 50 times more cancer-causing particles than air on rush-hour highways, according to the bill. The Casino Association of New Jersey, the casinos’ trade group, has said making the city’s casinos smoke-free would cost them customers. ATLANTIC CITY — Described variously as a bar or a cannabis club, the Rekt Café on Bellevue A… “Scare tactics about revenue and job loss are just that — efforts to maintain the status quo, even as it threatens the health of thousands of New Jersey workers,” said Cynthia Hallett, president and CEO of Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights. “By signing on as a prime sponsor of legislation to eliminate the casino smoking loophole, Assemblyman Moriarty is listening to the voices of thousands of workers instead of the big tobacco and gaming lobbyists.” The Assembly bill also has a Senate equivalent co-sponsored by state Sen. Vince Polistina, R-2nd, and his predecessor, former Sen. Chris Brown.

ROSELLE PARK, NJ — Roselle Park Mayor Joseph Signorello III and Roselle Park attorney Frank Capece have a long history in the area, as do their families. “I think both of our families go back to the early 1900s in Roselle Park,” said Signorello on Wednesday, Jan. 13. “I think it’s 1904. We go back to the inception of it. We’ve known each other for a long time, and now my dad, Joseph Signorello Jr., is on council, I’m the mayor, Frank is one of our attorneys, and it’s one, big, happy Roselle Park family. “My great-grandfather, for sure, is considered a longtimer in town,” he continued. “Grandpa Frenchy, as we called him, knew everyone in town, because he basically started the town watering hole at the town bar. When you’re the owner of the bar, you become a pretty popular guy pretty quickly. The bar still exists, and is called Frenchy’s Bar & Grill in Roselle Park.” The mayor said Capece’s grandfather knew his great-grandfather, starting a tradition of friendship. At one time, the mayor’s father, Joseph Signorello Jr., a former Roselle Park fire chief and councilman at large, owned Frenchy’s. When Capece, who is a columnist for Union County LocalSource, was a councilman, he was in licensing and transportation. He had to give approval for Signorello Jr.’s father to have games in the establishment. To Capece, there was a constant interaction between the two families. When Joe Signorello came to the United States from Italy, he had four sons — Frank, or “Frenchy”; Joe; John; Steve — and two daughters — Palmer and Jenny. Frank’s son, Joseph Signorello Sr., is 83 years old and still owns Frenchy’s. Joseph Signorello Sr.’s nephew, another Frank, runs Frenchy’s. “My grandfather Frenchy was one of the first residents to have a car,” Signorello Jr. said. “Back in the ’20s, they didn’t have an ambulance and there was no such thing as a first aid squad. My grandfather used to take people to the hospital in Elizabeth. It was quite often he would take people to the hospital. I’m proud to tell that story. He worked hard. He had two jobs and did what he had to do. Long ago, people didn’t have any money, so they bartered. They really helped each other out with a trade or a profession.” Capece said his grandfather, Prospero, who he also considers a longtimer of Roselle Park, died in 1964. He had come to the United States from Basiglio, Italy. He and Capece’s grandmother, Angela, came to Roselle Park in 1905. “He was a mason contractor, and the joke among my family was I was much more like him and not my father,” said Capece on Friday, Jan. 8. “My father was gregarious and friendly, but my grandfather was tough. I remember my cousin, Iggy, once told me something. You learn these things as you get older, but he said, ‘You have to understand, these immigrants came from a tough place, and they brought with them a tough attitude.’ “They had huge families,” Capece continued. “My grandfather had four boys and four girls: Jerry, Danny, Frank, Alfred, Jessi, Vira, Helen, Mary. That was culturally what happened. You had big families. He lived on East Lincoln and he was tough, even at the end. So, with my family, there was a very familiar connection to the town.” The Signorello family moved to Roselle Park in the early 1900s for better opportunities. “It’s a common story,” Signorello said. “I come from Italian immigrants, and, with a lot of folks, there is always a migration from the city to the suburbs. Elizabeth was the big city, where all the Italians kind of came in first through Elizabeth and Newark. When all these old families started having kids and wanting a little more space, you started to look around, and Roselle Park had more space at the time. It was a nice town, close to family, and you have a backyard here where the kids can run around and play. I think it’s an age-old story, especially for folks who’ve immigrated to the United States. You come in, start a family and you look for more space.” Capece’s grandfather moved his family to Roselle Park in the early 1900s for the same reasons. “It was part of the mass generation of immigrants that came to this country,” Capece said. “It never ceases to amaze me that, because of the decisions he made, I ended up in Roselle Park, I ended up a councilman in Roselle Park, I ended up dragging my wife to Roselle Park and then to Cranford. So, these immigrants, who came to this country, they set roots that still flourish. “This is a bittersweet memory, but I’ll drive through Roselle Park and point out Aunt Helen’s house, but Aunt Helen is deceased,” he continued. “Or point out my Aunt Vira’s house, but Aunt Vira and Uncle Jimmy are gone. But in my mind’s eye, that’s still their homes.” Capece said he didn’t know how close his grandfather and Signorello’s great-grandfather were. “I don’t know how much they interacted,” Capece said. “But I think it’s symbolic how two immigrants came to this country, and that their offspring would be fairly successful. Everything you hear about the American dream, that’s what happened. It’s hard for me to say how much of an interaction there was, but there was an amazing pride. Everybody knew everyone in Roselle Park.” The mayor said he’s well aware of his great-grandfather and Capece’s grandfather crossing paths multiple times. To him, they were friends. “They’ve all been in the same social circle, because Roselle Park is a small town,” Signorello said. “We’ve all been in the same social circles for a long time, but my family, in particular, we’ve always been involved heavily with supporting local youth groups, baseball, football, now soccer. My grandfather was on the board of education, so he was involved with that. My father, for a long time, was the fire chief before he became a councilman, so we’ve just been involved, and the Capece family has as well. But mostly through sports and helping out youth programs. They were definitely friends.” Joseph Signorello Jr. spoke to how close the two longtimers of Roselle Park and their families were. “His dad, my great-grandfather Joe and Frenchy (and) the Capeces were masons,” Signorello Jr. said on Jan. 18. “My great-grandfather and grandfather helped dig out the basements and get them prepped, because my grandfather had the horses and plows. So, in terms of their relationship, they were masons and they used to build the foundations, so that’s how their relationship worked out. By getting the foundations ready. The Capeces built the foundations, while the Signorellos dug the basement out. They used to work with another family, which is the Venturo family. They were the masons also. “My great-grandfather’s house was on 333 W. Clay Ave., and I think the Capeces were 170 W. Clay Ave,” he continued. “I met Frank Capece early in the ’80s and knew his cousin, Mark Rosso, who was killed on the Parkway at 52, two years after my son passed. Rosso’s son, Thomas, and my younger son, Mark, are extremely close. They’re both 24 years old and they both have matching tattoos.” Capece said he was proud that the new Borough Hall on Westfield Avenue was built by his father. “He was a contractor, and he built the building,” said Capece. “The advantage my father and my uncles had: They were all mason contractors. He would take me around and show me what he built.” Capece also remembered great things about his grandfather that he still holds dear to this day, recalling the expressions he brought over from Italy. “One was, ‘Nobody’s going to tell you to wash your face, so you look cleaner than they do.’ There were so many of these expressions that he brought with him from Basiglio,” he said. “He had so many of these that they pop into my mind now, years later.

He would cite quotes from films and books – some classic ones and some obscure.

At The Two River Times he would churn out article after article, throwing his heart and his words into the story. With his soothing voice and interviewing skills, he helped his subjects tell their stories – be it grade schoolers raising money, an employee who felt wronged or a homeowner whose house was destroyed in Super Storm Sandy. Sharing a fair, balanced article was important to John. “John believed in the power of journalism to serve the public good, and he gave it his all,” said Eileen Moon, former editor of The Two River Times, who hired John.“He loved the word ‘bespoke,’ and I think now that John was bespoke himself – a classic, custom-made, old-time reporter who loved nothing more than a council meeting; a controversy; a tempest in the proverbial teapot of local news,” she said. “John loved to tell stories – in print and off the cuff,” she said. “He was a movie buff.

John interviewed Forest, a community activist, as he covered borough issues. “He was a competent, professional journalist, because he was thorough. And that’s what you want – you want truth and you want real journalism.” The two men, who met while working in journalism, teamed up to review films in recent years. “We were sort of like Siskel and Ebert,” said Forest, who recorded the reviews and posted them on his Facebook page. “John was passionate about movies.” “John had a gift for people, a wonderful soul,” he said. “I’m honored to be his friend.” “He was an extraordinarily rare individual,” Pat Menna, mayor of Red Bank said. “John had an uncanny ability to get his story out from a human perspective.” According to Menna, “That was part of his humanity.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:31 am LEBANON TWP. – Republican Guy Wilson was sworn in as the newest member of the Township Committee at its Wednesday, Nov. 17, meeting. He replaces Republican Abe Abuchowski, who was appointed in January of this year to fill the unexpired term of Republican Brian Wunder, who resigned last year. Wilson was the sole candidate for the one one-year unexpired term on committee to replace Committeeman Abuchowski who chose not to run for re-election. No Democrats were on the ballot. Open Space The township preserved several parcels of open space over the years. Now the challenge is naming them. Adam Duckworth, chair of the Environmental and Open Space Commission, presented some suggestions for names to the Township Committee. He also explained why the right name is so important. “The parcels we own should have a formal name,” he said, explaining the name needs to make it easy for visitors to look up directions. The township has five separate open space parcels that are not yet named. The township named the Red Mill Race Preserve a few years ago. Three of the remaining should be named together, Duckworth said. He said the committee has discussed naming and has consulted Kathy Koch of the township historians. Duckworth also reached out to some residents of the Bunnvale section who use the open space in that part of the township. The commission came up with recommendations for two parcels. The small area abutting Mickwin woods should be named the Wood Glen-Mickwin Trail, Duckworth said. The 150 acres in the area of the township that used to be called Anthonytown should be the Anthony Preserve, Duckworth said. Mayor Mike Schmidt said that land does have some access off Anthony Road. As for the three combined parcels, the primary access is off Sunrise Mountain Road. Duckworth said the committee came up with suggestions of Bunnvale Preserve, Sunrise Preserve or BearBunn Preserve in recognition of the many bear sightings there. Committee members said maybe BunnBear would work better. The committee will take the suggestions under advisement for another meeting. Township Attorney Matthew Lyons said the formal names should be designated by ordinance. Memorial Donations The committee will create a policy for memorial donations on municipal property. Committee members Marc Laul and Beverly Koehler are working on a policy for accepting donations in memory of township residents. Laul noted Memorial Park has a committee that takes care of the property and any donations. Koehler and Laul checked how other municipalities handle it. They said the museum and library can make decisions on their own donations. Schmidt said the committee should set up categories of donations. Small ones such as the personalized pavers, which aren’t necessarily memorials, are one thing. Benches and other items the township could use are another and large donations, like structures, are a third. The committee will also keep discussing this matter. Medical Cannabis The only member of the public to comment at this meeting had something to say about the last committee meeting. Joanne Letters of Mt. Kipp road said she felt blindsided by the committee listening to a medical marijuana group because the township had just opted out of considering recreational marijuana facilities in the township. “I would think it should be a package deal,” she said. She also noted that the headline in the Nov. 10 issue of the Hunterdon Review seemed to indicate the township had allowed the medical marijuana facility, which isn’t really its jurisdiction. Committeewoman Koehler noted at the beginning of the meeting that she received calls from people confused by the headline. Koehler read a statement of clarification, which can be viewed along with this story at HunterdonReview.com. Additionally, although the committee did not comment at the time, in a telephone interview, Mayor Schmidt also clarified that medical cannabis is governed by the state, not the township, and has nothing to do with recreational marijuana. He said in 2019, when the state opened the door for medical cannabis growers to apply, one of the requirements was a letter from the municipality saying there is nothing in the local ordinances to stand in in the way. Schmidt, the township and Planning Board attorneys and the zoning officer all met with representatives of the NAR Group, which hopes to create a medicinal cannabis facility on vacant land off Anthony Road. The mayor said none of the officials weighed in with an opinion on the facility; they just noted as requested that there is no specific ordinance prohibiting it. Because of state delays, NAR was not able to move forward. Now, they can go before the township Board of Adjustment to determine if the facility would conform to the rural conservation zone. The property, at 62 Anthony Road, is the site of the former Diamond Aerosol plant, Schmidt said. Years ago, the township carved out a small industrial zone and in the 1970s the Diamond family built their factory. There was an Environmental Protection Agency action on the site in 2010-11, he said. The EPA and the state Department of Environmental Protection may have to examine the site again. In addition, NAR will have to be able to prove there is enough water on the land to support such a water-intensive business. The township planning board will have to approve a site plan for the facility as well. Schmidt said he understands Diamond Aerosol used some “nasty chemicals.” It also had a number of tractor trailers entering and leaving the property. The property has been vacant since the plant closed. The next Lebanon Township Committee meeting will take place at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, Dec. 1, at the municipal building at 530 West Hill Road. Republican Guy Wilson was sworn in as the newest member of the Lebanon Township Committee at its Wednesday, Nov. 17, meeting. LEBANON TWP. — The Township Committee confirmed zoning compliance for a medical cannabis company, during the Wednesday, Nov. 3, meeting. Log In BE YOURSELF.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:35 am Bordentown City history enthusiasts want the state to reconsider its plans to replace the 1831 Farnsworth Avenue Stone Arch Carriage Bridge and Tunnel. The conservation of one of Bordentown City’s most prominent historic sites — the Joseph Bonaparte estate — has made headlines from the Philadelphia Inquirer to the New York Times (and U.S. 1, too). But some local preservationists have their sights set on another landmark in the city. Under the city, too. The Farnsworth Avenue Stone Arch Carriage Bridge and Tunnel was slated to be replaced based on a plan proposed by the New Jersey Department of Transportation. The state cites shortcomings, including missing stones, water leakage, cracked and bulging walls, voids, and scaling. The tunnel’s inadequate vertical clearance, the state said, renders it functionally obsolete. But residents and historians argue that the site, which dates back to the 1830s, should instead be preserved and restored. “The state says it’s falling apart, but others say it’s not,” said Doug Kiovsky, vice president of the Bordentown Historical Society. “If anything, it should be rehabilitated, not destroyed. Once you do that, that’s history. That’s it.” The Farnsworth Avenue bridge is the oldest carriage bridge constructed over modern railroad tracks made of rolled iron and inverted T-rails, wrote local train enthusiast Pierre Lacombe in a letter to the Department of Transportation. It dates back to the Camden & Amboy Railroad, the state’s first permanent railroad and one of the first in the country. The bridge and tunnel is the largest manmade structure along the entirety of the C&A corridor. “It’s a significant bridge,” Kiovsky said. “It’s kind of like a bookend. The John Bull locomotive went right under that tunnel. This was the first tunnel that the John Bull ever went under. Where’s the John Bull now? In the Smithsonian.” The state proposed tearing down the existing structure and replacing it with a prefabricated archway in 2019. The plans also affect the veterans memorial that sits on top of the bridge, at the corner of Farnsworth and Railroad avenues. Under the state’s proposal, the memorial would be removed, store,d and replaced with a new structure, said Stephanie Corbo-Pecht, a longtime Bordentown resident and member of the Bordentown City Veterans Memorial Committee. “The artist’s rendering of the new design was representative of something you’d find in Bucks County, loaded with fieldstone as if it was built in 1700,” she said. “It was definitely not representative of the brick facade of the rest of Bordentown City. The possibility also existed that, because it would be the last stage of the project, the memorial would wind up not being replaced because of time or budgetary restraints.” “That is the first bridge on Earth to have modern rail put underneath it,” Lacombe said. And the reason the tracks go under the bridge instead of on top of it — like many historical finds in town — can be traced back to Joseph Bonaparte. Robert Stevens, the president of the C&A Railroad, envisioned the line traveling over Black Creek, curving along the shoreline of Crosswicks Creek, snaking up Thornton Creek, then ending up behind what used to be the Ocean Spray plant. “It would have been so much easier to cut a notch on the flanks of Crosswicks Creek and a notch going up Thornton Creek rather than digging that huge tunnel,” said Lacombe, a Florence resident and former geologist. But that would have ended up on the far side of the pond located on the Bonaparte estate. Bonaparte objected to the plans. A trained lawyer with plenty of resources, he ended up suing the Camden & Amboy Railroad over its use of eminent domain. The agreement wasn’t for property being used by the state for the state, but a private entity for a private entity. “He fought them by saying it was all just for profit,” Lacombe said. “[C&A] realized they were going to lose in court, so they settled. The settlement was — bingo. ‘Dig a trench through the center of Bordentown, and I’ll let you go across my property at Thornton Creek.” After Lacombe learned about the DOT’s plans two years ago, he prepared a 68-page report outlining the historical significance of the site. “I’m not a bridge engineer more than I’m anything else, but after reading engineering reports for so long, after a while, it was not really correct,” he said. “If I put together a critique of it, they’re not going to listen. However, if I lay out the scientific reasons why I think the facility should be considered a historical site, they can’t say, ‘Nobody told us. We didn’t know.’ They can’t use that as an excuse.” Its original keystone marker, still intact, is dated 1831, and the original stone sleepers are still present around the tracks. Graffiti that goes back to the 1800s — likely the initials of the men who built the structure — can be found on the tunnel walls. Another stone sleeper, he said, was used by a group of government officials, academics, and shipping industry professionals to determine the depth of the Delaware River after the Civil War — “all those issues that are important for navigation and transportation,” Lacombe said. They got together at the Navy base at Sandy Hook in 1883 and monitored sea levels consistently over five years. “The benchmark down on the monument states that this place is 38.96 feet above the mean sea level at Sandy Hook,” Lacombe said. “Only one other was found, in Phillipsburg. It’s pretty neat.” But these artifacts — and the structure itself — are just a slice of the whole C&A pie. “The whole Camden & Amboy corridor is a historical site,” Lacombe said. “It’s accepted as being the first major railroad in New Jersey.” And Kiovsky thinks that could be a big draw to Bordentown in the future — the 200th anniversary of railroading in New Jersey is 10 years down the line. He’d like to see the bridge become part of a rail trail or steam ride, similar to the locomotive in New Hope. “To have something significant like the railroad bridge nominated and saved would help us out from a railroaders standpoint,” he said. “We’re not an Altoona. We’re not a Scranton. But we have some significance in that we have this old bridge that Scranton or Altoona may not have. You’d be very hard-pressed to find any railroad bridge in the United States that says 1831 or older.” He also added that he has found items like original 1830s railroad spikes while out and working on something unrelated to the bridge. Visitors can compare the original rails to modern ones. There are scrape marks on the tunnel from old rail cars that outgrew the space. The historical significance is there, he said. The state just needs to recognize it. “It’s the largest manmade structure along the Camden & Amboy Railroad,” Kiovsky said. “I hope it’s still up in 10 years.” Your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers:'}]"

CHATHAM – The borough will observe two first-time events this fall. Proclamations recognizing National Hispanic Heritage Month and International Stuttering Awareness Day were read into the record and corresponding resolutions were both unanimously passed at a meeting on Monday, Sept. 27. Borough Council member Len Resto, who is of Hispanic decent, delivered the Hispanic Heritage Month proclamation. The celebration lasts from Wednesday, Sept. 15 through Friday, Oct. 15 to coincide with the independence days of several Latin American countries, and was borne out of the growing awareness of the diversity and numerous multicultural identities within the United States during the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s President Lyndon B. Johnson issued a proclamation in 1968 to recognize the first Hispanic Heritage Week. It was then expanded to a full 31 days thanks to the work of California congressman Esteban Torres. The aim is to bring to light the numerous accomplishments and contributions the Hispanic community has made to the country. Resto said he was “very honored” to have read the proclamation and proud to see Hispanic Heritage Month being acknowledged by the borough. “I moved to Chatham 26 years ago and I think I might have been the only Hispanic in town,” he said. “I was accepted by everyone and we’re seeing an increase in diversity.” He said recognizing the different ways in which the Hispanic population has helped the nation thrive is “nice to see”. Resto said there are a number of individuals among the borough’s workforce of Hispanic descent and said this proclamation would likely make them proud. Stopping The Stuttering Stigma The second proclamation was for International Stuttering Awareness Day, which is coming up on Friday, Oct. 22. Council President Carolyn Dempsey was bestowed the honor of reading the proclamation. The recognition was established in 1990 to celebrate individuals who stutter all around the world. According to the proclamation, stuttering affects more than 70 million people worldwide and more than 3 million people living in the United States alone. The proclamation said about 75 percent of children who have a stutter will grow out of it, while 25 percent never do. Residents John Mango, Christopher Nikolopoulos and Michael Bedkowski were all given a commemorative version of the proclamation and corresponding resolution. Emily Root, the director of speech pathology at Pediatric Speech, Language, & Learning Center, LLC in Berkeley Heights, had approached the borough earlier this year about recognizing the date. She thanked the mayor and council for the “opportunity to spread the message of eliminating myths of people who stutter” and listening to people who stutter. The aim of acknowledging individuals who stutter is to one day reach a point where they are not ostracized by the rest of the community. “Stuttering is nothing to be ashamed of and let’s keep spreading that message of normalizing stuttering and committing to stigma-free communities,” Root said. Mango said it was difficult having to deal with bullies when he was growing up. He said he is proud of the progress the U.S. has made to become more tolerant of other’s differences, whether they be race, religion or disability. He recalled the time his grandfather got in-between him and a neighbor who was ridiculing him for his stutter. Mango said his grandfather gave him a very good piece of advice after things calmed down. “He said to me, ‘John, don’t worry. The man with no shoes cried until he saw the man with no feet,’” he said. “’He says, ‘You can talk. Certain people can’t talk, so don’t let anybody ever make you feel like you can’t talk.’” Mango said this has stuck with him since the day it happened and to this day he has never been afraid to talk. He has tried to instill the same confidence in his grandson, Bedkowski, after the family learned he had a stutter as well. “He’s upfront with it, talks, he’s not at all shy and I’m proud of that,” Mango said, thanking the mayor and council for their support in the fight for a stigma-free society. Mayor Thaddeus Kobylarz said International Stuttering Awareness Day is personal to him because his mother stuttered and was bullied for it as a child. He said whenever she would talk about her experiences of being singled out for her stutter, it broke his heart. He said he was surprised to learn how many people in the world stutter, pointing out three million Americans equates to “roughly one percent of the population, so not insignificant.” Kobylarz listed the names of a few notable people who stutter including current U.S. President Joe Biden, author Lewis Carroll, actor Samuel Jackson, actor Bruce Willis, actress Nicole Kidman, actress Emily Blunt, actor James Earl Jones, actress Marylin Monroe, pop artist Ed Sheeran, rock ‘n’ roll legend Elvis Presley, blues guitarist and singer BB King and rapper Kendrick Lamar. “This is clearly an important cause,” he said. Borough Council President Carolyn Dempsey, who read the proclamation, said she, too, was unaware of how prevalent stuttering is in both the country and the rest of the world. She said recognizing Hispanic Heritage Month and International Stuttering Awareness Day gives the borough an opportunity to “set the tone for our community” and “bring awareness” to different causes. “We see you and we value you,” she said.
