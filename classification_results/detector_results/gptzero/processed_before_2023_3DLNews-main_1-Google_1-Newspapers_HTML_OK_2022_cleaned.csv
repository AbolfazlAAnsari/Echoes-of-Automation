Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 4:19 pm WOODWARD - Billed as the only drone festival based in Oklahoma, Woodward’s Thunderbird Drone Festival is slated for Aug.12th and 13th. Already entries in the Thunderbird Drone International Film Festival portion of the two-day event, have surpassed last year’s entries, festival Director Chris Castor says. According to Castor, the festival promises fast-paced fun for adults and children alike, with events such as drone races and education panels for all levels of interest. Speakers will engage all subjects, from beginners, who just want to learn how to use their drone, to those who use drones in industry and need more technical advice. Everyone is invited to see an amazing show and learn how to become a drone pilot and discover multiple uses for drones, he said. Friday evening, at the Woodward Arts Theatre, the awards ceremonies for Thunderbird International Drone Film Festival and ScavenDrone (a drone scavenger hunt) will begin at 7 p.m. Attendees will get the chance to see some of the most unique and spectacular films made by people from all over the world. Afterwards those who have purchased VIP passes are invited to a fun reception at Building 801 on Main Street in Woodward. Castor hinted at something special in the works for those who attend the film festival. “Plans are in the works for a very rare and unique opportunity right after the awards show in the downtown Woodward area,” Castor said. He couldn’t say more, as details are still “in the air”, Castor hinted. This year, Thunderbird Drone Festival’s exciting “Drone Day” on Saturday Aug. 13th is planned at Building A at the Woodward County Event Center. This second day of the Thunderbird Drone Festival has once again attracted the best drone racers, A-list speakers and sponsors. Some of those speakers include experts such as Dr. Jamey Jacob. Jacob is the Director of the OSU Unmanned Systems Research Institute, John Hendrix Chair, and Professor of Aerospace Engineering in the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Oklahoma State University. Also, a possibility, will be the inclusion on the speakers panel of an active-duty Air Force drone pilot who could share specifics about how the drone industry has changed the battlefield. Also participating in the festival are Oklahoma Film and Music office, Oklahoma Aeronautics Commission and the UAS Cluster Initiative. Children of all ages will enjoy the chance to get up close and even possibly learn to fly a small drone or even get a chance to test their chops on a drone simulator. Both days of Thunderbird Drone Festival promise a chance to see how rapidly growing technology, the use of drones in film and drone FPV racing is taking a foothold in the state, Castor said. The event will feature fun drone demonstrations for children, a coffee and drinks truck, cool event t-shirts and will be all indoors, out of the heat of the dog days of summer, said Woodward Convention and Visitors Bureau Director Rachael Van Horn. “This event will have something intriguing for everyone,” Van Horn said. “Whether you have just been curious about drones, have a dream to own or fly one or just want to learn how to make your own drone films or use your drone in your business, this is the event for you.” The event is sponsored by drone manufacturer Skydio, Woodward Convention and Visitors Bureau and Woodward County Event Center. For ticket information go to www.Thunderbirddronefestival.com Children 12 and under are free, however, please order a free ticket for your child anyway, as no one without a ticket (lanyard) will be permitted in the building. The event is a collaboration between Thunderbird Drone Festival LLC principals Chris Castor and Nathan Holliday and the City of Woodward Tourism Director Rachael Van Horn, Woodward County Event Center Director Bailey Kafka, Woodward Arts Theatre Director Laurie Steenbergen and Woodward Industrial Foundation President Alan Case.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:50 pm Fifteen years ago, CJ Moore was an MLB.com intern reporting on the Colorado Rockies during their first and only season to appear in the World Series. 2007 was a uniquely momentous year for the Denver-based ball club, but game highlights aren’t the only memories that stand out to Moore, now a college basketball writer for The Athletic. He also witnessed how left fielder Matt Holliday’s 3-year-old son, Jackson, became a popular guy in the clubhouse because of his precocious baseball skills. “I just remember all of the players would take turns pitching to him, and it was just pretty incredible to watch how well he could hit the ball at that young of (an) age,” Moore said. “Especially now, having kids and knowing kind of when their hand-eye coordination comes, (I think) the way he could do it at 3 years old was pretty unreal.” Before Jackson was old enough for kindergarten, he had established himself as a pint-sized slugger at Coors Field. Sunday night, at age 18, he established himself as the first player selected in the 2022 MLB Draft. The Baltimore Orioles selected Stillwater High shortstop Jackson Holliday with the No. 1 pick in the 2022 MLB amateur draft. What makes someone a No. 1 pick? The question invites debate, and the answers are complex – it’s human nature for opinions to vary. But you don’t have to be a fly on the wall in Baltimore’s draft room to understand why the Orioles were drawn to Holliday, the shortstop from Stillwater High. With Holliday’s baseball history in mind, several reasons become obvious. First, the statistics jump out. Mike Elias, the Orioles’ general manager, described Holliday as a “five-tool” shortstop. Breaking down the definition of a five-tool player shows how Holliday fits into every category. Hitting for average? As a senior, he posted an unbelievable .685 batting average. Hitting for power? He checked that box, too, with 17 home runs. His speed allowed him to rack up 30 stolen bases, and he satisfied the fourth and fifth requirements – good throwing and fielding – with only three errors throughout the season and a .980 fielding percentage. Holliday’s success also exists because of something that isn’t quantifiable, a trait that doesn’t fit into any of those five categories but affects all of them. Jimmy Harris, Holliday’s high school coach, said it best: “He’s dedicated his life to baseball.” Yes, Holliday had an early advantage. He grew up in MLB clubhouses with an all-access pass to learning about the game because of his father, Matt, a seven-time All-Star. Sons are following in their fathers’ footsteps, as the MLB Draft continued to show us when the Arizona Diamondbacks selected Druw Jones, the son of 10-time Gold Glove honoree Andruw Jones, with the second pick. The family legacy didn’t mean Holliday would magically hear his name at the beginning of the MLB Draft. He had to decide to be invested in the game. He had to work. He had to want this. From the age of 3, he did. After the Orioles selected Holliday, Denver-based sports producer/photojournalist Jeff Howe shared a video on Twitter of Holliday – then a toddler dressed like a miniature man in a white polo shirt and cargo shorts – throwing the ball to his dad, swinging a bat and rounding the bases. The shaggy-haired, rosy-cheeked toddler had skills. It makes me smile to see a kid enjoying baseball so much, especially knowing where that love for the game would take him. My claim to fame as a toddler was memorizing the names of players featured in a deck of All-Century baseball cards, but I have to admit that doesn’t hold a candle to Holliday’s wunderkind ways. He not only knew the names of the greats, but also had a knack for imitating their batting stances. “I think he would do David Ortiz,” Moore said. “And then I want to say Jeff Bagwell too, because I think Bagwell kind of had a funny stance, and he could do his. I think there were more than that, but those are the couple that come to mind.” The legend of Jackson Holliday grew. In a recent column, Benjamin Hochman of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reflected on the time he learned about Holliday’s talent. Hochman arrived in Denver in 2007 to cover the NBA’s Nuggets for the Denver Post, but he was hearing stories of a promising 3-year-old athlete in a different sport. “Everyone in the media group, media corps, would occasionally bring up just how talented this young boy was at baseball, and it kind of became like a thing that people knew about,” Hochman told me. “I just remember thinking, ‘Wow, there must be ballplayers’ kids (here) every year, but the fact that so many different people are bringing up the same kid means this kid must be pretty exceptional.’” Hochman and Moore discovered what the sports world now knows: it’s rare to meet a kid with Holliday’s baseball aptitude. Combine that with his genuine passion for the game, and that’s how he engineered a young career that made scouts see his sky-high potential. As a senior, he took online classes, arranging his schedule so he could work on his craft and train with his dad, continuing those bonding moments they had when Matt played in the majors. Hochman credited Matt and Leslee Holliday for nurturing their eldest son’s love of the game and pointed out that not every MLB player’s kid grows into a superstar on the diamond. “Clearly, whatever Matt and Leslee did and the other family members did, it was the perfect amount of motivation, teaching, but also letting the kid grow into the game himself because he didn’t burn out,” Hochman said. Throughout his childhood, Holliday also paid attention to role models outside his family, from third baseman Nolan Arenado to fellow shortstop Derek Jeter. One night before the premier of the seven-part ESPN documentary detailing Jeter’s celebrated career, Holliday took a step into realizing his own major-league dreams when the Orioles picked him. Someday, far into Holliday’s career, perhaps people will look back at his Stillwater High School days with the same nostalgic incredulity they have when they see footage of him swinging the bat at age 3. He had an unparalleled senior season – I will remember sitting on the Couch Park bleachers and witnessing moments such as when he hit not one, not two, but three home runs to fuel a tremendous comeback win against Tulsa Union. It’s Holliday’s story, a true account that inspires awe as if it’s a tall tale, and those of us who write about baseball are honored to simply sit in the background and document it.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:07 am If Oklahoma wants a kid like Peyton Bowen it can have him. Committed to Notre Dame since New Year’s Day, up and pulls Oregon out of a hat on Wednesday, only to not put pen to paper on Wednesday, only to announce and sign with the Sooners on Thursday. Down the road, when he’s not all-in, not developing, not becoming the player he’s supposed to become, we’ll know why, because he’s already proven he can’t commit to anything in the first place. A five-star prospect, of which less than 40 exist in the entire Class of ’23. The No. 2 safety prospect in the nation and the highest-ranked defensive signee to choose OU since ESPN began ranking prospects in 2006, he’s everything you want. But how can you want him now? I mean, really. Because now that he’s everything you don’t want. I can’t do it any more. Scratch all of that. I can only channel idiocy for so long. Eight sentences over six paragraphs is my apparent limit, and yet you know some not-too-small fraction of temporarily jilted Sooner fandom, certain OU would be Bowen’s original Wednesday choice, have gone much longer. They may still be going. As though they’ve never been indecisive over a huge life decision; or a huge life decision in which a great deal of money may be involved; or a huge life decision in which a great deal of money and, for crying out loud, a great deal of love may be involved. Let’s go back. Bowen is indeed the most well-regarded defensive signee the Sooners have inked in a very long time, probably since Gerald McCoy. He plays a position, safety, that may put him in position to stabilize the whole defense, because if the secondary can be stabilized, maybe the rest of the unit can be, too. Who’s to know what the Ducks were trying to throw Bowen’s way, though they have Nike founder Phil Knight on their side. For that matter, who’s to know what the Sooners threw at him, prior to Wednesday and after? Yes, we’d like to believe that’s not how OU operates, to just throw money at talent, and it’s sure not what coach Brent Vanables has said will be how OU operates, but it’s hard to know anything for sure when it comes to college football these days. There’s also the matter of Bowen’s girlfriend, Emma Alvord, herself a Class of ’23 Sooner signee on the soccer pitch and decent chance she’ll make an impact there before Bowen makes an impact in his sport. “We expect her to contribute right away,” OU soccer coach Mark Carr said after her November signing. And, of presumedly less import but still a thing, five-star quarterback prospect Jackson Arnold, also a Sooner signee, was a prep teammate of Bowen’s out of John Guyer (Denton, Texas) High School. Here’s one theory circulated Thursday in the hours prior to Bowen’s signing being confirmed by OU. Bowen’s mother badly wanted him to choose Notre Dame, yet Bowen’s heart had him badly wanting to come to Norman. So he chose Oregon to make a point to his mother. Though she endorsed his moving 1,000 miles northeast to South Bend, how would she feel about his moving 2,000 miles northwest to Eugene when what he really wanted was to move 150 miles north to Norman. I don’t buy it. I buy confusion. Because can’t an 18-year-old kid be uncertain about a huge decision bound to impact the rest of his life? Maybe Bowen didn’t know what he wanted. I’m 54 and don’t know everything I want. Do we ever? Maybe he had to try on all three schools to make the best choice, so he did and he did. Maybe, for some 18-year-olds, it’s hard to choose when the whole country’s clamoring for a binding decision and you don’t want to disappoint anybody so you don’t for as long as you can and then when you must you’re still not sure. Maybe we should just ask him. “As I reflect on yesterday’s whirlwind I recognize that I made some mistakes that I regret and will learn from,” began a statement Bowen put out via his Twitter account on Thursday. “With that being said, I also know that I was blessed to be in the position to consider multiple wonderful universities as I continue my football career.” He then thanked the Oregon coaches, writing that after choosing the Ducks, “I came to the realization that the decision was not the best path for me.” He then thanked the Notre Dame coaches, going on to write, “That being said, after deciding to reconsider my final destination I came to realize that my heart was somewhere else.” In the next paragraph, he wrote “Oklahoma has always felt like home to me.” He closed with an apology. “Oregon and Notre Dame faithful, I am sorry for how I handled the process,” Bowen wrote. “Changing my decision on signing day, the hat pump fake, all of it could have been handled better. “I can’t change what I did, but this experience is something I will learn from.” Presuming they were his words, Bowen sounds exactly like the kind of prospect you’d want on your team: thoughtful, humble and, at the end, honest.

Dưới đây là một danh sách được cập nhật về các nhà cái cá cược bóng đá hàng đầu, hãy tham khảo ngay để tìm ra nơi phù hợp nhất với nhu cầu cá nhân của bạn! Cá độ bóng đá đại diện cho một dạng cá cược, trong đó người chơi sử dụng tiền hoặc các tài sản có giá trị để đặt cược vào kết quả dự đoán của các trận đấu bóng đá đang diễn ra hoặc sắp diễn ra. Trong trường hợp người chơi đoán đúng kết quả, họ sẽ nhận được phần thưởng tương ứng với số tiền họ đã đặt cược. Tuy nhiên, nếu dự đoán sai, người chơi sẽ phải chịu mất toàn bộ hoặc một phần tiền cược, phụ thuộc vào loại cược. Hoạt động cá độ bóng đá không chỉ đa dạng về cách thức mà còn mang lại sự phong phú qua nhiều loại kèo cá độ. Cả trong truyền thống và online, chúng ta sẽ gặp các loại kèo cơ bản sau đây: Kèo Châu Á, còn được biết đến là kèo chấp chính, là loại kèo mà một đội được đánh giá là cửa trên với một số điểm trong trận đấu, trong khi đội đối thủ được xem như “dưới” với một tỷ lệ kèo cố định. Trong các trang cá độ trực tuyến, kèo Châu Âu là một lựa chọn phổ biến mà bạn có thể dễ dàng gặp. Khi đặt cược theo kèo Châu Âu, bạn không cần quan tâm đến tỷ số hoặc số bàn thắng, chỉ lưu ý ở kết quả cuối cùng của trận đấu giữa đội chủ nhà và đội khách, được biểu thị bằng các ký hiệu 1×2. Kèo Tài Xỉu, hay còn gọi là kèo trên dưới, sử dụng ký hiệu O/U viết tắt cho Over/Under. Loại kèo này dựa trên tổng số bàn thắng được ghi bởi cả hai đội trong một hiệp đấu hoặc cả trận đấu. Lựa chọn một địa điểm cá độ bóng đá từ những nhà cái đáng tin cậy sẽ là chìa khóa giúp bạn thuận lợi hưởng tiền từ hoạt động cá cược.
