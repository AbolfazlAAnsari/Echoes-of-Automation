Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 3:15 am On Nov. 17, 35 members of Macon County High School’s chapter of Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) toured Western Kentucky University. The group began their tour at the top of the hill at Cherry Hall, where they saw the statue of the university’s founder, Dr. Henry Hardin Cherry. Cherry Hall houses 25 cathedral bells that play daily according to class schedules. Members then enjoyed refreshments in Cravens Library. The group saw the Time and Place Compass and Clock outside the library, a fountain that includes compass points, constellations, and a sundial. They then saw the remnants of the former football stadium known as the Colonnade, which is now a commons area for students. Members also saw the president’s house, the Kentucky Building, the fine arts center, the mass media and technology hall, and the Preston Health and Activity Center. Students also saw the construction site for the new Gordon Ford College of Business, which is scheduled to be completed by the fall of 2025. While touring Diddle Arena, the group met Rodney Howard, the starting power forward for the WKU basketball team. Members walked around the Guthrie Bell Tower as it is believed by many to be bad luck to walk through it. Dedicated to the memory of Sgt. First Class Robert H. Guthrie, who was killed in the Korean War, the tower serves as a tribute to U.S. service members who died fighting for the country. The tour wrapped up at the Dero Downing Student Union, where members took a picture with the Big Red Statue. — Submitted Log In Keep it Clean.

Writer Nyrstar’s Middle Tennessee Mines (zinc mine) plans to “temporarily pause in production operations”, beginning this month. “Nyrstar’s Middle Tennessee Mines in Gordonsville, announces it will temporarily pause production operations on November 30,” company officials said in a statement released to the media, Tuesday (October 31) and posted on its website. A “temporary pause in production” will mean hundreds of laid off employees. According to the company’s website, 350 people are employed with the company, most of which are expected to be laid off indefinitely. The company says it will maintain a minimal staff while production is halted. “This decision comes after a thorough review and is in direct response to significantly weakened market conditions and inflationary impacts on input costs and operating margin,” company officials say. “As a result, employee layoffs will occur and Nyrstar plans to offer some employees alternative employment opportunities at its East Tennessee Mines and other mining operations in the U.S. During the pause in production operations, a limited number of staff will remain on site to ensure a safe and efficient ramp down of production activities and transition to essential services.” The local mines are known as Nyrstar’s Middle Tennessee Mines and include headquarters in Gordonsville, Cumberland Mine in Carthage and Elmwood Mine in Elmwood. “We understand the decision to pause production at the Middle Tennessee Mines will have a significant impact on our employees, their families and the local community. This decision was not taken lightly and we acknowledge the challenges this may present. These actions in no way reflect the skills and commitment of our talented team at Middle Tennessee Mines, but are a direct response to the current business conditions. We thank all members of our team for their continued support and firmly believe that this pause is necessary in these challenging market conditions in order to ensure the long-term sustainability and profitability of the mines,” said Bill Hart, Nyrstar’s Vice President Environment, Health & Safety, Human Resources and Corporate Affairs for North American Mining.

Now, with the Carousel s… To the Editor: To the Editor: As the county prepares for primary elections in March, the Williamson County School Board ballot has received an overhaul. On Dec. 19, the Tennessee Republican Party (TRP) removed Michael Carter, Donald Fischer, Claire Reeves and Rick Wimberly from the ballot after the candidates’ bona fide Republican statuses were challenged. “It is shocking to me to be in this position where I’ve been a lifelong Republican and I’m not even going to be able to be on the ballot and run,” said Reeves, who has filed to run in District 9 and has appealed the TRP’s ruling. Tennessee’s open primaries mean voters do not have to register under a specific political party — but parties maintain the right to decide if a candidate is a legitimate, or “bona fide,” member of the party. According to TRP bylaws (Article IX, Section 1), a bona fide Republican candidate must be active in the state or county party, be a registered voter in the county and have voted in three of the last four statewide Republican primaries. It takes a challenge from five bona fide voters for the Republican State Executive Committee of Tennessee (SEC) to review a candidate’s credentials and decide to remove or allow their name on the ballot. If a candidate is removed, they have 48 hours to submit a letter of appeal for the SEC to consider a waiver. “There is a waiver process in the bylaws for a reason and it is to address situations like mine where it’s not black and white,” Reeves said. However, Reeves said she did not receive any instructions on how to appeal for a waiver from the TRP. The letter she received to inform her of her removal only stated that she had the right to appeal within 48 hours but gave no information as to how. Reeves was removed for not meeting the voting requirements, having voted in only one of the last four statewide primaries and one countywide primary. Much of the candidates’ frustration surrounds the seeming lack of transparency and consistency from the SEC. Wimberly, a previous Republican school board candidate and incumbent in District 9, said on Thursday last week that he had not received an explanation from the party for being removed from the ballot. He maintained that he is more than bona fide, having voted in eight of the last nine Republican primaries. He had no idea why he was taken off. He said he was ""mystified"" and that ""it\'s a mystery why I have been removed and it\'s also a concern I haven\'t received notice of it. I understand that there is an appeal process, but since I don\'t know the basis for removal, I\'m not in a position to appeal."" On Friday last week, Wimberley said he had contacted the party and submitted an appeal after he received his suspension notice the same day. Wimberly announced earlier this year that he was not seeking reelection, but he said he recently changed his mind and decided to run again after a conversation with his wife and family. He has withdrawn from the ballot, but hopes his appeal is still well-received. ""I hope I\'m back on the ballot but won\'t know until the state party decides next week,"" he said. ""The withdrawal may have activated a little-known law that opens the qualifying period for seven days when an incumbent withdraws at the 11th hour, but there are questions about whether the law applies because the party had already removed me from the ballot. “If it does apply and the party accepts my appeal, I presumably can re-petition. If it does not apply, and the party accepts my appeal, I assume I\'m back on the ballot. It\'s all confusing and we\'re all dealing with laws and party policy that we\'ve never dealt with before."" Wimberly said he would give another interview when he receives word from the party. Scott Golden, chairman of the TRP, spoke to the Herald about Wimberly’s case, saying he was challenged not for his voting record, but for his “active status.” “You can’t just say that you’re a member of an organization, you have to actually do something;” Golden said. He explained the clause in the bylaws is a bit more subjective than the voting requirements, but requires “quantifiable contributions of time or money” to the party or a Republican candidate. Chad Story, former Williamson County commissioner, said the bylaws have seen a lot of changes recently that have added to the confusion. He said that “under the old bylaws… there was some gray area as to what is considered bona fide and your options if you don’t meet the criteria.” Things like vouchers used to create what Steve Allbrooks, one of the current SEC representatives for Williamson County (District 27), considers an unfair playing field. Now, he said the new rules are meant to be “basically fair and consistent to everybody.” “There is a lot of misperception out there that we’re making a decision, that we’re picking people or whatever — that is not true at all,” said Allbrooks. “They can run as an independent — we are not keeping people off the ballot; they would just not be able to run as a Republican.” However, Story thinks the party needs to be more forthcoming with information and inform candidates when the bylaws are changed. “They should’ve notified candidates well in advance that they were changing the bylaws,” Story said. “There haven’t been cut and dry rules for years.” Golden said the party has made several changes to the bylaws since 2017 and has updated the bylaw document on its website with these changes. “The assumption, of course, in the TRP bylaws is that you have read the rules of the Republican party, and if you’re going to run as a Republican you have agreed to those rules,” Golden explained. Election Commissioner Chad Gray said that the political party nominees now had until Thursday, Dec. 28, at noon to apply after the withdrawal due to the Anti-skullduggery Act. Currently, the only incumbents on the school board ballot are Jennifer Aprea (District 5), who is skipping the primary by running as an independent, and Wimberly if he is granted a waiver through his appeal. “Usually, you don’t see an entire slate of new candidates in an election cycle that are not incumbents,” said Gray. “I don’t recall there being a complete change at least in my nearly 24 years working for the election commission.” Gray said residents and others could email him with questions at Chad.Gray@williamsoncounty-tn.gov Coleman Bomar helped contribute to this report.

Lee’s desk for signature By Sabrina Bates; MVP Regional News Editor A measure legislating enhancing school-building safety has passed the Tennessee House and Senate. Senate Bill 274 is headed to Gov. Bill Lee’s desk for his signature. The bipartisan bill passed the Senate last night (Thursday, April 13) with unanimous support. There were only four votes against the proposal in the Tennessee House of Representatives last week. SB 274 was introduced earlier this year by Sen. Jon Lundberg of Bristol (R-74). The companion piece, House Bill 322, was proposed by William Lamberth of Portland (R-44). As the House version made its way through committees, it was eventually substituted with the Senate bill that included four amendments. This piece of legislation requires new schools construction and those undergoing major renovations to implement the following safety measures: * Clear, bullet- or entry-resistant film on doors and windows; * Door-locking mechanisms on interior doors to be able to be locked from the inside; * A secure vestibule at the front entrance and * A camera-monitoring system throughout the school and on the grounds that is accessible to local law enforcement. Current school systems will be required to submit building plans to all relevant and local law-enforcement agencies as well as certain state departments. In addition, “lock checks” will be randomly conducted by members of the Tennessee Highway Patrol on exterior entrances. Schools that don’t have their exterior doors locked could face penalties after the first offense which could include withholding of state funds until the school is brought into compliance.

Here are the top stories, in order of most reader votes: Remaking of the Westside and The Bend Two major projects could remake the downtown Chattanooga riverfront. Officials approved a new tax zone to help spur up to $2 billion of new downtown development by revitalizing 300 acres of the Westside and the city\'s oldest public housing project. Plans would allow thousands of new homes, more than 1 million square feet of commercial space and a new riverfront park. Chattanooga Housing Authority is trying to raise money to rebuild College Hill Courts and developers plan offices, storefronts, medical facilities, apartments and condos on the former Alstom Power site. Pedestrian deaths In 2023, 17 pedestrians have been killed this year in Chattanooga — nearly triple the pedestrian deaths reported last year at this time. That includes the deaths of two pedestrians on Frazier Avenue after a Nov. 26 accident in which two vehicles collided and one jumped the curb and struck three people on the sidewalk. A 41-year-old mother and her 1-year-old son were killed, and the driver faces two charges of vehicular homicide by impairment and charges of aggravated vehicular assault. City officials have closed the inner two lanes of Frazier on weekends until the end of December and are studying permanent changes to the road. (READ MORE: Top news stories for the Chattanooga area in 2022, as picked by readers) Plans underway for new Lookouts stadium A $79.5 million stadium is planned on the former Wheland and U.S. Pipe foundry sites. Construction is scheduled to begin in the South Broad District in 2024 to anchor a new development along Interstate 24 in the western entrance to the city. Landowners are seeking a rezoning of the land that would allow buildings as high as 12 stories and more dense development around the facility. Downtown changes Proposals were announced this year to demolish the TVA office complex, build a new federal courthouse and expand and renovate the Chattanooga Convention Center with a pedestrian-friendly ""convention district"" with nearby shopping, entertainment, restaurants and hotel space. Affordable housing \'crisis\' This year saw high interest rates, high housing prices, low inventory for Chattanooga-area real estate, and rents rising faster than incomes for many households. Mayor Tim Kelly proposed the city\'s first-ever housing action plan to bolster the area\'s dwindling affordable housing stock through policy changes and investments. ""Chattanooga is facing an affordable housing crisis,"" the plan states. Kelly has announced a $100 million initiative to invest in affordable housing, seeded by $33 million of city money. Construction On \'The Split\' The second phase of the $161 million reconstruction project of the Interstate 75/I-24 interchange started this summer. This phase of construction should add lanes to the most bottlenecked part of the interchange — the northbound lanes of I-75 to the westbound lanes of I-24 near East Ridge\'s Exit 1, which now narrows from two lanes into one. Completion is scheduled for late 2025. Croft & Frost firm folds Chattanooga accountant Jonathan Frost and his business partner Paul Croft pitched a vision to transcend the accounting business. But investor suspicions of betrayal and fraud have swelled since September, when Croft\'s and Frost\'s accounting firm abruptly collapsed, and management at the pair\'s separate green energy firm, Rhino Onward International, resigned after months of alleged nonpayment. The CEO of that firm has vowed to seek justice, and a procession of lawsuits have accused Croft and Frost of various breaches of trust. Homelessness Chattanooga officials have paused efforts to convert a transit building on East 12th Street into a 24/7 homeless shelter. The low-barrier shelter, designed to get people shelter with as few obstacles as possible, faced opposition from neighbors. A plan to convert a vacant motel on Lee Highway into 70 units of permanent supportive housing for homeless people is moving through the approval process. Police shootings Chattanooga police shot and killed two people in separate incidents. On Aug. 11, police shot Roger Heard Jr. at a Speedway gas station on Holtzclaw Avenue. Heard, 34, was killed after officers in plain clothes and unmarked cars attempted to stop him on warrants. Law enforcement officials said Heard fired at officers before they shot him in an exchange of gunfire. An officer was also hit in the exchange of gunfire and has returned to duty. Heard\'s family believes the officers used excessive force by continuing to shoot Heard after he fell to the ground and no longer had a gun. On Sept. 3, police shot David Mendez Lopez, 17, after responding to a reported domestic dispute on South Kelley Street. The Chattanooga Police Department said Mendez Lopez was armed with a weapon that he pointed at police. Erlanger becomes private Erlanger Health System transitioned from a government to a private nonprofit entity, a step officials say is necessary in order for Erlanger to remain competitive and viable in today\'s health care system. Erlanger is Chattanooga\'s largest and only safety net hospital; the Baroness hospital on East Third Street is home to the region\'s only Level 1 trauma center, which treats the most severe injuries and illnesses. School facilities A plan by a working group of Hamilton County leaders includes recommendations calling for K-12 school campus closures and renovations. The recommendations are part of a two-phase, seven-year plan to update Hamilton County Schools\' facilities. It would cost around $200 million. The plan calls for three new schools to be built, seven schools to be renovated or receive additions, six schools to be closed and three schools to move to new locations. State championship winners The third year of the annual BlueCross Bowl — Tennessee\'s nine-game, three-day football state championship event — featured rivals Baylor and McCallie in the Division II-AAA title game, Boyd Buchanan in DII-AA and South Pittsburg in Class A. While Boyd was disappointed, South Pittsburg won the program\'s seventh Class 1A state title. And McCallie\'s Blue Tornado claimed a dramatic 34-28 win over Baylor, which marked the fifth consecutive season one of Chattanooga\'s large private schools claimed the title. (READ MORE: McCallie\'s Gentle becomes Vols first signee) Quantum network launched, onboards first customer The EPB Quantum Network announced this year that it is onboarding its first customer onto the nation\'s first commercial quantum network. EPB spent $4.5 million to build its quantum network, which San Diego-based Qubitekk developed as an outgrowth of cybersecurity research EPB conducted about the electric grid for the Department of Energy\'s Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The company, called Qunnect, will work with Qubitekk to use the EPB Quantum Network to determine the ways key quantum technologies can be used across a quantum network. Riverbend on hold The Riverbend Festival will be put on hold in 2024 while the Friends of the Festival organization examines what is and isn\'t working. Riverbend was canceled in 2020 and 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, facing dwindling attendance and financial losses, organizers cut the event to four days and raised ticket prices. Homicides Chattanooga and Hamilton County have seen at least 26 homicides this year. The shooting of businessman Chris Wright, 38, at the intersection of 11th and Market streets Sept. 28 prompted city officials to increase security measures including increased police presence downtown, an expanded video surveillance network and a public safety commission. Hamilton County has assigned sheriff\'s deputies to support Chattanooga officers in the downtown business district. (READ MORE: Hamilton County, Chattanooga mayors grapple with response to downtown shooting) Angel Bumpass case A judge dismissed the case against Angel Bumpass, who was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison when she was 13 years old.

Bumpass, now 28, maintained throughout the years that she had no involvement in Bonner\'s death. Planning initiatives launched to guide growth A year-long planning initiative will study growth, traffic, sewers and public education in the unincorporated parts of Hamilton County and devise a blueprint to guide future growth.

There would be no “sudden blows.” In “Rapid Movements and Sudden Blows in Slow Motion: Longstreet’s Struggle to Launch His Knoxville Campaign,” Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park Staff Historian Jim Ogden will examine the challenges “Old Pete” faced as he tried to merely reach what would be his actual line of departure, and cross it, to then, ideally, as Bragg hoped, “… drive Burnside out of East Tennessee first, or better, to capture or destroy him.” The talk will seek to provide insights that will help explain why the Battle for Knoxville turned out the way it did. Ogden, a native of St. Mary’s County, Maryland, joined the National Park Service in 1982 and served at Chickamauga and Chattanooga, Russell Cave, and Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania before returning to Chickamauga and Chattanooga NMP in 1988 as historian, the position he still holds. He has taught numerous history courses, led hundreds of tours and Army staff rides and written several articles on the Civil War. He also has appeared in several television productions, including “Civil War Journal,” “Civil War Combat” and “History Detectives.” He has been the recipient of a host of awards for his scholarship, preservation and advocacy work. His most recent awards include the U.S. Army Commander’s Award for Public Service and the Civil War Trust’s National Park Service Preservation Advocate Award. Jim, his wife Lora and their son Jamie (born on the 133rd anniversary of the Battle of Fredericksburg) live in Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, near the Chickamauga Battlefield. This presentation is open to the public, and all interested are invited to attend. Individuals wishing to dine with Ogden at The Chop House at 5 p.m. prior to the program should request reservations by emailing Wayne Strong at trustwrks@aol.com.

Action by the county commission also required the establishment of a Financial Management Committee to set regulations and oversee the county’s Department of Finance, as well as hire a county director of finance. With the creation of the new department and appointment of a financial director, school board members basically feel the county is attempting to control how money is spent within the school system’s budget.

Hayes didn\'t have time to think as she and her family were consumed by a tornado Saturday in their Clarksville home. The 36-year-old mother of three remembers the sound the wind made as the roof over her head was ripped from its trusses. The house began to crumble, the walls caving in seconds later on her extended family of seven. Six survived. ""I just remember seeing things spinning all around me,"" she said. At one point, Hayes was suspended in the air, her mother\'s car flew past her and then she was buried in the rubble of the house she once called home. Her brother, Stephen Hayes, was also trapped under piles of rubble, plywood and debris after an EF-3 tornado swept through Clarksville and into Kentucky, reaching peak speeds of 150 miles per hour. But, unlike his sister, Stephen Hayes, 34, didn\'t survive. Originally from Maryland, the Hayes family moved to Middle Tennessee when Angela Hayes\' husband, Elorm Dzidotor, joined the army. He\'s now a pastor at Revival International. Angela Hayes\' faith took root at an early age, and Stephen played a big role, she said. ""We were a church family, grew up strong in the faith,"" she said. ""There would be times if it\'s not a Sunday, I would play pretend to be a pastor, and I remember one of his stuffed animals he called Teddy would be church member and he would preach to all his stuffed animals and my Barbie dolls."" As the siblings grew, they would ride bicycles together, go to the park and play. Angela Hayes said her brother was passionate about playing sports, especially basketball in high school. He was kind and generous, even as he faced mental health challenges as a adult. Along with their older brother Michael, Angela Hayes said the siblings were always asked if they were triplets because they looked so much alike growing up. ""There\'s nothing that God gives us that we cannot handle,"" she said. ""Just leave it up to God, and I, myself, and my family don\'t blame God. We know not to blame God."" Tornado outbreak: Tennessee tornado outbreak may mark deadliest December ever. What we know. On Saturday, Angela and Stephen Hayes were home along with her mom, Dzidotor and the couple\'s three children, ages 2, 4 and 17. Angela Hayes had arrived home that morning after a working a night shift in the labor and delivery ward at Tennova Medical Center. She was dozing off when she heard what she thought was an Amber Alert notification, she said. Instead, it was a tornado watch sounding for the area. When she looked outside, the skies were pitch black and the wind was whipping, she said. Her Henry Place Boulevard home was gone in minutes. ""I heard my mom yelling a tornado is coming,"" Angela Hayes said, and at first, she thought it was a false alarm, having lived through several severe weather watches and warnings in Middle Tennessee. December tornadoes: How often does Tennessee see tornadoes in December? is it part of \'tornado alley\'? Things changed quickly. The wind picked up, the house began to shake and Angela Hayes remembers yelling for her family to head for the pantry for safety. Her mom banged on her brother\'s room to warn him about the tornado, and she heard him say, ""I\'m coming."" The kids were wrangled and the family was beginning to head for safety when the roof came off. A wall slammed into Angela Hayes\' back and legs, knocking her into a daze, she said. It was over about 10-15 seconds later. Her ears ringing, Angela Hayes pulled herself out of the debris, looked around and didn\'t see anyone, she said. Panicking, she started looking for signs of life. Dzidotor emerged first, from what used to be the family\'s bathroom, and started screaming, \'oh God, oh God, where\'s my family. Where\'s my wife, where\'s my children,\' she said. ""I said, \'I\'m here,\'"" she remembered. Clarksville tornado: TikTok captures family praying as storm rages, aftermath Her husband asked where grandma and Stephen were. ""I could hear him, but my ears were ringing. I couldn\'t even hear my mother screaming where are the kids,"" Angela Hayes said. The couple found Angela Hayes\' mom and kids trapped under plywood and carpet. One by one, the children pushed each other through. As the family exited the remains of their home, they found a neighbor coming to check on them, Angela Hayes said. ""I looked in his eyes and was just like \'are these people really climbing out of the debris,\' and he was just like confused, like did that just happen,"" Angela Hayes said. Other neighbors made their way towards the home to help. A family from across the street gave Angela Hayes\' youngest daughter the clothes off their backs to keep warm as the rain fell. It was then that Angela Hayes realized she hadn\'t seen her brother, and she started screaming when the neighbors tried to lead the family away. ""I was like, \'I don\'t want to leave my brother,"" she said. But her husband and several others from the neighborhood needed help, so they went to the hospital, thinking Stephen Hayes would follow. A search and rescue party found him later, but he was trapped, and they couldn\'t pull him from the wreckage, she said. A search for a pulse turned up nothing. Four houses, including Hayes\', were reduced to rubble in their subdivision. Kyle and Katherine Burnham\'s home, at 1109 Henry Place Boulevard, once stood about 118 feet away from the Hayes home. There, Arlan Coty, 10, died in the storm. One other person, Donna Allen, 59, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, also died in the tornado.

For the latest news and updates on the conflict in Israel, read USA TODAY\'s live coverage for Saturday, Oct. 14. President Joe Biden on Friday said addressing the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza is a top priority, as Palestinians began to evacuate by foot, car and donkey cart ahead of a planned Israeli ground operation. As of Friday, the Israel Defense Forces said more than 1,300 Israelis have died and 3,200 were injured. The Palestinian Ministry of Health said 1,799 people have died and 7,388 others were injured. ""We can’t lose sight of the fact that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do Hamas,” Biden said, speaking at an event in Philadelphia. “And they’re suffering as a result as well.” He spoke Friday with family members of Americans missing in Israel in a meeting the White House described as ""emotional."" Other Americans and transplants from the U.S. who made it through the initial Hamas attacks and out of danger described harrowing moments and journeys home. Meanwhile, the world waits, uncertain about next steps as the war turns a week old and experts have said they expect Israel to continue pounding Gaza and possibly launch a ground invasion within hours. Biden said he’s directed his team to work with the governments in Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and other Arab nations and the United Nations to surge humanitarian relief to those impacted by the war. Hamas staged a shocking and brutal attack on Israel nearly a week ago and has fired thousands of rockets since. Israel has responded with a heavy aerial bombardment and has sealed off the Gaza Strip, stopping all entry of food, water, medicine and fuel to its 2.3 million people. Israel-Hamas War newsletter: Sign up to get the latest news and analysis from USA TODAY into your inbox. Developments: ∎ The number of Palestinians displaced increased by 25% over the past 24 hours, according to an early Friday update from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. More than 423,000 Palestinians have been displaced in Gaza and two-thirds are taking shelter at U.N. schools. ∎ Airstrikes have left cities and refugee camps in ruins. And Gaza has been experiencing a full electricity blackout amid Israel\'s siege of the territory, ""which has brought essential health, water and sanitation services to the brink of collapse, and exacerbated food insecurity,"" according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz has said electricity, water and fuel will not be provided until Israeli hostages are returned. ∎ Public officials and law enforcement agencies across the United States have expressed concern over potential protests on Friday in response to Hamas leadership\'s call for a global ""Day of Rage."" The D.C. region has enhanced its security in the area, including in the U.S. Capitol complex, and other major cities have also been on alert. ∎ Hamas\' media office said about 70 people, including women and children, were killed in an Israeli airstrike that hit cars full of people fleeing south from Gaza City on Friday. It was not immediately clear what the intended target was or whether militants were among the passengers hit. \'Humanity on both sides\': A gulf of perspectives is growing among US millennials amid war in Israel The State Department’s first charter flight taking Americans out of Israel has landed in Athens, Greece, the State Department said Friday. “The State Department will continue to organize these charter flights for as long as there is a demand from US citizens for departure assistance,” John Kirby, a White House spokesman on national security matters, said. Americans who left Israel on the charter flights have to make their own travel arrangements to the U.S. once they make it to the safe locations, according to the State Department. The American death toll from last week’s Hamas attack in Israel remains at 27, while 14 Americans are unaccounted for. — Joey Garrison President Joe Biden met virtually Friday with the families of 14 Americans who remain unaccounted for since last weekend\'s brutal attacks in Israel when Hamas militants took civilians hostage. ""The president conveyed directly to these families that they have been in his prayers and reaffirmed for them that the United States government is doing everything possible to locate and bring home their loved ones,"" said John Kirby, the National Security Council\'s coordinator for strategic communications. The White House said the Zoom call, which lasted over an hour, was ""emotional."" The White House believes a small number of the 14 unaccounted-for Americans are being held captive by Hamas as hostages, and officials are working to gather more information. At least 27 Americans were killed. “I think they have to know that the president of the United States of America cares deeply about what’s happening,” Biden said in an interview on ""60 Minutes,"" according to a clip released ahead of Sunday’s broadcast. — Joey Garrison Kenneth Whalum, a Memphis pastor, arrived in Israel on Oct. 2 to watch his son perform a concert in Tel Aviv as a trombonist and singer in Bruno Mars’ band. “The crowd was composed of Israelis and Palestinians, and they were all singing in unison with Bruno,” he told the Memphis Commercial Appeal. “It was unbelievable. It was surreal.” On the night of Oct. 6, Whalum dined with the band and Mars at a five-star restaurant in Tel Aviv, before preparing to fly home the next day. But Saturday morning, the sirens started. Whalum said he took shelter at different points along his journey out, first in his hotel where an employee barricaded the door with a steel bar, and later in stairwells with other passengers at the airport. “I just had a sense… that God was going to get me out, and that he was going to get my son out,” he said. “I was not afraid.” - John Klyce, Memphis Commercial Appeal The White House said Friday there’s no indication of a threat to the U.S. following last week’s surprise Hamas attack on Israel. John Kirby, a White House spokesman on national security matters, said Biden met with his national security team in the White House Situation Room on Thursday to discuss “the current homeland threat environment” following the attack. He said the president also discussed efforts to safeguard Jewish and Muslim communities and protect diplomatic facilities in eight U.S. cities: Washington, Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and San Francisco. ""At this time, none of our intelligence agencies have any specific intelligence indicating a threat to the United States stemming from the Hamas terrorist attack in Israel,” Kirby said. “That said, we continue to remain vigilant."" — Joey Garrison Israel\'s call for about a million people to move south within the Gaza Strip drew backlash from a United Nations agency and aid workers. ""The scale and speed of the unfolding humanitarian crisis is bone-chilling. Gaza is fast becoming a hell hole and is on the brink of collapse,"" the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East said in a Friday statement. ""The call from Israeli Forces to move more than 1,000,000 civilians living in northern Gaza within 24 hours is horrendous. This will only lead to unprecedented levels of misery and further push people in Gaza into the abyss."" The evacuation order further alarmed civilians and aid workers. Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent in Gaza City, told The Associated Press through tears that there was no way 1 million people could evacuate that fast. “Forget about food, forget about electricity, forget about fuel. The only concern now is just if you make it, if you’re going to live,” Farsakh said. Palestinians fled by foot, car, truck and donkey cart after Israel’s forces warned about half the population of the Gaza Strip to go south. The United Nations agency said the warning could have disastrous effects amid a growing humanitarian crisis in the sealed-off territory. ""Conditions are very bad,"" Yaser Betar, a Texas native, told USA TODAY. Israel\'s evacuation order for parts of Gaza came ahead of an expected ground offensive against Hamas militants. The order calls for people living in north Gaza to move south of the Wadi Gaza area, which is in the middle of the territory. The southern end of Gaza sits against the Egyptian border, which is closed. Hamas told residents to remain. Families were streaming down a main road out of Gaza City, the biggest city, packed with blankets and possessions, even as Israeli strikes hammered neighborhoods in southern Gaza, the Associated Press reported. But many hesitated to leave amid uncertainty about safety anywhere in Gaza, as suffering has been rising in the territory. “We\'re waiting here. Hundreds of thousands of people are walking to leave Gaza City to go to the south border because they are preparing for a big invasion,” said Betar, who was visiting family when'}]"

Spotting misinformation can be difficult, especially on an information super-highway like the internet. Our Fact-Check team at USA TODAY is constantly finding both misinformation and disinformation. At its most harmless, misinformation can be like a game of telephone: A group of once-true statements scrambled up and taken out of context giving readers a tinged version of the facts. At its worst though misinformation − and its ugly friend disinformation − can radicalize those that consume it, or trick them into believing harmful mistruths about anything from medicine to politics. Here\'s how you can better understand misinformation, disinformation, fake news, and everything in between. Oxford Dictionary defines misinformation as both a verb and a noun meaning either ""the act of giving wrong information about something"" or ""the wrong information that is give,"" respectively. With the proliferation of social media and the ever-growing partisan divide in our news consumption habits, ""misinformation"" has become popular topic. Politicians and researchers have warned of the growing risks of a misinformed public. When bots on Twitter, talking heads on cable news, or politicians delivering a stump speech espouse something false it can spread quickly. ""There is a myriad of consequences: From cynicism of government, the media, and science, to behaviors that harm individuals and others ... to large scale damage to public property, to insurrection,"" Dolores Albarracin, a psychology professor at the University of Illinois who studies attitudes, communication and behavior told USA TODAY in 2021. Fact Check: See USA TODAY\'s latest ratings The ""misinformation effect"" is a psychological term used to define the phenomenon in which a person\'s memory of something is retroactively altered by false information learned after the fact. It is essentially the rewiring of a memory of historical events to incorporate misinformation presented in the aftermath. It demonstrates both the fallibility of human memory and the potential danger of misinformation. “We have a lot more little bits of fiction roaming around in those memory banks than probably people would realize or would like to think is true,” Elizabeth Loftus, a University of California, Irvine professor who has done groundbreaking research on the misinformation effect, explained. Her work revolves more around personal memories, than “semantic memories” or the “fact misinformation” commonly linked to fake news or online falsehoods., but she does think the two worlds should be speaking to each other more. “If you can change a personal memory it ought to be really easy to either change or plant fact misinformation,” Loftus says. The misinformation effect doesn\'t just change memories, it can plant entirely new ones, she warns, and everyone is susceptible. “Even the most intelligent, the most educated, most experienced people with really great memories can be contaminated with misinformation,” Loftus says. What\'s more, we\'re more susceptible to misinformation that feeds into our existing biases. Our memories can start to change for a number of reasons she says, like if we weren\'t paying attention during the original event, or we trust the conveyer of misinformation more than we trust our own memory. The real danger emerges though when we share that altered version of events, she posits. Fake news, literally, means any false information distributed by a news outlet or related to current events. There is a long and rich history of publications printing sensationalistic, distorted, and knowingly false news accounts. The modern iteration of the phrase is a bit more complicated, however. ""Fake news"" gained newfound popularity in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election when then-candidate Donald Trump used it to describe any coverage he found unfavorable, regardless of its basis in fact. In the years since Trump, along with some other hard-right members of the GOP have begun using the phrase as a catch-all for what they perceive as attacks from the ""liberal"" news media. The News Literacy Project, an education nonprofit, defines news literacy as ""the ability to determine the credibility of news and other information and to recognize the standards of fact-based journalism to know what to trust, share and act on."" It is the ability to think critically about the news you consume, to evaluate whether the author and the publication can be considered a trusted source and whether the reporting itself seems to have met the standards required of legitimate journalism. Al Tompkins, an expert at the Poynter Institute who specializes partly in media literacy told USA TODAY a reader can begin to sort out fake news by asking the following questions: Galen Stocking, a senior computational social scientist at the Pew Research Center who specializes in News and Information notes that news people themselves are concerned about the rise of misinformation. He points to a survey from 2022 which revealed 71% of journalists said made-up news was a big problem, in contrast to 50% of the public. “There is definitely an awareness among journalists and a sense of responsibility,” Stocking said. It might be easiest to think of misinformation and disinformation as Russian nesting dolls. Misinformation, or literal ""fake news"" settles comfortably into the category of disinformation when it is spread intentionally, and with malice. So not all misinformation is disinformation, but all disinformation is misinformation. Confused yet? Here\'s an easy example. Consider you are surfing the web and find a news article that, unbeknownst to you, contains false claims about the president. You share it with your followers on social media. You have just participated in the spread of misinformation. Now consider the same process but the story was written by an agent of the state, who knew it was false or was spread by a bot online for the purpose of misinforming others. That would be disinformation. Social media has emerged as a powerful new frontier in the misinformation market. More so than traditional news channels, social media can be a host of conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation, sorting users into echo chambers that only serve to distance them further from the truth. Big tech companies like Facebook and Twitter have been grilled by Congress in recent years over perceived negligence in letting misinformation spread rapidly on their sites. Both the 2020 election and the COVID-19 pandemic proved ripe moments for the dissemination of mis- and dis-information online. Falsehoods swirled about vaccines and treatments and the legitimacy of mail-in voting systems. The ability to share quickly and to a wide audience makes social media a particularly easy medium for misinformation to travel quickly on social media. Stocking points to a series of studies in 2019 and 2020 in which participants were split up based on where they said they got the bulk of their news: radio, television, print, social media, etc. There was a comparatively low proportion of the people who said they got their news on social media who had high levels of political knowledge, which Stocking defined as the ability to ""answer multiple questions correctly about current events."" The same cohort had a lower level of knowledge about COVID-19-related facts and reported seeing more misinformation. “There’s something intrinsic about using social media, as a primary news source at least, that leads to this” Stocking said.

Most Jewish people today are aware that there are Jews who believe in Jesus and yet still maintain their Jewish identities. This awareness is largely thanks to the work of Jews for Jesus and the organization’s strategic partnerships with individuals and churches. The opportunity to share this message has only become more relevant as the landscape of Jewish life continues to become more diverse. Under the leadership of CEO David Brickner, the organization’s footprint continues to expand globally with a significant presence in Israel. Recently, Jews for Jesus has launched initiatives to support Ukrainian refugees and to serve the homeless in Tel Aviv. Additionally, the organization has opened the first shelter in Israel for Hebrew-speaking women leaving prostitution. In the last few years, Jews for Jesus has also opened the doors of new cafes and art spaces in New York and Los Angeles. Avi will share more on January 7.

primary target of at least 10 complaints filed since September but the board’s three-person Ethics Committee unanimously dismissed nine of the complaints at a hearing last Thursday. Padilla, who was elected in August 2022, faced those accusing him in a nearly four-hour meeting. The boardroom in the school district’s central office was packed with nearly 75 community members, most of them Padilla supporters. “These people are my family, not supporters,” he said. “We have a common goal of providing the best education in the safest environment to all students.” Padilla created the page, called ”WCS District 4 Joseph Padilla,” last year and it remained on Facebook until January, when he said he deactivated the page. Among the Facebook comments Padilla made were congratulations to Republican election winners across the country last November, including Tennessee Congressman Andy Ogles, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders and Texas governor Greg Abbott. All of them are Republicans. Many of the ethics complaints came about because the title of the page made it seem like it was a page created by or endorsed by WCS. The school district does not provide official Facebook pages for any of the seven board members. Board chair Jamie Farough and board member Carrie Pfeiffer each have a Facebook page with “Wilson County Schools” in the title. The content on those pages is typically a recap of board meetings and district and school announcements. Padilla has two accounts, one under Joseph A. Padilla and the other under Joseph Padilla. On the page under Joseph A. Padilla, he wrote, “These are my personal thoughts and opinions, I only represent myself on this account.” There is nothing available to see when this was added. However, the profile picture has his WCS badge, with his photo and the words “Wilson County Schools.” “My wife likes my smile in that picture, and I try my best to make her happy,” he said about the badge. Ethics committee chair Melissa Lynn said that it was considered an official page by board members. At the hearing the person who made the complaint would read it and provide additional comments to or answer questions from Lynn and the two other members of the committee, Larry Tomlinson and Kimberly McGee. Padilla gave a response to each complaint, also answering questions from the committee. Supporters of both sides clapped after some of the comments. The only complaint that was not dismissed said Padilla provided a photo of a teacher’s classroom door without her permission to a Nashville TV station. The committee (which could have ruled on any of the complaints with a 2-1 vote) decided to present that complaint to the full board for consideration of a public censure of Padilla. “I have never taken any pictures of any doors at Green Hill High School,” Padilla said. “It seems that particular picture is from the Green Hill High School Official Facebook Page that is accessible by anyone including media outlets. If you review the actual (Channel 4) news story the complainant is referencing, you will see that her name is illegible, her name is never mentioned, Green Hill High School is never mentioned, and pictures of Elzie Patton are shown throughout the news story.” The TV station interviewed Padilla who proposed a new policy during a meeting to prohibit teachers from putting LGBTQ Pride Flag stickers on the classroom door to represent a “safe space” for those students. Padilla recommended putting stickers and signs in the school lobby. “I have no problem with the LGBTQ community or any group that tries to make America a ‘More Perfect Union,’ ” he said in an interview three days after the meeting. “The problem lies when groups try to tear down the very foundation that America was built on. If you don’t like it, leave.” Erin Moore, who filed one of the dismissed complaints, said, “I am incredibly frustrated. The (committee) said he violated their ethics policy and dismissed them anyway. I think the board was under a lot of pressure because there were a lot of people in the room.” McGee said it was difficult for the committee members to separate fact from opinion in Padilla’s online posts and the complaints. Tomlinson repeatedly said Padilla made mistakes in comments soon after being elected when he didn’t know what he could and couldn’t say and how it would reflect on him as a school board member. He received assurance a couple of times from Padilla that he has met with WCS Director of Schools Jeff Luttrell to review and understand how board members need to follow district guidelines. “I’m glad the hearing is over, but I am concerned that the complainants will not accept the results,” Padilla said last Sunday. “This hearing had absolutely nothing to do with ethics. This was about leftover emotions from the election. “I don’t think the complaints were appropriate or justified. I think the ethics committee did the best they could do with the information they had. I was really disappointed with the lack of evidence. It was also troubling that the proof that was submitted only told half the story. It seemed like I was on trial for hurt feelings and thought crimes.” You must be logged in to post a comment.

Rinkes, 66, of Decherd pleaded guilty recently to making and subscribing a false U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, Form 1040, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee at Chattanooga. Sentencing has been set for March 7, 2024, before the Honorable Charles E. Atchley, Jr., in the United States District Court at Chattanooga. Rinkes faces a term of up to three years in federal prison, a fine of up to $100,000, and supervised release for up to one year. As required by his plea agreement with the government, he has paid restitution to the IRS in the amount of $1,485,120.38, which includes unpaid taxes plus penalties and interest required by law. As part of the plea agreement filed with the court, Rinkes waived an indictment by a Federal Grand Jury and agreed to plead guilty to the aforementioned charge. Rinkes, the owner of Rinkes Angus Ranch, a farm near Decherd was in the business of purchasing and reselling chicken litter, which is used as fertilizer, and selling crops to grain aggregators. For 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, he provided his tax return preparer with false information that led to material underreporting of his income for each year. Rinkes signed those tax returns under penalty of perjury. On his tax return for 2017, Rinkes willfully and falsely underreported his income by at least $523,796, which resulted in him underreporting his income tax due for that year by at least $181,659. His false individual income tax returns for 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 resulted in a total tax loss of $679,515 to the United States. United States Attorney Francis M.

As students left their early morning classes on Friday, Sept. 15, they were met by some unexpected activists on PED Walkway chanting, flailing signs around and claiming that “birds aren’t real.” Birds Aren’t Real is an official club at the University of Tennessee with 24 official members but more than 150 members on GroupMe and more than 360 followers on Instagram. They have many meetings and events, including rallies on PED and painting The Rock. Many students passing by the rally stopped to read the signs, engage in conversation and take pictures — something the organization highly encourages. One such student was Drew Phillips, a freshman studying marketing. “The whole birds aren’t real protests are a group that is widely seen by others as weird and, to some, obnoxious,” Phillips said. “But honestly, I think it shows the creativity and freedom UTK offers to its student body. Yes, it’s a shot at ironic comedy and internet humor, but overall, the fact that students can gather and express their beliefs no matter how ironic or ridiculous is good to see on campus.” While many students believe that the rallies are satire, the students hosting them seem to truly believe in their cause. Birds Aren’t Real UTK has existed for many years but was not active until last spring when co-presidents Olivia Judd, a sophomore studying engineering, and Jessie Hosken, a junior studying supply chain management, took over and started hosting events and spreading the word. Hosken created an Instagram account last semester that is growing exponentially. Judd has been a long-time activist of the Birds Arent Real movement, her journey beginning while she was in high school. Judd, Hosken and their club members believe in statements made by a U.S. government whistleblower — statements that claim the U.S. government and CIA were in collaboration on an experiment to make birds into drones to spy on the American people. These statements date back to the 50s, and they claim that these whistleblower accounts led to what they believe is the government-planned assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963 because he tried to stop the experiment. They claim that the Eisenhower administration signed off on official documents pertaining to the experiment, but it was not until 2001 that the technology was advanced enough to carry out the experiment fully. “I do believe I’ve made a difference being a part of this group,” Hosken said. “I hope to continue to spread the feathered gospel and reach even more people.” Depending on which club member you ask, not all birds are government drones, but most are, especially in America. “I believe that some other countries could have real birds flying around,” Hosken said. “But I would not be surprised if other governments also replaced their birds with drones.” Although the Birds Aren’t Real movement has seen many criticisms over the years and has been associated with extreme right-wing conspiracy theorists, the club at UT is not associated with politics and conspiracies. They just wish to spread what they believe is the truth. Through their rallies, Birds Aren’t Real UTK hopes that they can expand their club and spread their ""truth"" or, at the very least, bring smiles to fellow students’ faces. “Since we are new to this, we only have co-presidents, again, Jessie and myself. I hope as the club grows, we can split the work and have officers for social media and events and whatnot,” Judd said. For those interested in joining the club and spreading the word, you can follow the group on Instagram @birdsarentrealutk and click on the link in their bio to join their GroupMe. “We send info, debate topics over birds, and it\'s starting to feel like a real community,” Judd said. “Regardless of political or religious opinions, the one thing people can agree on is that birds aren\'t real.” I\'m a 2-time graduate of UTK and absolutely believe in free speech and that students should exercise their right to speak out on any topic they wish. But . . . I\'m struggling to get my arms around this particular conspiracy theory. Is the fact that living breathing birds are actually birds - and nothing else - fake news?

According to Channel 3, the vehicle had struck a boy and woman who lost their lives in the accident, as well as another man who was left in critical condition. Channel 3 also reported that the driver, Randy Vega, was driving under the influence in his van before he struck another vehicle while speeding on Frazier Avenue and veered off the road. Vega is facing multiple charges pertaining to the crash and is now booked at the Hamilton County Jail. According to the Chattanooga Times Free Press, the family that was struck was visiting Tennessee for the first time from Jacksonville, Florida. The recent crash has led multiple residents of Chattanooga to call for the city to do more for pedestrian safety, specifically in the North Shore area with its current traffic set-up. Mayor Tim Kelly stated in a Facebook post, “A reduced speed limit and a new temporary weekend traffic pattern for Frazier Ave will slow traffic and provide insight for long-term redesign of a critical Northshore route.” A memorial was set up at the site honoring the victims of the crash and a go fund me page was set up to support the family and friends affected by the incident and to bring the victims to Florida so the family and friends can have a proper goodbye.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 4:22 am In this file photo, former Senator and U.S. President John F. Kennedy, former Tennessee Governor Buford Ellington and former Senator Albert Gore on the speakers stand at the Tri-Cities Airport Wednesday when Sen. Kennedy spoke to an estimated 11,000 people. The Kingsport Times front page from Sept. 21, 1960, reported on John F. Kennedy’s visit to the Tri-Cities. BLOUNTVILLE — Former U.S. President John. F. Kennedy arrived at Tri-Cities Airport 30 minutes late when he was greeted by an estimated crowd of 11,000 people on Sept. 21, 1960. Kingsport Times News, September 22, 1960 In a Kingsport Times News article published Sept. 22, 1960, reporter Ellis Binkley recaps the energy from the day then-Sen. Kennedy visited the Tri-Cities region. “Even before his white twin-engine plane came to a stop, the crowd started cheering and yelling, ‘We want Kennedy,’” the article states. “Police locked hands to form an aisle from the plane to the speakers’ stand. Despite this human barricade, many reached across to touch the Democratic presidential nominee.” The article also states that he was accompanied by his sister Eunice Shriver, former Sen. Albert Gore and his wife. Another article written by Jerry Alley for the Times News said among the crowd was a group of seventh graders who arrived as early as 6 a.m. to get a glimpse of the future president. His arrival was welcomed with the sound of a high school band performing “Happy Days Are Here Again.” The article states that two planes carrying media personnel arrived ahead of Kennedy’s private plane Carolina, which he named after his daughter. It was reported that at least 100 newspaper, radio and television reporters and photographers were present. “They represented the Associated Press, United Press International, area dailies and weeklies, area television stations — and even one high school newspaper,” the article stated. “It was the largest news media group ever assembled in the area.” During Kennedy’s brief speech, he started out by explaining he was the first presidential candidate at that time to visit the area since Herbert Hoover in 1928. He made reference to the crowd that included visitors from across Virginia, North Carolina and Tennessee. “I think it is most appropriate that we should begin in this community with visitors from three states, Virginia, North Carolina and Tennessee,” said Kennedy in his speech. “Because it was Virginia which produced Thomas Jefferson who founded the Democratic Party. And it was North Carolina and Tennessee that produced and brought to fruition Andrew Jackson, who built the Democratic Party.” Kennedy goes on to explain his platform points of rebuilding and strengthening the nation during a time of tension between the United States and the Soviet Union. “The Democratic Party does not run on a program in this election which will give any satisfaction at all to Mr. Khrushchev,” Kennedy said in his speech. “If we are successful, our objectives will be to rebuild our country, to strengthen our country, and strengthen its position around the world, to strengthen its defenses, to rebuild the economy of this United States.” His speech ended on an optimistic note, citing “our brightest days as the defender of freedom” as still ahead. “I think the 1960s can be days which historians will say, ‘This is when the country moved,’ said Kennedy in his speech. “I ask your help in this campaign, as we move across the New Frontiers of the 1960s, not resting on our oars, not saying what other presidents in other times have done, not saying that previous generations had a rendezvous with destiny, but saying our generation does, our generation does. “ To read the full speech, visit https://www.jfklibrary.org/archives/other-resources/john-f-kennedy-speeches/blountville-tn-19600921. After Kennedy’s death on Nov. 22, 1963, an article published by the Times News stated schools would be closed all day and many businesses would be closed part of the day on the Monday following his assassination. The article states that ETSU classes were also suspended that day “as an expression of the extreme grief possessed by students, faculty and administration.” Kingsport Times News, November 24, 1963 “Whistles will blow in industrial plants at 11 a.m. and work will cease for a period of silence,” the article written by Times News staff writer Bill Barnett states. “Among those definitely planning such observances are Tennessee Eastman Co., The Mead Corporation, Kingsport Press Inc. and American Saint Gobain Corp.” Saint Dominic Church of Kingsport conducted a requiem mass for Kennedy following his death. Binkley recalled some memories of covering Kennedy’s appearances across the state, including a visit to Nashville in May 1963. He said that no matter where Kennedy went, he was always greeting people with his “two-hand shake.” “Here again was the same dynamic personality that had captured the people in Bristol and at the Tri-City Airport,” the article read. “The smile was the same, but the face had lost some of its youthful appearance. There were deep lines that were not there when he was in Tennessee before.” React to this article and join our community of readers sharing their feedback.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 4:22 am Associate Editor Serina Marshall Jonesborough friends: Over the last two years, it has been my privilege to write for the Jonesborough Herald and Tribune. Adding to the legacy and history of not only the town but the paper has been one of the greatest successes of my life — and I will forever be grateful for the time spent on Main Street. However, my chapter at the little paper with a big heart has come to a close. After two years, I am hanging up my reporter hat and press pass and beginning a new page of opportunities, though I will carry the faces and memories of those who have crossed my path in Jonesborough daily. Thank you for allowing me into your businesses and homes, inviting me to your weddings and birthdays and treating me like one of your family with every interaction. If only the world could be more like the small town in East Tennessee. Telling your stories has been an honor, and I am grateful to you for trusting me with your tales. I truly hope that you will remember me fondly, as I will all of you. Please continue to support local journalism and small-town papers. News deserts are devouring print media, and small-town news is being found less and less. It is such a shame to see them disappearing, but they still can be saved. If I could leave you with one request — don’t give up on the Herald and Tribune. I promise, the paper itself hasn’t given up on Tennessee’s Oldest Town. And no matter where I am, I will make sure the world knows about Jonesborough and the people who make it so wonderful. You’ve made this dreamer’s dreams come true within your fairy-tale town. Thank you will never be sufficient. I love you all. I’ll be seeing you! — Serina Marshall Associate Editor Jonesborough Herald and Tribune React to this article and join our community of readers sharing their feedback.
