After all, the program that demolished the city’s downtown Black neighborhoods ended almost 50 years ago. But many sociologists, historians and local Black residents agree: Urban renewal isn’t over. Uprooting most of the Black population between 1959 and 1974 directly contributed to today’s Black poverty, struggles for education, poor housing conditions, crime and unsafe neighborhoods. It also helped create today’s affordable housing crisis and shaped public housing for half a century. Today, at least one in five Black families in Knoxville live in poverty. Knox County schools acknowledge discipline policies that disproportionately remove Black students from classrooms. And Black teens are getting shot and killed at an alarming rate. The predominantly Black Austin-East High School has lost five students to violence this year -- including Anthony Thompson Jr., shot by police inside the school. Enkeshi El-Amin founded a creative community nonprofit named for the Bottom, one of the neighborhoods destroyed by urban renewal. A sociologist and folklorist, El-Amin says the destruction wrought by urban renewal created feelings of loss and instability that still shape Knoxville’s Black community. “The... young people that were killed in East Knoxville: That is not separate from the destruction of black places. These things are all connected,” she said. “Black folks are completely disregarded in Knoxville and we’re constantly pulled out of our places.” Some East Knoxville residents perceive patterns established by urban renewal repeating today, as the city pursues new projects in the old Black neighborhoods. On the drawing board are a children’s science museum and a baseball park. Because of all these factors, urban renewal has become a current political issue. Knoxville Vice Mayor Gwen McKenzie authored a proposal that passed city council late last year, acknowledging the damage of urban renewal and agreeing for the city to seek $100 million in grants over the next decade to make amends to the Black community. A task force will advise the city, identifying needs and coordinating local partners. McKenzie said it has taken a long time to vet the many applicants, and the process was delayed by the need to focus immediately on youth violence in East Knoxville. But she said City Council will be asked to approve the task force members in June. “Urban renewal created a mindset of poverty and generational poverty,” McKenzie said in May. “I felt like it was our responsibility to say we’re going to be intentional -- just as intentional as the federal urban renewal program was -- at helping provide the training, the access, the financial literacy, the coaching, the life skills that people who were affected and living in poverty are having to deal with.” That in turn will break that cycle and start building generational wealth, she said. Federal incentives, racial overtones James Fraser was an urban geography professor at Vanderbilt, now writing a book about housing justice called “The Making of the Precarious City.” He explains the philosophy behind urban renewal: “The actual stated goal was to modernize cities and get rid of what some people called blight,” he said. That often meant unstable houses that lacked indoor plumbing and electricity. But Fraser says the term was often applied unevenly and too broadly, especially to Black neighborhoods. “There were many cases across entire country where white power was used to obliterate certain neighborhoods in order to provide subsidies to kind of a whole development industry, to upgrade areas in the name of helping people,” he said. “But it didn’t take into consideration the unstated goals. We’re talking about an era in which White power was used to create cities in the image of colonizers -- people who came in and decided what they wanted was better than what was there.” A 1958 News Sentinel article did in fact proclaim that the Bottom“is almost ready for a new wave of ‘pioneers,’ very different from pioneers of old. These pioneers will be modern industries and businesses.” Like many cities, Knoxville was eager to revitalize a tax base that was dwindling as houses aged and white residents fled to the suburbs. The Housing Act of 1949 established the urban renewal program to help cities knock down decrepit buildings and clear space for new development. The same year, a Knoxville planning engineer told the City Council that “slum property” was bringing little money to the city’s treasury but received “a disproportionate share” of city services like police protection, social workers, public health support, and garbage collection. “It is literally true,” he said, “that good residential sections of our city are subsidizing slums.” He claimed the areas were havens for juvenile delinquency, tuberculosis, and “family disintegration.” To cities across America, urban renewal looked like a great deal: The federal government would pay two-thirds of the cost, and the local contribution could be through services or materials. Over the course of the program’s life, federal officials approved over $13 billion in grants to more than 1,200 cities. The relatively-new Knoxville Housing Authority was put in charge of urban renewal locally. The agency was not a stickler for following the law’s (limited) requirements to help affected residents find better-quality housing. In 1960, the News Sentinel reported that urban renewal funds had been frozen because Knoxville hadn’t created housing codes or formed a citizen advisory committee for relocating these families. But that was just a hiccup. By 1967, Knoxville’s participation in urban renewal ranked second-highest among Southeastern cities of a similar size. Nationally, people of color made up 60 percent of those forced to move by urban renewal. In Knoxville, it was 70 percent, according to the Beck Cultural Exchange Center, which preserves the history of urban renewal in the city. The Willow Street project was the first of three to level African American neighborhoods downtown. It took a neighborhood known as the Bottom, the onetime “Little Harlem” of Knoxville that also had a residential section as well as stockyards built around a railroad spur. Next came Mountain View, once its own town, a residential neighborhood with commanding river and city views. That project eventually bled into Morningside and extended east toward Five Points. A fourth urban renewal project cleared a neighborhood known then as “West Knoxville” to double the size of the University of Tennessee campus starting in 1962. The majority of the 393 families relocated from there were white. But a middle-class Black neighborhood there was destroyed too. Downtown destruction Downtown, urban renewal came in waves, uprooting of every aspect of life for thousands of people. “Losing your business, losing your home, losing your church, that’s a lot to rebuild,” El-Amin said. “Something’s got to go, because you can’t build everything back at the same time. You didn’t build it all at once to start with.” The entire Black business district around East Vine Street was wiped out. Only Jarnigan & Son Mortuary survives today. According to the Beck Center, about 2,500 structures, including at least 107 businesses, were destroyed. Urban renewal also took community institutions like schools and the Carnegie Library, built for Black residents in 1917. It took the Phyllis Wheatly YWCA and the YMCA established by Cal Johnson, the former slave and wealthy Black businessman. Housing conditions were rough in some areas. A 1967 report by the Southern Regional Office of the Urban League indicated that only 40 Census tracts in the entire country were in worse condition than Mountain View, which had “some of the country’s worst ghettos.” There, 65 percent of families earned less than $3,000 in 1959 and 52 percent of men over 25 didn’t have an eighth-grade education. The Bottom had some very run-down areas too.
