Paramedics and emergency medical technicians treated patients — ranging in age from 14 months to adults — for a long list of injuries, including serious head injuries, cuts, bruises, nausea, and loss of consciousness. Hawaiian Airlines said Flight 35 from Phoenix “landed safely” in Honolulu about 10:50 a.m. The Airbus A330 was full, carrying 278 passengers and 10 crew members.
