His attorney argued the prosecution didn\'t provide sufficient evidence his client committed the crimes. Carie Hallford already had her hearing and will face trial. During Carie\'s hearing, prosecutors presented text messages suggesting the couple tried covering up their financial woes by leaving the bodies behind at the ""maggot-infested"" Penrose facility. Jon allegedly suggested dumping the bodies in a hole or setting them on fire to avoid getting caught in text messages dating back to 2020, according to prosecutors. The Hallfords were arrested in Oklahoma in November and now face hundreds of charges, including 190 counts of abuse of a corpse, five counts of theft, four counts of money laundering, and more than 50 counts of forgery.
