The number of people injured and the number of cars in the pile-up near Manchac has also risen. Here is the latest information from Louisiana State Police Troop B. Troop B and engineers still have a lot of work to do to get the stretch of elevated interstate that runs between Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas open. For now, I-55 is closed from Ponchatoula to the Ruddock exit. State Police, first responders, DOTD crews and various tow companies worked all day Monday and through most of Tuesday to clear vehicles and debris off the roadway. The next step in the process is to clean the roadway. DOTD bridge inspectors have already identified several areas that require repair. Once the remaining debris, diesel fuel, and other chemicals are cleaned up, they will begin a more thorough structural inspection. Meanwhile, experts are conducting bridge deck scams that will provide additional data needed for engineers to determine the integrity of the damaged concrete, the extent of the damage, and what repairs are required to make it safe for travel. Louisiana State Police and DOTD will work closely to coordinate reopening of the interstate, but not before inspections are complete. Monday night's additional death brings the death toll to eight (8). Troopers say at least 168 vehicles were involved in the cluster of crashes, up from the original report of 158. Originally, they reported 25 people had sustained minor to critical injuries, but that number has risen as well, to 63. State Police are still working to confirm that all vehicles involved in the crash are accounted for. They also want to identify anyone, driver or passengers, who may have been in those vehicles. Anyone who has a family member they have not heard from who may have been traveling along that portion of I-55 during the time of the crash should email Troop B at TroopB@la.gov. Understandably, the crash was traumatic on the people involved. The Louisiana Department of Health has created a behavioral health resource guide that may help anyone affected by the tragic event. Drivers and owners of the vehicles involved in the crash can find out where their vehicle may have been towed by emailing TroopB@la.gov. Vehicles and personal items can be retrieved from the tow yard by showing proof of ownership to the tow company.""}]"

And while some of the people singled out by the committee as collaborators are facing racketeering charges in Georgia, many others remain in positions of political leadership — and Trump leads the Republican primary pack, despite facing 91 felony counts across four criminal cases. Cheney says the committee\'s work was ""crucial and indispensable"" both in terms of informing the Justice Department\'s work and presenting evidence of Trump\'s involvement for the historical record. And she says it\'s far from over. ""Looking to the future requires that we acknowledge what happened and how dangerous it was and certainly not put those same people back into office again,"" she added. ""Making sure that that story is written and that story\'s told is very important as we think about, particularly, the election that\'s coming up next year."" Cheney was a notable figure in conservative politics well before she was elected to represent Wyoming in Congress in 2017. She worked on her father Dick Cheney\'s campaign when he was George W. Bush\'s running mate in 2000, and focused on promoting democracy in the Middle East as a State Department aide in Bush\'s administration. She says she grew up in Republican politics and believes in the values of the party that former President Ronald Reagan, for example, embodied. But she doesn\'t recognize them in today\'s GOP, which she says has become ""an anti-constitutional party."" She points to the moment at the first Republican primary debate, when six out of the eight candidates onstage raised their hand to show they would support Trump as the nominee even if he were convicted.

The answer is we likely will all be just fine even though the New York Post reports that this sucker is big! It weighs 600 pounds! And while this satellite is a big piece of space junk now it also has a really long name. The newly decommissioned satellite is called the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager or RHESSI. This satellite was pretty amazing. According to NASA, it recorded over 100,000 gamma rays and x-rays over its life. It even was able to give scientists information about the shape of the sun. The reason that they are letting it fall back into the Earth\'s atmosphere is because in 2018 it started haveing difficulty communicating information back to our planet. It basically is just getting old. This satellite was shot up into the Earth\'s low orbit back in 2002. Imagine all the different information NASA was able to glean from this piece of equipment in the nearly twenty years that it has been orbiting our planet. Now, it\'s likely not going to be a bother to any of us as most of the satellite will burn up as it reenters the Earth\'s atmosphere. However, some pieces could stay intact and fall onto our landscape or into an ocean. The chances of one of us getting hit by it are one in 2,467.

Federal lawsuits accused Amazon and Google of exploiting their monopolies. Streaming services offered less content for more money. Reddit users protested a new policy. Social media networks filled with ads and recommendations and stores we didn\'t ask for. And then there\'s whatever is happening at X, formerly known as Twitter, under Elon Musk. One man put a name to this process. We cannot say the term on public radio, but you can think of it as worsening or platform decay. The New York Times went with the euphemism enjunkification. Tech journalist and science fiction writer Cory Doctorow coined the term we cannot say. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. CORY DOCTOROW: Thank you very much. SHAPIRO: What is a platform that, to your eyes, exemplifies this trend? And you can\'t say Twitter \'cause that\'s too easy. DOCTOROW: No, I think Facebook\'s a good example. You know, Facebook went through the whole life cycle of platform decay. They started off by offering a really good deal to their end users. You know, they said, hey. Leave MySpace. Come to Facebook. It\'s just like MySpace, except we only show you the things that you ask to see, and we\'ll never spy on you. And then once those users were locked in - you know, because once you\'re in a place with all your friends, it\'s really hard to leave - they started to take away some of that good stuff they gave them, and they handed it to advertisers and publishers. To the advertisers, they said, you know, we were lying when we said we weren\'t going to spy on these guys. We\'re totally spying on them. Here\'s all the data you need to target them for ads that we\'re not going to charge you much money for. And to the publishers, they said, we were also lying when we said we\'d only show them the stuff they asked to see. And then, you know, once the publishers and the advertisers were locked in, well, they took away those surpluses. The ads got more expensive. Publishers had to put more and more of their content, not just to get recommended, but even to be shown to the people who subscribe them. And that\'s the final stage. This stage where there\'s just, like, only the residual value left on the platform that the platform owner thinks will keep the users and the business customers they bring in stuck to the platform. And that\'s when, you know, we\'re at the beginning of the end. SHAPIRO: You use the term platform decay, which suggests this is a well-established arc. Can you just, in the simplest layman\'s terms, describe what this process is? DOCTOROW: Yeah. It\'s a platform being unfettered from competition \'cause they were able to buy their competitors or use predatory pricing to keep them out. They bring in users. They offer them really good deals, and then they alter the deal. And they use the fact that digital realms have a lot of flexibility. You can change the deal in tiny ways that are hard to notice, although they add up over time. And also because these companies, when they get so big and concentrated, they capture their regulators. And so things that would otherwise be a violation of privacy rights or labor rights or consumer rights, they get away with. SHAPIRO: So I can imagine a few potential solutions. Like, one is all of the users migrating to some other platform. Another would be an antitrust lawsuit like some of the ones we\'ve seen. Is there something that you think actually works really well to fight this? DOCTOROW: Well, one thing we could do is stop them from buying their competitors or using predatory pricing. There\'s been a bunch of law action from the agencies on this. The DOJ and the FTC have taken it on. Their European counterparts, even China, have all been paying attention to these questions. We have to make it legal to do to Facebook and Apple and Google and all these other tech platforms the things they did to the companies that came before them. SHAPIRO: You know, there was a New York Times op-ed that basically said, what you call the degradation of these websites is actually just old people aging out of an internet that has always catered to young people - that Millennials and Gen Xers just don\'t get it anymore. And Gen Z is still having fun online on platforms that might barely register with you and me. What do you make of that critique? DOCTOROW: Well, look. I turned 50 a couple of years ago. I got doxxed by the AARP. They tracked me down... SHAPIRO: (Laughter). DOCTOROW: ...And gave me that card that allows me to complain that things used to be better when I was young. But I\'ll stipulate that the way that I want to use the internet is not the way my 15-year-old wants to use the internet. What I\'m concerned about is when she wants to leave the platform that she\'s on because it\'s not serving her either, will she have an easy way to escape, or will she find herself stuck to it? And you\'re just not going to convince me that what happened between my generation and my kid\'s generation is that they suddenly discovered that they enjoyed being ripped off. SHAPIRO: Cory Doctorow. His latest book is called ""The Internet Con: How To Seize The Means Of Computation."" Thanks a lot. DOCTOROW: Thank you. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.

'version': '2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Updated November 18, 2023 at 11:45 AM ET Israeli bombardment has killed thousands of civilians in the areas of the Gaza Strip that Israel has ordered them to move to, Gaza health ministry death tolls show. Witnesses\' accounts, satellite data and expert assessment gathered by NPR show that Israeli airstrikes and artillery fire occur daily in the areas Israel has said are ""safer"" for civilians, and have hit schools, residential towers and overcrowded United Nations refugee shelters. Amid its military offensive on Gaza City and the northern Gaza Strip, the Israeli military has repeatedly dropped leaflets and sent messages telling residents they must leave their homes and ""evacuate"" to areas it claims are safer, which are south of the Wadi Gaza wetlands. Families have risked journeys through the blasted landscape of destroyed buildings and corpses, along the road that Israel has designated as a ""humanitarian corridor"" through the war. For the few hours each day that the road is open, people carry or drag wounded loved ones. They push wheelchairs with patients just out of surgery in hospitals that have now stopped working. Mothers pull along weary children who look around with blank, fearful stares. But what awaits Palestinians who move south is still life-threatening. The ""evacuation"" areas are both heavily bombarded and in a dire humanitarian crisis, as Israel\'s blockade of fuel and control of aid into the Gaza Strip leaves people searching for food and access to clean water. ""Israel\'s use of the term \'evacuation\' for sending Palestinians to southern areas is really problematic, because it conjures up an idea of a safe route to a place of safety,"" says Caitlin Procter, a research fellow at the Center on Conflict Development and Peacebuilding at the Geneva Graduate Institute. ""But the reality is there is no safe place left in Gaza for people to go."" Israel has vowed to defeat Hamas and force an end to its rule of Gaza after the Oct. 7 attack in which Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials. The Israeli military says it will strike Hamas targets ""wherever necessary."" So far, Israeli airstrikes have hit residential buildings, bakeries, hospitals and even United Nations-run shelters across the heavily populated Gaza Strip, including in the south. The Israel Defense Forces press desk, responding via WhatsApp to questions from NPR, said on Nov. 9 that it is operating to protect the security of the state of Israel after the Hamas attacks. It said it ""continues to request that all residents move south, where it is considered to be safer than the northern Gaza Strip."" But, it says, because ""Hamas has embedded itself in civilian infrastructure and operates across the entire Gaza Strip,"" the IDF ""will strike Hamas wherever necessary."" Earlier this week, Israel\'s military dropped leaflets telling residents in parts of the southern town of Khan Younis they too had to leave their homes. The IDF did not respond to NPR\'s request for comment on this further displacement of civilians. The dangers for those fleeing south are evident from the high number of people killed there. So far, a total of more than 11,800 people — of which more than two-thirds are children, women and elderly — have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its military offensive last month, according to Gaza\'s Health Ministry. A map by the United Nations\' humanitarian affairs office, relying on the health ministry\'s data, shows that more than 3,600 people — roughly one-third of the total — were killed in areas where Israel has told civilians in northern Gaza to escape to. Loading... The latest analysis of imagery from the European Space Agency\'s Sentinel-1 satellite shows a steady increase in the number of buildings destroyed in middle and southern Gaza. Since the beginning of the conflict, over 10,000 buildings are likely to have been damaged or destroyed by airstrikes in these areas, according to analysis by Corey Scher of New York\'s CUNY Graduate Center and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University. As NPR has previously reported, the same satellite analysis shows extensive destruction in northern Gaza, according to Scher and Van Den Hoek. The majority – 94% – of the damage to central and southern Gaza appeared after Oct. 13, when the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of northern Gaza. Since Oct. 30, between 3,400 and 4,800 additional buildings have been destroyed or damaged in this so-called evacuation zone, including in the heavily populated refugee camps of Bureij and Al-Maghazi. On Tuesday, Israeli airstrikes hit a densely populated residential area in Khan Younis, killing at least 14 people. Several news reports have noted bombardments also hit residential buildings in the Nuseirat refugee camp and Deir al-Balah, both in central Gaza. Asa\'d Saqallah told NPR his family fled Gaza City when his father received a call from the Israeli military saying they had to leave their home and move south. On Oct. 13, he and 16 relatives, including his adult siblings and their children, took what few possessions they could and went to stay with a cousin in Khan Younis, in the south of the Gaza Strip. Eleven days later, at night on Oct. 24, most of the family were sleeping when, Saqallah says, ""Death came."" In a multiple rocket attack, Saqallah says, the walls of their apartment caved in on them, and the apartment above in the three-story building was destroyed. ""I started praying; rubble fell on me; my face was burnt,"" he says. Saqallah says his 11-month-old son was killed. So was his sister, her husband and their three children, ages 12, 8 and 6 months. And so was his younger brother, 18, and a cousin. Saqallah\'s wife, who was heavily pregnant, was badly wounded. ""When I carried her out of the building, her arm was gone and her legs were just flesh,"" he says. Doctors managed to save her and the baby girl that she has now delivered — named Mariam after Saqallah\'s dead sister. Saqallah, 25, says baby Mariam has given them a reason to live. But they remain broken. ""There is no emotion, no life, no feeling,"" he says. ""After everything that has happened, and we\'re sitting in the hospital now, how do you want us to feel?"" An analysis by the civilian harm watchdog Airwars shared with NPR finds that in the first week after Israel began telling civilians to move south, the bombardment on these areas increased. The increase was part of intensified airstrikes across the Gaza Strip. The group parsed every report of harm to civilians south of Wadi Gaza in the first week after Israel told civilians to go there. Including only those events they could geolocate, Airwars gathered 127 allegations of civilian harm between Oct. 14 and Oct. 21. ""You can see that the frequency and intensity of those allegations of the attacks south of Wadi Gaza really appeared to increase,"" Sanjana Varghese, a journalist who also works as an investigator at Airwars, says of the group\'s as-yet unpublished analysis. The strikes on the south were part of a pattern of increased Israeli bombardment across the whole Gaza Strip, Varghese says. Many of the reported attacks Airwars analyzed in the south were around civilian infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and restaurants. ""Calling this area an evacuation zone might technically be true,"" says Varghese. ""But it\'s not safe. It\'s not a place that people can go to and know that they\'ll be taken care of."" Last Sunday, Israeli strikes included an attack on a guesthouse for staff from UNRWA, the U.N. relief agency that aids Palestinians, in the southern town of Rafah, on the border with Egypt. In this case, the employees had just left the building and were not injured. But in the past five weeks, 102 UNRWA staff have been killed — more losses than during any other period in its more than 70-year history. ""Every day we get more confirmation of more colleagues killed,"" says Juliette Touma, UNRWA\'s director of communications, based in Amman. ""It\'s shattering. It\'s just shattering."" Some 830,000 displaced people are sheltering in UNRWA schools and other buildings. They live in cramped conditions, sleeping in the schoolyards or in hallways. In the most overcrowded shelters there are now over 600 people sharing one toilet. UNRWA regularly shares the coordinates of its centers with the Israeli military, and civilians come to the shelters hoping they are safe. But even these have become targets.

In the end, the mayor never stayed in any of the developers’ properties, meaning investigators left the exchange essentially empty-handed, the sources said.
