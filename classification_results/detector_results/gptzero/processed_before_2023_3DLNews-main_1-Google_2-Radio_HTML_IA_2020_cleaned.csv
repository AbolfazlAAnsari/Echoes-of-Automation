She now says she will make decisions to share tomorrow, after looking at another day of data. There are several counties that are seeing marked growth in COVID-19 cases. Every county in the state may not see the same openings. The State of Iowa was given 400 doses of Remdesivir by the Federal government because of the growing number of cases of COVID-19 in the state. According to IDPH, the department will decide which hospitals and patients qualify. A patient must have severely low oxygen in their blood or be on a ventilator. Additionally, while fast-tracked by the FDA to help treat the symptoms of coronavirus, it is still an experimental treatment, so a patient can say “no.” ___________ The Iowa Department of Public Health has released the new COVID-19 numbers. They reported 539 new cases and 18 deaths. There are currently 385 hospitalized with the virus, with 143 patients in intensive care. There are 101 patients on ventilators. ___________ Iowa Lieutenant Governor Adam Gregg has given an update on the Feeding Iowa Task Force. Gregg says that vendors and corporations have been generous so far as the state tries to keep food banks full, despite near-record unemployment, and Iowans being forced to stay home due to COVID-19. He talked about the success of the Pass the Pork program so far, and how he hopes to expand to other livestock, and possibly vegetable producers. They are also talking about the repacking of bulk goods for families, if sellers can not move them on the market. For more information on food assistance, or donating to the feeding of your neighbors, see the Iowa website. Local News: All patients going to UnityPoint, even if they are asymptomatic, will now be tested for COVID-19. The move comes as the hospital amps up planned admissions and elective procedures. It will also apply to anyone transferred. The healthcare provider’s testing capabilities have increased, so they are increasing safety. ____________ The Des Moines Arts Festival has decided to cancel the 2020 version of the cultural event. Out of caution for the artists, volunteers, and attendees, Festival leaders have chosen to close the in-person event. The 2021 Des Moines Arts Festival is scheduled for June 25-27. In the meantime, DMAF will be having some fun with videos, virtual art displays, the Interrobang Film Festival being online, and more. Here’s the first video now! Meanwhile, another major local event, the Iowa State Fair, intends to make its decision about the August tradition in early to mid-June. ____________ Polk County Emergency Management gave an update today on its efforts in fighting COVID-19 locally. It was noted that the United Way managed 2-1-1 is getting about 100 COVID-19 health calls a day, as well as hundreds more for their regular services, and needs that have been created by the pandemic. Polk County has its own testing strike team for hot spot needs. That’s because the State of Iowa has a long waiting list for the teams. When Polk County tests directly the tests come back within 48-hours on the outside. The County is following State of Iowa testing rules, available here. They are just as strict as when testing began in the state because there are still limited tests. ___________ It’s International Nurses Day! Now, more than ever, people are appreciating just how important and amazing nurses are. To show your appreciation, you can help them get the PPE they need to fight COVID-19. Polk County Health Department is taking donations of medical-grade, and homemade, safety gear. To find out what is needed, or to arrange a donation, email logistics@polkcountyiowa.gov. ____________ Catch Des Moines has launched the “Buy Now, Visit Later” hotel bonds campaign. The program aims to support recovery efforts for local hotels – which are a huge part of the local economy through tourism and hospitality. And, the hotel-motel tax helps pay for the arts, events, and cultural infrastructure in the community. How does it work? By investing in a $100 bond to a local hotel that matures to $150 in 60 days, residents can help local hotels weather the storm. Then they can use the bonds for a staycation, or to invite friends and family to visit later. Nearly 30 Greater Des Moines hotels have signed up for the initiative. See full details, and buy your bonds here. Good News: The Elder Corporation has bought 1,000 pasta dinners from Tursi’s Latin King to be given to the community for free on May 12, to recognize Elder’s 60th anniversary. Beginning at 3 p.m., everyone is welcome to pick up a pasta dinner with a side of salad and a roll on a first-come, first-served basis. Drivers should enter from the Hubbell Avenue side. Latin King will pause regular carryout orders on Tuesday only. ____________ Hy-Vee will give away 7,200 mangos to customers at the Chariton Hy-Vee on Wednesday, May 13, courtesy of its produce supplier Robinson Fresh.

time of year, folks. Turkey season. What could be better than spending a day with family, eating good food, and casually watching the Lions get beat in the background? In the spirit of Thanksgiving, I thought it would be fitting to discuss some things in the world of sports that we can be thankful for. Without further ado, here are those things… Because of the coronavirus, we were robbed of the most wonderful time of the sports year – March Madness. Nothing beats making a bracket and hanging on tooth and nail to every game in hopes that your upset picks were correct and your Final Four teams move into the next round. I tried to scratch my bracket-making itch by filling in an Electoral College map this year but believe me, it wasn’t the same. Fans of the teams may wear customized wristbands and other sports apparel to show their support. While March Madness and the excitement of sports fandom bring joy to many, it’s crucial to consider the impact of prolonged standing or intense physical activity on our bodies. This is where orthotics can play a significant role in providing comfort and support. Whether you’re cheering courtside or pacing around the living room during a nail-biting game, the right orthotic inserts can alleviate discomfort and prevent potential foot issues. Websites like EaseTheFeet.com offer a range of orthotic solutions tailored to individual needs, ensuring that fans can continue to enjoy their favorite pastimes without sacrificing comfort or well-being. So, while the thrill of March Madness may be on hiatus, investing in proper foot support ensures that fans can stay in the game, both literally and figuratively. Never fear, after some slight scheduling modifications, the NCAA college basketball season is starting this Thanksgiving week. In my opinion, there is no play more exciting in all of sports than the last-second Hail Mary. After nearly 60 minutes of battling it out in the trenches and with the trailing team out of options, for a moment, the gridiron is transformed into a schoolyard game of 500. Within 10 seconds of the quarterback taking the snap, one team will be alive with the thrills of victory, and the other team dead in the agony of defeat. The ball hangs in the air for what feels like forever, the camera pans to the mess of players jostling for position, and finally, the ball drops out of the sky to decide the fate of the game. Poetry in motion. Recently I have been reading Al Michaels’ book, You Can’t Make This Up, and it has given me a new appreciation for sportscasters. It’s easy to overlook announcers when flipping through games on TV or the radio, and often, it’s easy to hate on them. But instead of discounting and denigrating them, I think it’s more fun to view announcers as characters who add to the experience of watching a sporting event. After all, can you imagine the Masters without Jim Nantz or the afternoon football game on Fox without Joe Buck? From the measured warmth of an Al Michaels to the spontaneous rambling of a Bill Walton, announcers who are able to brush their personality on a game all while providing insight and value are national treasures. So thank you, announcers. Jordan. Woods. Brady. Chestnut. Is there anyone who has dominated their sport the way Joey Chestnut has dominated the 4th of July Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest? The man has won 13 out of the last 14 years. And in those 13 wins, Chestnut has eaten 244,720 calories worth of hot dogs. That’s over 122 days of food based on a 2000 calorie per day diet. Sometimes you just have to take a step back and marvel at greatness. Surely, there is no better sound in sports than the sound of a baseball colliding with the sweet spot of a bat. A nice crack of the bat on a hot summer’s day is what America is all about. The only other sports sound that comes close is the sound of a football hitting the upright. Cody Parkey’s double doink in Chicago was a piece of symphonic genius. Nevertheless, nothing beats the sound of a crack of the bat, so I am thankful for the science behind that sound.
