RELATED: Poisoned: Arizona’s fentanyl crisis Phoenix fire officials performed life-saving measures but the toddler was pronounced dead on scene. Police say Natalie Tate, the toddler's mother, confirmed she was the caretaker of the boy leading to his death. Another child was found unharmed. Tate admitted to using drugs, described as fentanyl, the night before and believed the young boy might have gained access to a container with pills and ingested one. According to court documents, Tate has a history of drug abuse documented by the Department of Child Safety. Some of the history includes having marijuana and Percocets in her bloodstream a day after giving birth. Tate faces one count of negligent homicide and two counts of child abuse. Tara Sundem, the executive director of of Hushabye Nursery, a recovery center for pregnant and parenting families that struggle with opioid addiction, says the situation that unfolded is ‘tragic,’, and that it is difficult for those who are using drugs to use their brains correctly. “It’s really scary. Opiate use disorder is a chronic illness, and it’s a brain disease and everyone needs help sometimes. Reach out, we’ll do what we can,” Sundem said. Sundem has seen an increase in babies and parents coming in to ask for help. They hit a sobering milestone of helping 700 babies this January since they opened in 2020. Data from the Banner Poison and Drug Information Center shows an increase from seven fentanyl exposures reported in 2017 to 113 reported in 2022. However, in 2023, the number decreased to 70.

Devin Thompson was surrounded by family and lawyers on Thursday during a news conference that officially announced a notice of claim, which is filed before a lawsuit. He was in a wheelchair because he’s paralyzed due to the shooting. His lawyers said he couldn’t talk about the case because of the legal litigation. On Aug. 1, officers went to the area of 35th Avenue and Bell Road after someone said a man was waving a gun and had possibly been intimidating neighbors before. Investigators said when officers arrived, Devin Thompson and another person were sitting on a landscape wall. As the police SUV was slowing down, detectives say Thompson pulled a gun from his waistband and ran toward officers. Rev. Jarrett Maupin disputes this. “The police were called by a racist neighbor and they were basically bum-rushed by them,” he said Thursday. Police said an officer jumped out of the slow-moving SUV and shot Thompson as he ran by. “He wasn’t in the midst of committing a crime. The police were called, and he ran away from them. Who the hell wouldn’t run from them these days?” said Maupin. Thompson’s legal team said he was running away from them when he was shot. “This young man was well past the police officer’s car when he got out and pulled his gun and turned and shot this young man in the back,” attorney Robert J. McWhirter said. Thompson and his attorneys said he had a cellphone in his hand, and was not carrying a gun. Police said they recovered a homemade handgun with a Glock switch added to make it look like a machine gun, which appears to be corroborated by body-cam video (see still image below) released by the department weeks after the shooting. Thompson’s lawyers said the gun police got wasn’t there at the time of the shooting. Because of the shooting, Thompson lost a lung and can’t walk. Maupin said this case highlights “how extremely violent, on the cusp of death, an encounter with an encounter with Phoenix police can be.” After being released from the hospital, he was booked on two counts of prohibited weapons, two counts of disorderly conduct and one count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Thompson said he is going to therapy and needs help from his mother to shower. “I don’t wear jeans; I got pants I can put on and slip off,” he said. “You know, just healing up, just getting my mind right, and going to church every Sunday.” His legal team also released a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice urging more federal oversight of the Phoenix Police Department. This comes as the department is awaiting the findings from the DOJ’s investigation that started in August 2021. Federal investigators are focusing on allegations of excessive force, discriminatory policing, retaliation against protesters, and violations surrounding how it treats those with behavioral health and the homeless. Phoenix officials say reforms have already taken place within the police department since the start of the investigation, and federal monitoring “does not make sense for Phoenix.” Thompson’s lawyers said they still haven’t released the raw body-camera video of the Aug. 1 shooting.
