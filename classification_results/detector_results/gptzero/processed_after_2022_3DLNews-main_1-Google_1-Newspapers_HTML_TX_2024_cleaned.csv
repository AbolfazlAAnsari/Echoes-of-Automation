Greg Abbott speaks at a campaign rally Monday at the Fredonia Hotel. As the old saying goes, there’s three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics. Gov. Greg Abbott employed all three strategies in a single statement Monday during a stop at the Fredonia Hotel as he confidently fed a ravenous crowd the baloney they wanted to hear instead of the truth.
