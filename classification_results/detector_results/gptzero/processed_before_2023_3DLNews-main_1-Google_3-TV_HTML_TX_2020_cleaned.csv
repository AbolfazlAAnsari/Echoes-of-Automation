Greg Abbott declined to issue a statewide order. He said he preferred local governments decide for themselves. So far, more than 50 Texas counties have issued stay-at-home orders. There are huge clusters of stay-at-home orders for counties around the most populated cities. Stay-at-home and shelter-in-place are essentially the same thing. Many city and county leaders though have started calling it a stay-at-home or “Stay Home, Work Safe” order so people don’t get it confused with orders during something like a hurricane or active shooter.

afternoon near Bailey Island. Marine Patrol confirmed what witnesses at the scene told NEWS CENTER Maine: a woman was swimming off the shore near While Sails Lane when she was injured in what appeared to be a shark attack. Earlier on Monday afternoon, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Amanda Wyrick had confirmed with NEWS CENTER Maine the Coast Guard took a call of a possible shark attack off the coast of Harpswell Monday afternoon. Wyrick said they were in the process of sending a small boat to assist in the rescue from the Coast Guard station in South Portland, but their assistance was called off when they heard two kayakers helped transport the two people in the water back to shore, where they were met by members of the Harpswell EMS squad. Marine Patrol says the woman was pronounced dead at the scene. The investigation is ongoing and no other information is available at this time, Marine Patrol says. #DEVELOPPING: The US Coast Guard says it responded to a possible shark attack off the coast of Harpswell Monday afternoon. A 9-1-1 call for a water rescue was made at the same time here off White Sails Ln. on Bailey Island. @newscentermaine pic.twitter.com/0XoHx6pO0V Until further notice, swimmers and boaters are urged to use caution near Bailey Island and to avoid swimming near schooling fish or seals. The identity of the woman is being withheld pending notification of family. The neighbor who called 9-1-1 tells me she saw a woman thrown up in the air while swimming between this shore line and the first lobster buoy.

The ship, owned by the University of Alaska, is becoming a platform for a joint study along with the University of Washington. ""The Arctic is the canary in the coal mine - people have called it. It\'s the place where we\'re seeing the most dramatic, rapid climate change,"" said Jim Thomson, a professor of engineering and adjunct professor of oceanography for UW\'s Applied Physics Lab. The organization has studied the Earth\'s poles for decades. ""We were looking at the reduction in sea ice, which has been very dramatic in recent years,"" Thomson said. ""And we were looking at how that reduction in sea ice has allowed an increase in wave activity."" Also see | Microsoft pledges to be ‘carbon negative’ by 2030, launches $1B Climate Innovation Fund Open ocean allows for higher waves to form more frequently because the friction of the wind roils that water into waves. Why does that matter in ocean once covered by thick sheets of ice? One reason is that the waves are now able to reach and attack the Alaskan coast line for longer periods of the season. That\'s already forcing the retreat and abandonment of portions of coastal villages. During their trip, scientists also witnessed large areas of so-called pancake ice, which are round disks of thin ice. Though it\'s common in Antarctica where waves are more violent in the southern oceans, it wasn\'t until recently that pancake ice was seen in the Arctic Ocean. ""That has not been seen in the Arctic previously,"" Thomson said. ""Now we\'re seeing this pancake ice form and that\'s really because there are waves now. We\'re changing the types of ice that forms - when it does finally form - in the late fall in the Arctic."" Also see | 2010s was Earth\'s hottest recorded decade by far Video from NASA shows just how far the ice retreated in 2019, especially compared to the average summer ice sheet since 1981. Yet it\'s one thing to talk about open ocean versus ice covered ocean, and the simple thickness of the ice itself - it\'s thinner. ""There\'s a lot of ice that\'s not safe to walk on anymore,"" Thomson said. The ice is only about 3-feet thick in some areas, as opposed to being 10 feet thick or more. ""And that\'s the point that the public often misses,"" Thomson said, adding that when we look at satellite maps of the ice, we don\'t see how thin it\'s becoming. ""And the loss of ice mass is critical to maintaining the thermodynamics of the oceans,"" Thompson said.
