(WMBF) - Conway police are offering $5,000 rewards for anyone who can come forward with information on two unsolved deadly shootings in the city. The rewards are for information on either the deadly Jan. 10. shooting on Hemingway Street, the deadly Feb. 1 shooting on Rufus Street or any information that connects the two shootings. This comes as Conway Police Chief Dale Long is pushing for the public’s help with the investigations. “We cannot do this alone,” Long said at a Friday news conference he held. The day after the Feb. 1 shooting on Rufus Street that ended the life of Ja’Mir Johnson, an 18-year-old senior at Carolina Forest High School, police shared a photo of a vehicle of interest in the case. Long said the community has not given any feedback about the vehicle since releasing the image a week ago. “I mean I know beyond a shadow of a doubt someone has looked at that video and said, ‘I know whose car that is,’” the chief said. “And they haven’t called...” The chief also said someone posted a video of the deadly scene on social media that was deleted, with “no way of backtracking it.” Someone took a screenshot of that video and put a caption on it. That caption has been the source of a “retaliation” narrative, according to the chief. Yet, despite all the rumors and talk, Long said no one has come to the police to say who is responsible for taking Johnson’s life. “The only way that evil is going to thrive in this world is when good people stand by and do nothing,” Long said. “Too many good people in these neighborhoods, these communities all around town, and them to step up and be the good people we need.” One of the biggest rumors in the Rufus Street shooting is that it’s related to the Jan. 10. shooting on Hemingway Street that killed 25-year-old Ty-Ree Graham. But as of now, Long said no one from the community has come forward to confirm that, leaving police with nothing to link the two shootings. “But again, there are so many things that are being said out there that we are looking at every single one of them, but it does seem to kind of bog down some of the investigation,” Long said. Several parents have called police worried about school safety, in part because Johnson was a student. The chief said the department has increased its presence in local schools to combat this worry. Long emphasizes they currently believe Johnson and Graham were the intended victims of isolated shootings because no one else was targeted. “It appears at least in both of these cases, there was a singular victim that, whoever the subject is, that picked them. That was their victim, and then they just left and fled the scene,” Long said. After a question from a WMBF News reporter, Long confirmed he wanted to update the public on the investigations sooner, but he was hoping more information would have come forward. Police cannot say, at this time, if the shootings were gang-related. No arrests have been made in either case. Anyone with information is asked to call 843-248-1790.

The Collier County Sheriff’s Office identified Edward Daniel Murphy, a 50-year-old pilot and co-pilot Ian Frederick Hofmann, 65, as the deceased. The three survivors were crew member Sydney Ann Bosmans, 23, and passengers Aaron Baker, 35, and Audra Green, 23, both of Columbus, Ohio. The three were taken to a local hospital for injuries. Their conditions are unknown. Moments before the private jet slammed into a Florida highway, the pilot had calmly told an airport controller that the aircraft “was not going to make the runway” because it had lost both engines. The jet, with five people aboard, was bound for the airport in Naples when it tried to make an emergency landing on Interstate 75 on Friday afternoon. But witnesses say it collided with a vehicle — the wing of the plane dragging a car before slamming into a wall. An explosion followed, with flames and black smoke rising from the scene. Two people were killed, according to the Collier County Sheriff’s Office. Federal authorities have launched an investigation into the crash near Naples, just north of where the interstate heads east toward Fort Lauderdale along what is known as Alligator Alley. The plane had taken off from an airport at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, about 1 p.m. It was scheduled to land in Naples around the time of the crash, Naples Airport Authority spokesperson Robin King said, when pilot contacted the tower requesting an emergency landing. “Got that. Emergency. Clear to land. Runway. Two. Three,” the air traffic controller responded to the pilot, in audio obtained by The Associated Press. “We’re clear to land, but we’re not gonna make the runway. We’ve lost both engines,” the pilot calmly replied. The tower lost contact, and then airport workers saw the smoke from the interstate just a few miles away, King said. King said they sent fire trucks with special foam to the scene, and three of the five people on board were taken from the wreckage alive. Brianna Walker saw the wing of the plane drag the car in front of hers and slam into the wall. “It’s seconds that separated us from the car in front of us,” she said. “The wing pulverized this one car.” Walker and her friend spotted the plane moments before it hit the highway, allowing her friend to pull over before the crash. “The plane was over our heads by inches,” she said. “It took a hard right and skid across the highway.” According to the FlightAware aircraft tracker, the plane was operated by Hop-a-Jet Worldwide Charter based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Lindell went public by tweeting that that Fox, which had been one of MyPillow’s biggest advertising outlets, had canceled him. He said in his tweet that he didn’t know why but that he suspected that the network was trying to silence him. Fox denied that. Losing Fox was just the latest in a series of financial and legal setbacks for Minnesota-based MyPillow and Lindell, who continues to propagate former President Donald Trump’s lies that the 2020 election was stolen from him, in part by rigged voting machine systems. Several big-box retailers, including Walmart, have discontinued his products, and lawyers who were defending him against defamation lawsuits by voting machine companies quit. “As soon as their account is paid, we would be happy to accept their advertising,” Fox spokeswoman Irena Briganti said. “They’re 100% lying,” Lindell said an interview with The Associated Press. But he acknowledged that MyPillow owes money to Fox. He put the figure at $7.8 million, but he insisted that the sum is within his credit line with the network. He said MyPillow has long spent an average of $1 million a week to run its ads on Fox. And he said the network had long allowed him 12 weeks of credit until it recently cut that to eight weeks. “This has nothing to do with money. That’s a fact,” Lindell said. Lindell said he believes Fox wants to silence him “because I want to secure our election platforms.” And he said he suspects the network is sore because his Lindell TV/FrankSpeech online channel recently hired former Fox Business host Lou Dobbs, whose debut show on Monday night featured an interview with Trump, who made further false claims that the 2020 election was rigged. Fox last April agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems nearly $800 million to avert a trial in the voting machine company’s lawsuit that would have exposed how the network promoted lies about the 2020 election on shows by Dobbs and other hosts. Fox canceled Dobbs’ show three years ago. Lindell acknowledged in an interview in October that he owed two law firms that were defending him against lawsuits by Dominion and Smartmatic millions of dollars that he couldn’t pay, which is why they quit. He said MyPillow had been “decimated.” But Lindell insisted Friday that MyPillow is “doing great.” He said it’s still running ads on another conservative network, Newsmax, and on his own platforms. But he conceded that losing Fox will hurt the business and said he would run his ads there again if Fox would take them. “Obviously, it would be great if Fox said, ‘Hey, come back,’ ” Lindell said.
