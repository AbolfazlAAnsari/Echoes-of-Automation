This place lets you send yourself an e-mail one year into the future,… I remember asking my Guidance Counselor in High School if there was a job where I could get paid to talk and play music. He just laughed and said, “not that I know of”! Little did he know that there would be a future in Radio for me. I’ve been blessed for almost 20 years to be in this business. And I’m not really sure you can call it a job when you’re having so much fun! I’ve been fortunate enough to have lived in South Dakota most of my life, growing up in Salem, and now living in Mitchell. I truly believe we have the greatest people in the world here. You’ll find me enjoying concerts at the Corn Palace, watching a funny flick at the movie theatre, playing basketball or baseball, and cheering on my favorite sports teams including (DWU, Atlanta Braves, Miami Dolphins, Miami Hurricanes, and L.A. Lakers). I love all kinds of music, but some of my favorites include Elvis Presley, The Beach Boys, Neil Diamond, Huey Lewis & The News, and Three Dog Night. You can catch me Weekday Mornings from 6am to 11am for the Kool 98 Morning Show. Be listening for your chance to win great prizes with Morning Trivia, plus News of the Weird, and the Kool Website of the Day.
