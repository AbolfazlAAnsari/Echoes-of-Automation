Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:01 pm An official portrait of Floyd District Judge Eric D. Hall was unveiled at his retirement party by Floyd Circuit Judge Johnny Ray Harris and Kara Hall, wife of Judge Hall. Speakers at the event included Floyd County Attorney Keith Bartley. A longtime Floyd County District Judge was honored for his more than 24 years of service to the court on Friday, as a retirement party was held for 31st District Court Division 2 Judge Eric D. Hall. Hall was celebrated by his colleagues and peers for a distinguished legal career, in which he oversaw some of Floyd County’s most historic cases. Words like temperament, respect, fairness and most of all, mentor, were used to describe Judge Hall by those who spoke. Floyd County Circuit Court Judge Thomas Smith joked, “When I grow up, he (Hall), is who I want to be like.” Floyd 31st District Division 1 Judge Jimmy Marcum worked near and spoke highly of Hall. “I knew I had a man down the hallway who always had my back, and in these jobs that’s priceless.” Marcum continued, “This doesn't mean we still can’t go hunting and fishing together, I just can’t go as much as you can.” Floyd County Attorney Keith Bartley has tried dozens of cases in front of Hall. He also shared his thoughts on the judge’s career. “Judge Hall is a finer-person than you’ll ever meet in this world. You take that kind of person, and put them in a robe, he’ll be as good of a judge as you’ll ever meet,” Bartley said. An official portrait of Hall was also unveiled at the ceremony, and will now hang in the new Floyd County Courthouse. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.

Gold Star Mothers group following her son\'s death in 2012, Henderson\'s Sarah Whitledge Taylor had no idea she\'d be the organization\'s president someday. She simply wanted to do something with her grief. Officially known as American Gold Star Mothers, Inc., the group is a nonprofit made up of mothers of children who died serving in the Armed Forces. There are around 1,000 members. Taylor was elected president in June. ""There\'s nothing more devastating to a mother than losing a child,"" Taylor said. ""While our stories are different, they\'re also the same. We\'ve each made a choice to not let our grief control us, but instead to reach out to others."" Henderson news:Henderson launching ‘weather-ready’ project in wake of December storm The group makes visits to veterans in hospitals and nursing homes, as well as gathering coats and backpacks for homeless veterans. They also volunteer for special projects involving veterans within their communities and are part of initiatives like Wreaths Across America. Like Grace Darling Seibold, the founder of AGSM whose words she often quotes, Taylor said she realized after her son\'s death that ""self-contained grief is self-destructive"" and wanted to work through it by helping others. ""We find ways to serve the veterans and their communities,"" Taylor said. ""This is how we choose to work through the loss and grief we feel from losing our children."" On Memorial Day 2012, she met Cathy Mullins of Owensboro, Kentucky, whose son Brandon had also been killed in Afghanistan. The two decided to get the Kentucky state chapter of AGSM up and running. She first got involved with the national board in 2017. ""Honestly, I just thought it was an honor to carry our banner at national events,"" she said. ""I never thought I would stay on the board for long and I never thought I would be the president. These mothers are strong and courageous women, so resilient."" Taylor knows all about being resilient. Her son, Army Spc. David W. Taylor, died in Kandahar, Afghanistan in March 2012, the result of an accident on base as his unit was preparing to go on a five-day mission. He was 20. ""I never asked details because I don\'t really want to know them,"" his mother said. ""All I know is someone didn\'t properly secure or dispose of ammunition. About 90 percent of the report was redacted. But I\'m at peace with what happened, I just don\'t want to know that he suffered or was in pain."" Henderson news:Henderson, Kentucky, electric customers could see rate increase soon Taylor said a common refrain among Gold Star Mothers is remember how they lived rather than how they died. It\'s how they keep the memories of their loved ones alive. Taylor said remembering her son in that way makes the pain of his loss more bearable. ""I usually start out by saying he was a handful,"" she said with a laugh. ""All his life, David wanted to be in the military,"" she said. ""He was a little patriot. He joined the Army two days after his 18th birthday. He was a natural leader. His friends loved him and would have followed him to the ends of the earth. ""As a mom, you always think your kids are pretty cool anyway,"" she said. ""But when I heard people talking about him, I understood he had a really good heart and put others before himself. That made me so proud."" Taylor said after her son\'s death she was told that he was the first person to welcome a new soldier on base and ask what he could do to help the new arrival. Hearing the stories of other Gold Star Mothers is something Taylor is passionate about, as well as developing relationships with people who frequently become lifelong friends. She plans to make that a cornerstone of her approach to being the AGSM national president. ""I will try to make sure everyone feels loved and know that they are important to this organization,"" she said. ""And I\'ll do whatever is in my power to make sure they feel loved, respected and honored and that their child is never forgotten.""'}]"

From sunlight exposure to future nearby developments, here are some of the factors most often overlooked by home buyers. NEOSHO, Mo. — Two Neosho missionaries were among three people shot and killed by gangs in Haiti on Thursday night. Celebrate the last cool nights of late spring with the ultimate comfort food: cottage pie. Are you struggling to shed those stubborn pounds or build muscle despite your best efforts in the gym? The missing piece to achieving your fitness goals might be hiding in your bedroom: sleep. Church services on Sunday were hosted at sister Emma’s place for her son Benjamin and Crystal. It was Benjamin’s 22nd birthday as well as Mother’s Day. My daughter is home for spring break and I’m having a ball spoiling her. She’s so much fun to buy things for because she has very specific tastes and I love the rush I get when I absolutely nail it, finding just the right thing to delight her.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:10 pm COVID-19 has been affecting people since the end of 2019, causing many outbreaks across the world. In response, Eastern Kentucky University research students have been collecting echoencephalography data of people who have had COVID-19 and people who have not, to measure the reaction time on the brain. The study consists of placing an EEG cap on the participants to help create readings on the EEG reader to retrieve data. “We’ll start the process by putting an EEG cap on the participants head and then we use a funnel like object to insert gelatin into the holes on the cap in order to read the electrodes and that’s how it deciphers their brainwaves,” said senior psychology major, Shannon Ackerman. The research lab lead for this study, Ackerman, and her team, which consists of software technician and senior psychology major, Colton Grubbs and data analyst Rachel Vascassenno, a junior biology major. The team began the study during the summer of 2021. They are testing strictly EKU students during this study, with 33 COVID-19 participants during the behavioral collection and over 100 non-COVID-19 participants. Currently, they are still testing three non-COVID-19 participants and three COVID-19 participants. “This is ongoing research, and we are trying to figure out the effect of COVID-19 on the brain because it is a unique virus that is causing people to have long term complications, like the loss of smell or the inability to smell certain things. There have been reports of brain fog and confusion as well as cases of seizures, even psychosis resulting from COVID-19 infection,” said Grubbs. No one certainly knows what is going on or why it is affecting people the way it is, but EKU research students are going to continue this research until there are explanations as to why and how COVID-19 is affecting young adults. “The reason this research is ongoing is because COVID-19 is looked at as just an acute respiratory infection, however that is not what this just is, because it affects potentially the entire central Nervous System. What we are hoping for, that the data presents, is that future COVID-19 patients will be turned to Neurologists and Neuropsychologists for further testing and support,” said Ackerman. There are definite struggles from COVID-19. People have lost their lives not only to the virus itself, but because people could not stand the confusion and brain fog after contracting the virus. “There seems to be a very slight trend in those who had a prior COVID-19 infection as they had an increase in reaction time, meaning they took longer to do the same test than those who were non COVID-19 patients. Thankfully, it is very marginal, so while it is trending in that direction, we are hoping for it to be by chance. We are going to try and figure it out and continue our studies, especially by analyzing EEG data so we can know for sure,” said Grubbs. EEG data analyst Rachel Vascassenno was able to research the correlations between the different vaccinations. “There was a very strange correlation as vaccination status participants had a longer reaction time but at the same time they didn’t when it came to data readings and that could be because of computer errors or maybe slow Decipher Analytics,” said Vascassenno. With the research being conducted, Ackerman and her team are also displaying their research at the Southeastern Psychological Association which will be hosted in South Carolina. Vascassenno will be presenting her research over the behavioral data relating to the vaccination status for people who have had COVID-19. Ackerman will also be traveling to Alabama to participate in the Southern Regionals Honors Conference to highlight her research over COVID-19 and the effects it has on the brain. “After our presentations are over, we will continue to take in subjects to provide more data for the study. Students can contact me at my email, Shannon_ackerman4@mymail.eku.edu to get involved as a participant as well as referring to SONA, which is an online platform where EKU Psychology students can post their studies and anyone can view them,” said Ackerman.

Yum! Center on Saturday, Oct. 29, Louisville Magazine editor Josh Moss talked over Zoom with the band’s founder and frontman, Jim James. Published Thursday, Oct. 27, and edited for length and clarity. The Louisville Leopard Percussionists are opening for you guys, and my daughter, who’s in third grade, is in the group. These kids are all second- through sixth-graders. I was talking to her about practicing for the show and wondered: Who were you at that young of an age? “I was just trying to survive, just trying to understand this crazy world. That’s one reason why we wanted to have the Leopards and why we support creativity for kids and organizations like that. When kids can get guidance like that when they’re that young, it just means the world. You see it shaping the kids’ consciousness and their life. “I just wish we’d had stuff like that when I was young. Music really came to me more in like sixth grade, so I was a little bit older when I started getting into music. If there would’ve been programs around back then, who knows? Maybe I would’ve gotten into music even earlier.” Who were some of those people who provided that guidance for you? “Really for me, the Muppet Show was like the first kind of vehicle into understanding what music was — watching the Electric Mayhem band on the Muppet Show and watching Kermit sing. Real early on as a kid, I remember thinking: What is that? I want to do that. And my mom would explain, ‘They’re a band. That guy’s playing the drums, that guy’s playing the guitar.’ And so I got a little toy guitar. I loved Kermit and wanted to sing like Kermit as a kid. Then, as I got a little older, I just never felt like I fit in anywhere in the world except when it came to music. That was like the only thing that I understood, really. So it became my salvation.” What was your childhood home like? What music was playing in the house? “We just lived in a really lower-middle-class home, just a typical small home in Hikes Point. And my parents, I wouldn’t say they weren’t music fans, but they weren’t really deep music heads or anything. I would just kind of hear what was on the radio, and luckily back then the radio was so good. I know they listened to a lot of oldies stations, so there was a lot of variety. I remember hearing Marvin Gaye ‘What’s Going On’ as a kid or Stevie Wonder or Simon & Garfunkel. And even stuff like Bread and Neil Young.” You wrote this essay for the magazine in 2012, and we ran it unedited, and it’s just a lot of your memories about growing up in Louisville. And one of the things you wrote, you said, “To any parents or grandparents who let your kids’ bands practice at your house, you’ve earned a place of positive entry into the afterlife of your choice.” [Laughs.] “Yeah, that is for sure.” It made me wonder: How has your relationship with your parents changed as you’ve gotten older and become an adult yourself? “They try to come see me play whenever we play, and they take trips to see us play. I was so blessed with such great parents, and I feel like they did such a great job of really being supportive but also drawing a lot of lines when I was growing up. They drew a lot of lines in the sand, which, at the time, I thought was tough. But now as I look back, I’m really grateful. When you want to be a musician or an artist, that’s like the scariest thing to your parents, you know? They think you should be in college or have a back-up plan. And my dad made this really cool rule for me. He said, ‘If you’re in school, I’ll try to help you however I can. But if you’re not in school anymore, you’re on your own, and I can’t help you anymore.’ “As I look back, I’m so grateful for that, ’cause I dropped out like as a sophomore in college (at UK). I went to just a little bit of college. I really wanted to pursue music, and I had to work at Subway all the time or at Heine Bros.’ and a million different jobs to try and make music happen. And so my parents were always really supportive, but they never just gave me their support. I had to work. If they helped me get a guitar, I had to mow the lawn to pay it off. There was always something that made it real. Every single thing had such meaning and weight to it.” On your song “Circuital,” you sing: “I am older / day by day. / Still going back / to my childhood ways.” What sends you back? “I think we’re all — a lot of us are — trapped in childhood. I think a lot of things happen to us in childhood that we don’t ever grow out of — some good, some bad. As I’ve done more and more therapy — family constellation therapy, internal work, EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, particularly with traumatic memories) — you really realize that, as a kid, you created all of these ways to protect yourself that maybe you don’t need anymore. You really have to get in there and do the work to find out, like: How am I still running an outdated program that I ran when I was five because I was scared?

replacing the mural on the fiscal courthouse facing College Street until legal and insurance details have been resolved. Robert Moore Herald Staff rmoore@harrodsburgherald.com The Mercer County Fiscal Court held off on approving a new mural at the fiscal courthouse until questions about the legality of replacing the old mural and insurance for the artist are answered. Earlier this month, the Harrodsburg-Mercer County Tourist Commission approved paying up to $20,000 over two years to paint a new mural on the back of the courthouse, which faces College Street. Like the current mural—which was painted in 2012 by Harrodsburg graphic designer Paul Mulder—the new mural would depict James Harrod and the Osage orange tree. It would also depict Old Fort Harrod State Park and Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill and downtown Harrodsburg as well as a pioneer family, according to Toni Preston of the 250th Anniversary Committee. On Tuesday, Preston presented board member with an initial design by artist Damon Farmer of Shadetree Studio in Versailles. “We’re looking to make that corner really pretty,” Preston told the fiscal court. She asked the county to pressure wash and paint over the current mural and provide scaffolding. Once the design is approved, Farmer could start painting the mural in the spring. The sealer which will be used on the mural has a 25 year guarantee lifespan. County Attorney Ted Dean said they need to make sure there is no existing contract on the current mural. Dean said Farmer has to have liability insurance that would cover the property as well as the artist and his staff. “We’ve just got to make sure that we’re covered,” Dean said. “We’ll get a pretty mural out of it, we just don’t want a pretty mess.” Dean apologized to Preston, but said he was just doing his job as county attorney. “I come up with all kinds of roadblocks,” Dan said. Any decisions on the mural were tabled until the questions over the legalities and insurance are answered. Figures we are still staring backwards, never forward. Nothing ever changes here.. move on folks… move on..'}]"

MURRAY – The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new COVID-19 masking guidance Friday, shifting away from using cases counts as a barometer for community transmission. The new guidance is focused on reducing strain on local healthcare systems, not reducing transmission of the virus. CDC has developed new metrics and incorporated them into, what it calls, Community Levels. Jamie Hughes, public health director for the Calloway County Health Department, explained, “They are looking at hospitalizations, the current impact on the healthcare system as a whole and put that in with the case rates to calculate the Community Level.” The new guidance explicitly states that people are always free to wear a mask if they so choose and that those who have symptoms, have tested positive or have been exposed should wear a mask. At all levels, CDC recommends staying up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccinations and getting tested if you have symptoms. At the “medium” level, CDC recommends those at high risk for severe illness should talk to a healthcare provider about mask-wearing as well as taking other precautions to reduce their risk. In counties designated at the “high” level, everyone should wear a mask in indoor public places; in addition, CDC states that those at high risk for severe illness may want to take additional precautions at this level. The announcement prompted many organizations to announce dropping masking requirements. As of Monday, Murray Independent School District no longer requires masks on buses. Murray State University is no longer requiring masks in any campus buildings. Starting Tuesday, masks are also no longer required in state government office buildings. It should be noted that the new guidelines do not apply to healthcare organizations where masks are still required. Their masking guidelines are still dictated by the old community transmission rates. Jeff Eye, vice president of patient care services at Murray-Calloway County Hospital, said, “Part of the calculus was looking at the higher transmission rate and less severe disease and the fact that there is substantial amount of immunity either through natural immunity or vaccinated immunity and that changes their recommendations, which is appropriate.” Hughes noted that case numbers got so high with the Omicron surge that the local baseline for case counts has shifted. “When the cases started to go down, we were still at Delta-levels for cases, and we were excited about getting down that far. We saw this huge high peak and then it went down and even though it was still at a high level we were so excited. Our county was still red,” he said. “They’re doing their calculations based on Omicron. If we’re cranking out 250 cases a week, that’s still only 12 to 14 in the hospital; and we managed that fairly well. It’s not comfortable, but it’s not crisis-mode. That was when we had three weeks over 650,” Eye said. “That’s the problem, anytime the hospital census of COVID patients is pushing 20 or more, then things get tense; but their stated goal was to keep the hospitals from being overtaxed.” While the guidelines consider the number of hospitalized COVID patients, they do not consider overall hospital capacity among the indicators. To that end, Eye noted, “We talked (at last week’s board meeting) that we were down to (11) hospitalized patients, but our census was 92. The hospital was very full. There is no taking into consideration other things causing your hospital to be at capacity.” “It’s a fair point to say that if the hospital is very full, it takes very limited COVID admissions to push that over the edge because any increase in patient volume when a hospital is full is difficult,” Eye said. In his press briefing Monday, Gov. Andy Beshear said that overall hospital capacity is “something we are going to watch.” He noted that the new guidance shows that CDC is assessing the prevalence of COVID in a county based on the number of people hospitalized for the disease. “We are in constant contact with our hospitals, and if we need to make changes based on a lack of space, then we will absolutely do so,” Beshear reassured. “(These are) certainly not the only (metrics) that we are looking at.” There will no longer be daily updates with the new system. Instead, the CDC will update its County Levels map weekly. Eye said that is his only criticism of the change. “If it starts to ramp up quickly, is it going to be sensitive enough to put people back on precautions fast enough before you’ve already got significant community transmission? Eye asked. However, he noted, “If we saw the situation changing where we would project that we would be in a higher level by the next publicly reported time, we would put out a statement.” Hughes said that the Kentucky Department of Public Health has not provided him information regarding how local health departments should be monitoring the new metrics. Both Hughes and Eye agreed that there will likely be some kind of collaboration between CCHD and MCCH, but the specifics still need to be worked out. “As of (Thursday), they were showing Calloway, actually, in the medium section of community level while the majority of the state of Kentucky on (Thursday) was in the high end of community level, which is where they’re encouraging masking,” Hughes said. “The medium is where we’re probably going to spend a lot of our time. Hopefully, we’ll get to low.” “When, at the hospital, we were in the height of the Omicron with 37 patients and very few resources available, I would still go the grocery store and there would be no one wearing a mask; and that’s when it was required by the CDC for everybody to have one anytime they were in public,” Eye said. “If this results in people being able to move to use these as on-and-off ramps into wearing a mask/not wearing a mask based on the (County Level), then it will be a great change. As opposed to the guidance where everybody was supposed wear them but a large percentage of the population did not wear them.” “It’s the best tool and guidance that we have at the moment,” Beshear said. “We always hope that having more specific and more targeted guidance will help with compliance we just need a commitment by our local leaders, but also by all of our individual families that I know are relieved to have new guidance at the same time, while we learn to live with COVID.

After some conflicting online back-and-forth between Parkette Drive-In’s management and property owners, multiple media outlets confirmed in late June that Parkette had served its last meals. The drive-in restaurant operated on New Circle Road for more than seven decades. Oscar Diggs opened in 2018 on North Limestone. In late June, owners announced that the fast-casual burger joint would permanently close. “This has been an extremely difficult decision for us. Oscar Diggs has continued to be successful through it all — pandemic, staffing and the many issues — all beyond our control,” the post said. World of Beer, located in The Summit at Fritz Farm, has also closed. According to the bar and grill’s Facebook post in early July, “After five happy and memorable years, we’re sad to tell you that we will be closing permanently as of today. We will miss this beautiful community and all the wonderful people we’ve come to know here.” Officials with East Main Street speakeasy Pour Decisions announced its closure in early July but hinted it may not be the final chapter, as an alternate location is being sought. The Rickhouse Pub was listed as for sale in July, according to its Facebook page. Marbled Pig BBQ in Georgetown also announced in July it would be closing, citing personal family reasons. Not all news is gloom and doom in the food scene, however, as some newcomers opened. La Folie opened on the ground floor of The Woodlands on Main Street. Menu highlights include lobster bisque, filet mignon with foie gras, and beef bourguignon. The French eatery also offers a variety of salads, appetizers and desserts. Zaki Mediterranean Restaurant has opened in the former Georgetown Cafe location at 891 Georgetown St., serving shawarma, kebab, gyros, soups, salads and appetizers. Versailles City Council’s Laura Dake announced in early July that the city of Versailles has purchased the former Kroger building at 525 Marsailles Road. A family entertainment complex, developed through a public-private partnership, will be located there and will include an indoor playground, trampoline area, skating, miniature golf, a family restaurant and bar, and other activities. On the heels of its third anniversary in Lexington’s Distillery District, Wise Bird Cider Co. has launched a food truck called Little Fork. The food truck, located on the cider company’s patio, will partner with Black Soil KY to source meat and produce. Chefs Nick Zaluski and Micah Arvin will serve farm-to-table dishes, including sharables like a hummus plate, seasonal sides, and large plates like a market harvest salad and patty melt. Another newly launched food truck, Griffin’s Kitchen, is affiliated with the Griffin Gate Marriott Golf Resort and Spa. Menu items include tacos, BBQ, grilled cheese sandwiches and more. The Brown Barrel in Midway has relocated to the nearby former Darlin’ Jeans location, at 204 N. Gratz St. Owners cited more patio space, a larger bar area and more options for hosting private events as reasons for the move. Oasis Mediterranean Restaurant, a staple in Chevy Chase for more than 20 years, has been sold to a new owner. Java Jukebox Café and Eatery has opened at 640 W. Maxwell St. Owner and musician Lane Allen says he wanted to open the café “to give people quality coffee and diner-quality food, while being able to enjoy their favorite songs in a laid back, retro music-oriented environment.” Menu items include hot ham and cheese with Swiss, cinnamon raisin PB&J, tomato basil pesto grilled cheese, chai and iced lattes, and breakfast favorites like eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy. The operators of El Cid announced the opening of a new eatery at Triangle Park called Señor Chimi. Juice and smoothie bar B’Juiced announced it has moved out of Greyline Station and would be reopening at a new location in August. Also vacating Greyline Station is Wilson’s Grocery. A social media post invited patrons to visit its Cramer Avenue location. Rick’s White Light Diner owner and chef, Rick Paul Rick’s White Light Diner on Bridge Street in Frankfort, a local dining staple since 1943, is for sale but remains open. Owner and chef Rick Paul bought the diner at auction in 1991. Dave’s Blazin BBQ has opened at 751 Sloan Drive in Georgetown, with a menu that includes sandwiches, ribs, platters, BBQ tacos, nachos and more. The Creatures’ Cauldron Café, a coffee shop and sister location to Creatures of Whim, both on North Broadway in downtown Lexington, opened in early July.

million prize from the Kentucky Lottery. Rickie bought the winning Powerball ticket at the Benton Walmart. BENTON – While a Kentucky Lottery player didn’t claim the world’s largest lottery jackpot, a lucky player from Marshall County is still cashing in the largest prize won from Saturday night’s drawing. Rickie and Karen Melton have a Symsonia address but live just over the Graves-Marshall county line on the Marshall side. Rickie’s winning ticket matched the five white ball numbers but not the Powerball number to win the game’s second prize of $1 million. He added the Power Play option to the ticket, an additional dollar per play, doubling the prize to $2 million. Rickie and Karen made the trip to lottery headquarters Wednesday morning to claim a $2 million Powerball ticket from the Nov. 5 drawing. “It’s been nerve-wracking knowing we’ve won and having to hold on to the ticket until Wednesday,” Rickie said. Rickie told officials he was sitting in his driveway getting ready to leave for breakfast on Sunday morning when he reached in the console of his truck and pulled out his Powerball tickets to check from Saturday night’s drawing. “I pulled up the winning numbers on my phone and started looking at my tickets,” Rickie said. “It was the last ticket I checked; I got really nervous about matching the fourth number. On the fifth number, I was so nervous I couldn’t leave the driveway and had to go back into the house.” Rickie was trying to hold his excitement while Karen slept after working a late shift as a nurse. “I kept pacing the floor until I just had to go wake her up,” he said. Karen wasn’t too happy with him at first, but it didn’t take her long to wake up after she heard the big news. Rickie purchased the $3 winning ticket from the vending machine at the Walmart on West Fifth Street in Benton. He chose to let the machine pick his numbers (Quick Pick). After taxes, the western Kentucky couple walked away with a check for $1,420,000. They told officials they already have an appointment with a financial planner and will invest some of their winnings. They also plan to take an Alaskan cruise and buy a new car. During this 96-day jackpot run, the Kentucky Lottery made four millionaires and awarded several other large prizes. In addition to Melton’s $2 million win, a ticket sold in Midway for Saturday night’s drawing also matched all five white ball numbers, but not the Powerball, to win $1 million. This ticket has not yet been claimed. With the Oct. 17 drawing, a Bowling Green couple won $2 million since they added the $1 Power Play feature. Earlier in the jackpot run, a winner from Crittenden won $1 million on the August 31 drawing. Also, during the latest jackpot run, Kentucky awarded 16 winners of Powerball’s third prize of $50,000, including four winners from Monday’s delayed drawing. A $100,000 winner added the Power Play option for an additional dollar per play to their ticket, to multiply their prize. The Power Play number drawn was 2. Success!

Clarion Publisher/Editor Donn Wimmer said the situation is frustrating not only to subscribers, but also to Clarion management. “We understand subscribers need their paper as soon as possible, and we desire them to have it when they expect it,” Wimmer said. “There are several factors contributing to the issues, and we speak almost daily with those involved to try and solve the problems.” Wimmer explained that for years the Clarion has been printed at a plant in Shepherdsville. There the paper is labeled, bundled and divided into postal tubs. The papers are then delivered to Tell City, where they are picked up by a driver and delivered to the required post offices for mail delivery. This is where the matter gets a bit muddled through a variety of circumstances. The company which had owned the printing plant sold to a much larger company in the summer. The new owners closed a nearby plant in Elizabethtown following acquisition, moving the work from Elizabethtown to the Shepherdsville plant. This is has substantially increased the workload on plant staff. As well, changes over the past two decades or so in the Postal Service has included the closure of several postal sorting centers, changing requirements for bulk mailing of items such as newspapers. “Our subscribers in Pellville and Reynolds Station might expect their paper would be mailed from the Hawesville Post Office, but that is not what is happening,” Wimmer said. “For subscribers in those communities, the papers are actually dropped in Owensboro by our driver and then the Postal Service sends them to Fordsville for delivery on those rural routes. Any delay along the way could affect timely delivery.” The four Post Offices papers are mailed from are Hawesville, Owensboro, Lewisport and Tell City, depending upon where the subscribers of the Clarion live. “Another example would be a subscriber in Cloverport,” Wimmer said. “Those papers are taken to Owensboro, then delivered to Hardinsburg for route and PO Box delivery. Everything has to happen just right, and even then, there might be an issue with a full address not being printed on the label at the plant. Those papers are typically returned to our office, and then we label them and get them back into the mail system.” Kentucky Press Association Executive Director David Thompson said issues with postal delivery is not limited to newspapers, with Postmaster General Louis DeJoy indicating mail delivery was likely to slow down. “There is absolutely no reason it would take the post office more than a couple of days to deliver a newspaper locally,” Thompson said. “But delivery issues of a week or more is totally unacceptable and perhaps goes back to (DeJoy) stating a slowdown in mail was forthcoming. Unfortunately, subscribers believe the issue originates at the newspaper and they complain at length about late delivery or much delayed delivery and threaten to cancel the subscription.” Thompson said there is little newspapers can do to solve the ongoing issues. “Local residents need to direct their anger to the local post offices to see why they cannot get the paper delivered in a timely manner,” he said. “USPS continues raising rates for periodicals class mailings yet service suffers even with the additional income.” Postal issues for newspaper delivery are not new in the industry, and the topic is one of constant discussion not only in Kentucky but nationally. The National Newspaper Association maintains the Max Heath Postal Institute, a clearinghouse which offers training programs to newspapers on the ever-changing postal environment. Heath – considered industry-wide to be the foremost newspaper expert on the Postal Service – was an employee of the former owners of the Shepherdsville printing plant. He had served as executive editor for Landmark Community Newspapers and was chairman of the NNA Postal Committee for 30 years. “As the Postal Service is pushing massive changes out to mail users, we face a daunting frontier without our leader,” NNA Foundation President Matt Adelman said following Heath’s death in July 2021. “He understood that the best newspaper imaginable has little value unless people are able to receive it. Max spent decades training us, fighting for us and leaping into the fray of postal policy.” Clarion customers facing delivery issues should contact the office at 270-927-6945 or hancockclarion@gmail.com with any concerns.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:01 pm Floyd County Attorney Keith Bartley speaking during the Dec. 21 Floyd County Fiscal Court meeting. Bartley raised questions about the decision by the fiscal court to establish, along with Prestonsburg, a county 911 dispatch center. The Floyd County Fiscal Court recently voted in favor of establishing a new 911 dispatch center to be located in Prestonsburg at its Dec. 21 meeting, though facing fierce opposition from one county official. At present, all emergency calls coming out of Floyd County are dispatched through the Kentucky State Police Post 9 in Pikeville. The City of Prestonsburg’s Fire and EMS system, under the plan, will become the county’s 911 service. Just before the court was set to vote, Floyd County Attorney Keith Bartley took to the podium and addressed those in attendance. Bartley argued that Post 9 currently handles approximately 90 percent, or thousands of Floyd County calls every year, and that the county’s priority would decrease with the new 911 center. “The proposed change will, without a doubt, change the priority, because it is legally required to change the priority of the response to 911 calls,” Bartley said. According to Bartley, KSP base their troopers in the areas with more criminal activity. Bartley also said there are 13 KSP troopers along with a supervisor assigned to Floyd County alone. “So, make no doubt about it, no question, there will be a reduction in the number of KSP officers assigned to Floyd County, which will endanger lives. It will slow response times, and anybody that says any different, is just wrong,” said Bartley. However, Floyd County Judge-Executive Robbie Williams said an advisory committee was formed with members of several local firstresponder groups. “This isn’t Robbie Williams’ recommendation; this is the recommendation of the advisory committee,” Williams said. “We’ve got the fire departments on board, ambulance services, we’ve got the rescue squads, EMS and 911. Everybody is on board. The governor has assured us there will not be one trooper pulled out of Floyd County.” Williams noted the lack of communication between Post 9 and the county as another issue discussed by the committee. “They send us an invoice and an agreement to sign for two years in the mail.” Williams continued, “In the middle of this flood, we asked them (Post 9) for an extension of time to deal with this, and they would not grant us an extension of time and doubled the fee.” Floyd County Judge-Executive Robbie Williams responds Dec. 21 to criticisms from Floyd County Attorney Keith Bartley regarding the decision to pursue, along with the City of Prestonsburg, establishing a single county 911 dispatch center. However, according to Williams, after discussions with KSP Commissioner Philip Burnett Jr. and Gov. Andy Beshear’s office, only the location will change. Bartley also took issue with the many revisions of the contract, stating he had seen several versions over the past few days, and had yet to see the revised contract. “They’re going to ask you to sign a contract you’ve never seen,” Bartley said. “As your lawyer, I would be the worst lawyer on planet earth if I advised you to sign it. As your friend, I would tell you don’t do it, because it’s a huge mistake for your people. As your constituent, I would tell you, don’t endanger our lives, because if you do, it’s going to come back and bite you.” Williams rebutted, “We’ve worked this out, nothing will change, just the location.

Prestonsburg Police Deputy Chief Ross Shurtleff worked alongside Gina Porter for months on the contract, with many versions passed back and forth before reaching a final agreement, officials said. The contract was approved with Dist. 2 Magistrate Mark Crider, Dist. 1 Magistrate George Ousley and Williams voting in favor.

School system officials are blaming a lack of communication, but many parents and middle school students are upset over a dress code “pilot” for leggings that did not go well last Friday. Dress codes are established by each school’s site-based council, so dress codes vary from school to school. Some schools, for example, do not allow jeans with holes, while others allow such jeans. It is unknown how many Scott County schools do not allow leggings, which are described by Wikipedia as “elastic close-fitting high-rise garments worn over the legs typically by women.” Earlier this school year, eighth grade student Madison Easterling approached SCMS’ site-based council requesting leggings be permitted. A compromise was reached calling for a “pilot” for leggings provided the girls wore a garment over the leggings that met all other dress code requirements on Fridays during February. The length of the garment must reach the fingertips, according to the dress code. A statement from Scott County Schools stated “improved communication,” was needed. “The Site-Based Decision Making Council at Scott County Middle School governs the school dress code,” said Renee Holmes in a statement distributed to several media. “The SBDM at Scott County Middle School decided to permit students to wear leggings each Friday in February as a pilot as long as other dress code guidelines were followed.
