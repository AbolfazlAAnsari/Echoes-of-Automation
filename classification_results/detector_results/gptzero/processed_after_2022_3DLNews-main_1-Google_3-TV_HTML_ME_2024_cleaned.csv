The wife of the man who died, who wanted to remain anonymous, says a candle fell into a garbage can and started the fire. The couple managed to escape the house but noticed that their dog wasn’t with them. The man rushed back inside to rescue the dog. When the woman found the dog under a car outside, she entered the house to get her husband out, saying she army-crawled about 15 feet to let him know the dog was safe. However, he stayed inside to try to find his father’s ashes. “He’d lost everything so many times before. He kept saying he couldn’t lose everything again,” the woman said. “He just needed to find his dad’s ashes. He just wanted to find his dad. He told me to make sure that me and her are safe and to get out, that he would be out. He told me he loved me, and I told him I loved him.” That was the last conversation she had with her husband. He couldn’t get out of the burning home and died in the fire. “He was my soulmate,” she said. Firefighters have not reported an official cause of the fire. Indiana Fire Marshals are investigating.

""And he has responded with a grace and warm heart that anyone who knows President Biden would expect."" Austin\'s unannounced hospitalization, which was not disclosed to the media or Biden and other senior administration officials for days, raised major questions about transparency and communications within the Biden administration.

Austin last took questions from the media more than one month ago on Dec. 20 when he visited the USS Gerald R. Ford, an aircraft carrier operating in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Two days later after returning to the United States, Austin underwent surgery to treat prostate cancer, a procedure which required general anesthesia and an overnight stay. His surgery and hospital stay, as well as his diagnosis with prostate cancer in early-December, was not revealed to the president and to senior administration officials until after the New Year when he was hospitalized a second time for complications from the surgery. Video above: Lloyd Austin says he\'s \'still recovering\' Austin remained in the hospital for two weeks, leaving on Jan. 15. He then worked from home until this past Monday, when he returned to the Pentagon for a bilateral meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. At the time, Austin said, ""I feel good and recovering well, but still recovering."" Biden acknowledged earlier this month that Austin’s failure to notify him about his hospitalization was a lapse in judgment. Austin’s chief of staff, Kelly Magsamen, directed a 30-day review of the Pentagon’s processes and procedures for notifying senior national security leaders and the White House when the Defense secretary needs to transfer authorities to the deputy secretary, which was required during Austin’s hospitalization. The Defense Department Inspector General launched a separate investigation of whether the Pentagon had the appropriate policies in places to ensure an effective transfer or power and duties.
