Glenn Youngkin delivers his State of the Commonwealth address before a joing session of the Virginia General Assembly, Wednesday, Jan. 10, 2024, at the Capitol in Richmond, Va. (AP Photo/Steve Helber), File) RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Dozens of pieces of gun-related legislation that advocates say will bolster public safety are winding their way through Virginia’s Democratic-controlled General Assembly, including a measure that would halt the sale of certain semi-automatic firearms. The question hanging over all the bills is: Just how many will Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin veto? Youngkin, who generally toed the GOP party line on firearms rhetoric in his campaign but notably did not receive the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, is a former private equity executive whose first two years in public office were spent with a GOP majority in the state House of Delegates that largely prevented Democratic gun bills from reaching his desk. After that chamber flipped in November’s elections, the governor signaled to lawmakers in a speech on the session’s opening day that he wanted to see bills that would tighten the penalties on criminals who use guns rather than legislation further restricting the purchase and use of firearms. Still, he’s been assiduously quiet about where he might wield his veto pen, as he navigates a divided government dynamic and negotiations with the new Democratic legislative majority over a proposed sports arena deal in northern Virginia. Youngkin’s press office did not directly respond to questions about his position on a range of bills but said he would review any legislation that comes to his desk. The administration’s silence has left advocates on both sides of the issue uncertain of the final outcome. “He basically telegraphed a message of, ‘If you’re going to send me more gun control, I’m not going to be happy with it.’ But that’s all we know,” said Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, a grassroots gun-rights group. Among the dozens of gun bills sponsored this year by Democratic lawmakers — who do not have the numbers to override a Youngkin veto — is legislation that would prohibit the importation, sale, manufacture, purchase or transfer of an “assault firearm” made on or after July 1 of this year. Possession of such a weapon would be banned for those under 21, and the measure would also prohibit the sale of certain ammunition-feeding devices that can hold over 10 rounds. Republicans and other opponents have questioned the constitutionality of the measure that would impact the sale of new models of the popular AR-15. Proponents have argued it would limit the number of “weapons of war” available for sale in the future, along with high-capacity magazines that have been used in mass shootings. On Wednesday, the Senate passed the legislation on a party-line vote after a lengthy debate in which one GOP legislator warned it would ultimately be vetoed. A House version cleared that chamber last week, also along party lines. Other gun-control proposals making their way through the General Assembly with Democratic support include measures that would ban assault weapons in public areas, ban plastic guns able to be missed by metal detectors, and prohibit the concealed carry of a gun by most people onto the premises of a restaurant or club that sells alcohol. Additional bills would create a civil penalty for people who leave guns unattended and visible in a motor vehicle, and require people purchasing a gun to complete a firearms safety course or otherwise “demonstrate competence” with a firearm. “We’re hopeful that if the governor wants to keep Virginia safe that he’ll sign these bills into law,” said Mike Fox, a volunteer who helps lead the Virginia chapter of Moms Demand Action. Meanwhile, a small handful of bills are moving toward Youngkin’s desk with broad bipartisan support. One would expand the types of firearm safety devices eligible for a previously enacted tax credit. Another would ban auto sears, which convert semi-automatic handguns into automatic weapons. Older ones permissible under federal law would be allowed, according to Van Cleave. A third measure aims to provide a legal mechanism for parents to be charged with a felony under the state’s child abuse and neglect law if they allow a child who is known to be a danger to have access to a firearm, said the measure’s sponsor, Democratic Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg. VanValkenburg said he worked on the bill with the family of Lucia Bremer, a 13-year-old suburban Richmond girl who was shot nine times after she and a friend walked home from school in 2021. A teenager, who was 14 at the time but was tried as an adult, pleaded guilty last year to first-degree murder and other charges in Bremer’s killing. But the teen’s legal guardian, who was charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, a misdemeanor, on the basis of the boy having access to the gun, was found not guilty. “Lucia died on the floor of a garage while I stroked her hair and I tried to will her back to life. Lucia is dead in part because an adult gun owner made a choice to leave his firearm easily accessible to his teenager,” Bremer’s mother, Meredith Bremer, told a Senate committee. The bill cleared a Senate committee on a bipartisan 13-0 vote with two Republican abstentions. When Van Cleave stood to speak against the bill, he faced sharp questioning from Sen. Mark Peake, a Republican of Lynchburg, who asked that gun-rights groups meet with VanValkenburg to find compromise. The Democratic legislative majorities have also rejected a range of GOP-sponsored gun bills, including a measure that would have increased the mandatory minimum sentence for the use or display of a firearm during the commission of certain felonies. ___________________ Tune in live for more on the stories that matter to you: WMAL.com | WMAL app | “Alexa, play W-M-A-L” Copyright 2023 by WMAL.com.

‘Anti-Satellite Capability,’ White House Confirms Print The new national security threat that sent some in Washington into a tizzy and sparked calls urging Americans not to panic, is a new Russian anti-satellite capability, the White House confirmed Thursday, again emphasizing there is no immediate threat to life or limb. White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby declined to go into details about the emerging Russian capability but said that U.S. intelligence agencies have been tracking Russia’s pursuit of such systems for a while, and that Washington has been reaching out to allies on next steps. ""This is not an active capability that\'s been deployed,"" Kirby told reporters. ""And though Russia\'s pursuit of this particular capability is troubling, there is no immediate threat to anyone\'s safety."" ""We are not talking about a weapon that can be used to attack human beings or cause physical destruction here on Earth,"" he added. The explanation, and the effort to reassure the public, came just more than 24 hours after a leading U.S. lawmaker took to social media, demanding U.S. President Joe Biden declassify intelligence so the American public and U.S. allies could formulate a response. Republican Representative Mike Turner, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement Wednesday warning of ""a serious national security threat."" ""I am requesting that President Biden declassify all information relating to this threat so that Congress, the Administration, and our allies can openly discuss the actions necessary to respond,"" Turner added. But both the White House and Pentagon on Thursday downplayed the need for that type of urgency, while conceding the Russian advancement is cause for concern. ""We\'re taking this potential threat very, very seriously,"" Kirby said, adding that U.S. intelligence agencies have been aware of Moscow’s pursuit of what he described as a ""space-based"" anti-satellite capability for ""many, many months, if not a few years."" ""But only in recent weeks now has the intelligence community been able to assess with a higher sense of confidence exactly how Russia continues to pursue it,"" he said. U.S. defense officials, likewise, emphasized the emerging Russian capability does not come as a surprise. ""We are tracking what this is,"" said Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ""is part of the national security team that\'s been briefing the president,"" Ryder told reporters, adding that there is still a gap between Russia’s ambitions in space and what it is currently capable of doing. ""It\'s not an immediate threat. It\'s not an active capability. It has not been deployed,"" he said. For its part, Russia on Thursday dismissed the U.S. allegations about an anti-satellite capability as a ""malicious fabrication."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov accused Washington of engaging in a ruse to get U.S. lawmakers to spend more funds. ""It is obvious that the White House is trying, by hook or by crook, to encourage Congress to vote on a bill to allocate money, this is obvious,"" Peskov told reporters in Moscow. Despite some consternation among some White House officials and members of Congress about the way the public was alerted to the threat, there is general agreement in the U.S. that the danger is real. The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Jim Himes, said Wednesday the threat is ""a significant one."" And the leading Democrat and top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee noted they have been tracking developments ""rigorously,"" describing the matter as serious. Some arms control experts warn that the ramifications of a new Russian anti-satellite capability could be far-reaching. ""This would affect the global economy, the society writ large,"" said Daryl Kimball, director of the Arms Control Association. ""China would be deeply concerned. India would be extremely concerned — countries that Russia has better relationships with than they do with us,"" Kimball told VOA. ""So, I think there would be stinging rebuke. That might be enough to encourage Russia to back down."" U.S. intelligence agencies have been warning for years that Russia and China have been pursuing ""a full range of anti-satellite weapons,"" noting that the development and use of such systems ""could degrade U.S. intelligence gathering abilities."" One of the most recent declassified U.S. intelligence assessments warned that Moscow continues to ""field new anti-satellite weapons to disrupt and degrade U.S. and allied space capabilities."" Russia ""is developing, testing, and fielding an array of nondestructive and destructive counterspace weapons — including jamming and cyberspace capabilities, directed energy weapons, on-orbit capabilities, and ground-based ASAT [anti-satellite] capabilities,"" the Office of the Director of National Intelligence wrote in its 2023 Worldwide Threat Assessment report. But U.S. officials appear to acknowledge that the new Russian capability takes those ambitions a step further. The NSC’s Kirby, while briefing reporters at the White House, said the capability the Kremlin is pursuing ""would be a violation of the Outer Space Treaty to which more than 130 countries have signed up, including Russia."" That treaty, which entered into force in 1967, prohibits nations from placing into space ""any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction,"" and further bans the installation of such weapons on celestial bodies. For now, Kirby says the White House intends to keep most of the information classified, while working with allies on how to respond. He said the U.S. has also reached out to Moscow, though there have yet to be any real conversations on Russia’s attempts to achieve the new space-based anti-satellite capability. As for the U.S. lawmaker who ignited the initial clamor, he said after being briefed by top White House, Pentagon and intelligence officials late Thursday that he is satisfied, for now, with the U.S. approach. ""We all came away with a very strong impression that the administration is taking this very seriously and that the administration has a plan in place,"" Turner said. ""We look forward to supporting them as they go to implement it."" Still, top U.S. officials warned of a possible fallout from Turner’s decision to take his concerns public, saying that intelligence agency sources and methods may have been compromised. ""We\'re asking ourselves that very question right now,"" said Kirby. ""We\'re working our way through that analysis right now with the intelligence community.""
