He was the leader of the Easy Money band, and I remember looking up to him as a band leader even back then,"" Heath Wright of Ricochet said.

Ohio State University\'s airport collided with a vehicle in Collier County on Friday afternoon creating a fiery debris field and closing Interstate 75. Collier County Sheriff\'s Office confirmed at least two people are dead. They were identified Saturday as pilot Edward Daniel Murphy, 50, of Oakland Park; and co-pilot Ian Frederick Hofmann, 65, of Pompano Beach. All the occupants of the automobiles damaged in the crash survived, FHP said Saturday. Two ground vehicles were damaged in the crash: a 2015 Chevrolet Silverado and a 2023 Nissan Armada SUV. The driver of the Silverado, a 48-year-old Naples man, suffered minor injuries and was taken to a local hospital, FHP said. The driver of the Nissan, a 66-year-old woman, and her two passengers, an 85-year-old woman and a 31-year-old woman, escaped with no injuries. The occupants of the Nissan were all from Massachusetts. Naples-area resident Jinny Johnson happened upon the crash just minutes after it took place, heading north on I-75 around 3:20 p.m. ""All of a sudden I saw a lot of black smoke,"" Johnson said. ""It was pitch black. As I got closer, the smoke got a little lighter. And then I saw flames."" Flames shot into the air, eating into the plane, and there was a damaged car sitting on the median, Johnson said. As she crept north, sticking to the curb lane on the far side of the road to give herself as much space from the plane as possible, she watched everything unfold. Emergency vehicles had not yet arrived, and as traffic crept along, she watched a helicopter land near the wreckage. Ambulance, fire and police vehicles sped north up the sides of the interstate on the southbound side, she said. She thought it had hit a side wall along the highway, but couldn\'t be sure. Johnson added that she saw a first responder was sitting next to a person on the median, who appeared to have been in the car. Naples Airport dispatched firetrucks with a special foam-type substance that can help control jet fuel fires. As firefighters hosed down the plane, the smoke changed from black to gray to white. The Federal Aviation Administration said the Bombardier Challenger 600 jet crashed on southbound Interstate 75, near mile marker 107, Pine Ridge Road, at about 3:10 p.m. Friday. At least one vehicle was destroyed. The plane crashed roughly 4.7 miles from the airport. The plane was coming from Columbus, Ohio, to the Naples Airport and scheduled for departure to Fort Lauderdale, said Robin King, the director of communication with The Naples Airport Authority. It left Ohio at 12:30 p.m. King said the airport lost communication with the plane just before the crash. ""It was coming in for a landing,"" she said. ""We received word that it had possibly lost an engine, we have not confirmed that, then we lost contact."" In a tape released of the final call from the pilot, the pilot tells an airport controller they won\'t make the runway. Pilot: ""Okay, Challenger, Hop-A-Jet 823, lost both engines, emergency. I\'m making an emergency landing."" Controller: ""I\'ve got an emergency. Clear to land Runway 23."" Pilot: ""We\'re clear to land but we\'re not gonna make the runway. We\'ve lost both engines."" King did not have a time for departure to Fort Lauderdale. ""We don\'t have anybody here at the general aviation terminal waiting for them,"" she said. ""We don\'t know who they are, the nature of the business. We don\'t know why they are coming here."" Friday night, the Hop-a-Jet charter company released a statement saying it had ""received confirmed reports of an accident involving one of our leased aircraft near Naples"" and that it would dispatch a team to the crash site. ""Our immediate concern is for the well-being of our passengers, crew members, and their families,"" the statement said. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the incident. An NTSB investigator arrived at the accident site Friday afternoon and several others were expected to arrive Saturday. The NTSB said it would move the plan to ""secure facility"" for further evaluation. A spokesperson said its investigations involve the pilot, the airplane and the operating environment. Florida Highway Patrol troopers remained on the scene Saturday. By 7:40 p.m. Friday, northbound lanes of the interstate had reopened. Southbound lanes remained closed Saturday as the investigation continued. Troopers advised drivers to avoid the area and seek alternate routes. The FAA also restricted airspace in the area around the crash. Officials at OSU said the Columbus, Ohio airport is fully commercial, and the plane is not affiliated with the university. Naples Daily News and Fort Myers News-Press journalists Liz Freeman, Kendall Little, Bill Smith, Andrew West, Stacey Henson, Dan Glaun and Alex Martin and Jim Wilhelm of the Columbus Dispatch contributed to this report.'}]"

A sliding scale allows therapists to charge more affordable rates, which can be an incentive for those who struggle to commit to long-term treatment. When healthcare is more accessible, more people are likely to receive it. This can reduce the number of people who have untreated medical issues, which leads to healthier communities overall.

All bicyclists want to feel safe. Matt Penniman is a devoted cyclist and is the communications and advocacy director for the League of Michigan Bicyclists and started with the organization in 2018. As a member of the bicycling group, Penniman advocates for the importance of riding safety as fatalities and crashes increase. “Michigan saw a surge in bicycle crashes in 2020 during the pandemic,” Penniman said. “Part of that can be attributed to more people riding bikes. Part of it can be attributed to more reckless driving,” he said. “We’re advocating for a number of interventions to make our streets safer, both in state law and policy.” Another program is Bike Wave, where cities borrow equipment for protected bike lanes, he said.

There were 1,340 traffic crashes involving bicyclists in 2022 and from 2020 to 2022, 103 bicyclists were killed in Michigan, according to the State Police. For example, Mandy Benn was sentenced last December to at least 70 years in prison for causing an Ionia County crash that killed two cyclists and injured three others participating in a 2022 “Make a Wish” bike ride. A jury determined that Benn was under the influence of drugs at the time. And in Hillsdale last May, cyclist Charles Vallance was airlifted to a hospital after he was struck by a motor vehicle. According to the Hillsdale County Sheriff’s Office, Vallance was knocked off his bike after he pulled out in front of the vehicle. In Clinton Township a cyclist was killed last November in a collision with two cars on Harper Avenue. According to the Clinton Township Police Department, alcohol may have been a factor in the crash. The investigation is ongoing. According to a 2017 study conducted in Michigan by the Federal Highway Administration State Planning and Research Program, 39% of those surveyed said that someone in their household had used a bike for transportation in the past year, and another 28% said that they used a bicycle to commute at least two times a week. Long-time cyclist and former Washtenaw County Deputy Sheriff Jeff Carek expressed his concerns regarding bicyclists’ safety. “I’ve been cycling for about 50 years now, and I consider myself to be a confident rider,” said Carek, the director of education for the League of Michigan Bicyclists. “I often bike in the Metro Detroit area where I see a lot of drivers disregard bikers or don’t take them seriously,” he said. “I see drivers who are intentional about their dislike for cyclists, and this creates very dangerous conditions on the road.” The Governor’s Traffic Safety Advisory Commission issued a “State of Michigan Vulnerable Road User Safety Assessment” last year that covered tactics for vulnerable road users to follow to stay safe.

(AP Photo/Steve Ruark, file) WASHINGTON (AP) — The release of a harshly critical Justice Department special counsel report on President Joe Biden has triggered instant flashbacks to history-shaping events of 2016. That’s when FBI Director James Comey castigated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over her email practices despite recommending against charges. In this year’s already heated election season, the Justice Department cleared Democrat Biden, too, of criminal wrongdoing but painted a politically damaging picture of his handling of classified information. Both announcements were derided by Democrats for their potential to unduly shape public perception in an election year — and for the inclusion of what they saw as gratuitous swipes at their candidates. In particular, Hur’s detailed discussion of apparent memory lapses by Biden revived a long-running debate within legal circles about how much derogatory information is appropriate to place in the public realm about individuals like Biden and Clinton who are investigated but not charged. “I think what we saw was a special counsel who was trying to be as complete as possible and trying to be as transparent as possible with the public about every aspect of the investigation,” Robert Mintz, a former federal prosecutor, said of the Hur report. “But ultimately,” he added, “some of these observations were more subjective than objective, and I think it’s fair for individuals to question whether or not some of the phrasing that was put in the report was entirely necessary.” To be sure, there are significant differences between the Clinton and Biden investigations, including that the Biden probe concluded a full nine months before this year’s election while a final statement from Comey on Clinton came just nine days before voters went to the polls in 2016. As FBI director, Comey broke from the norm by delivering a detailed public statement marking the conclusion of the Clinton email investigation, even though such announcements — to the extent they’re made at all — normally would come from the Justice Department. Hur, by contrast, was fulfilling his duties under Justice Department regulations by drafting a report that was presumably meant for public consumption. Such reports, like special counsel Robert Mueller’s 2019 one about President Donald Trump and Russia, often include unflattering narratives about people who were not charged with a crime. Justice Department regulations mandate that special counsels produce their reports, confidentially, to the attorney general. But they don’t dictate what should be in those reports, said former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller and was once Hur’s boss. “The policy is about what you release to the public,” Rosenstein said in an email, adding that the authority to release the memo rested solely with Attorney General Merrick Garland. In both the Biden and Clinton cases, the language used to characterize the subjects has been as closely scrutinized — and criticized — as the decision not to prosecute. Comey, in a July 2016 announcement at FBI headquarters, pointedly referred to Clinton as “extremely careless” in her handling of classified information on a private email server she used as secretary of state — even as he detailed all the reasons she shouldn’t be prosecuted. Hur said he would not have charged Biden, even independent of a Justice Department legal opinion that says sitting presidents cannot be indicted. But one particular prong of his reasoning for not prosecuting was especially notable — the potential that the president would come across to a jury as a “sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” During an interview with Hur’s office, the report said, Biden could not immediately recall the dates of his vice presidency or what year his son Beau died. Those comments prompted fierce pushback from Biden himself, who in a White House news conference grew visibly angry as he denied not knowing when his son had died. Insisting his memory was fine, he said of Hur’s reference to Beau Biden: “How in the hell dare he raise that?” Anticipating the explosive nature of the memory claims, the president’s attorneys wrote Hur before the report was released to complain about the inclusion of what they said was “highly prejudicial’ commentary. “Such comments have no place in a Department of Justice report, particularly one that in the first paragraph announces that no criminal charges are ‘warranted’ and that ‘the evidence does not establish Mr. Biden’s guilt,'” wrote Richard Sauber, special counsel to the president, and Bob Bauer, Biden’s personal lawyer. As with Comey’s statement on Clinton, the report was delivered not only in an election year but in a bitterly polarized political climate. The FBI closed its investigation in July 2016 but reopened it less than two weeks before Election Day after potential new evidence was discovered. Comey cleared Clinton anew nine days before the election, but in a final jolt blamed by Democrats for contributing to her loss. Though this year’s election is nine months away, discussion of Biden’s memory cuts to the core of deep-seated voter concerns about his age approaching the November contest. “The prosecutor would absolutely be aware of the context in which he is publicizing these types of gratuitous and unnecessary remarks,” said former Justice Department prosecutor Christopher Mattei. “And just looking at the reaction that they’ve gotten, it’s quite clear, and totally predictable, that these types of remarks would have political ramifications, even during a primary season.” Hur’s selection as special counsel in January 2023 was clearly meant to show a nonpartisan approach by Garland. Hur had held senior leadership roles in the Trump Justice Department, both in Washington and as U.S. attorney for Maryland, and as a younger lawyer clerked for William Rehnquist, the conservative Supreme Court chief justice. Garland, meanwhile, has worked assiduously for the last three years to combat Republican claims of a politicized Justice Department by repeatedly taking steps designed to prove that he is not catering to the interests of Biden or his family. That includes the appointment of a different special counsel to investigate Biden’s son, Hunter, who is now facing federal tax and gun charges in two states. Yet once the report was released, Democrats and some former Justice Department officials appeared taken aback by the report’s findings. Some openly undermine his findings. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. Like Comey, Hur’s job was never going to be easy — especially not when a different special counsel, Jack Smith, already charged Trump with hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. It fell to Hur to illuminate in his report the differences in the fact patterns and legal analyses that led to one 2024 candidate facing charges and the other not. “I think part of the drama that’s associated with this right in the moment is the circumstances that we find ourselves in: Biden had classified documents, Trump had classified documents, Trump got charged. There was no way the special prosecutor here was going to satisfy everybody,” said Eric Gibson, a former Justice Department public corruption prosecutor. ——— Richer reported from Boston.

Trout was sentenced to 55 to 90 years in prison for the second-degree murder charge and 30 to 60 years for the first-degree child abuse charge. HARRISVILLE — Aaron Trout is looking at over half a century in prison following his sentencing for the violent abuse and murder of a young girl. Trout was found guilty of second-degree murder and first-degree child abuse of 2-year-old Jayde McDonnell, the child of Trout’s then-girlfriend Adrienne Pavelka and Gannon McDonnell. Before receiving his sentence Trout was given an opportunity to speak before Judge Laura Frawley and the court. In his speech, Trout continued to insist that he was innocent of Jayde McDonnell’s murder and, despite his conviction, he knows he is a good person. “I know that my kids love me, I know that I’m a good man,” said Trout. “I guess bad things happen to good people.” Despite his continued claims of innocence, Trout did apologize for what had happened to Jayde McDonnell and asked the judge to give him a more lenient sentence. “I really am sorry with all my heart,” said Trout tout to Judge Frawley. “I hope you find it in your heart to give me a sentence that is not so harsh.” Despite his request for leniency, Judge Frawley sentenced Trout to 55 to 90 years in prison for the second-degree murder charge and 30 to 60 years for the first-degree child abuse charge. Judge Frawely’s sentence not only exceeded the initial Cobbs recommendations of 37 to 75 years but even went beyond the prosecution’s request of 50 to 80 years. Judge Frawley explained that her ruling came from her not believing that the guidelines used to determine Trout’s original recommendation were inadequate in addressing the horror that McDonnel had at Trout’s hand. “I, like everyone else here today, have been thinking about this case,” Frawley said. “I believe the guidelines are inadequate…The facts of this case demonstrate a cold calculated depravity on the part of the defendant.” Judge Frawley would go on to express Trout’s actions against McDonnell as well as his lack of remorse in those actions demonstrate a truly unique level of evil that despite her many years of experience is beyond her comprehension. “You are pure evil,” said Judge Frawley to Trout. “You don’t have even a scintilla of human compassion in you… I’ve seen a lot of things in 38 years and this is beyond my ability to comprehend.” Trout will be serving his sentences concurrently, and has received 565 days of credit for his sentence.

Daddy Long Leg shrooms, a type of psilocybin mushroom, are known for their unique effects on the mind and body. This article will dive into what these spindly fungi can do, from altering perception to impacting mental health. Discover the mystical journey that awaits.

These effects can contribute to a unique and transformative experience for the mind. Increased perception and hallucinations Consuming Daddy Long Leg Shrooms intensifies the senses, often raising awareness of colours, sounds, and textures.

Such alterations can provide individuals with unique perspectives on their surroundings and themselves while under the influence. Enhanced creativity and introspection Shifting from altered thought patterns, exploring the effects of Daddy Long Leg Shrooms on the mind highlights enhanced creativity and introspection. Users often report a heightened sense of creative flow while under the influence, leading to artistic expression and novel problem-solving abilities.

The body may feel calm and relaxed, with lightness or heaviness in the limbs. These mushrooms can lead to tranquillity and peacefulness, often accompanied by feeling connected to nature or the surrounding environment. Furthermore, individuals may experience decreased muscle tension and overall physical stress. The relaxation these mushrooms induce is often described as gentle and soothing, contributing to a general sense of well-being and well-being. Possible side effects and precautions Daddy Long Leg shrooms may have side effects and require certain precautions when consumed. Users should be aware of the potential risks associated with consuming these mushrooms, including nausea, increased heart rate, and heightened anxiety. Starting with a low dose is essential to gauge individual tolerance levels. Additionally, mixing these mushrooms with alcohol or other substances can amplify their effects and lead to adverse reactions. Consuming hallucinogenic mushrooms in an unsuitable setting or mindset may result in overwhelming experiences that could potentially lead to psychological distress. Users should also be mindful of any underlying medical conditions or medications that may interact negatively with the effects of Daddy Long Leg shrooms. Therapeutic potential for mental health treatment Psilocybin therapy is increasingly being researched for its potential therapeutic applications in mental health treatment. Studies have shown that psilocybin, the active ingredient in Daddy Long Leg shrooms, has demonstrated promising results in treating various mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD. This compound has been found to facilitate introspective experiences and promote emotional breakthroughs, offering a new avenue for addressing these challenging conditions. Psilocybin therapy involves guided sessions where individuals consume controlled doses of psilocybin under supervision. The psychoactive effects can lead to heightened self-awareness and profound insights into one’s thoughts and emotions. Conclusion In conclusion, exploring the effects of Daddy Long Leg shrooms on the mind and body reveals intriguing insights into altered perception, enhanced creativity, and sensory changes.

It was a similar task that he was faced with at his prior stops: the San Francisco 49ers and Stanford. 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, the brother of former Wolverine quarterback Dylan McCaffrey, starred at Stanford where he set records and was the runner-up for the Heisman Trophy in 2015. And so in the lead-up to the 2024 Super Bowl in Las Vegas, curiosity has risen if Jim Harbaugh coached Christian McCaffrey in Palo Alto with the Cardinal. REQUIRED READING: Jim Harbaugh hopes to bring Michigan football magic to Los Angeles and the Chargers Here's some connections between the former Michigan football coach and the 49ers star running back: No. Jim Harbaugh was already gone for four years by the time Christian McCaffrey stepped onto the campus in Palo Alto in 2014, but both do share a tie to the Cardinal. Jim Harbaugh has two separate ties to Stanford himself. The first involves his dad, Jack Harbaugh, who served as the Cardinal defensive coordinator 1980 to 1981. Then four decades after he left Palo Alto as a kid, Jim Harbaugh returned to Stanford but this time as the Cardinal coach in 2007. During his four years at the helm at Stanford, Jim Harbaugh inherited a program that had a 1-11 record prior to his arrival and turned it into a 12-1 season finish, which ended with an Orange Bowl victory, by his final year in 2010. He coached a handful of players who went on to have NFL careers like Andrew Luck, Richard Sherman, Doug Baldwin, Zach Ertz, David DeCastro and Trent Murphy amongst others. Jim Harbaugh finished with a 29-21 (21-14 Pac-12) record in four seasons at Stanford. REQUIRED READING: Jim Harbaugh spent 9 years as Michigan football's power source. Now he's electrifying LA Christian McCaffrey, who was recruited to Stanford after Harbaugh left, was an elusive and dual-threat running back for the Cardinal from 2014 to 2016. His best season with the Cardinal came during his sophomore year in 2015 when he broke Brian Westbrook's previous NCAA record for single-season all-purpose yards record (which includes return yards) with 3,864 yards. The Colorado native was selected with the eighth overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft by the Carolina Panthers. Here's a full list of Christian McCaffrey's records at Stanford according to the NCAA: REQUIRED READING: Jim Harbaugh heaps praise upon J.J. McCarthy, says he could be No. 1 QB in NFL draft Before Harbaugh returned to the college ranks to coach alma mater in 2014, he spent four seasons at the NFL ranks as the head coach of the 49ers. Harbaugh's time in Santa Clara was successful, for the most part, as he recorded 44 wins from 2011-14 − the fourth-most of any coach in that span behind Bill Belichick, Mike McCarthy and John Fox according to FOX Sports Research. He also led the 49ers to three straight NFC championship game appearances from 2011-13 and a Super Bowl appearance in 2012, which he lost to his younger brother, John Harbaugh, and the Baltimore Ravens. Christian McCaffrey found his way to San Francisco through an in-season trade last year between the 49ers and the Carolina Panthers. In his time with the 49ers, the 5-foot-11 tailback has excelled in Kyle Shanahan' system becoming one of the NFL's premier offensive weapons on the ground and through the air. Christian McCaffrey played at Stanford in college. During that time:-Pac-12 OPOY (2015)-AP POY (2015)-2x first-team All-Pac-12-5,100+ total yardsNow CMC heads back to the Bay to play for the Niners. Full circle 🙌 pic.twitter.com/nVXylBf9OY Though Harbaugh did not Christian McCaffrey at Stanford, the now Chargers head coach did coach his younger brother, Dylan McCaffrey, at Michigan. Dylan McCaffrey, who was a four-star recruit and the No. 2-ranked prospect in Colorado in the 2017 recruiting class — according to his 247Sports' composite rankings page — played for Harbaugh from 2017 to 2019 at Michigan. After redshirting his true freshman season, Dylan McCaffrey served as one of the Wolverines' backup quarterbacks in the 2018 and 2019 seasons. In those two seasons under Harbaugh, Dylan McCaffrey completed 18 passes for 242 yards with three touchdowns and ran for 168 yards on 23 carries for two touchdowns in 13 combined games. Dylan McCaffrey entered the transfer portal in 2021 following sitting out the entire 2020 season after losing out on the starting quarterback job to Joe Milton. He used the final two years of his eligibility playing for his dad and former NFL wide receiver, Ed McCaffrey, at Northern Colorado.""}]"

and Recreation. This isn’t unusual, we’ve both made each other sit through shows one of us enjoys. I’ve made him watch the entirety of Full House (and Fuller House), Friends and the Golden Girls, so he deserves to have me watch a show he enjoys. We watched the first season, a whopping six episodes, and I have to say I’m not a fan. I’ve never been a big fan of the ‘mock-umentary’ style sitcoms, things like the Office, Modern Family and of course Parks and Recreation. My biggest complaint so far has been that the show poorly portrays how a local government works. This might just be a complaint I have, but I’m a small-town reporter. I talk to people in local government all the time, I cover local ordinances, local elections, and various other things that the show portrays, and none of it is correct. The premise of the first season is that the city of Pawnee owns a piece of property that had been being developed but only got as far as digging out a basement before the developer abandoned the project, leaving a large pit in the ground. A man falls into it, breaking both of his legs, and the main character, deputy parks and recreation director Leslie Knope (played by Amy Poehler), vows to make it right by turning the property into a park. I had several complaints, all of which made my husband pause the show and stare at me in bewilderment because he’d never heard these complaints before. Things such as ‘the city council would have to vote on that’ and ‘the property would have to go through a rezoning process to go from multi-family residential to recreational’ and ‘if residents wanted to vote on it, they would have to circulate a petition and file it with the county and it would come up on a future ballot. That process could take months.’ Things that he had no clue about, because most people don’t think about zoning laws on a regular basis. At least not to the degree I do. Also, if there was a fenced-in property with a pit, and someone snuck in and fell in said pit, they would probably be charged with trespassing. I don’t mind some suspension of disbelief in television shows, but for a show that’s supposed to follow a documentary style I would expect more accuracy. That probably makes me sound boring. My friends told me so when I explained my complaints to them over the weekend, as none of them work closely with government either and prefer to watch a show for entertainment instead of accuracy. And the show spans seven seasons, so I’m hoping it’ll get better or at least funnier. I also don’t find it very funny, which is the other problem. At least when we watch other sitcoms, Kyle and I both laugh. Even one of our dogs likes sitcoms. Cosmo is very soothed by all the voices in the Golden Girls, and he likes to watch it to fall asleep. I’ll watch the whole show, like I said, he deserves it. And when it’s over, it’ll be my turn again and I’m making a list of shows we need to watch.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:03 pm (The Center Square) – President Joe Biden declared a major disaster existed in Michigan and ordered Federal assistance to supplement state and local recovery efforts in areas affected by severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding from Aug. 24 to Aug. 26. The action makes federal funding available to affected individuals in the counties of Eaton, Ingham, Iona, Kent, Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland and Wayne. “Michiganders have been working hard to recover from the tornadoes and storms that caused so much damage across the state this summer,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement. “With today’s federal disaster declaration by President Biden, we will get the resources we need to support impacted families, businesses, and communities. Michiganders are tough. We will get through this the way we always have—together."" Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster. On Aug. 24, areas in lower Michigan experienced several storms that brought heavy rain, strong winds and seven tornadoes. Whitmer requested a Major Disaster Declaration as communities across the state experienced road and bridge closures, downed trees and power lines, damage to building structures, embankments, and road surfaces, overwhelmed stormwater and sewer systems, and deposits of silt and debris. Hundreds of homeowners also reported residential flooding. Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide. John F. Boyle of the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments. Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated areas can begin applying for assistance at www.DisasterAssistance.gov, by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the FEMA App. Anyone using a relay service, such as video relay service, captioned telephone service or others, can give FEMA the number for that service. “This federal assistance will supplement the ongoing state and local recovery efforts and will directly help home and business owners affected by these storms,” said Col. James F. Grady II, state director of Emergency Management and Homeland Security and director of the MSP. “We encourage all affected residents to apply.” Originally published on thecentersquare.com, part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange.

Online dispensaries implement strict quality checks on all items before listing them for sale on their platforms. These measures ensure customers get genuine cannabis strains every time they make mail order marijuana purchases through these verified online vendors.

These unregulated sellers often lack quality control measures, meaning you cannot be certain about the safety and authenticity of what you’re getting. From questionable packaging to unreliable sources, there are many potential hazards when opting for black market cannabis. To ensure your safety and satisfaction, it is important to choose certified online vendors or licensed distributors who have undergone proper quality assurance processes and testing by accredited labs.

Oxford Fire Chief Matt Majestic warns residents that with the recent temperatures above freezing, and the rain over the past few days, the ice is unstable right now and they should avoid going out on lakes and ponds. Photo provided by Oxford Fire Department By Jim Newell Managing Editor OXFORD TWP. – The Oxford Fire Department averted what could have been a tragedy, rescuing two teenagers who fell through the ice on Paint Lake on Sunday afternoon The incident happened at 1:35 p.m. after the teens were on Paint Lake, formerly known as Squaw Lake, approximately 75 yards from shore near the DNR access site. One teen had gone completely under water and was transported to a hospital as a precaution. The second teen only had one leg fall through the ice and was released to his parents, said Oxford fire Chief Matt Majestic. “One boy went in one leg and the rest of him stayed up top, and the other boy went in and took a whole section of ice out with him. When he first went under he went completely under, he was submerged. When he popped back up he was holding onto the ice shelf,” Majestic said. “The piece he fell in on was like a block that had broken free because it was weakened by that honeycombing or candling effect.” By the time firefighters arrived the piece of ice the boy was holding onto had already started to submerge. “It was down about 8-10 inches because it’s weak ice, it’s hollow ice, so water is flowing through it now rather than being under it,” Majestic said. Firefighter Ryan McLeod went out onto the ice and used a rescue sling to pull the teen to safety, urging the boy to kick his feet once firefighters began pulling on the rescue rope. The teen, however, said he could not move his legs to kick. “The problem is that your body starts shutting down and sending your fluids back to the core to try to take care of the heart, lungs and brain. So, it makes it very difficult for you to use your arms and legs. And that’s the situation he was in,” Majestic said. McCloud fell through the weakened ice himself just a few feet from the teen, but was wearing a protective suit. “He’s in the immersion suit, that’s what we go out with. He did a good job,” Majestic said. Firefighters on shore then pulled the two to dry land. From the time the teen fell through the ice, until the time the fire department received the call, arrived on scene and were able to pull the teen free was about 16 minutes. The boy whose leg went through the ice was able to get himself out and get onshore, Majestic said. “And rightfully so, he didn’t go back for the other boy because he would have gone in too,” Majestic said. “Even as our rescuers got to him they could feel the ice bouncing as they were walking and they got down on their hands and knees as they got close.” With the recent change in weather from below freezing to warmer days above freezing, coupled with the rain, the ice becomes even more unstable, Majestic warns. “We’ve had weather that went from full on frigid winter and that lasted for a few days but now we’ve been hit with a good five to six days that never got below freezing and that ice begins to decay,” Majestic said. “And when it decays it does what’s called candling. It literally looks like if you were to take a bundle of candles and tie them together. Or even honeycomb. That’s another term used.” When ice begins to decay, it does so from the bottom upward and the top downward until it meets in the middle, creating ice that resembles a test tube, Majestic said. “It’s reminiscent of that old game Don’t Break the Ice. It fails in that similar fashion. Just placing pressure on it from above causes it to break. Think of that bundle of candles or bundle of test tubes, and how you can just push on one in the center, how you can just slide it out. That’s exactly what happens when the ice begins to decay this time of year,” Majestic said. “It could be eight or 10 inches thick, it doesn’t matter. It just doesn’t have the integrity or strength because of those weakened hollow points all the way throughout.” As soon as there is one opening in the ice it begins to break off in pieces. “It’s just going to start to exponentially decay,” Majestic said. “As soon as ice starts pulling away from shore, it’s showing you that it’s in decay, it’s breaking down, it’s starting to melt.” Why the teens were on the ice was not released as of press time.

These third party services use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, web server logs and similar technologies to collect information. The information collected is of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site, and which pages you visited throughout our site. The information collected may be disclosed to these third parties, who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of the website.

Here is more information on how Google uses data. We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based targeting”).

(AP) — Two people have died after a small plane attempted to make an emergency landing on Interstate 75 in southwest Florida on Friday afternoon, colliding with a vehicle and bringing traffic to a halt as a massive plume of black smoke rose into the air. The crash landing happened near the Pine Ridge Road exit in Collier County, just north of where the interstate heads east toward Fort Lauderdale along what is known as Alligator Alley. Brianna Walker saw the wing of the plane drag the car in front of hers and slam into the wall. “It’s seconds that separated us from the car in front of us,” she said. “The wing pulverized this one car.” Walker and her friend spotted the plane moments before it hit the highway, allowing her friend to pull over before the crash. “The plane was over our heads by inches,” she said. “It took a hard right and skid across the highway.” Walker said an explosion of flames then burst from the plane with a loud boom. Pieces of the plane littered the highway. “It feels unreal, like a movie,” she said. “It was seconds between us dying.” The Federal Aviation Administration identified the aircraft as a Bombardier Challenger 600 jet and said five people were aboard when the crash happened around 3:15 pm. The plane had taken off from an airport at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, at about 1 p.m. and was scheduled to land in Naples around the time of the crash, Naples Airport Authority spokesperson Robin King said. A pilot had contacted the tower requesting an emergency landing, saying they had lost both engines. The tower lost contact, and then airport workers saw the smoke from the interstate just a few miles away. King said they sent fire trucks with special foam to the scene, and three of the five people on board were taken from the wreckage alive. Collier County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Adam Fisher confirmed two deaths, but said he didn’t immediately know whether the victims had been passengers on the plane or were on the ground. According to the FlightAware aircraft tracker, the plane was operated by Hop-a-Jet Worldwide Charter based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The aircraft had been scheduled to fly back to Fort Lauderdale Friday afternoon. Hop-a-Jet did not immediately respond to an email and phone message seeking comment. A spokesperson for Ohio State University said the aircraft is not affiliated with the university, and they had no further information about it. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate, with the NTSB leading the investigation. One NTSB investigator arrived at the crash site Friday afternoon, with several more expected to arrive on Saturday. They will document the scene and examine the aircraft, which will then be taken to a secure facility for further evaluation. A preliminary report about the cause of the crash can be expected in 30 days. The Florida Highway Patrol said in a news release that the southbound lanes of the interstate were closed and advised motorists to seek alternate routes.

brakes on plans to establish a social district in the downtown area. On Tuesday, the village council opted to table a resolution proposed by the Downtown Development Authority (DDA) that would have set hours, boundaries and guidelines for a social district. Social districts, as defined by Michigan law, allow patrons to purchase alcoholic beverages from qualifying licensed businesses and consume them outside in designated areas on the city’s right-of-way sidewalks. DDA leaders are looking to boost business and draw more visitors to the village by implementing commons areas for outdoor alcohol consumption. However, several village council members said they want to hear more public input before approving the plan and make sure that the social district will be safe for patrons. Four downtown businesses have expressed interest in applying to be part of the village’s proposed social district, including Mikey’s Grill, Roots, Senor Victor’s and Chicky’s Paradise Saloon. Jim Aleck, owner of Mikey’s, and Chicky Bryant, owner of Chicky’s, were both in attendance at Monday’s meeting to urge the council to approve the social district. Currently, the DDA has proposed Plan A and Plan B maps for the social district. Under Plan A, the social district would encompass sidewalks in front of and behind Mikey’s, Roots, Senor Victor’s and in front of Chicky’s and stretch from Stone Street to School Street near the Dollar General store along N. Main Street (M-53). The DDA’s Plan B map would only include Mikey’s, Roots and Senor Victor’s on the southeast side of Main Street in the downtown area and exclude Chicky’s, which is located on the northwest side of downtown across the street. Both maps have been reviewed and approved by the village attorney and the DDA’s attorney and have received support from Almont Police Chief Andrew Martin. President Pro Tem Tim Dyke and Councilman Peter Feldman said they’ve received multiple emails from residents who are concerned that the district will pose safety issues. “I’ve gotten emails from people I know…who don’t feel that this is Almont,” said Dyke. “They don’t think the alcohol variant of trying to draw people downtown is what Almont needs.” Angela Edwards, executive director of the Almont DDA, said patrons in the social district would be required to stay within the designated area while consuming alcohol and would not be permitted to cross M-53 with a drink in their hand unless the street is closed for a special event. She said patrons would have to use a specially marked, single-use disposable drink cup bearing the Downtown Almont Social District decal and logos of participating businesses. Edwards also said that the DDA would mark the commons areas with plenty of signage displaying the social district rules and “no alcohol permitted beyond this point” messages. Councilman Edward Kuligowksi said he thinks the social district would be beneficial to the village, but he’s concerned that M-53’s traffic volume could pose a risk for patrons who are navigating the commons areas — particularly visitors who aren’t familiar with downtown Almont. “Will there be designated lanes directing people where they can cross the street?” he asked Edwards. “M-53 can be a nightmare (for traffic).” Edwards said the DDA could include a map of the social district routes and instructions on where to safely cross M-53. She also pointed out that designated commons areas would be open seven days a week and where day-to-day activity would take place. However, the entire social district boundary would only apply when M-53 and other downtown roads are closed for special events, such as Heritage Festival in September and Holly Day Festival in December. Fountain Park on 101 S. Main Street is also being considered as a commons area. “Since this (social district) law was enacted, 112 municipalities across the state have adopted designated social districts. Of those 112, 26 are comparable or less in size to our village,” said Edwards. “Two-thirds of businesses that are within our social district boundary have voiced full support and approval and are excited to get it going here.” Councilwoman Melinda Steffler said she supports the DDA’s vision for the social district but doesn’t want to rush the approval process. “I would expect with a proposal of this size and impact on the community that we should have more people in the audience,” she said. “I feel they should have an opportunity to think about it and provide their input and feedback on where commons areas should be.” Steffler asked if the DDA would be willing to distribute informational flyers about the social district proposal throughout town. Edwards said she would consider doing that. The DDA has also posted a feedback section on its website, almontdda.com, as well as information and a link to its social district presentation on the Downtown Almont Facebook page. Community feedback is needed before Feb. 19. Andy Roosa, chairman of the Almont DDA Board of Directors, said the DDA is hoping to have the resolution passed in time for spring so that participating businesses can receive their permits through the DDA and the Michigan Liquor Control Commission. “We’re pushing up against the clock to get it done this year ahead of our events like Jeep Night and Cruise Night,” he said. “Our deadline is April for the (participating) businesses to get their license agreements in place.” Almont would become the second community in Lapeer County to have a social district if the village council approves the resolution. The City of Lapeer debuted its social district in 2021. The Almont Village Council is expected to take up the social district resolution again at its next meeting on Feb. 20 at 7:30 p.m. Due to early voting, the meeting will happen at the Almont Township Fire Dept.

and CEO Joyce Donaldson and GM Orion Plant Director Jeff Roeschke all discussed the impact the chamber has had on the area during the chamber’s member appreciation breakfast on Jan. 31. Photo by Jim Newell. By Jim Newell Managing Editor ORION TWP. — The Orion Area Chamber of Commerce is growing and experienced one of its largest years of growth in 2023 when 58 businesses, organizations or individuals joined the chamber ranks. The chamber now has 311 members and Chamber President and CEO Joyce Donaldson attributes the growth to more businesses in the community learning about how the chamber supports area businesses. “I think with the help of The Lake Orion Review and ONTV and our board members and ambassadors getting out the good word about how the chamber does support small businesses they’re literally calling us every day to join,” Donaldson said. “They basically call us because they want to be a part of something that is greater than themselves. They want the support of the chamber and business community. With all of the support that we offer I think they feel us wrapping our arms around them to support them, whether they’re a new business, an existing business or a longtime business. I think they see the chamber being more active and they want to be part of it.” The news came during the chamber’s annual membership meeting on Jan. 31 at the Orion Center, along with the chamber’s annual report which details the activities of the chamber and membership. While there are many networking opportunities within the chamber for businesses to gain exposure, the business owners also feel a strong connection to the Orion community and want to find ways to contribute, Donaldson said. “Many of our members are very community-oriented. Yes, they’re getting involved in the chamber but they’re also getting to know nonprofits and supporting the nonprofits. At Christmastime the Lions Club reached out to us and said, ‘Hey, we know you have great relationships with the credit unions, could you give us the name of your contact people?’ We gave them the contacts and through that they were able to get financial donations, baskets and turkeys. So, (businesses) are really interested in helping the community. That’s just one example but it’s one example that I’m really proud of. And the financial institutions all came back to me and thanked me for getting them in touch with the Lions Club.” “This is the best chamber in America. I am not biased,” said Orion Township Supervisor Chris Barnett. “Thank you for supporting our chamber, for supporting our community and supporting each other. I love watching the ribbon cutting videos because it’s amazing to see the investment that’s happening over and over every day in our community. On top of that, to hear the success from the new business owners who moved here, who chose Orion Township to plant their flag, to hear that some of their best customers are their repeat customers, or are referring clients, are members of the chamber of commerce.” Barnett added that he appreciates the locally-owned businesses who have chosen to make Orion Township their home for business, and personal, investment. “The Ignite Taverns and the Old Detroits and the Johnny Blacks and the small businesses that are people who live and work and raise their kids here thrive,” Barnett said. “I think that’s really unique about our community and I love that about our community.” Over the past year, Donaldson is most appreciative of how active chamber members are within the chamber and the community. “I think I’m most proud of the involvement. Just looking at this room today, 125 people came out to learn about what we did last year and look to the future because they want to be more involved. And many of them are those 58 new members that we received last year,” Donaldson said.

And there was great pressure on me having to do with guns. We did nothing. We didn’t yield,” he said as he addressed the NRA’s Great American Outdoor Show in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Friday evening.

Fresh off another dominant win in the Nevada caucuses Thursday night, Trump used the NRA forum to highlight his support of gun rights, a major priority for GOP voters. The issue is also a major motivator for Democrats as well as younger voters who grew up participating in active shooter drills and have witnessed a spate of school shootings in recent years. Next week will mark the sixth anniversary of one of those shootings, the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead.

The state’s Feb. 24 primary may prove the last chance for Nikki Haley, Trump’s last remaining rival, to blunt the former president’s march toward the nomination.

The group’s longtime CEO, Wayne LaPierre, resigned last month ahead of a trial in New York over allegations that he treated himself to millions of dollars in private jet flights, yacht trips, African safaris and other extravagant perks at the powerful gun rights organization’s expense. The New York attorney general sued LaPierre and three co-defendants in 2020, claiming widespread misspending and self-enrichment. The organization filed for bankruptcy and sought to incorporate in Texas instead of New York, but a judge rejected the move. ___ Associated Press writer Thomas Beaumont contributed to this report from Des Moines.

spiritual leader and bestselling author who was the first Democrat to challenge President Joe Biden in the 2024 primary, has suspended her campaign. Williamson announced the end of her White House bid in a YouTube video posted on Wednesday. “Particularly those of you who are young, who felt that in this campaign you saw hope, I want you to remember that that which is most important does not end on this day,” Williamson said in the video. “The story itself is so long, the American story, the arc of history is what matters, and the ideas that we stood for … anytime we put out that ripple of hope, anytime we put out any good idea, any time we shed light on a darkened sky, that light will remain and that darkness shall be less.” Williamson made the announcement after earning 2% of the vote in the South Carolina primary on Tuesday. As she did in her 2020 campaign, Williamson enchanted many with her message of love and peace, this time aided by TikTok, where she amassed a large following. But it was always going to be an uphill battle for her campaign, with the Democratic National Committee declining to host any primary debates and Biden, polling high, declining to engage with his competitors. Williamson’s campaign was also reportedly marred by dysfunction, including staff turnover and fundraising issues. (Williamson denied the claims.) Some former staffers accused Williamson of being more interested in building an audience to promote her upcoming book The Mystic Jesus: The Mind of Love. The book is scheduled for release in May. Williamson gained fame in the 1990s as a spiritual leader for celebrities in Los Angeles and New York. In the late ’90s and early 2000s, she led the Church of Today, a Macomb County megachurch.

I love the fact that my Lions prediction against the Rams was dead wrong as I picked the Rams to win. The Detroit Lions held on by one thin point for a 24-23 victory over the Rams. The Lions first playoff win after nine straight defeats in the playoffs and first home playoff game in 30 years made the State of Michigan proud. The Lions fan base has been waiting, waiting and waiting for this moment — a playoff home game and a playoff win! The Lions delivered both on Sunday night in a highly contested football game. The Lions football team played a red-hot Rams football team, and they knew it would not be easy to defeat the Rams. I know Matthew Stafford wanted this win as bad as he wanted to win the Super Bowl two years ago against Cincinnati. I want to say, I was a Stafford fan and greatly appreciated what he did for the Lions during his Lions career. Matt Stafford is one tough competitor and an elite quarterback in the NFL. The first half was electric action on the field, and the crowd noise was off the charts. I guess if it’s been 30 years there should be some pent-up vocal cords in the crowd ready to be released. The Lions offense came out on fire, scoring three straight touchdowns on their first three drives. The offense looked unstoppable, but then came the second half. I can tell you for as good as the offense was in the first half, it stunk to high heaven in the second half. The play calling in the second half was absolutely abysmal in my opinion. I can tell you I have a love and hate attitude with offensive coordinator Ben Johnson. He refuses to stay aggressive when the Lions have the lead in the football game! It absolutely infuriates me to the point of throwing objects at the television and shouting obscenities. The fact they scored only three points in the second half is totally ridiculous if you ask me. I thought Jared Goff played a steady game under center for the Lions as he did not turn over the football. The Lions defense won the game (who thought I would ever write that?) with their red zone defense. The Lions held the Rams to three field goals in the red zone, which made the Lions victorious. The job Dan Campbell and Brad Holmes has done with this team in three years is nothing short of phenomenal! What is next in the NFL Playoffs this weekend? The Dallas Cowboys are playing golf as they choked once again in the playoffs losing to the Green Bay Packers. Let’s just say Karma bit the number two seed in the “Cowgirls” tail. The Lions’ blown reported eligible play is now a blessing as Dallas is eliminated! The Lions now get another home game playoff game! The Lions go 30 years without one and now get two in two weeks! I love it! The Lions will host Tampa Bay at 3 p.m. on Sunday afternoon at Ford Field. The crowd will be electric, and the roof may well be blown off by the fans with noise. The Lions need to handle their business and win this game for a trip to the NFC Championship game. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are confident after beating Philadelphia and cannot be taken lightly. I think the Lions will find a way to defeat the “Yuck a neers” and play for the right to go to the Super Bowl. The Fat Guy crystal cheeseball says: Home Sweet Home 26 and Walk the Plank 20. For the AFC playoff games I like the Ravens over the Texans 31-17. I like Buffalo over Kansas City 27-24 and what a game this will be on Sunday night! For the NFC playoff game in San Francisco, give me the 49ers over the Cheese Heads 34-24. I will be pulling for the Packers to take out the boys from San Francisco to get the Lions yet another home playoff game! The Red Wings are playing good hockey! ROAR!

Israelis are “white colonizers.” Courtesy of Ben Younger This article originally appeared in The Forward. A new Instagram account called @israelsowhite presents Israelis with diverse racial and ethnic heritage saying the words: “I’m a white colonizer.” Some of the individuals featured are Black, some are Asian and most have olive or brown skin. The satirical campaign pokes fun at the idea promoted by some critics that Israel is a “settler colonialist state” founded and inhabited by white Europeans. The account is the brainchild of director Ben Younger, whose films include Boiler Room, Bleed for This and Prime, which starred Meryl Streep and Uma Thurman. Many of the three dozen Israelis in Younger’s #israelsowhite video reel smile or giggle as they utter the words, “I am a white colonizer.” One asks, in a puzzled tone of voice, “You want me to say what?” The amused reactions suggest that they think it’s absurd to use the term “white colonizer” to describe ordinary, nonwhite Israelis like themselves. The video ends with text stating: “Israel has 9.2 million citizens. More than 2/3 are people of color,” followed by a list of countries they come from: India, Ethiopia, Algeria, Iraq, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, Iran, Yemen, Libya, Colombia and Morocco. “I made this video to illustrate one of the misconceptions many people have about Israelis,” Younger wrote on Instagram. “Jews are indigenous to Israel. All Jews. All shapes, sizes and colors. 90% of us have Israel in our DNA. Point is, we are an incredibly diverse people. We simply do not fit into a reductive, binary framework.” In a phone interview, Younger, who lives in upstate New York, said the idea came to him on a trip he made to volunteer in Israel after the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attacks. Coming back from a kibbutz near the Gaza border where he’d spent the day trimming weeds, Younger saw an IDF soldier at a gas station. “I told him that back in the U.S. there is an alarming contingency of young people that believe Israel is composed solely of white Jews — colonizers and imperialists to boot,” Younger wrote in a post launching the account this week. The olive-skinned soldier laughed and responded, “Do they know the country is mostly people that look like me?” So far the video has received nearly a million views and more than 27,000 likes. Younger said he’s not very active on social media, but the campaign started getting attention when it was reposted by his friend, comedian Michael Rapaport, who has 2 million Instagram followers. It was also posted on the social media platform X by journalist Eve Barlow, who has more than 70,000 followers. Not all the responses to the account are positive. “Every one of those people serves whiteness/white supremacy,” wrote one critic, referring to the individuals showcased in Younger’s posts. “So this means you can kill 30,000 Palestinian’s and destroy Gaza and do settlements in the West Bank?” wrote another person commenting on Instagram. A third weighed in: “Do you think a whole long list of y’all’s Brown faces coming on here laughing saying your white colonizers do you think they actually changes anything??” In an interview, Younger dismissed the criticism. This “is about an irrefutable fact,” he said. “If people had that fact, then we could make more informed decisions about how we do argue about the war and what we do say about the war.” He added that a defining characteristic of colonization is the imposition of language. Dozens of countries around the world speak English, French and Spanish as a result of colonization, but only one speaks Hebrew — the language of Jews who were indigenous to Israel. Another defining characteristic, he said, is the exploitation of resources to benefit the colonizers. “Where are the Israelis bringing all these things back to?” he said. His goal is to get people “to understand who we are.” Calling Israelis colonizers “is actually so easily refutable. I just chose the visual path.” Younger, 51, is an Ashkenazi Jew who attended yeshiva growing up in New York City and New Jersey.

But troubling signs soon appeared, especially when Ma\'Kayla Wickerson, 25, distanced herself and her 3-year-old daughter, Malaiyah, from the rest of her family – a decision Morgan said was unlike anything her daughter had ever done. “She was so different,” Morgan told USA TODAY. “I didn’t understand.” Although she grew increasingly concerned, Morgan could never have known what they were caught up in. Police say Ma\'Kayla and Malaiyah have vanished, swallowed up with four other people by a ""spiritual cult."" Authorities are investigating the disappearances, the suspected cult and possible ties to murders in other states, Missouri police say. Berkeley Police Maj. Steve Runge told USA TODAY he hopes spreading the word will help authorities find the missing alive and well. In addition to the Wickersons, that includes 24-year-old Mikayla Thompson of St. Louis; 27-year-old Gerrielle German and 3-year-old Ashton Mitchell of Lake Horn, Mississippi; and 29-year-old Naaman Williams of Washington, D.C.

The adults are believed to be followers of Rashad Jamal, a convicted child molester who leads ""The University of Cosmic Intelligence.” Police described the group as a ""spiritual cult,"" which has about 200,000 subscribers on its YouTube channel and tens of thousands more across other platforms. Authorities said believers have been active on social media and shared Jamal’s videos, disconnected from family and friends, quit their jobs, meditated outside without clothes and had polygamous relationships. Morgan said she holds out hope for her missing loved ones. ""We miss Ma\'Kayla and Malaiyah so much,"" Morgan said. ""Faith has been keeping us together as a family. ... We still believe that everything\'s going to be OK and they\'re going to come back home safely. I just wish I knew where they were.""

Working with clients, jewelry designers bridge imagination and creation to transform dreams into a cherished piece of jewelry that embodies the couple’s unique love story. The women’s wedding band market constantly evolves to reflect new ideas and tools that allow brides to express their individuality. From the resurgence of vintage styles to the invention of stackable rings, brides-to-be have more options than ever. Whether made of precious and durable metals or adorned with sparkling diamonds, unique wedding bands for women are not just jewelry but an unbreakable symbol of your love and commitment to each other. These one-of-a-kind pieces are tangible representations of your unique bond and a reminder of the many memories you have made together. Featuring personalized designs like handwriting and fingerprints, these rings are a gorgeous symbol of your love that can be worn as a keepsake for the rest of your life. Once a couple decides to make their wedding rings, the whole experience becomes a priceless memory. Every detail of the workshop process will be significant for the couple, from picking designs together to learning how to solder and sand. In addition, the videos and photographs of their time crafting their rings will become a keepsake for the rest of their lives. The artisan who creates a custom ring can take four to eight weeks to produce the piece before it’s ready to be worn. While this waiting time is not ideal for couples who are impatient, the craftsmanship and quality of a handmade ring will be worth it. Traditionally, wedding bands have been simple and gold. They come in various shapes and materials to match your unique style. They also offer a wide selection of stone accents that can add a bit of personality to your ring. Wedding bands can be worn stacked with engagement rings or on their own. A renowned wedding planning company believes in turning your wedding dreams into a breathtaking reality that exceeds your wildest imagination.

""The gentleman had come into the restaurant following a memorial for a very dear friend of his,"" Sweeney said the customer had explained to him. ""His tip was the gesture he chose to honor her — and pay it forward."" The general manager said the man — who appeared to be middle age, in his late 40s — dined alone, in a black suit and blue tie, what you might expect he\'d wear for a funeral. Sweeney said he doesn’t remember exactly what the man ordered, and the tip wasn’t an inheritance from the friend who died, or anything like that. The Mason Jar Cafe — which is owned by husband and wife, Able Martinez and Jayme Cousins, in a converted car dealership — serves locally grown food, fresh-squeezed orange juice and coffee made with specialty-roasted beans. Drinks come in — what else? ― mason jars. But even by posh standards, the customer\'s $10,000 tip was generous. ""We have a crew that does a wonderful job of taking care of guests, so larger tips are pretty normal around here, but not anything of this magnitude,"" Sweeney said. ""This was absolutely out of the blue — and the largest anyone I’ve spoken to has ever seen."" The wait staff, the general manager said, have expressed appreciation for the customer’s generosity and desire to turn a sad moment in his life into a joyous one for others. Some of them, Sweeney said, have talked about what they might do with the extra money: one, a mom, plans to spend it on driver’s ed classes for her child, and another, said she can finally go on the family vacation of her dreams. The receipt, which the cafe posted to Facebook, has been circulating on social media. It noted, in part: ""Things can feel real heavy sometimes, but this was such an amazing act to have seen first hand in our restaurant. So to everyone doing what they can for themselves, and for others, we see you, thank you, and appreciate you."" The social media chatter also has drawn favorable attention to Benton Harbor, which, at times, hasn\'t always been portrayed in the best light. ""There’s a lot of good that goes on here,"" Sweeney added. ""It’s a vibrant, growing community that’s getting brighter. The customer could have chosen to go anywhere that day, but he chose to come here."" Contact Frank Witsil: 313-222-5022 or fwitsil@freepress.com'}]"

SUCHYTA Times-Herald Newspapers DEARBORN – A Wall Street Journal editorial calling Dearborn “America’s Jihad Capital” has residents and city officials outraged about the characterization, and has led to an increased police presence at key locations. The recent op-ed piece, written by Steven Stalinsky, has been characterized as anti-Arab, anti-Muslim and Islamophobic, and police officials are concerned that it might draw violent extremists to the city. Police Chief Issa Shahin said the city has increased police patrols and law enforcement presence in and around places of worship and at major infrastructure locations within the city. He said the editorial has increased hateful rhetoric and threats again the community. “We continue to monitor social media and other forms of communication to identify any threats to our community,” Shahin said. “We also remain in contact with our federal, state and local law enforcement partners.” He encouraged residents who see suspicious activity to report it immediately to the Police Department. Mayor Abdullah Hammoud also urged residents to remain vigilant. In an Instagram post, the mayor said the increased police patrols are a direct result of the “garbage WSJ opinion piece that has led to an alarming increase in bigoted and Islamophobic rhetoric online targeting the city of Dearborn.” Hammoud said it is inconceivable that in 2024, the WSJ would publish a piece that is “reckless, bigoted and Islamophobic.” “Dearborn is one of the greatest American cities in our nation,” he said. Hammoud said Dearborn is the fastest growing city in Michigan, is home to The Henry Ford, the top travel destination in Michigan, is home to Ford Motor Co., is a coffee, food and cultural capital of Michigan and is among one of the most diverse cities in Michigan. Stalinsky, executive director of the Middle East Media Research Group, said he wrote the editorial to call out what he characterized as open support by Dearborn residents for the Oct. 7 attack against Israel. President Joseph Biden and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer also have condemned the commentary.
