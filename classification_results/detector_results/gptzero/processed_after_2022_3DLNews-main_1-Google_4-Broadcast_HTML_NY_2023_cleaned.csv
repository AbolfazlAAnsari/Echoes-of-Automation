Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donations Police were searching Friday for a suspect who allegedly assaulted a 43-year-old woman in an apparent unprovoked attack in the Bronx earlier this month. The incident happened just before midnight on Dec. 21 in the Concourse neighborhood, according to the NYPD. Police said the male suspect — whom they have not yet identified — approached the woman near McClellan Street and Sherman Avenue and struck her in the face with an “unknown object” before running away. The man was described as about 5 feet 9 inches tall and was last seen wearing a black hoodie sweater, black pants and white shoes and holding a metallic-colored cane. While overall crime in New York City is down 4% this year compared to 2022, felony assaults are up 6% and have spiked almost 30% since the start of the pandemic. The city had about 27,000 reported felony assaults this year, up from nearly 21,000 in 2019. Police officials and crime experts told Gothamist the increase could be partly related to the growing number of people living on the street, who may be more likely to be involved in violence as victims or perpetrators. Anyone with any information about the Dec. 21 incident can call the NYPD's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477), 1-888-57-PISTA (74782) for Spanish, or submit tips at the Crime Stoppers website.

(NEWS10)–Colorado’s highest court ruled former President Donald Trump is disqualified from being on the 2024 presidential primary ballot. Here in New York, a new bill would authorize the board of elections or the attorney general in the case of a deadlock, to remove an insurrectionist from the presidential ballot. The legislation is sponsored by Democratic Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz. https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/A8392 “The constitution is very clear,” said Dinowitz. “The 14th amendment, 3rd section talks about people who commit insurrection to not be able to run for office.” Colorado’s Supreme Court argued former President Donald Trump engaged in an insurrection on January 6th, 2021. However Trump said on Truth Social, “ I’m not an insurrectionist.” Senate Minority Leader Rob Ortt released a statement saying in-part, “Whether you like Donald Trump or hate him, the right to approve or disapprove of candidates should lie solely with the voters…. The only real threat to Democracy is the continued poisoning of our Judicial process by power hungry politicians and activist judges.” When asked if he thought it would be a conflict of interest if the Attorney General were to remove Trump from the ballot since her office is suing him, Dinowitz said, “The court cases aren’t personal. They are not her court cases. She represents the State of New York.” Colorado’s decision to take Trump off the ballot will likely go before the U.S. Supreme Court— something Governor Kathy Hochul said she will be closely watching.

Former President Trump is 77. Age has become a defining part of Biden’s image, and is potentially his political Achilles’ heel. Polls suggest voters in both political parties have doubts about electing Biden to a second term because of his age. In contrast, age rarely comes up as a criticism of Trump, a double standard frustrating to some Democrats defending Biden’s acuity and stamina. “Joe Biden is getting older, we all know that. But the other guy he’s probably going to be running against is getting older, too. And in the focus groups that I’m doing, old and steady still beats old and crazy,” Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha said on CBS News. Democrats acknowledge age is a factor in the race and is a part of the equation when it comes to the president. Biden walks slowly and sometimes falters with his speech. There are days when he looks every day of his nearly 81 years. Yet Biden has also repeatedly shown his acuity, political savvy and stamina, from baiting Republicans at the State of the Union address on cuts to Social Security, to his recent marathon trip to India and Vietnam. And there are of course virtues to age. “Look, here’s what I know, here’s what I can speak to. I can speak to that — a president who has wisdom,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said when asked recently about suggestions he is being treated with kid gloves by his staff. “I can speak to a president who has experience. I can speak to a president who has taken historic action and has delivered historic pieces of legislation. And that’s important.” Trump doesn’t have the same responsibilities as Biden as a former president. He doesn’t maintain Biden’s schedule, which includes near-daily appearances and occasional international travel. But when on camera, giving a speech or doing an interview, Trump can come across as forceful and fast-thinking. “Trump talks louder and faster than Biden does and moves with a thudding force,” New York Times columnist Frank Bruni observed this week. “He’s like a freight train to Biden’s cable car, or a big, bulbous tuba to Biden’s tremulous piccolo. Listening to Biden, I want a volume knob I can turn up. Listening to Trump, I crave nonsense-canceling headphones.” Democrats also haven’t made a point of going on the attack against Trump over his age. That’s partly because it would expose them to attacks on Biden’s age. But it’s also because they see much bigger reasons to keep Trump out of the White House again than his age. “His age is the last thing I’m worried about,” said Jim Kessler, a co-founder of the centrist think tank Third Way. “He is an authoritarian monster who happens to be old.” Polls suggest another tight race between Trump and Biden if Trump is the GOP nominee, but there are reasons for Democrats to think the former president would be an easier opponent to face than some of his younger opponents. Age is a part of that equation, but the fear Trump inspires in many voters is another reason. Trump has shown an ability to drive his own supporters to the polls, but also his detractors. “Trump has bigger challenges than his age, doesn’t he?” said Dan Eberhart, a GOP fundraiser who has backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the primary. Attacks and criticisms of Biden’s age have been a much bigger part of the emerging race so far. A Wall Street Journal poll published earlier this month found 73 percent of Americans said the phrase “too old to run for president” described Biden at least “somewhat well,” compared to 47 percent who felt the same of Trump. Some of the criticisms of Biden have even come from somewhat friendly quarters. In an op-ed published late Tuesday, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius, a usually reliable Biden booster, urged the president not to run for a second term, citing his age as a major liability with voters that could lead to his defeat at the hands of Trump. “Biden’s age isn’t just a Fox News trope; it’s been the subject of dinner-table conversations across America this summer,” the columnist wrote. “Biden has another chance to say no — to himself, this time — by withdrawing from the 2024 race. It might not be in character for Biden, but it would be a wise choice for the country.” White House allies largely responded to the Ignatius column with frustration and eye rolls, viewing it as the latest example of a media columnist or pundit calling for Biden to step aside or reevaluate the Democratic ticket, an argument they believe is simply not rooted in reality. “Something about hypotheticals not rooted in any suggestion of reality sucking up all of the air in the room just doesn’t sit right with me,” Symone Sanders-Townsend, a former Biden campaign spokeswoman who served as Vice President Harris’s press secretary, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “So, Biden will be the Dem’s nominee. Harris is on the ticket,” Sanders added. “The [question] to ask is ‘will people vote for them?’ Not ‘should he run?’” Biden and his team have repeatedly said that while it’s fair for voters to raise the president’s age as an issue, they should judge Biden on his actions and his record in the job. Trump has attacked Biden on all kind of issues and has been a behind-the-scenes player urging Republicans in the House to move forward with an impeachment inquiry against the president. But he generally doesn’t attack Biden on age. “Age is interesting because some people are very sharp, and some people do lose it, but you lose it at 40 and 50, also,” Trump told SiriusXM’s “The Megyn Kelly Show” in an interview that aired Thursday. “But no, he’s not too old at all. He’s grossly incompetent.” Trump has shown some sensitivity on the subject of his age and mental fitness for office. The former president in July 2020 bragged repeatedly about his performance on a test designed to detect signs of Alzheimer’s Disease or cognitive impairment. He also suggested in an interview before announcing his 2024 run that he would have to consider things like a doctor’s assessment while contemplating his political future. “If [Biden’s] the nominee, they’ll lose because he’s a lousy candidate,” Trump told Kelly. “So, you know, I’d rather take on the age issue. I feel I’m physically extremely good. I feel the same way I did 40 years ago.” Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Rząd federalny nie udostępnił na ten cel funduszy” – cytuje CBC News szefa dzielnicy Manhattan Marka Levine’a. Zgodnie z szacunkami do Nowego Jorku przybywa codziennie około 1000 migrantów. Urzędnicy miejscy twierdzą, że system schronisk jest przeciążony, a fundusze się wyczerpują. Jednym z wyzwań jest zapewnienie żywności. „Przez ostatni rok radziliśmy sobie całkiem dobrze ze 100 000 przybyszów, ale dochodzimy do punktu, w którym jest coraz trudniej. Naprawdę potrzebujemy pomocy” – oświadczył Levine.

'2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Li-Cycle President and CEO Ajay Kochhar is pushing back on dire predictions that his lithium-ion battery recycling company is headed toward bankruptcy. “It\'s a good business,” he said in an interview with WXXI News. “But this is a significant speed bump.” The company abruptly shut down construction on a Rochester hub facility last month. And this week it released a sobering quarterly earnings report that sent its stock price tumbling. Kochhar reiterated that Li-Cycle remains committed to the Eastman Business Park facility. So much so that he laughed off any suggestion that it wasn’t, saying that hub facility has the potential to “unlock” the company’s profit potential. “It has to be our top priority,” he said of the Rochester hub. “We have $390 million that we\'ve invested in the facility already, between the buildings and all the equipment. We\'re not walking away from that. That is number one.” He said Li-Cycle has a number of big companies in their corner with a vested interest in making sure the project is seen through. What’s next? Line up additional financing. And likely revise the construction plan in a way that could require less investment, initially, to produce a profitable, intermediate product. ""Then firm up the timing to come back and restart construction,” he said. “So no, we\'re not going bankrupt. We\'re confident in the business. It\'s been paining me to read that.” Kochhar declined to lay out a specific timetable but said the company would have to address the question by the time of its fourth quarter earnings call in February — if not sooner. Describing what went wrong, Kochhar said contracting on the project had become so layered that it likely slowed the flow of information. He said a report he received “very soon, right before” the Oct. 23 announced shutdown, showed a drastic rise in construction costs. The project at the time was moving from structural work to mechanical, piping and electrical work, which translates to more work hours. Read: Li-Cycles presentation to investors There also were delays in financing, particularly when it came to a conditional commitment for a $375 million loan from the U.S. Department of Energy. And a lease arrangement that didn’t work out with Pike Conductor, a partnership of local contractors that would have gotten funding and, serving as landlords, reimbursed Li-Cycle for the buildings. All that left Li-Cycle funding the project – and quickly running out of money. “I wouldn\'t say we were spending money we didn\'t have,” Kochhar said. “If we\'d continued, we would have been. … We were right at that cusp.” Had the loan been closed, and the lease been finalized, there might have been room to adjust. “It\'s just all those things happening at once,” Kochhar said. “But then you\'re stuck with a pretty tricky decision. … Do you keep going? And that would be frankly irresponsible. Or then you have to make a quick call.” In a statement, the Department of Energy said that, as with every conditional commitment, ""prospective borrowers must fulfill conditions … which can include legal, technical, commercial, contractual, and financial requirements.” The DOE continues to work with Li-Cycle on what ultimately is a multi-agency review covering legal, technical, commercial, contractual and financial requirements. What terms or conditions must be met are considered business confidential. And material changes in the project, significant litigation or other negative developments can factor into the process. Li-Cycle is facing a potential class action lawsuit that it defrauded investors. Kochhar made clear the company is not making excuses or placing blame. This was Li-Cycle\'s project and Li-Cycle\'s responsibility, he said. That isn’t to say he doesn’t have questions. “We have a lot of questions around, OK, well, how did that happen so quickly? How are we going do it differently next time, and a whole bunch of stuff, right?” The potential for a “next time” is where he sought to steer the conversation. And the need to gain greater cost certainty on a $485 million project that became a $560 million project and might balloon to an $850 million project or even $1 billion, when everything is built. ""You have a fully engineered project, and you have all the equipment and all the materials on the site,” he said. “So, the other component of that is how do you do the construction contracting? There must be better ways here, from our perspective.” The latest earnings report painted what many saw as a dire future for the company. Losses exponentially outpacing sales. Cash on hand is dwindling. Projects in Canada and Europe also being paused or put under review. Workforce reductions, including 20 people furloughed or laid off locally. It’s what fueled serious doubts among analysts including Ethan Wade, senior vice president and chief development officer at Brighton Securities. ""Will they announce bankruptcy tomorrow? Probably not,” Wade said this week. “But is that looking more and more likely that that will be a hand they may have to play in the near future? It does. And the lower the stock price goes, the bigger the bigger and more likely that could become.” Li-Cycle\'s stock closed at 71 cents a share on Wednesday. That was up 5 cents from the day before. But well below the high for the year of $6.58 a share. “I get it,” Kochhar said of analysts and traders alike. “They\'re looking at financials, and they\'re just looking at the base facts. I mean, the reality is, our business today, when you look at our quarterly financials, is not the hub business.” Li-Cycle\'s business plan works off a patented spoke-and-hub model. The spokes “shred the batteries,” he said, creating what is called black mass. ""That generates some revenue,” he continued. “But that\'s not really the full model, right? We make an intermediate product, we sell it. The real unlock here is the hub.” The hub is what refines the product to create battery-grade lithium, nickel, cobalt. It\'s the hub where Li-Cycle promised to create more than 260 jobs — a commitment Kochhar said ""hasn\'t really changed ... based on what we know today."" Put simply, the hub is where the money is. And that gets back to why Rochester is a priority. “This is the difficult side of the clean energy kind of build out,” he said. “Building stuff is hard. And it always is, and especially when you\'re at kind of the bleeding edge or the cutting edge, it\'s even harder. And these things can happen. ""It\'s surprising how it happened, even for us. But, you know, there\'s still a lot of value in it, and so we look forward to coming back.” More New York State News'}]"

Please enter a valid zipcode. Save When the coronavirus pandemic took hold in an unprepared U.S., many states like Ohio scrambled for masks and other protective gear. Supplies were so limited in 2020 that the state bought millions of medical gowns from a marketing and printing company and spent about $20 million to try to get personal protective equipment made in-state. Three years later, as the grips of the pandemic have loosened, Ohio and other states are now trying to deal with an excess of protective gear, ditching their supplies in droves. With expiration dates passing and few requests to tap into the stockpile, Ohio auctioned off 393,000 gowns for just $2,451 and ended up throwing away another 7.2 million, along with expired masks, gloves and other materials. The now expiring supplies had cost about $29 million in federal money. A similar reckoning is happening around the country. Items are aging, and as a deadline to allocate federal COVID-19 cash approaches next year, states must decide how much to invest in maintaining warehouses and supply stockpiles. An Associated Press investigation found that at least 15 states, from Alaska to Vermont, have tossed some of their trove of PPE because of expiration, surpluses and a lack of willing takers. Into the trash went more than 18 million masks, 22 million gowns, 500,000 gloves, and more. Thatâ\x80\x99s not counting states that didnâ\x80\x99t give the AP exact figures or responded in cases or other measurements. Rhode Island said it shredded and recycled 829 tons of PPE; Maryland disposed of over $93 million in supplies. â\x80\x9cWhat a real waste. Thatâ\x80\x99s what happens when you donâ\x80\x99t prepare, when you have a bust-and-boom public health system,â\x80\x9d where a lack of planning leads to panicked over-purchasing in emergencies, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. â\x80\x9cIt shows that we really have to do a better job of managing our stockpiles.â\x80\x9d The AP sent inquiries about PPE stockpiles to all 50 states over the past several months. About half responded. States emphasize that they distributed far more gear than they discarded and have gone to lengths to donate the leftovers. Washington state sent hundreds of thousands of supplies to the Marshall Islands last year. Pennsylvania says it offered PPE to 10,000 cities, heath facilities and more throughout the pandemic. Both states still ended up throwing out loads of expired items. Some states found limited post-expiration uses, such as training exercises. Many states are keeping at least a portion, and sometimes all, of their remaining protective gear. Some, such as Minnesota, even plan to update their stockpiles. But others say the vagaries of the pandemic and the PPE supply left no choice but to acquire the items, and now to throw them out, however reluctantly. Expiration dates are set to ensure the protection works as intended, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency has set the fair market value of expired supplies at zero dollars. â\x80\x9cAnytime youâ\x80\x99re involved in a situation where youâ\x80\x99re recalling how difficult it was to get something in the first place, and then having to watch that go or not be used in the way it was intended to be used, certainly, thereâ\x80\x99s some frustration in that,â\x80\x9d said Louis Eubank, who runs the South Carolina health departmentâ\x80\x99s COVID-19 coordination office. The state has discarded over 650,000 expired masks. Before the coronavirus pandemic, health care product distributors typically kept 20 to 30 days of supplies. That wasnâ\x80\x99t enough when the pandemic struck and demand skyrocketed for N95 masks, gloves and gowns. They became so scarce that some health care workers wore homemade masks and used trash bags for gowns. Hampered by years of underfunding and expanded responsibilities, the U.S governmentâ\x80\x99s Strategic National Stockpile â\x80\x9cwas not equipped to handle the COVID-19 pandemic,â\x80\x9d according to an inspector generalâ\x80\x99s report. As the federal stockpile dwindled, states plunged into global bidding wars and anything-goes arrangements. Massachusetts even used the New England Patriotsâ\x80\x99 team plane to collect masks from China. The explosive demand triggered a surge â\x80\x94 and ultimately a hard crash â\x80\x94 for American PPE manufacturers. The AP found in 2020 that states spent over $7 billion in a few months on PPE, ventilators and some other high-demand medical devices in a sellerâ\x80\x99s market. Ultimately, the federal government paid for many of the supplies. â\x80\x9cThere was no way to know, at the time of purchase, how long the supply deficit would last or what quantities would be needed,â\x80\x9d Ohio Department of Health spokesperson Ken Gordon said. Ohio distributed more than 227 million pieces of protective equipment during the pandemic. But as the supply crunch and the health crisis eased, demand faded, especially for gowns. Now, â\x80\x9cstates, hospitals, manufacturers â\x80\x93 everybody in the whole system -- has extra product,â\x80\x9d said Linda Rouse Oâ\x80\x99Neill of the Health Industry Distributors Association. Given the glut, stockpiled items are selling for bargain prices, if at all. Vermont got $82.50 for 105,000 boot covers and 29 cents apiece for thousands of safety goggles. The glut extends beyond states. Georgiaâ\x80\x99s Fulton County, which encompasses Atlanta, dispensed gloves, hand sanitizer and other supplies by the dozens of boxes at a public PPE giveaway in March. New York City said it auctioned a heap of â\x80\x9cnon-medical-gradeâ\x80\x9d PPE that was expiring or supplanted by better versions. Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan told local lawmakers in May that officials would focus on enhancing supply contracts for future emergencies, rather than prioritizing â\x80\x9ca static stockpile of commodities."" Missouriâ\x80\x99s mental health department planned but scrapped an auction of thousands of extra masks, gowns and other protective items bought with federal coronavirus relief money. The agency cited a belief that federal rules barred such a sale, but the U.S. Treasury Department later told the AP that states can sell excess PPE. Supply chain chaos prompted some governments to place multiple orders, resulting in surpluses when the shipments belatedly arrived. A New York state-run veteransâ\x80\x99 home was so deluged by PPE deliveries in early 2021 that it stashed them under tarps in a parking lot. By the time a warehouse was arranged four months later, between $560,000 and $1.6 million of supplies were too damaged to use â\x80\x94 and cost another $21,000 to incinerate, according to a state inspector generalâ\x80\x99s office report. Another $779,000 in expired items have been discarded. Striking a balance between preparedness and surpluses is â\x80\x9ca major dilemmaâ\x80\x9d for governments, said Scott Amey of the Project on Government Oversight, a Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group. And while politicians vowed in 2020 never to be caught off guard again, â\x80\x9cmemories are short, budgets are tight,â\x80\x9d Amey noted. In Wisconsin, a legislative committee axed from the budget $17.2 million that would have funded a warehouse with an ongoing 60-day supply of PPE for two years. The state Department of Health Services said it is now â\x80\x9cdemobilizing the warehouseâ\x80\x9d and trying to donate the supplies. Already, Wisconsin has tossed nearly 1.7 million masks and almost 1 million gowns. In Michigan, a 2021 state law requires the state health department to keep a stockpile of up to two months of medical supplies, and the departmentâ\x80\x99s website shows more than 38 million items on hand. But one of the lawâ\x80\x99s sponsors, Republican state Rep. John Roth, said he now thinks â\x80\x9cwe have to take another look at it,â\x80\x9d suggesting a one-month supply might mean less waste. The Health Industry Distributors Association recommends that product distributors maintain a 60-to-90-day supply to guard against demand spikes. But the group says itâ\x80\x99s probably unnecessary for everyone in the system â\x80\x94 from manufacturers to doctorsâ\x80\x99 offices â\x80\x94 to have such a large cushion. Some government officials concur. â\x80\x9cItâ\x80\x99s not really practical for most local health departments to have a large stockpile of materials for â\x80\x98just in case,â\x80\x99â\x80\x9d said Adriane Casalotti of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. â\x80\x9cThey have limited budgets. They also have limited space.â\x80\x9d Pennsylvania officials are aiming for a 15-day stockpile after frank conversations about what they can afford not only to keep, but to keep replacing. Tens of thousands of cases of PPE already have expired and been slated for disposal. â\x80\x9cIf we had unlimited federal funding, or even significantly more federal funding, for public health preparedness, that 60-day stockpile or 90-day stockpile would be a fantastic idea,"" said Andy Pickett, the Health Departmentâ\x80\x99s emergency preparedness and response director. Meanwhile, Missouriâ\x80\x99s health department has maintained a 90-day supply of PPE, based on the highest-demand months of the pandemic. Itâ\x80\x99s keeping even expired materials, presuming the federal government will OK their use in an emergency as it did for COVID-19.

In fact, one has been named #1. When you think of rude people, what do you imagine them doing? Most people tend to think of awful driving habits, bad manners, and a heightened sense of entitlement. But where in the United States will you find the most people with these bad attitudes? Unfortunately, they're right here in New York. A recent survey from Business Insider claims to have identified the rudest cities in all of America - and a place in the Empire State dominated the polls with over a third of the vote. The publication surveyed over 2,000 adults and asked to choose the five rudest cities from a list of the 50 largest metro areas in the country. The results was compiled from two separate online polls. Topping the list was none other than The Big Apple - A.K.A. New York City. With over a third of the vote, NYC was crowned the rudest city in all of America. In fact, 34.3 percent of all respondents put NYC at the top of their list, which is nearly twice as much as second-place finisher Los Angeles, California. You can read more about this survey HERE. Strangely enough, another survey - this time from Travel.Alot.com - also named NYC the place with some of the worst residents in the entire country. It shouldn't come as too much as a shock that NYC earned this not-so-great badge of honor, as the city has been widely viewed as terrible for centuries. In fact, President John Adams said in 1774: I have not seen one real gentleman, one well-bred man, since I came to town. At their entertainments there is no conversation that is agreeable; there is no modesty, no attention to one another. They talk very loud, very fast and altogether. If they ask you a question, before you can utter three words of your answer they will break out upon you again and talk away Then again, those who are pro-NYC argue that the city is only seen as unwelcoming because it is so cramped and offers hardly any space for privacy. However, another city beat out the Big Apple in a different roundup and it honestly might surprise you. A different kind of survey was released by Insurify and it based a city's rudeness off the temperaments of their drivers. Those who have the most aggressive people behind the wheel - as in those who gleefully cut people off or tailgate - managed to earn a spot on this recent roundup. Interestingly enough, despite the tangled mess that is New York City traffic, it failed to earn a mention on this list. Instead, the honor went to none other than Schenectady. According to Insurify: Despite having just over 67,000 residents, Schenectady greatly surpassed more populated New York cities with a 120% higher rate of rude driving violations than the state average. Schenectady is the only city that appeared on last year’s list as well. Schenectady was found to have one of the highest percentages of drivers with violations on their record - with 1.93 percent, which is 120 percent higher than the state average.
