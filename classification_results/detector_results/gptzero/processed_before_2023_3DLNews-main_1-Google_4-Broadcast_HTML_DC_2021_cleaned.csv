ANSWER: Yes. The Verify team looked through a pair of databases that track presidential executive orders. They showed that President Biden issued 22 executive orders in his first week, along with many presidential proclamations and memorandums. This compares to four executive orders issued in President Trump\'s first week, five by President Obama, and zero by President George W. Bush. SOURCES: Process: Since taking office, President Joe Biden has signed a flurry of executive orders. Many of these actions were reversals of President Trump\'s policies. Others were meant to set a new tone in Washington. The swift action has prompted praise from those on the left, and ire from those on the right. Many critics have posted to social media that they are upset by the unilateral action. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, tweeted criticism on President Biden\'s executive orders. 30 executive orders and actions signed in only 3 days\' time. @POTUS, you can\'t govern with a pen and a phone. The Verify team looked into the numbers, to find out if Biden\'s pace of executive orders have differed from past administrations. The Federal Register tracks executive orders since President Bill Clinton, whereas The American Presidency Project tracks executive orders since President John Quincy Adams. The Verify team also looked through the list of presidential actions, listed on the White House website. Here were the results for the last eight administrations: The data also shows that President Joe Biden has started out at a pace that is far faster than recent administrations.

RELATED: Inauguration Day 2021: Biden enters White House for 1st time as president President Donald Trump\'s White House had all but abandoned the practice of briefing reporters daily, taking an oftentimes openly combative tone with the news media. Sean Spicer, who was Trump’s first press secretary, set the tenor four years ago by claiming that the audience at Trump’s inauguration was the largest in history, despite photographic evidence to the contrary. Trump’s final press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, had called some White House journalists ""activists,"" and refused to call on them during contentious briefings. Psaki said Wednesday that she will bring truth and transparency to the White House briefing room, a clear reference to her predecessors under Trump. Psaki answered questions from reporters on a range of subjects during the briefing — from Biden’s foreign travel plans to the president’s stance on the Senate impeachment trial of Trump. Psaki said Biden will allow Congress to decide the way forward on the impeachment trial, and that the president believes members of the Senate should figure out how to proceed with a trial that could consume the opening weeks of his presidency. Trump was impeached by the House last week on a charge of inciting an insurrection. It was his second impeachment, though he was acquitted by the Senate in the first. Psaki said Wednesday that the Biden administration is instead focused on the pandemic and the economic crisis that have engulfed the country for nearly a year, noting that the Senate can handle multiple issues at once. On the foreign relations front, Psaki said Biden will call Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday, the first call with a foreign leader after his oath of office. Psaki said the subject of the call will be relations between the United States and Canada as well as the status of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, whose permitting Biden revoked in one of his first acts as president. Psaki said Biden’s first round of calls to foreign leaders will be with allies, adding that the new president plans to repair damaged global relationships. This story was reported from Los Angeles.
