Sites where the stickers can be purchased even suggest against putting names under figures on the decals, but many people just ignore the warning. Because of all the danger, police are now urging car owners to not put up stickers that give away personal information. The authorities also advise going even further and removing any parking passes that might hang from a rearview mirror when the car isn't parked in the lot it's required for. Additionally, the police warn against putting a child's name on their backpacks or clothing for the same reasons.""}]"
