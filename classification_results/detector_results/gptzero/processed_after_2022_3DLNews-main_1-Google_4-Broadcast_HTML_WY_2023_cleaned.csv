Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:39 am A semi-truck driver lost control on U.S. Highway 16 West and was seriously injured Oct. 5. The driver was hauling bentonite, which spilled during the wreck, blanketing the road and ravine. Bulletin photo courtesy of Jacob Link A man has survived an accident along U.S. Highway 16 West that ejected him from the cab of his semi-truck. The accident occurred near mile marker 86 on Oct. 5 when Ariel Crespo Sori, of Houston, Texas, lost control of his semi-truck that was carrying about 48,000 pounds of bentonite, according to Wyoming Highway Patrol Troop C Sgt. Louis Tegdesch. Dispatch received a call at 2:18 p.m. that an accident had occurred, Tegdesch said. Tegdesch said a witness driving behind the semi-truck reported Crespo Sori’s brakes were on fire as he was driving down the mountain. Crespo Sori bypassed the brake check area near Grouse Mountain, which all trucks are required to stop at. The truck eventually lost control and overturned just east of the Mosier Gulch trailhead. The bentonite spilled over the road and the truck ended up with its front axle over the lip of the guard rail near mile marker 86. Crespo Sori was ejected from the cab sometime after he lost control and ended up halfway down the hill off the side of the highway near the Clear Creek Trail. The driver was conscious when emergency services and law enforcement arrived on the scene. The exact cause of the truck’s loss of control is still under investigation, Tegdesch said. “The curve nearby 86 is a common spot for trucks to go off,” Tegdesch said. Crespo Sori was taken by ambulance to the Johnson County Healthcare Center before being airlifted to Banner Wyoming Medical Center in Casper. A highway patrol trooper in Casper has since interviewed Crespo Sori, who has no recollection of what happened during the accident. He was ticketed for reckless driving. No other vehicles were directly involved in the crash. U.S. Highway 16 West was closed from Buffalo to Deer Haven for nearly nine hours as crews cleaned up debris and removed the semi-truck.

Shakeel Kahn and his brother Nabeel Khan (that\'s how they spell their names) are scheduled for their six-week retrial on Nov. 6, according to federal court documents. Shakeel Kahn, a pain management physician, was arrested in late November 2016 and he and his wife were initially charged with one count of conspiracy to distribute oxycodone. More charges were added. Shakeel Kahn and Nabeel Khan were found guilty of numerous crimes in a trial in Casper in May 2019. They were sentenced in August 2019. Nabeel received a 15-year, one-month sentence for conspiracy to distribute oxycodone and other drugs, plus a consecutive five-year sentence for possessing a firearm during a drug-trafficking crime. Shakeel received a 25-year-sentence for drug distribution resulting in death, plus a consecutive five-year sentence for possessing a firearm during a drug-trafficking crime. The Wyoming U.S. Attorney had asked for a life sentence. Through a series of appeals, the last of which was combined with the case of another doctor, Kahn had his case overturned. The court dealt with the question of when or if doctors legitimately prescribing painkillers such as oxycodone shifted at some point to their supporting addiction, and when or if they knew that.

The federal law says ""... it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally -- "" ""to manufacture, distribute, or dispense ... a controlled substance...."" The Supreme Court then sent the case back to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled unanimously in February that the jury instructions used terms about whether Kahn acted ""in good faith"" are impermissible because they referred to the mental state of a ""hypothetical \'reasonable\' doctor, not on the mental state of the defendant So the trial will return to Wyoming where it started. Even though the only issue is about the jury instruction, the entire case must be re-tried, hence scheduling it for six weeks. Monday, the attorneys for Shakeel Kahn and Nabeel Khan met with federal prosecutors and U.S. District Judge Alan Johnson for a status conference to resolve other pre-trial details. Those matters include previous pre-trial rulings; discovery procedures and deadlines; disclosures of evidence to each side; pre-trial filing deadlines including a joint status report and a possible plea agreement; proposed jury instructions, verdict forms and void dire questions; and witness and exhibit lists. =========================The verdict in May 2019 ended a three-year investigation after the Wyoming Board of Pharmacy had questions about Shakeel Kahn\'s apparent prescribing high amounts and doses of painkillers that seemed to be outside the usual standard of care. Federal and state law enforcement agencies took over in the spring of 2016. Prosecutors filed an initial criminal complaint against defendant Paul Beland in November 2016. The crimes from January 2011 through November 2016 comprised the heart of the first count of the 23-count indictment with the Kahn brothers and three other co-conspirators -- Shakeel\'s wife Lyn, Shawnna Thacker and Beland. Those three co-conspirators pleaded guilty to this and other charges in exchange for testifying for the prosecution and reduced sentences. Included in the conspiracy count for Shakeel Kahn and Nabeel Khan was the charge that their distribution of those drugs resulted in the death of Arizona resident Jessica Burch in 2015. The other crime with the stiffest penalty facing Shakeel Kahn was operating a continuing criminal enterprise, conviction of which was punishable by 20 years to life imprisonment. The indictment also named five counts of dispensing oxycodone, three counts of possession with intent to distribute oxycodone and aid and abet, six counts of unlawful use of a communication facility, three counts of dispensing oxycodone and aid and abet, and two counts of money laundering.'}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:39 am A multi-agency, multi-year poaching case that resulted in three individuals paying more than $137,000 in fines and restitution has ended with a Florida man pleading guilty to taking big game out of season and wanton destruction of big game in Campbell and Johnson counties. The plea agreements between Florida resident Jeb Rou and county attorneys in Campbell and Johnson counties were approved in November, ending a multi-year investigation by Wyoming Game and Fish Department law enforcement officers. The investigation began in December 2019 after North Gillette game warden Kristen Strom responded to a poaching call from an anonymous tipster. The reporting party informed a local landowner that a deer had been shot and he saw three individuals hiding the deer on the landowner’s property. Later that night, with help from the landowner, Strom caught Gillette resident Eric Sorensen and Georgia resident Justin Price attempting to retrieve the illegally killed deer. Rou fled the scene and was not apprehended. As the investigation continued, multiple wildlife violations for all three suspects were discovered dating to December 2018, including eight buck mule deer and one bull elk taken out of season or wantonly destroyed. Evidence showed the majority of violations occurred at night with Rou, Price and Sorensen using thermal imaging rifle scopes and spotlights to find and poach mule deer and elk in Campbell and Johnson counties. However, in one daytime poaching instance, the trio shot and killed a buck mule deer in a Gillette subdivision, shooting long distance over a church playground, two roads and two homes. The animal was left to waste. The investigation also uncovered wildlife violations in six other states, some of which were past those states’ statute of limitations and so could not be charged. “There is not a statute of limitations for wildlife crime committed in Wyoming, so we were able to charge all three suspects with several of their poaching crimes even though some occurred several years ago,” said Strom. As violations were discovered during the investigation, Price and Sorensen made multiple court appearances in 2020 and 2021 in Campbell County. Sorensen received $15,640 in fines and had his hunting, fishing and trapping privileges suspended for 20 years. He also served 30 days in jail. Price received $40,165 in fines and had his hunting, fishing and trapping privileges suspended for 23 years. He also served 30 days in jail. Although Rou had returned to Florida in December 2019, Strom and Wyoming Game and Fish Department investigators worked with Campbell County prosecutors to issue nationwide extraditable warrants for Rou. After three years, Rou was apprehended in January 2023 following a high speed vehicle pursuit with officers in Florida. He was arrested and extradited back to Wyoming by the Campbell County Sheriff’s Office on wildlife warrants. “Wyoming has extradited suspects from surrounding states for wildlife crimes before, but never from across the country,” said Strom. “This case really sets a precedent. If you poach in Wyoming, you will be held responsible for those crimes, regardless of where you live.” In November 2023, Rou agreed to plea agreements for taking big game out of season and wanton destruction of big game in Campbell and Johnson counties. He received a total of $31,505.80 in fines and his hunting, fishing and trapping privileges were suspended for 27 years. He also recently completed a 60-day jail sentence in the Campbell County Detention Center. Rou, Price and Sorensen will also jointly pay $50,000 in restitution for the wildlife they killed. “This case came to a successful conclusion thanks to help from officers with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks,” said Strom. “We also appreciate the support of Campbell and Johnson county prosecutors, and particularly the Campbell County Sheriff’s Office, which worked hard to extradite Rou back to Wyoming to face these wildlife charges. But most importantly, we are thankful for the anonymous member of the public who reported the initial violation, which allowed us to begin this investigation.” As required by state statute, the fines in these cases will be distributed to the public school fund in the counties where the violations occurred. As required by state statute, restitution in these cases will be deposited into a Wyoming Game and Fish Department account that is used to purchase access easements to public and private land. Wyoming and 48 other states participate in the Interstate Wildlife Violator Compact. If a person loses hunting or fishing privileges in one state, the revocation is also in effect in all other partner states. Tips and information about suspected wildlife violations can be provided online through the Wyoming Game and Fish website at wgfd.wyo.gov or by calling 1-877-WGFD-TIP (1-877-943-3847).

Wyoming is second to Montana for gun ownership (by a fraction of a percent: 66.30 percent of Montana households have a gun; 66.20 percent of Wyoming households do). Wyoming also ranks fourth in the nation for the highest gun death rate. Firearms were used in 75 percent of Wyoming suicides, according to the Wyoming Department of Health, and in 2021, 155 people died by firearm in Wyoming, a 26 percent death rate, according to the Centers for Disease Control. In a gun-loving state, safety is key. Psychology teacher at Laramie High School Corey Scimeca said she thinks one reason guns and suicide in the state are correlative is due to “The relaxed attitude about having loaded guns in the household. So many people have loaded firearms that are not secured. Guns are the most lethal way of suicide; if a person has access to guns and is suicidal it is more likely they will complete suicide.” The Firearms Research Center (FRC) at the University of Wyoming College of Law is combatting these statistics with its new website dedicated to suicide awareness and prevention. The FRC partnered with the Cheyenne Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Walk the Talk America to create a page for gun safety information and a mental health directory. “The suicide crisis is devastating families across the nation, and the Firearms Research Center is committed to doing our part to raise awareness and provide resources to the public,” said FRC Executive Director Ashley Hlebinsky in UW’s news release this week. “Through this webpage, the FRC hopes to educate those who own, use, sell, and/or rent firearms about safe handling and storage practices, as well as encourage efforts to prevent suicide involving firearms.” FRC Director George Mocsary said, “As we recognize September as Suicide Prevention Month, we hope this new online hub will educate, empower, and, ultimately, help save a life.” To access the new suicide awareness and prevention site, visit the page here.'}]"
