Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 1:19 pm Digital Editor, Investigative Reporter Mobile’s largest home service repair company and its owner were stripped of their heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) credentials in September 2021 after state inspectors uncovered a bevy of regulatory violations in work done at residential homes. Known for its wrapped trucks and signature cartoon repairman, C&P Hansen Heating and Air was founded in 2006 by owner Chadrick Setchell and has grown to service residential and commercial accounts in Mobile and Baldwin counties and the Mississippi coast. The company has also expanded over the years to provide electrical and plumbing work. According to interviews with various business blogs, Setchell has 30 years in the HVAC industry and began Hansen with one white truck and $100 in his pocket. As recently as February, he interviewed with a video blog and indicated Hansen was generating “$50 million a year.” But on Sept. 15, 2021, the 12-member Alabama Board of Heating, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Contractors voted unanimously to revoke both Hansen and Setchell of their HVAC licenses, citing numerous service standard violations and severe infractions, which were discovered during a string of investigations into complaints from customers during 2020. However, despite the action, Hansen’s services have been able to continue without a hiccup over the last two months as ownership and structural changes were made to the company. A day prior to being slapped with the penalty (Sept. 14, 2021), Air Pros USA, based out of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, announced it had bought-out Hansen’s air conditioning service branch and the company’s HVAC license is now registered under another employee’s name. According to a press release by Air Pros, the terms of the acquisition allow Hansen to continue to operate under its brand name and retain Setchell in leadership as the head of Air Pros’ Gulf Coast operations. Air Pros said the acquisition expands the company to a seven-state enterprise and doubles its footprint, providing the company with an additional 350 vehicles, 500 technicians and staff, and a customer base of more than 100,000. “Hansen’s strong market presence and positive reputation along the Gulf Coast made them a perfect fit to join the Air Pros family as we continue to expand and acquire additional HVAC companies across the U.S.,” Anthony Perera, founder of Air Pros USA said. “They are well run and we see even greater growth opportunities for Hansen as we apply our technology to increase their efficiency and value to both customers and employees.” Perera added, “We are excited that Chad will stay on to run our Gulf Coast operations, and that we will be adding Hansen’s many talented technicians and staff to our platform. We love how Hansen Air refers to them as ‘Super Techs’ as that’s how we see them as well.” Setchell said he was thrilled to have Hansen join the Air Pros family and is looking forward to continuing to grow the business in the region. “Air Pros has quickly earned a fantastic reputation for innovation, hard work and providing each customer with quality services and lasting results,” Setchell said. “We knew Air Pros would be a great fit as they share the same goals and culture regarding how they care for their customers, and in how they demonstrate their respect toward employees in helping them grow professionally and personally.” State business license records show the company was reformed as “Hansen Air Pros” in Delaware in November 2020 and qualified for operation on Aug. 26, 2021. Its principal address is listed as Hollywood, Florida. Hansen and Setchell are the only HVAC licensees to be revoked this year, according to Jeffrey Becraft, executive director of the Alabama Board of Heating, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Contractors agency. Becraft told Lagniappe license revocations are not common. “In general, we rarely revoke more than two, if any, annually,” Becraft said. “The size of the company is not a factor in the board’s decision.” Becraft was asked about the acquisition of Hansen and its implications for licensing. He said he could not speak for Air Pros or Setchell as to what the intentions were upon the sale of the company. “The board does not hold jurisdiction over the hiring process and administrative roles within Air Pros’ corporate umbrella,” Becraft said. While Setchell is maintaining leadership in the company, its HVAC credentials will no longer be in his name. According to licensing records, Hansen Air Pros LLC’s HVAC contractor certification was registered to Hansen General Manager Greg Roberts on Aug. 30, 2021, ahead of Air Pros’ acquisition and the state’s sanctions in September 2021. In a statement to Lagniappe, Air Pros dismissed concerns Hansen’s prior discipline by the the Alabama regulatory board would reflect on its future services to the region. “Air Pros USA has its own license to operate, and we have no need for Mr. Setchell’s prior license,” a company spokesperson said. The spokesperson noted Hansen has 2,500 reviews with an average 4.8-star rating. “Regardless, as with all Air Pros USA acquisitions, we take and introduce best practices from all of our operations. This is to ensure our policies and practices are consistent nationally and that we uphold our company ethos that ‘our customers are our business,’” the spokesperson stated. “[We] look for markets where we see a lot of value. We see a lot of value in Alabama, which led to the Hansen acquisition, and we’re thrilled to now be part of the community.” Setchell told Lagniappe the acquisition was a year in the making when it was finally announced in September 2021. He said Air Pros brought “massive” changes in a short period of time to internal operations, customer service and quality control. He said the purchasing company is essentially a franchise and allows Hansen to maintain all of its team members while providing an even better work environment. According to Setchell, Hansen hit a two- to three-year window where there were so many A/C units being sold and installed he lost control of the company’s ability to provide quality control. “It came down to the point where I had over-extended my skill set and business got way bigger than I was able to manage. It grew so fast I lost control of it. It was completely and utterly overwhelming,” Setchell said. “We installed a lot of units and made a lot of mistakes.” Setchell said even though he did not personally work on houses where violations were found, as the owner he was the one on the hook. “The state board had to do what they had to do,” Hansen said. Air Pros will honor viable warranties on labor done by Hansen, Setchell said. He said if consumers are concerned about standard violations on heating and air conditioning work done by Hansen they should let the company know. SETCHELL-revocation-PS-order-and-amended-recommendation_0001 Disciplinary records detailing the state HVAC Board’s case against Hansen and Setchell detail four cascading consumer complaint investigations into heating and air conditioning installation work performed by Hansen. These investigations by a state inspector found 61 minimum standard violations and six life-safety violations. Setchell admitted to the violations during a June 24, 2021, hearing with the HVAC oversight agency and “acknowledged his mistakes and subjected himself to discipline from the board.” Records signed and handed down by an administrative law judge state Setchell “believes he has improved since the last time he was disciplined by the board, noting fewer life-safety violations.” On Aug. 28, 2019, Setchell entered into a settlement from three previous complaints.

Na Rin An hits her tee shot on the 10th hole during the final round of the LPGA Q-Series at Highland Oaks on Sunday. An won the event and received her LPGA Tour card. Sophie Hausmann hits a bunker shot on the 18th green during the final round of the LPGA Q-Series at Highland Oaks in December. Pauline Roussin-Bouchard of France finished second in the LPGA Q-Series tournament held at Highland Oaks in December. There were lots of emotions – some tears of disappointment, some tears of joy. Forty-six golfers earned LPGA Tour status for the 2022 season at the conclusion of the Q-Series Tournament at Highland Oaks in Dothan on Sunday. Karis Davidson of Australia survived by one stroke, shooting her worst round of the two-week tournament with a 5-over-par 77 on Sunday and then had to wait quite a while to find out if she would be among those earning a card as others finished their rounds. In the end, all was good. “It was pretty nerve-racking, definitely,” Davidson said. “It’s been a very tough year, so it’s really rewarding and I’m very excited for what’s to come.” Davidson had five bogeys on the first nine holes before calming down and finishing out with pars the remainder of the round. “I don’t think I really thought about it, but deep down I believe there were a lot of emotions,” Davidson said of the pressure going into the last 18 holes. “I got it together after nine holes, which was good.” On this day, whether a golfer finished first – as did Na Rin An of Korea after shooting a sizzling final round 66, or Davidson and five others who tied for the final spots – they all achieved their goal of earning an LPGA card. While the top 45 players and ties in the 74-player field earned LPGA status, those finishing outside of the top 20 and ties also received 2022 Symetra Tour status, which is the developmental tour of the LPGA. It was a two-week tournament played on two Robert Trent Jones Trail golf courses, the first four rounds at Magnolia Grove in Mobile and the final four in Dothan. The scores were cumulative. Haylee Harford of Leavittsburg, Ohio, secured her spot with a final round 73 to tie for 32nd and took photos with her boyfriend, who served as her caddie this week, and parents before all those earning their cards posed on a green for a group picture. “It’s a dream come true, honestly,” Harford said. “I’ve played on the Symetra Tour the last two years, so to get LPGA status is what I’ve been working towards so I’m so excited.” “I was really happy with how I played last week, and this week I think the course is a little challenging and I told myself if you can just stay consistent, that’s going to be good.” Finishing second behind An by one stroke at 32-under-par for the eight rounds was Pauline Roussin-Bouchard of France, who led the first seven rounds. She had a double-bogey on 13 and a bogey on 17 to finish at even-par for the day. Former University of Alabama standout and Huntsville native Janie Jackson wrapped up a strong tournament with a 69 to finish in sixth place at 19-under par. The full leaderboard can be viewed on www.lpga.com and www.symetratour.com Kathy Lawrence, the tournament director from the LPGA, was pleased with how everything ran at the two RTJ sites. “The hospitality has been fantastic,” Lawrence said. “We’re going to take a deep breath, we’re going to exhale and enjoy it. You can see we have some lovely ladies who are pretty darn happy as well as our staff.” Visit Dothan CEO and president Aaron McCreight is in hopes the success of the tournament will be a springboard to future events with the LPGA. “This is something we can use on our resume as a destination, as a course, to say, ‘Look, we’ve hosted the finale of Q-Series, let’s do this again, let’s bring this back, what else is out there for the PGA,’” McCreight said. “We’ve never hosted anything at this level with the LPGA before, so hopefully this opens the door to show them what is possible here.” McCreight says the feedback he’s received from LPGA officials this week has been positive. “They’ve been thoroughly happy,” McCreight said. “I mean, when you think about the delays with the fog and the rain … this team here at Highland Oaks just worked their tails off all week to make this click. We only got three holes behind on one day. That’s incredible.” Get local news delivered to your inbox! Get up-to-the-minute news sent straight to your device.'}]"

Are we living in a rainforest now? Is this still even Alabama? In my first job out of college I have distinct memories of doing stories about drought levels and burn bans during the summer in Alabama. Not this year! Everything just feels sodden and soggy. The old song says gray skies are gonna clear up, but my rendition of “Rain, rain, go away, come again another day,” doesn’t seem to be sinking in. Well, that’s not totally true. The “come again another day” part is being heard loud and clear, apparently. You’ve hit rock bottom – or, perhaps, the muddy, squishy, puddle-filled bottom – when you’re writing about the weather. It’s not really any better than small talk about the weather. And yet, here we are. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not blind to the benefits of good, hearty rainfall. After all, I’m certainly not saying the danger of wildfires and crushing drought was a better scenario than the one we’re in now – not at all. A nice steady downpour is a special kind of pleasure to enjoy, in addition to being good for our planet. Not to mention, my air conditioner sure has an easier time keeping my house cool when it’s not 112 degrees outside, when the sun isn’t beating down on my windows. That’s nice for the electric bill, too. So there’s a definitely upside to this rainy summer. It’s just that I don’t know about you – but I could do with a little sunshine.'}]"

Read more | Add your comment By Rebekah Yancey Email the author Published 8:40 pm Sunday, March 21, 2021 The Morgan County Sheriff’s Office recently launched a new initiative in an effort to resolve some of the county’s “substantial” number of outstanding warrants: Wanted Wednesday, a social media campaign that shares information about those warrants. “We launched Wanted Wednesday to encourage those with warrants to turn themselves in and to ask for tips from the public on locating the individuals,” PIO Mike Swafford said. “The goal is to allow the justice system to move forward.” Two weeks into the campaign, Swafford said 70 percent of the warrants have been executed, three have turned themselves, and 13 arrests have been made. Wanted Wednesday is happening on Facebook, where the Morgan County Sheriff’s Office has a following of nearly 45,000 and a weekly reach between 100,000–250,000. Swafford said there are consistently 100,000 warrants throughout the county for various violations, from simple traffic violations to major felonies. “Warrants don’t go away unless they are executed, so we have well over 100,000 at any time,” he said. Swafford said social media allows the sheriff’s office to relay public safety information while also connecting with citizens. “We focus on giving consistent, accurate information so the public can make the best decision for themselves,” he said. “In turn, we use it to listen to what the public is concerned about in their area. We read every comment, message, tweet and tip.” Wanted Wednesday is not the first citizen-based campaign the MCSO has used. In 2019, the office launched TipLink with the goal of giving the community a way to share their concerns and information. Swafford said since TipLink’s inception, the MCSO has received 583 tips and has been able to take action on 273. “No one knows a neighborhood or street better than those who live there,” he said. “Their tips allow us to have additional insight that allows us to know what is going on and where to focus our efforts.” The office has a Most Wanted section on its website with 175 people listed. According to the sheriff’s office, it will not contact anyone by phone or ask for funds to satisfy a warrant, which is a common phone scam. Mariann Acardi contributed to this report.'}]"

Hospital ambulances to operate in the city, but the hospital’s CEO on Friday said the hospital may seek a city license to expand its ambulance operations due to concerns that First Response’s service is inadequate. “I want the citizens here to have the best ambulance service possible,” hospital CEO Kelli Powers said Friday. “Just think about it, when you call 911, you need to know that truck is on its way. I’m not sure that’s happening today.” She said the Huntsville Hospital System would have to approve it, as would the Decatur City Council, “but we are willing to” apply for the certificate of public necessity and convenience needed to establish permanent ambulance operations in the city. The hospital began running ambulances after Feb. 1, when the City Council passed a COVID-related resolution authorizing Decatur Morgan Hospital “temporarily and based on the critical situation at this time” to transport patients to and from other Huntsville Hospital System facilities. The resolution expressly states that the hospital’s ambulances may not be dispatched by Morgan County 911 on emergency or non-emergency calls “except as required in the event of a mutual aid or mass casualty event,” but they have begun taking 911 calls when First Response has no ambulances available. Powers said she requested the transport authorization because during the pandemic First Response was unable to quickly transport patients out of the hospital, which meant there was no hospital space to admit new patients. First Response fought against the resolution at the time and continues to oppose it because it reduces the number of non-emergency transports it handles. Transports tend to be more lucrative than emergency calls because many emergency calls involve uninsured patients. At a City Council meeting last week, First Response director David Childers said the COVID-19 crisis that was the reason for allowing hospital ambulances to make transports has ended, noting that the Alabama state of emergency has expired. First Response had a monopoly on the city’s ambulance service until Decatur Morgan Hospital began the transports. “We would like to formally ask that this (Feb. 1 resolution) be rescinded so we can go back to business as normal, have our full staffing and continue to provide service for the city,” Childers said. Decatur officials, however, responded that the city is increasingly dependent upon hospital ambulances because First Response frequently has too few ambulances to respond to emergency and non-emergency calls. Missed calls Decatur Fire & Rescue Chief Tracy Thornton said First Response often misses multiple calls a day, forcing Morgan County 911 to call other ambulance services, including the hospital’s, to respond to emergency calls. Thornton said patients have had to wait several hours for a response to an ambulance call when First Response has too few units in operation. EMS Coordinator Ashley England said First Response is having to “zero out” frequently, meaning it is unable to respond to a call. The company has been running two or three ambulances in a day when six or seven usually provide city coverage, England said. “Between June 21 and June 29, they rolled 11 calls,” England said, meaning 911 dispatched a different ambulance service because First Response was not able to respond. “That’s a lot.” Thornton said First Response zeroed out 13 calls on June 26. He said other ambulance services picked up some of these calls or there were long waits for First Response to become available and respond. Some of those “rolled calls” are going to Decatur Morgan Hospital’s ambulances, according to Powers, who said she was contacted by city EMS personnel asking that the hospital accept calls when First Response fails to respond. “What happens now is that if First Response can’t respond, it rolls to Lifeguard (Ambulance, which serves much of Morgan County outside Decatur). If they can’t respond it rolls to us,” Powers said. “I don’t think we can get out of that unless First Response steps up to the plate. ""We are going ahead with the full 911 service so we can help the city with this.” While the city’s ambulance ordinance generally requires all ambulances to have a certificate of public necessity and convenience (CPNC), which only First Response has, it creates an exception for a “major emergency when the ambulances authorized to operate in the city by CPNC are either insufficient in number or inadequate for any other reason as determined by the (Decatur Fire & Rescue) chief or EMS coordinator.” Powers said Decatur Morgan Hospital has four operational ambulances, all of them equipped as advanced life support units. Three of them are older units donated by other hospitals in the Huntsville Hospital System, but Decatur Morgan bought a new truck two to three weeks ago that is in service and accepting 911 calls not handled by First Response. First Response had only two emergency ambulances in service on Thursday and two non-emergency vehicles in operation, Thornton said. \'Poaching our employees\' Childers said First Response is having a problem with Huntsville Hospital and other ambulance services “poaching our employees. It’s very difficult for a private company to pay $20 an hour.” England said the employee problem is the only reason Childers has given for the high number of rolled calls. Powers said Decatur Morgan Hospital has been hiring ambulance staff, ""but I don’t think we have very many First Response employees hired as of today. Now that doesn’t mean they haven’t applied.” Assistant City Attorney Chip Alexander said First Response could be penalized under the city ordinance for a rolled call by counting the call against the requirement that an ambulance must respond and reach the call scene of 90% of the emergency calls within eight minutes in the city limits and 12 minutes in the police jurisdiction. However, enforcement of the response-time requirements is in limbo. Morgan County 911 is switching to a new system and that switch is into its third month of implementation. The new system is not yet tracking response times for First Response. Morgan 911 also doesn’t track the number of rolled calls and there isn’t a penalty under the ordinance when First Response says it can’t respond to a call, England said. Childers said he sent two complaints to the Alabama Department of Public Health’s Office of EMS against Decatur Morgan Hospital for allegedly running emergency calls without the proper license. The Daily could not confirm the complaints were filed. England said he’s aware of one of the complaints, which the city dismissed as not valid. The hospitals’ critical care truck was being repaired so it had to use an ambulance not certified for critical care to transport a patient to UAB Hospital. “The truck had a special (critical care) crew that was sent by a physician,” England said. Thornton said First Response’s second complaint came after the hospital ran a call in Decatur. Again, Fire Department officials didn’t think it was valid because the hospital\'s ambulance was called in after a patient was held up too long waiting for an ambulance. “They had to wait for hours,” Thornton said. Powers said complaints from Childers and First Response are not unusual. “He’s called the state on many occasions on us, and so far they’ve all been unsubstantiated,” she said. In the meantime, changes in the city ordinance that were recommended by the Ambulance Regulatory Board two months ago have not been presented to the City Council for consideration. Some of the recommended changes include eliminating the required performance bond, increasing the amount of time an ambulance has to respond to emergency calls in the city and the police jurisdiction and a reduction in the fine amounts. Alexander said he is working on making the recommended changes to the ordinance before he presents them to the council. Council President Jacob Ladner said he hopes those recommendations will be presented at Monday’s work session so the council can consider them on July 19. — bayne.hughes@decaturdaily.com or 256-340-2432.

Rainfall near a quarter of an inch. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 1:19 pm Dr. Andrew Hodges, of HealthPointe Primary Care, takes a moment to talk about COVID, masks and vaccinations. Dr. Andrew Hodges takes a moment between patients at HealthPointe Primary Care to attempt to ease the minds of folks concerned with COVID. “The delta variant is certainly circulating,” said Hodges. “It seems quite a bit more contagious than the “OG” virus (we call it the “wild type”) on the order of two-to-three times more communicable.” Hodges adds that the good news is it seems to be no more deadly than the wild type. “In fact, looking at worldwide data, it seems to slightly, but significantly, less deadly,” he said. “Again, though, there is a danger gradient.” He said it affects the older population in terms of its severity. Sixty years old and older seem to be the high-risk group, especially with comorbid conditions like obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes. “This is in contrast to the 18 and younger population, where there are still less deaths due to COVID than the 2017-2018 flu season,” said Hodges. Masks Hodges said he’s spent the last few days doing a massive literature review regarding masks, and the results are mixed, at best. His study comes a week after the Scottsboro City Board of Education voted down a mask mandate in the school system. “Suffice it to say, there is absolutely no data that fully supports mask mandates, especially in schools,” said Hodges. “Obviously, masks are some benefit in healthcare settings. However, there simply is no consistent data that mask mandates make any difference whatsoever, at least any difference above optional mask wearing.” Hodges said his opinion on masks is the traditional viewing still holds strong. “If you have symptoms, wear a mask out in public if you can’t stay home,” he said. “If you are taking care of someone sick, wearing one won’t hurt, but don’t be surprised if you get the illness, too, even while wearing a mask.” Vaccinations Hodges said vaccinations are great, highly effective in preventing severe disease and death. “This has truly become a pandemic of the unvaccinated people who have never had COVID,” he said. “If you are 45 and above, I highly recommend getting this. If you are 20-45, I suggest doing a personal risk calculation with your physician to see if the vaccination is right for you, weighing risks and benefits.” Hodges added that if you have never had COVID and you don’t have any problems with vaccinations, it’s not a bad idea to get the vaccine. “There is not a small amount of controversy over kids getting the vaccine,” said Hodges. “Many physicians say ‘absolutely,’ while others have some reservations. For example, the rate of myocarditis (heart inflammation) is around one in every 5,000 kids vaccinated. While that is rare, it’s not so rare that you need to discredit it. I personally do not practice pediatrics, so I leave that to the professionals of that field, including family medicine, to give the final recommendations on that.” Hodges said he doesn’t believe the lockdowns a year ago were helpful, adding they were more harmful. “If you look at the states who had hardcore lockdowns vs. ‘open’ states, the age-matched data shows the lockdowns disproportionately affected poor people,” he said. “Poor people in lockdown states fared far worse not only in COVID-related illness, but also economically. This is contrast to, for example, Florida where COVID-related illness and economic hardship was, believe it or not, spread rather equally amongst the socioeconomic classes.” Hodges said he truly believes we are reaching herd immunity. “I do not believe we need to cower in fear, but I also believe we need to be wise,” he said. “If you are having symptoms, call your doctor, wear a mask around others, wash your hands and stay hydrated. If you are positive, there are early treatment options available. If you are negative, well then, Roll Tide. Wear a mask if you want, don’t if you don’t want to, unless you have symptoms.” Hodges asks people not to engage in vaccine and mask shaming. “We don’t need that level of divisiveness in our community,” he said. “Please show a little grace for the hesitancy of people to not engage in certain behaviors; we often don’t know their hearts or minds, unless they bless us with all that information on Facebook, which is often the case.” Hodges said what people do medically is supposed to be kept in private. “It is no more respectful or loving to outright ask someone about his/her vaccine status than it is to ask about anything else medically in his life,” he said.” Log In Keep it Clean.

One of Birmingham’s brightest entrepreneurs, Otulana sold his company Therapy Brands for $1.2 billion in May. Otulana joined the Alabama EnergyTech Accelerator for its “founder stories” series, sharing the story of his company, how founders can navigate the challenges of the startup journey and his vision for growth in Birmingham. In 1998, Otulana moved to Birmingham from Lagos, Nigeria, to attend the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where he studied engineering and management information systems. He registered his first computer software company, Zertis, in 2004, not long after graduating, eventually going full time in 2011 before founding TheraNest in 2013. Otulana served as founder and CEO of TheraNest and its parent company, Therapy Brands, a leading provider of software solutions for mental and behavioral health providers. As of May, Therapy Brands served more than 28,000 practices nationwide. Otulana shared how he recognized a need for those providing mental and behavioral health services, and those needing those services, to be treated with the same dignity as those involved in other areas of health care. His commitment to helping provide a solution is evident in Otulana’s advice. “When it comes to growth, first think of the core of your business, the value, the mission. That core mission is what you build people around, and people build a company,” Otulana said. “Take that core and translate it outside to how you can engineer a high rate of acceleration around your product.” This slideshow requires JavaScript. As far as product development, Otulana shared how he values the innovation process. “Find a way to build quality products and your brand. You have to have this experiment iteration. In doing that you find when something works; then you double down on it.” In addition to talking with founders about how he navigated building a team, managing work and personal priorities, Otulana also offered guidance on focusing time and feedback. “There is going to be a lot of distraction. As a founder, you just have to be mechanical in how you get feedback. You will have a lot of people telling you how to do things,” Otulana said. “Prioritize filling your calendar with conversations with people you will sell to. These will help you hear the voice of customers, gain insights to the industry and give you outputs to create your product.” Otulana is now focused on elevating local founders and supporting the Birmingham startup scene with his new venture, Harmony Venture Labs. Founder stories are an integral component of the Techstars accelerator model. At Techstars accelerators across the country, serial entrepreneurs are invited to speak to cohorts about how they built their companies and the lessons learned along the way. As part of the founder stories series, members of the Alabama EnergyTech Accelerator will have the chance to learn from local entrepreneurs sharing honestly about their own journeys to success. “No matter what type of business you have, we all have common battles that we fight as founders,” said Nate Schmidt, managing director, Techstars Alabama EnergyTech Accelerator. “Being able to invite successful startup founders to our space to share the battles that they have fought and overcome is critical to the success of our program.” The Alabama EnergyTech Accelerator’s rigorous program is well underway since the second class was announced in mid-September. Ten startups from across the nation and Canada are actively engaging with mentors across Alabama this month to enhance the future of energy. For more information, visit the Alabama EnergyTech Accelerator program page at www.techstars.com. The story appeared originally on the alabamanewscenter.com website.'}]"

north shelby county September 21, 2021 By Emily Williams-Robertshaw The Homewood Board of Zoning Adjustments approved two variances needed for owners Clayton and Rachel Mobley to begin construction and restoration of the historical Pink House property. The exceptions allowed in the Sept. 2 meeting were a height variance for an addition to the home and pool variance. “We sincerely thank the BZA for their favorable decision tonight, as well as the citizens of Homewood for their kind support and solidarity which carried us through to this joyful outcome,” the Mobleys, who plan to live in the house, said in a released statement. “We are so grateful to live in our wonderful community that cares about historic structures and listens to the will of the people. We eagerly look forward to getting started on our restoration efforts to preserve the extraordinary history of this property that is beloved by our family and this community.” Plans to restore the property and build an addition required the owners to obtain two variances, both of which were rejected by the board in June. The owners’ legal representative, Bob Fowlkes, presented an adjusted plan on Sept. 2 to the board as well as detailed explanations and answers to questions raised at the last meeting. The adjusted plan includes dropping the requested height variance from an increase of 11.5 feet to 9.4 feet. In addition, the new plan features a pool that has been reduced in size by more than 15%. The presentation also included the submission of signed affidavits from the Mobleys addressing board members’ concerns. Some of the highlighted portions of the statements included assurance that the Mobleys would maintain the property as their private residence and would not rent it to the public as an event venue. In addition, trees and other vegetation on the side of the property along Roseland Drive will be maintained, with more trees planted so that the pool will not be visible from Roseland or Edgewood Boulevard. The debate over renovating the Pink House has been going on for almost three years. The city had approved a former property owner’s plan to demolish the house and build five new houses on the property. Public outcry was quick and a plan to raise money to save the house was launched. But the situation was resolved when a private owner purchased the house. The Mobleys purchased the home in 2020. The house was built in 1921 by Georges and Eleanor Bridges, socialites and artists.

KMMG is providing more than 30 truckloads of dirt, and Takco is having it taken to a site on Higgins Street, where it is being spread over adjoining lots and compacted by a sheepsfoot roller. The dirt is being removed from the Kia pad where a new parking lot is being built. “We want to thank Kia and Takco for helping us with this,” said Mayor Steve Tramell. “They have the men and equipment to handle such projects and get it done super fast. It would have taken us much longer if we had gotten small contractors to do it.” Takco had four large dump trucks running constantly, hauling in big loads of dirt from what once was the Grady Webb Farm. The dirt will allow the sites of CFCP Homes No. 65 and 66 to be several feet above the curb. Each lot will be 26 feet wide and 44 feet deep. The homes will be built the week of October 3-10. A group of 17 people from the Bunkertown Brethren Church of McAlisterville, Pennsylvania will be heading up the project. Lots of local volunteers will be assisting. “I am so excited about how it’s coming together,” said CFCP Executive Director Kim Roberts. “This past week we went to Tupelo, Mississippi, where Eight Days of Hope donated the shingles, flooring, tubs and light fixtures for the two new homes. We thank them so much for helping us. We also thank Phil Teague for providing us a flatbed truck and driver to transport it back home.” The upcoming project has gotten some other generous donations. “The Church of the Highlands in Birmingham has donated the Hardie board for both homes,” Roberts said. “Knauf has donated the insulation and West Frazier (formerly Norbord) the OSB.” The 44 sets of walls for each home are ready to go in. The first sets were built over the summer by youth and adult leaders from the First Baptist Church of Minden, Louisiana, who spent a week in West Point and Lanett earlier this summer. The second sets were built by members of the Bunkertown Church. “They purchased all the materials needed for the walls and put them together,” Roberts said. “They will have them transported to the site on a flatbed truck.” Bethlehem Baptist will be the host church. An opening ceremony will be taking place there on Sunday evening, Oct. 3. Starting that night, they will be serving dinner to all the volunteers throughout the week. Some of the volunteers from Pennsylvania will be staying at the Hampton Inn & Suites in Lanett and others at the Plant City Methodist Church. Two local families have been selected to live in the two new homes at the end of Higgins Street. Luteshia Finley and her two children will be living in Home No. 65 and Rita Rowland and her 12-year-old granddaughter, Kennedy, will be living in CFCP No. 66. Rowland is a 14-year veteran of the U.S. Army. No. 66 will be the first home she has ever owned. She has two grown children, son Jaylin and daughter Asia. Tramell said that someone in upper level management at KMMG contacted him and asked if he knew of anyone who needed some dirt that was being removed from the Kia pad to make room for more parking space. “We appreciate them doing that,” Tramell said. “We also appreciated Takco for what they did in getting the dirt to the site and compacting it.” With its main office located on Airport Parkway in LaGrange, Takco is part of the residential building industry. It annually generates more than $2 million dollars in sales and is involved in all kinds of construction including office buildings and single-family homes.'}]"

Winds SSE at 5 to 10 mph. Chance of rain 50%. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 1:19 pm Subscribe To Lagniappe Today Two-time NBA champion Jason A. Caffey is getting off the bench and taking his shot at representing Mobile City Council’s District 2. Caffey, a Mobile native and former Chicago Bull, who won championships in 1996 and 1997, alongside Michael Jordan, believes he can improve the district he now calls home. “All I’ve ever been about is being able to help people,” Caffey said. “When I came back to the Campground, I knew it had to change. I didn’t want to be a product of my environment; I wanted the environment to be a product of me. I was totally upset by the lack of care it was receiving, given it was a historical district.” Living in Texas in 2012, the Davidson High School graduate began to miss the Gulf Coast and decided to move back home the next year. He purchased a house and started his first in a series of group homes. The business grew. “We went to two (group homes),” he said. Then three to four, four to five and five to six. In 18 months, I was housing 68 people. In 10 years, I’ve helped more than 200 people.” Caffey and his family now refurbish homes in the Campground area. Caffey also leads basketball camps. That’s where he got his first taste for politics. “I was working with politicians all over the state in these basketball camps,” he said. “I didn’t want to do it then, but I knew I had the ability.” Caffey admits his fast-paced life in the NBA didn’t always lead to the best decisions and he credits God for showing him a slower-paced lifestyle is the best for him. Caffey said he was unable to pay child support in the past because it was still in the millions of dollars, even after he retired from the league. The rates have since been adjusted and he has been able to pay it. District 2 issues If elected to council, Caffey wants to do more to combat the high weeds and grass he sees on certain blocks around the district. He also wants to work harder to eradicate blighted structures that he said are havens for drugs. “We need to make it possible to rebuild and allow for those homes to be purchased,” he said. Caffey said the drug issues in the area are caused by a lack of leadership for the youth in the city. “Young men need to be led,” he said. “We need more programs in District 2.” Caffey applauded Mayor Sandy Stimpson’s administration for implementing the SCORE (Second Chance or Else) program, which gives a second chance to street-level drug dealers. Annexation District 2 candidates are split on the importance of annexation to grow the city’s population. When Strimpson introduced a proposal in 2019 that would’ve allowed about 13,000 West Mobile residents the chance to vote on whether or not to join the city, incumbent Councilman Levon Manzie turned out to be the swing vote against it. The proposal failed despite a majority of councilors approving the measure on a 4-3 vote along racial lines. The proposal needed a supermajority of five votes. Caffey believes the city must annex that portion of West Mobile in order to grow. In fact, he said the 2019 annexation would have resulted in more coronavirus aid coming into the city than the $58 million it is set to receive. The funding was tied to population, he said, and if the city had more people it would’ve received more help. The city could’ve received more federal funding in general, Caffey said, which could’ve helped defray the cost of infrastructure like the new I-10 river bridge. Caffey also argued the city provides services in West Mobile, including fire protection, that it already pays for. As part of the police jurisdiction, the area only pays half of the sales taxes and business license fees that the rest of the city pays. “Where can you show me that’s smart,” he said. Caffey also blasted current councilors for voting against annexation along racial lines. He said he’s “new school” and works with both Whites and Blacks to accomplish a goal. He also blamed Manzie for not educating the district better on the merits of annexation. “Growth is important for the city,” he said. “Otherwise, we’re a failing city. Without growth, we’ll remain stagnant.” Amtrak The council had promised Amtrak as much as $1 million per year over three years to operate a passenger rail service from Mobile to New Orleans. However, the council’s resolution required the completion of a modeling study featuring Amtrak, CSX and Norfolk Southern to see what improvements needed to be made to prevent a negative impact on freight rail. The study was never completed, as Amtrak took its argument to use freight tracks to the Surface Transportation Board. The city funding is now up in the air. Caffey favors another form of transportation to and from New Orleans. He said he personally loves attending Pelicans or Saints games and feels passenger rail could be better than driving in those situations. “I don’t see it being a problem.” He also advocated for a passenger train from Mobile to Tuscaloosa to help transport students to The University of Alabama, where he attended college.

Skylar Bolton earned her GED and CNA certification last year after years of starting and stopping her efforts. “I’m so thankful for the Wallace State Adult Education program,” she said at the time. “They’ve encouraged me every step of the way, even when I wasn’t receptive. The teachers and staff are top-notch, and they do all they can to help you succeed.” Adult Education’s efforts to assist students like Bolton fall in line with Gov. Kay Ivey’s Success Plus Initiative. The Success Plus Initiative addresses Alabama’s increasing need for workers with certificates, credentials or degrees in addition to a high school diploma. By 2025, Alabama will need to add 500,000 high-skilled employees to the workforce in order to fill existing industry’s labor needs and compete for new businesses, according to a report produced by the Alabama Workforce Council’s Statewide Educational Attainment Committee.

But for the next fifty years Americans illuminated their lives with candles and kerosene lamps. And in 1925, only about half of the homes in America had electricity. I bet you have it now. Inventors were hopping in the early nineteenth century. About three months after old Tom Edison gave us the light bulb, a German named Karl Benz showed the world that he had made the first workable internal combustion engine. And when Henry Ford learned an effective way to make them, American roads—mainly one-lane and dirt and built for horses—were filled with motorcars. Until the advent of the steam engine, no matter how rich you were you couldn’t travel faster than the wind could blow the sails of a sailing ship. And there was no way to make that speed consistent. On land you couldn’t travel faster than your horse. No matter how poor you are in today’s America, I bet that you’ve driven in a car. Even if you are easing along, you are travelling fast enough to make the richest people in the world jealous not all that long ago. Around then William Davis invented something for which he never gets enough credit—the refrigerated railroad car. For the first time we could move fresh fruits and vegetables around the country. Before this invention, the furthest you could take your produce was the distance your horse and buggy could travel. George Hammond bought the patent and made a fortune shipping meat. George and Wilbur Wright, whose life until then had been spent making, repairing, and selling bicycles, decided to take a shot at making a flying machine. On December 17, 1903, their awkward and oddly-shaped flying machine took off in Kill Devils Hill, North Carolina. I’ve stood where they took off and landed, and I was told the story of that first flight by the granddaughter of the man who photographed it. The first flight was 120 feet. Talk about taking off, but fifty-nine short years later Soviet Cosmonaut Yuri Gargarin became the first human in space. In only eight years three Americans not only went into space, but they went all of the way to the moon, and two of them walked on it. We went from the first flight to walking on the moon in 66 years. Not bad. To live in America is to be richer than Croesus imagined. Who among us does not have access to a washing machine, a dryer, canned food, a refrigerator? We’ve sped from one-lane roads to superhighways in no time at all, and you have free access to them all. Interested in learning? You have no excuse. Public education is free. And if that is not enough, you can—for free—go to the local public library and check out the best books the greatest minds have ever written. And if your local library does not have what you are looking for, they will get it post haste. The internet? No one had access to it until such a very short time ago. Can you imagine living without it? There is nothing you can’t learn there. And you can have free access to it. I could go on. Now that I have you thinking, you’ll come up with dozens of things that not only Croesus, but your very parents, had no access to. And I haven’t even mentioned polio shots to keep you well; penicillin shots to heal your infections; and anesthesia to put you to sleep so you don’t have to bear surgery when you are wide awake. Greek mythology holds that Croesus, known for his wealth, met Solon, known for his wisdom. Croesus asked Solon whether he had ever encountered anyone more fortunate that he was. Solon, always honest, said that he’d met several. That infuriated Croesus and he demanded to know who they were. Solon described them to him as he explained that the richest men he’d ever met were men who had learned to be happy and satisfied where they were. So you see, living in America, even if you consider yourself to be poor, you have access to things that Croesus could not have even imagined. And if you are content in your life, you are wealthier and happier than he was by far—no matter your financial condition.'}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 1:19 pm Dr. Mark Christensen Mark Christensen, MD, Director of Emergency Medicine at Highlands Medical Center in Scottsboro and Cullman Regional Medical Center in Cullman was recently selected as one of five 2020 Facility Medical Directors of the Year by Alteon Health, the industry-leading national medical group that manages these emergency medicine programs. The award honors Medical Directors from across Alteon’s more than 125 clinical sites who exhibited exemplary leadership and professionalism in 2020, mentoring their physicians and advanced practice providers while improving department performance amid the challenges of COVID-19. In her nomination of Dr. Christensen, Destiny Harvey, Regional Vice President of Operations for Alteon, celebrated the strong collaboration Christensen has fostered between the emergency medicine providers, the nursing staffs, and other hospital departments at both facilities since becoming medical director in 2019. “He is always seeking ways to improve performance,” Harvey said. “In doing so, he is able to break down the processes into easily executable steps that allow everyone in the department to work toward improvement with him.” Christensen was one of five awardees selected by a panel of clinicians from Alteon’s executive leadership team. The four other Facility Medical Directors recognized for their outstanding service were: Christensen earned his medical degree from the University of Alabama School of Medicine. He is board-certified in both emergency and family medicine. He joined Alteon Health in 2017 and became ED Medical Director for Alteon’s northern Alabama sites two years later. In addition to his role as Medical Director, he serves on seven committees between the two hospitals and directs Alteon’s local Emergency Medicine Fellowship Program, which trains physicians who have completed family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, and other residency programs to provide effective and efficient emergency medical care and to become independent Emergency Department physicians in community hospitals. “Dr. Christensen is one who will not ask his team to do anything he himself isn’t willing to do,” Harvey said. “He wants all members of his team to treat each individual who comes into the department as if they were the ones on the receiving end of that care.” Log In Keep it Clean.
