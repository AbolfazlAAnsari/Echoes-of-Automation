Officers have been required to provide aid to those they have shot or injured by using force since Initiative 940 became a State law in 2019. The trial continued this morning, resulting in the end of closing arguments of the prosecution and defense. Defense for TPD officer Timothy Rankine and Matthew Collins, who, along with TPD officer Christopher Burbank, are all charged with first-degree murder, focused on how Ellis’ death was his own doing. Collins and Burbank are also charged with the more severe charge of second-degree murder. The closing arguments reiterated that the officers acted with appropriate use of force and that Manny Ellis, a 33-year-old Black man who died in the custody of the three officers, died due to a lethal amount of Methamphetamine in his system compounded by a pre-existing heart condition and excited delirium. Both Burbank and Collins claimed that Ellis didn’t say anything despite audio on a nearby home security camera capturing Collins responding to Ellis’ pleas for air “Shut the [expletive] up.” TPD officer Timothy Rankine, who is Asian American, told Ellis, “If you’re talking to me, you can breathe” while putting pressure on his back and neck. Rankine continued to put pressure on Ellis’ neck for over nine minutes while medics were en route. This case is the first time the State Attorney General has criminally charged officers for using deadly force under I-940 and subsequently sets the precedent for similar cases in the future. I-940 requires that in cases where excessive use of force occurred, the “officer acted in good faith or reasonably under the circumstances.” Additionally, I-940 mandates an increase in de-escalation & mental health training, and an independent deadly force investigation must be conducted thereafter. The prosecution and defense have both rested their cases, with closing arguments having begun this past Monday. Special prosecutor Patti Eakes told jurors in their closing argument that the defendants had denied Ellis “The most basic part of human existence: Breathe in, breathe out. It’s so basic that we don’t even think about it until we can’t breathe. And then, we fight for breath. We fight for breath because we want to live, because breath is life.” Eakes emphasized that “Each of the defendants knew it was a risk because Manny Ellis told them over and over again that he couldn’t breathe. And each of the defendants chose to ignore him and let him die,” Wayne Fricke, representing officer Burbanks stated Tuesday, “This is a situation where [Ellis] created his own death. It was his behavior that forced the officers to use force against him.” The verdict is expected to be released by the end of this week. All three officers have pleaded not guilty, are free on bail, and remain employed by the TPD on paid leave.

(AP Photo/Earl Neikirk)Credit: ASSOCIATED PRESS (AP Photo/Earl Neikirk) BY ASSOCIATED PRESS RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — John Clair, the police chief of a small Appalachian town in southwest Virginia, spends his days consumed by a growing problem: the frequency with which his officers are tapped to detain, transport and wait in hospitals with people in the throes of a mental health crisis. Officers from Clair’s 21-member Marion Police Department crisscross the state to deliver patients for court-ordered treatment, sometimes only to discover the hospital where they were sent has no available beds. Patients end up boarding in waiting rooms or emergency rooms, sometimes for days on end, while under the supervision of Clair’s officers. It’s a problem for law enforcement agencies around Virginia, one that advocates, attorneys and leaders like Clair say ties up policing resources and contributes to poor patient outcomes. In the past five years, these types of transports have become the largest single category of case the Marion department handles. “We are against the wall,” said Clair, an Army veteran and former lay pastor who sometimes shuttles patients himself, and did so last month on a nearly 15-hour round trip to a coastal city on the other side of the state. The problem underscores a widely held consensus that Virginia’s mental health care system is in urgent need of reform, due to what Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration says is an overreliance on hospitalization at a time of growing need. About a year ago, Youngkin, a Republican, rolled out an ambitious initiative that aims to transform the way psychiatric care is delivered by creating a system that allows people to get the treatment they need without delay, in their own community and not necessarily in the confines of a hospital, easing the burden on both patients and law enforcement. While Virginia’s struggles may be particularly acute, Youngkin is not alone in his focus on the issue. Improving mental health care became a priority in the U.S. like never before as the pandemic brought new levels of isolation, fear and grief, in addition to pre-existing crises such as rising drug overdose deaths and the struggles burdening teen girls. Survey data from the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found that in 2022, about half of adults with any mental illness did not receive treatment. “We know that there’s a lot of partisan divide across the country, but what we’ve found is whether it’s red states or blue states, there’s a lot of support for behavioral health at this point,” said Brian Hepburn, executive director of the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors. Youngkin’s emphasis on mental health developed during his 2021 campaign, when person after person — from doctors to local officials to police — pleaded with him to make it a priority, according to John Littel, the cabinet secretary overseeing the Virginia initiative. “It was just so clear that people were really struggling,” Littel said. Youngkin has since won bipartisan support for his “Right Help, Right Now” initiative and praise from advocates, though some worry about the pace at which things are moving. The governor — whose press office says the initiative is exceeding key milestones — cannot seek a second consecutive term and leaves office in two years. The initiative’s wide-ranging goals include building up the behavioral health care workforce and working to stem the tide of overdose deaths, which claimed the lives of an average of seven Virginians a day in 2022. Youngkin has signed dozens of related bills into law and has secured hundreds of millions in new funding, with more proposed. The “foundational” part of the plan, as Littel describes it, is creating a system that delivers same-day help to individuals in crisis, which should also relieve some of the burden on police departments like Clair’s that are charged with transporting most patients a court deems a risk to themselves or others. Youngkin’s administration hopes to build up that continuum of care by increasing the number of mobile crisis teams with clinicians to respond to mental health emergencies and creating more short-term stabilization centers for patients to avoid the need to take them hours away from their homes for care. A recent report from the state’s legislative watchdog emphasized the need. Virginia had more than 20,000 temporary detention orders in fiscal year 2023, according to a recent presentation to lawmakers. Some 8,538 of those individuals experienced delays receiving psychiatric treatment after they had been deemed an imminent risk to themselves or others, the report found. The report also raised concerns about law enforcement “drop offs,” where officers or sheriff’s deputies leave patients before they’re accepted by a hospital or other facility. Recent testimony in a legislative hearing suggested drop-offs put some of those patients at risk of death. Elsewhere in the U.S., states’ policy concerns and approaches to improving mental health care have varied. States have used federal coronavirus pandemic relief funds to bolster access to care, and most governors have talked about mental health in their state of the state addresses in the last few years. Mental health was listed as a budget priority in most states in an analysis by the National Association of State Budget Officers. Will that emphasis continue? “It’s a marathon, it’s not a sprint,” said Katherine McGuire, chief advocacy officer of the American Psychological Association, “and our daily hope is that the states especially after the public health emergency was rescinded will realize they have to stay at it, they have to stick with it.” Virginia’s lawmakers are considering bills on the intersection of law enforcement and mental health this year. Clair said he hoped that speaking with candor about his department’s experiences will help them see the urgency of the problem. But he’s worried that the part-time General Assembly, also grappling with controversial gambling and sports arena deals, may rush through something that falls short of what’s needed. The patient Clair transported across the state, costing his department thousands of dollars, has had around 15 mental health encounters with his agency in a year and a half, he estimates. One involved a suicide attempt. The patient dropped off a handwritten thank-you note for the chief after their long ride. A short time later, she was back in his department’s custody. Clair said both police and patients in need — whose crises can be exacerbated by time spent detained in the back of a police car — deserve better. “We’re just setting ourselves up for tragedy over and over again,” he said. ____ Geoff Mulvihill contributed to this report from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

The most recent slip-ups involved Biden mixing up the names of European leaders with past officials who had died years earlier. On Wednesday, Biden twice appeared to mix up late German Chancellor Helmut Kohl with former Chancellor Angela Merkel while talking about a conversation he had in 2021. Merkel was Germany’s leader during the event he was discussing, while Kohl died in 2017. That came after another error on Sunday, when he confused French President Emmanuel Macron for Francois Mitterand, a former French president who died in 1996. They are the latest examples in what has become a growing problem for Biden, who has referred to himself as a “gaffe machine” in the past. But they come as voters are voicing concerns about the 81-year-old president. An NBC poll released Wednesday found 76% of voters had major or moderate concerns about whether Biden has “the necessary mental and physical health to be president for a second term.” Eleven percent said they had no real concerns. Biden’s age has been an issue he has confronted directly and tried to overcome by asking voters to count on his experience and what he has been able to accomplish as president. But questions continue to pop up any time he makes a mistake while speaking or appears frail. “It's a double-edged sword to put him out on the campaign trail or in high-profile events. The upside is you could show people ‘look at him out there’ being active and speaking, whether on-script or extemporaneously interacting with people. And he could pull it off very well for hours or days in a row. But just one slip-up and that's probably what will get all the attention,” said Chris Devine, an associate professor of political science at the University of Dayton. But Biden isn’t alone in giving voters concern over his advanced age, as the same poll found 48% said they have major or moderate concerns about 77-year-old former President Donald Trump. Thirty-five percent said they had no real concerns. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has tried to draw attention to Trump’s age in the Republican primary race, especially after he confused her for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during a rally. Before dropping out of the race, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ campaign had launched a “Trump accident tracker” on top of quips from the governor about Trump “losing his fastball.” Trump has also made other gaffes like saying he ran against former President Barack Obama or confusing former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who ran in the 2016 GOP primary, for his brother, former President George W. Bush. The old age of the candidates, who appear to be on a collision course for a 2020 rematch, has been one of the primary drivers behind their disdain for what’s to come at the top of the ticket in November. Voters in both parties have consistently told pollsters for months that they want someone new to be the presidential nominee. That has spurred some speculation that third-party candidates may have a bigger sway over the final results due to higher levels of disinterest in the two major political parties’ candidates, though experts say that is unlikely to materialize when it comes time for voters to cast a ballot. Challengers to the two frontrunners have also tried to harness that energy in their longshot campaigns, though they have limited success. Haley has frequently drawn attention to Trump’s age but lost primary contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. She was also handily defeated in Nevada’s primary election to “none of these candidates” without Trump on the ballot, though she did not campaign in Nevada and the election does not award any delegates. Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips has also tried to use Biden’s age against him in his longshot primary challenge. “In 2016, Joe Biden made the wrong decision by not running, and in 2024 he’s making the wrong decision by running. It gives me angst, but someone in Washington has to be honest and say what the entire country knows,” Phillips said in a post on X including videos of Biden speaking in 2016 and this year. While attacks about age are not having much of an effect in primary races, both campaigns have also tried to make it a factor in the general election. Biden’s campaign and other Democrats have tried to highlight Trump’s errors to counterbalance the frequent attacks against the president, who Trump’s campaign has tried to frame as a confused, elderly man incapable of serving another four-year term. It’s a risky strategy for Biden. While it may convince some voters that there is not a stark difference between the two elderly candidates, it could also draw more attention to a vulnerable issue for him. “We see this often in campaigns where one candidate has a weakness — whether that's a real weakness or at least the perceived one — what they do is say, ‘I know you are but what am I?’ and try to turn it back on the other candidate, and it rarely works,” Devine said. “Usually, if there's a narrative that attaches to someone, it's because people see something compelling there.”""}]"

In addition to meeting with local and state leaders to discuss continued efforts to hold Norfolk Southern accountable, the president ""will discuss his commitment to ensuring the people of East Palestine are not defined by this single event, and that his administration is delivering on the needs of families, businesses, and affected residents,"" according to guidance released by the White House Press Office. East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway, a conservative who does not support Biden, extended the invitation to the Democratic president at the behest of some of his citizens, but also says the visit will be good for his community. This will be the first time Biden himself puts boots on the ground in the town on the Ohio-Pennsylvania border, which is still recovering from a massive derailment of a Norfolk Southern freight train which spilled tens of thousands of gallons of hazardous chemicals into the surrounding region on top of other chemicals aerosolized by the fires on the crashed cars. The president received substantial criticism from Republican critics, and some in the community, for not visiting in the immediate aftermath, instead dispatching Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to serve as the avatar of the administration. In a recent interview with WKRC, Buttigieg touted the tighter inspection rules his administration has put in place since the derailment. However he, like many in Washington, are putting weight behind and hope in the bipartisan Railway Safety Act back by all four senators from Ohio and Pennsylvania. That legislation aims at increasing safety mechanisms and regulations for freight trains, especially those carrying hazardous and our flammable material, mandating crew minimums on those trains and requiring research on more advanced designs for freight cars. ""This is a good, important, bipartisan bill,"" Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., said in a statement released last Saturday. While Norfolk Southern vows that is working to comply to and accept proposed new guardrails, the railway industry as a whole has been reportedly working against the bill, lobbying key members of Congress who oversee transportation to reject the bipartisan legislation. The Washington Post noted that over the past year, the nation\'s top five largest rail operators have thrown a combined $17 million at lobbying lawmakers as well as donating to other key lawmakers on Transportation Committees. The bill is also expected to face an uphill battle in the Senate, despite its bipartisan origin and support up until now. The Hill reports that Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., opposes the act in its current form. Other Republicans are also nervous about the law granting the Federal Railroad Administration certain safety powers, like overseeing the implementation of rail-side defect detectors and extending inspection times. Others are concerned about the the additional powers granted to the Department of Transportation to implement many of the news law\'s provisions. ""This should have been acted on before,"" Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, told a Northeast Ohio public media station. ""I\'m pushing hard with Senator Schumer, the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, to get this scheduled on the floor. It comes down to the power of the rail industry."" Vance admitted to The Hill that he believes there are provisions in the bill he could write off to try and win more support but he is also sure that nothing will win over the hard holdouts like McConnell. Residents of the village told WSYX that they are still concerned with the final stages of cleanup and whatever potential life has to move on after the last year, “This town is very divided, very divided,” said Diane Parker, who lives close to the center of town. Huffman is worried about the water too. He likes to fish and used to catch minnows to use as bait. He said there were fish kills in area waterways after the derailment and chemical release. But he said he’s also seeing improvement. “I\'m seeing the life coming back,” he said. ____________________________ WSYX\'S Tom Bosco and the Associated Press contributed to this report.'}]"

Earlier Saturday, Trump called for the end of foreign aid “WITHOUT “STRINGS” ATTACHED,” arguing that the U.S. should dramatically curtail the way it provides money. “FROM THIS POINT FORWARD, ARE YOU LISTENING U.S. SENATE(?), NO MONEY IN THE FORM OF FOREIGN AID SHOULD BE GIVEN TO ANY COUNTRY UNLESS IT IS DONE AS A LOAN, NOT JUST A GIVEAWAY,” Trump wrote on his social media network in all-caps letters. Trump went on to say the money could be loaned “ON EXTRAORDINARILY GOOD TERMS,” with no interest and no date for repayment. But he said that, “IF THE COUNTRY WE ARE HELPING EVER TURNS AGAINST US, OR STRIKES IT RICH SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE, THE LOAN WILL BE PAID OFF AND THE MONEY RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES.” During his 2016 campaign, Trump alarmed Western allies by warning that the United States, under his leadership, might abandon its NATO treaty commitments and only come to the defense of countries that meet the alliance’s guidelines by committing 2 percent of their gross domestic products to military spending. Trump, as president, eventually endorsed NATO’s Article 5 mutual defense clause, which states that an armed attack against one or more of its members shall be considered an attack against all members. But he often depicted NATO allies as leeches on the U.S. military and openly questioned the value of the military alliance that has defined American foreign policy for decades. As of 2022, NATO reported that seven of what are now 31 NATO member countries were meeting that obligation — up from three in 2014. Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine has spurred additional military spending by some NATO members. Trump has often tried to take credit for that increase, and bragged again Saturday that, as a results of his threats, “hundreds of billions of dollars came into NATO”— even though countries do not pay NATO directly.
