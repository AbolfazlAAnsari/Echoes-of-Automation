is considering whether to expand the facility, which has become overcrowded in recent years. But critics say that expanding the jail isn’t the answer. WMRA’s Calvin Pynn reports. The number of inmates in the Middle River Regional Jail has been more than double its rated capacity every year since 2017, according to the jail’s website. And conditions there have, allegedly, been grim. ANNA CUBBAGE: My name is Anna Cubbage, and last year I was briefly incarcerated here at the Middle River Regional Jail. Anna Cubbage, from Bridgewater, described her incarceration as one of the worst experiences of her life. CUBBAGE: In that time, I witnessed violations of human rights, deliberate indifference by staff towards inmates, and I saw numerous mentally ill members of our community struggle in concrete holding cells that were covered in human excrement – sometimes not even their own, because the cleaning of these cells between inmates is virtually nonexistent. Critics say the answer to the overcrowding is not to build a bigger jail, but to not incarcerate so many people in the first place. That was the message that more than 100 people sent as they stood outside the jail Monday night to protest the expansion in a rally arranged by Virginia Organizing. [Cars pulling into the Middle River Regional Jail] CUBBAGE: There are many, many people who do not belong here. Nobody should be punished for being mentally ill, for having a substance abuse disorder, or for being poor. And that’s why we’re here. Some, like Cubbage, gave testimonies about their own time at the jail - including Dewan Bellamy, deputy chairman of the Waynesboro chapter of the Black Panther Party, who was incarcerated there from 2014 to 2015. DEWAN BELLAMY: I spent 623 days in solitary confinement. I was beaten, I had my wrist broken, and I was stripped naked for 15 days in a cell where the temperature was below freezing. I’ve seen rotten food, I’ve worked in the kitchen here. Tracy Stover read a letter her son, Thomas Stover, who was incarcerated at Middle River last year and is awaiting trial in the Rockingham County Jail for probation violations stemming from earlier drug charges. TRACY STOVER: I can’t help but wonder what the trajectory of my life could have been had I not been in prison for two marijuana plants ten years ago, and had I not been labeled a convict beyond helping. The rally was held ahead of the jail’s authority board meeting on Wednesday, where they were expected to vote on whether to move forward with the proposed $40 million expansion, but the vote was delayed. The board’s Chairman, Stephen King, said it’s still too soon to take action. STEPHEN KING: We have five different jurisdictions, all with different thoughts and ideas. Some of them wanted to get to the jail and look at the facilities before they make a decision. Some members of Harrisonburg City Council toured the jail this past weekend, and other local leaders will follow in the coming weeks. Harrisonburg, Staunton, Waynesboro, and Rockingham and Augusta counties all fund the jail, and at least four of the five jurisdictions must approve the proposal for it to move forward. KING: So, we're just waiting, giving a little more time for that input so that we can let them all have a chance to provide that input to their various city managers, and county administrators. Harrisonburg City Council has opposed the project, arguing that the extra funds that would pay for the project would be better invested in the community. According to King, expanding the jail isn’t the board’s ideal solution either. KING: We don’t want to, there's no desire to do that, but the reality is what's driving what we feel compelled to do at some point. We are all in favor of doing the alternative programs that we can to reduce numbers. But our reality is we're having to deal with. The board could vote on the project at their June 1 meeting, provided the localities have all the information they need. Some local activists say that even if the board votes against expanding the jail, that won’t address the systemic issues that led to overcrowding in the first place. Dewan Bellamy, again. Bellamy: I think that should be our focus whether they expand or not because stopping this expansion isn’t going to stop them bringing it again up five years from now. So, we have to find a way to eliminate the issue completely.""}]"

(WSET) — As the year comes to a close, we are all taking time to reflect on 2021. These are the non-COVID-related stories that most resonated with our viewers in Lynchburg this year. The Liberty University saga ABC13\'s Cynthia Beasley spent more than a year investigating claims of sexual assault at Liberty University. Those claims ultimately led to a lawsuit being filed against the university by 12 women, who allege the school weaponized its code of conduct, known as ""The Liberty Way,"" to silence the young women making the accusations. Since the initial filing of the lawsuit, more women have come forward, sharing their own stories and joining the dozen Jane Does in their legal quest to see change at Liberty. An on-campus movement, Justice For Janes, is showing support for the women making the allegations and demanding the school address the concerns of the Jane Does and the student body. The Title IX lawsuit follows what\'s been a rough couple of years for the school. There is, of course, the Falwell fallout and subsequent lawsuits between LU and Jerry Falwell, Jr. The school was also served lawsuits alleging discrimination against LGBTQ students, along with one filed by a former employee, who is Black and gay, as well as LU\'s former spokesperson, who says he was fired after speaking out about the university\'s alleged mishandling of sexual assault allegations. And, one of LU\'s professors was arrested and charged in the abduction and sexual battery of a student. Here are a few other news reports related to LU in 2021: Riverside Park railroad trestle death Back in April, a young man was killed after falling 175 feet from a train trestle at Riverside Park. Police say 20-year-old Sean O\'Hare and a young woman were taking photos on the trestle when a train approached. They both hung from the side of the trestle, but O\'Hare was not able to hold on. The woman held on until a railroad worker got to her and pulled her to safety. WSET has reported on four other accidental deaths there over the past 10 years. The senseless death of Samantha Robinson A 28-year-old woman was driving down the street in the Diamond Hill neighborhood in January when the unthinkable happened -- a stray bullet entered her vehicle and struck her -- in front of her child. She later died at the hospital. ""This senseless act of violence took a young woman from her family and our community way too soon,"" Lynchburg Police Chief Ryan Zuidema said at the time. The woman\'s mother described Samantha as a ""good, beautiful soul. Smiling, laughing all of the time and was the life of the party."" Samantha Robinson\'s death led many to rally for justice. A devastated community still awaits answers; Samantha Robinson\'s shooting death remains unsolved. Lynchburg jail riot On a Monday evening in August, dozens of maximum-security inmates were able to gain control of Pod K. The siege lasted more than 14 hours -- but it was long enough for hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage to be done. Thankfully, no law enforcement officers were injured. In the days after the uprising, some inmates spoke out about mistreatment and poor living conditions within the Lynchburg jail. Crime spikes in the Hill City We\'d be remiss for not including the rising crime rates in our city. A couple of examples: From 2020 to 2021, Lynchburg\'s homicide rate doubled. In a shocking and brazen crime, four teenagers -- yes, teenagers -- ages 14, 15, 16, and 17 -- carjacked a couple at gunpoint. The community has expressed feeling unsafe and is calling on leaders to make changes and address the spike in violent crime. “You need to have eyes in the back of your head these days. You never know where something is coming from,” said long-term Lynchburg resident, Kevin Diamond. “I was just at the Wendy\'s on Memorial Avenue, and I pulled over to eat in the parking lot. I kept looking over my shoulder because I have been hearing so much about it lately,"" said Burt. Wynter Benda, Lynchburg\'s new city manager, made an announcement earlier this month that the starting pay for Lynchburg Police will be raised to $50,000 -- in an effort to attract candidates and retain officers amid a nationwide law enforcement shortage. ""There\'s no place for this type of violence in our city,"" said Chief Zuidema. With fewer officers on the force, it\'s cutting back on an important tool. ""It definitely challenges our capacity to engage the community at a level that\'s meaningful to us,"" said Chief Zuidema.
