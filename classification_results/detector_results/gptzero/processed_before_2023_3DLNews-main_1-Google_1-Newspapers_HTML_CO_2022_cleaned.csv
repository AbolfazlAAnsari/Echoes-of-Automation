Hiring a coach because you’re certain he won’t bail in the middle of the night isn’t how you become relevant.It’s how you become the Rockies. What happened to be true in November 2018, when then-CU football coach Mike MacIntyre turned news conferences into prop comedy, is even more apt today. Two coaches later. The Buffs job is a lot of things, not all of them pleasant. But it isn’t too good a gig for a first-timer. If you’re CU athletic director Rick George, you’re outta mulligans. You can’t be too scared to get used. You can’t be afraid to become a stepping stone if the next “right guy” comes along. “Colorado has woefully underperformed,” a longtime national television analyst, who asked not to be identified, told me the other day. “And it’s a program that could and should expect to be much better. It’s a program that has enjoyed a great tradition. “It’s one of the very few schools that can call themselves an AAU (academic) university with a national championship, a Heisman Trophy (winner), a Butkus Award (winner), a Jim Thorpe Award (winner). There are very few schools that have that type of legacy. And with the right fit, CU can be a (contender) in the top 25 most years.” Don’t sweat the future. Sweat the fit. CU should be chasing the hottest coach on the market, not worried about how they’re going to get dumped. Karl Dorrell was never going anywhere, and not just because he’d built a home in Lafayette. Aim higher. Matt Rhule, who became the umpteenth guy to win big at the college level and then crash out in the NFL, is in the pool, having been cut loose by the Carolina Panthers Monday morning. BetOnline.ag has already tagged the Buffs as 8-to-1 odds to land the former Baylor and Temple coach, behind Nebraska (3/2), Auburn (3/1), Wisconsin (5/1) and Arizona State (15/2). If Steve Addazio has scared you off former Owls dudes forever, then what about Illinois defensive coordinator Ryan Walters? He’s young (36), he’s a Buffs legacy, the son of a CU football player who then became one himself, a local kid who rolled at Grandview, then rocked in Boulder. Oh, and his defenses, as opposed the ones Buffs fans have been forced to sit through, are completely legit. Illinois heads into the weekend ranked No. 24 and with a 5-1 record, thanks in part to a Walters scheme that’s No. 1 nationally in fewest points allowed (8.0 per game) and No. 2 in yards allowed per game (228.0). Local context: A Wyoming offense that averaged 25 points, 18 first downs and committed just one turnover in home wins over Air Force and UNC managed only six points and 10 first downs while giving it away three times against Walters’ defense during a Week 0 whuppin’ in Champaign. Walters’ 2021 defense at Illinois finished 29th in the country in points per game allowed (21.9), shaving almost 38% off the program’s 2020 total of 34.9 points per game under Lovie Smith and Rod Smith. Walters’ 2019 unit at Missouri ranked 16th (19.4) in fewest points allowed. Statistically, he’s a Jim Leavitt in waiting. So what if he’s never been a head coach before? And so what if CU’s institutional stubbornness and academic stonewalling could drive him batty the way it did Midnight Mel? CU faithful walk into Folsom Field and they see history — Rashaan Salaam running to daylight, Bobby Pesavento to Daniel Graham, Nebraska fans shuffling toward the exits in shame. But coaches, search firms and media outside the Front Range look at the Buffs and see a coaching graveyard. A place where careers go to die. “This isn’t a bash job, it’s my opinion,” FOX Sports football analyst Brock Huard told me late last week. “Outside a global pandemic year (2020), you’ve had one winning season there (since 2005) and when this job came open the last time (in February 2020), it was hard to fill. “And now you have the uncertainty of conference realignment, and where you fit in (there). It’s a beautiful school. It’s an incredible environment. Does it have a tremendous amount of academic cache on top of it? Yes. Do all those things, even with the portal, work in today’s college football? Yes. Can you see Kansas (in CU?) Yes, you can.” Worry about finding your own Lance Leipold first, Buffs. Hiring a coach because you’re certain he won’t bail in the middle of the night isn’t how you become relevant. It’s how you become the Rockies. Copyright © 2024 MediaNews Group'}]"

The Rifle Senior Center Meal Program offers free hot meals to seniors in Rifle, as well as Parachute, Silt and New Castle.

up to the left. Like he’s going to hit it right into the houses on the left,” Eric Price recalled with a chuckle. “And he’ll swing as hard as he can, and it’ll go right down the middle of the fairway. It’s incredible.”Price worked as an offensive research assistant under Hackett, the Broncos’ new coach, in Jacksonville, and under Nate’s father, Paul, when the elder Hackett was with the New York Jets. He’s rarely seen anybody in the coaching fraternity adjust — to game situations, to personnel, to the weather, to crummy swings, whatever — the way that Nathaniel Hackett adjusts.“That could be the reason why (the Broncos) hired him, is because he’s good at that,” Price said. “He can develop a kid that may not be the greatest quarterback, but he can make them productive as far as wins and losses.“Nate is fine if (you) don’t score 100 points, if you just score one more point than the other team. He’s not selfish. He just wants to win. I think he’ll do that. He’ll find a way to make that happen. If they get a great quarterback, he might score 40 points a game.”He might have to. But can Hackett hack it here without Aaron Rodgers, his buddy in Green Bay? Can he make it big? Can he change the narrative without a star riding shotgun?“Everyone needs that quarterback, that’s the deal,” Price said. “It’s easier said than done, but you never know. There’s some random dude that all of a sudden starts to play great. We had (Gardner) Minshew Mania for a little bit (in Jacksonville). It was crazy.”Broncos Country has had it up to here with random dudes at quarterback, thanks all the same. John Elway became the patron saint of random dudes. In the AFC West, random dudes go 6-11. Random dudes put their coaches out of work. “You’ve got to find a quarterback,” former NFL tight end Anthony Becht, another old Hackett pal, told me Saturday. “You’ve got to find offensive linemen … those things are important to having success, whoever the quarterback is, whether they’re drafting (one) or they have to sign (one).”Over Becht’s 11 seasons in the NFL, Hackett was one of the sharpest cats he ever came across. The pair last hooked up professionally with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2007, where Hackett was an offensive quality control coach and general gopher for then-Bucs coach Jon Gruden.“The biggest thing with him is communication,” Becht, who works as an analyst these days, said of the Broncos’ boss. “And that’s going to be key.“That’s not just communicating, just talking to someone. I think in this day and age, in this league, you have to get to know some of these players, but still be able to demand accountability … And if you can find that middle ground, that’s when guys will run through walls for you.”Hackett’s biggest project in Jacksonville, quarterback Blake Bortles, wouldn’t run through walls for his coach when the two worked together. Bortles would run through two. Or three. No questions asked.“I think it was built on his relationship with Blake and having his back and sticking up for him,” Price stressed. “A lot of people (in the NFL) won’t stick up for their guys. With a lot of guys, it’s, ‘See you, dude.’“And Nate is the kind of guy where, if he believes in you, he’ll have your back. And he’ll stand up for you, regardless, in good times and bad times. He proved that with Blake, and I think that’s why it worked in 2017. He actually stood for up for (Bortles) until the day he left, basically.”Hackett reached the AFC title game in 2017 calling plays for Bortles. While that’s the offensive coordinator equivalent of wrenching Excalibur free from its stone, he’s in a different neighborhood now.You can fake a slice. You can’t fake talent. Or poise. Or points.“That’s the toughest thing about that Broncos job — that division,” Price said. “But you know, things change. Denver traditionally has been a very successful franchise. So it’s possible to turn it around. You never know what’s going to happen in this league. If something clicks, you get a QB, he’s the next Drew Brees, and all of a sudden, bam, you’re winning Super Bowls. You just never know.“I wouldn’t count (Hackett) out. I wouldn’t count him out.” “So he’ll line up to the left.

Please give us a call at 970-249-3444 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy Alexi Armendariz loved paddleboarding. (Courtesy photo/Armendariz family) In the early morning hours on Oct. 12, a car crash took the lives of two Delta County high school seniors, Edwardo “Eddie” Carillo, 18, and Alexi Armendariz, 17. The two were riding in a car that went off Colorado 133 and rolled, throwing them from the vehicle. Two others, including the driver, were injured. Alexi’s mom Misty Rae Ann Armendariz recently reflected on her daughter’s life, saying the teen was involved with everything, especially when it came to spending one-on-one time with those she loved dearly. She enjoyed hiking excursions with her mom, even though hiking was not her favorite thing to do because it only involved walking. She also had a summer adventure with her dad this year. Born on Nov. 30, 2004, Alexi was the life of the party from the start and very adventurous, and loved doing things her own way. Before Alexi could walk, she would balance on her father’s hand, standing tall and showing off. She was known to “weeble” and wobble, without falling and the nickname Weebs stuck with her. In fact, Alexi’s mom recently bought a young puppy, naming her “Weebs’’ in her daughter’s memory. Alexi loved being in the water, and was very active even as a young child, although at times her parents said she could be very clumsy and dramatic. Alexi didn’t mind getting hurt because her latest wound became a trophy she could brag about and tell all the details of getting the injury. Alexi’s dramatic talent was used to get her the leads in school plays. One performance her parents and siblings especially enjoyed was when she played a double role as a bride and groom marrying herself. Alexi’s mom said she was definitely a “daddy’s girl” and would hunt, fish, shoot rifles and participate with her dad in archery. A favorite picture has her showing off her first kill hunting at age 13 with her dad. Alexi also knew how to brand cows, enjoyed riding horses and running tractors. “She loved animals,” her dad Steven Armendariz said. “Milo was her dog. She also loved horses. She wanted to barrel race, but they would kick her off.” Her parents Steven and Misty said she really enjoyed her grandma Lori’s horse Casino, which was a granddaughter to the legendary Secretariat. While it may appear on the surface that she might have been a tomboy, she wasn’t. Alexi just wanted to spend time with her dad and the two had quite a strong bond, her mom said. Although Alexi herself didn’t play football, she loved watching her 10-year-old brother Jaxton play. However, she was not known for her sportsmanship when he played, as she would be loud voicing her opinions. “I felt bad for the other team,” Alexi’s mom said. Alexi also was able to attend a Broncos football game. Alexi was a strong competitor at all she did, being involved in cheerleading, and all kinds of recreational sports, including softball, basketball, volleyball and soccer. But her recreational activities didn’t stop there. She enjoyed paddleboarding too and loved to snowboard, and even worked jobs to pay to enjoy the experience. According to her parents, snowboarding was her favorite thing to do. “Her ultimate love in life was snowboarding. She couldn’t wait for the season, working odd jobs just to get the next lift ticket,” her obituary stated. A few of the jobs to support her hobby of snowboarding included working at McDonald’s, Little Caesars, A&M Creations, mowing lawns and grooming horses. Alexi told her family she loved white water rafting in Glenwood Springs, saying, “It was better than tubing and paddleboarding.” Alexi’s mom Misty said, “When we went to Key West, Florida, she could do handstands on her paddleboard. She’s done everything. If that girl wasn’t on the go, she was sleeping.” Alexi also had a desire to skydive. Alexi loved cooking and would hold steak grilling competitions with her parents and usually won. Alinas Bailey is Alexi’s best friend. “She was always there,” Bailey said. “When I wasn’t there, she would make it there for the whole family. She was a good friend and made me laugh.” Bailey said sometimes Alexi said the stupidest things, especially when under anesthesia. When she had her tonsils out, Alexi kept crying, saying how beautiful her best friend was. Bailey said one birthday she and Alexi watched the movie “The Purge” and Bailey’s mom threw a toilet brush at her. Alexi’s younger sister Brooklyn said her favorite memory is when they went fishing in the ocean in California and caught stingrays, a leopard shark and lobsters. They fished using anchovies at the dock. Her Uncle Turtle enjoyed hiking and fishing with Alexi and her dad and was always excited to watch her play soccer. Alexi desired to help people and was studying to retake a test to help her become recruited for Navy service as a trauma nurse. Alexi’s mom said her daughter was like a rainbow and she loved all the colors of Alexi’s life. “I can’t lose sight of the rainbow up ahead in the distance,” Misty said during the funeral. “I was blessed to have all your colors for less than 18 years. Through your life and death, beautiful rainbows will pour colors of love and life into us all.” Grace Community Church Pastor Brian Workman said during the funeral that Alexi’s life has purpose and meaning and Alexi had strong faith. He also pointed out how her life impacted so many by the hundreds who attended. As a way to honor their daughter, Alexi’s family and her best friend will get a tattoo “trophy” to honor her 18th birthday later this month.

Weiss. The building was on the market for sale but is no longer. As the Colorado Springs Independent newspaper looks to enter its 30th year of publication in 2023, co-founder John Weiss, 67, is retiring this month, and his privately owned Colorado Publishing House will cease to exist. But the products of his labor, which over the past three decades have grown from publishing an alternative news weekly to regularly churning out seven varied publications, are moving to a different business model that company officials say will safeguard longevity. Final paperwork is being completed to form a new 501(c)(3) nonprofit, Sixty35 Media, Amy Gillentine, publisher and executive editor of Colorado Publishing House, said Thursday. Assets of the corporations — which include the flagship Independent, known as the Indy, along with the Colorado Springs Business Journal, the Southeast Express, the Pikes Peak Bulletin in Manitou Springs, The Transcript legal publication and two newspapers under Colorado Springs Military Group — will move to the nonprofit, she said. The shift will be completed by the end of October, according to Gillentine. “This is a way to make sure the papers continue in perpetuity and not be based on a single person or owner but based on community effort or involvement,” she said. “We are very excited about moving forward in a new way.” All the papers initially are coming under the Sixty35 Media umbrella, she said. The organization is named for Colorado Springs’ elevation of 6,035 feet above sea level. The two military papers, the Fort Carson Mountaineer and the Space Orbital for Schriever Space Force Base, will end on Nov. 11 and be reformatted into military and local news products that publish six to 12 times a year, Gillentine said. Colorado Publishing House considered several options when Weiss announced he would exit as chairman, said Ahriana Platten, chairwoman of the Sixty35 Media board, which is still being formed. Other members won’t be named publicly until all seven seats are filled, she said. “Do we just stop, do we sell the papers to another nonprofit or media group,” were among the choices leaders mulled, Platten said. “But when everything was done, the overall feeling was becoming a nonprofit ourselves would assure that we would stay local, which has always been foundational to this company,” she said. The COVID-19 pandemic and the fluctuating economy have forced many businesses to reconsider their operating models, said Platten, a minister who previously ran Unity Spiritual Center in the Rockies. Switching profit structure is a recent evolution in the publishing field, said Tim Regan-Porter, CEO of the Colorado Press Association Network, a nonprofit trade outfit. Industry challenges are driving the nationwide trend, he said, since online platforms such as Craigslist and Google began eating into newspaper advertising revenue. “There’s still a lot of money in the industry, so I think there will continue to be opportunity for people to own a company and make a profit,” he said. “But there’s an increasing realization that regardless of whether there’s a lot of profit or a little profit, that what we provide is very valuable to citizens, other businesses and democracy,” Regan-Porter said. “It’s important that these news institutions remain in whatever form there is.” Under Sixty35 Media, the papers will keep publishing hard-copy and digital formats, Gillentine said. Additional podcasts are planned for the organization, she said, and other developments will be announced later this quarter. News coverage won’t change, Gillentine said, with the exception of no more election voter guides and endorsements. Nonprofits with 501(c)(3) designation are not allowed by law to endorse political candidates. “Our bylaws keep the journalism we do separate from board influence or interference,” she said. “We are adamant in all the paperwork that independent journalism is what we do and will continue to do.” The mission to provide a public service and “tell the stories nobody else is telling, give people a voice to people who don’t have one and hold government officials accountable” also will not be affected, Gillentine said. Three employees have been laid off this year, but only one in preparation for the switchover, she said. New positions, such as a digital editor, are being hired. Advertising sales will generate the bulk of the organization's revenue, Gillentine said, with foundation grant funding being sought for special projects and operating costs. A new membership program with benefits to supporters will roll out in November. “Without local journalism observing the decisions that are made politically, environmentally, culturally, without someone reporting on that, the public is in some ways disabled when it comes to being informed and being able to respond and actively create the community they want,” Platten said. Weiss has been a visionary, Gillentine said. He and Kathryn Eastburn started the Indy in 1993, following the 1992 Colorado voter-approved constitutional amendment that banned municipalities from prohibiting discrimination against LGBTQ people. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down the measure in 1996. “His commitment to truth-telling and local community-based journalism is to be commended,” Gillentine said. “He’s been a great force in this community.” Weiss did not return a call to The Gazette seeking comments on the new direction for himself and his company. The reality, said Regan-Porter, is that news “still has to be sustainable.” Nonprofit status removes some of the pressures related to the amount of return a news outlet generates, he said. “That’s why some have found it a reasonable alternative,” Regan-Porter said. “The trend in general is a recognition that what we provide is more than the business, it's a public good.” Contact the writer: 719-476-1656.

So, I felt it was fitting that since I’ve returned to the San Luis Valley — and since it’s almost All Hallows Eve — that I share with you some of my family’s favorite spooky stories. A dance with a devil in Conejos County A woman was dancing the night away during Lent in Conejos County. Suddenly, a handsome man appeared. No one at the dance knew the man. He approached the woman and asked for a dance. She did not know him, but he was so handsome she couldn’t refuse. The two danced for hours. Suddenly, the man turned away and left. As he walked away the woman gazed down at his feet. What she saw horrified her. Instead of a pair of shoes, or human feet, she saw two hooves, much like those of a goat. She fled the dance in horror. The man was never seen again. The goat at the door On a cold, blustery night, my great-grandfather was playing cards with family and friends. Suddenly, he heard a strange knock at the door. He thought nothing of it, and thought that maybe it was another player joining the party. “Come in,” he yelled. The door slowly crept open, yet no one was at the door. After a few moments, a goat walked into the house. Taken aback, my grandfather rushed to shoo the animal out of the house. Many believe goats have close ties to witchcraft and even the occult. The fox with the red ribbon My great-grandfather and his brother were hunting in the valley many years ago, looking for deer. While searching for deer, the two men came across a little red fox. The fox, oddly, had a ribbon tied around its neck. The two men decided to shoot the fox. They hit the fox, injuring it while it ran off into the distance. The fox limped away into bushes nearby. My great-grandfather and his brother followed the fox, but it was nowhere to be found. What they did find was an old woman with the same red ribbon tied around her neck, laying in the bushes. The two went for help, and when they returned, the woman had vanished. Something under the bed My mom’s oldest sister was known for shaking her legs before falling asleep. One night, her and my mother were staying the night with my great-grandmother. In the middle of the night, the bed began to shake, furiously. My aunt, however, was fast asleep. It surely could not have been her legs making the bed shake. My mom heard a cat screech under the bed as it shook. She clasped her hands tightly together and began to pray. The bed stopped shaking and my mom could no longer hear the cat. It wasn’t the first time that noises were heard under a bed in the house. My grandpa owned an acoustic guitar which he stored under the same bed. One night the guitar began to play on its own. In another instance, my grandpa and grandma were staying at the same house. There was a picture, encased in glass, of Jesus in a garden above the bed. Suddenly, in the night, the picture fell. Yet, the glass did not shatter. Later, my grandpa said a cold pair of hands grabbed his feet in the night. All of these bizarre incidents occurred in the same room. The Ouija board in the pantry My mom lived with some friends in Leadville after she graduated from high school. She and her roommates, along with some friends, decided to play with an Oujia board one night. When they finished, they placed the board into the kitchen pantry. My mom was home alone that weekend as her roommates returned to Antonito to visit family. She was watching TV when she heard a loud knock at the door. She went to the door but no one was there. She returned to the couch and began watching TV again. Suddenly, there was another knock. Still, there was no one at the door. A few minutes later my mom heard another knock, this time from the very pantry where the Ouija board was placed. My mother stayed up all night, frightened and listening to knocking in the pantry. Terrified, she called her friends to come and pick up the Ouija board. A beast in the basement My mom spent the night at a friend’s house when she was a teenager in Antonito. Her friend’s older sister was babysitting. My mom’s friend and her sister got into a fight. Her sister got mad and sent my mom and her friend to the basement. The basement was sectioned. There was one single light in one of the sections of the basement, barely giving off any light. The girls sat on a bed, in the dark when an eerie feeling swept across the room. The light cast a shadow on the wall in front of them. Suddenly, a large shadow of a horned creature lurked over them. The girls looked at each in terror then sprinted upstairs. My mom’s friend’s older brother had returned home. He and the older sister took the family dog downstairs after hearing the girls’ tail. Once in the basement, the dog began to bark and growl and snarl, the hair on its back standing straight up. They didn’t see anything down there, despite the dog acting frantic. To this day my mom said she doesn’t know what she saw. She only says, “it looked like the devil.” Luke Lyons is the managing editor of the Valley Courier.

hyper-local business news isn’t going anywhere. Rather, beginning Jan. 11, readers will receive a new magazine that combines the Business Journal with other publications within the company under the name Sixty35. Business Journal subscribers will automatically become subscribers of Sixty35 magazine. Sixty35 will have a separate business section, with coverage expanded beyond CSBJ’s current offerings — largely online. The print publication and its new website will also include features from the Colorado Springs Independent, Southeast Express and the Pikes Peak Bulletin. All were previously produced by Colorado Publishing House — the Business Journal’s parent company before it transitioned to a nonprofit in October. That stable of publications reaches 360,000 people in the Pikes Peak region, publisher Amy Gillentine said. Gillentine noted that while it’s a big change for a lot of readers who like their individual publications, “this is not a ‘less than,’ this is ‘a more.’ We’re delivering more news to more people — and we’re doing it in an efficient way, for them and for us.” The mission — to deliver the truth, build community and engage citizens — will not change. But as a recently formed nonprofit, the weekly magazine faces a steep hill to attract funding, find its place among other media that rely on donations, secure a loyal and paying audience and promote a publication that’s been rebranded — even as newspaper readership declines across the country. The new publication is anchored by the flagship Indy, which Gillentine said is well respected across the Pikes Peak region. It and the Business Journal are staffed with award-winning journalists. The Indy created events such as Music at the Indy, which takes place during the summer, and the Business Journal produces high-profile events including Women of Influence, Rising Stars and the COS CEO Leadership Series. The new publication will continue to sponsor events and focus on reaching more readers via digital media, including its newly created podcasts. Expanding commitment Sixty35 Media, a rebranding that Gillentine said began two years ago, was launched in late October under the nonprofit Citizen-Powered Media after Indy co-founder and owner John Weiss stepped back to pursue other ventures. (He’ll serve as a nonvoting member of the nonprofit’s board of directors.) On Wednesday, Jan. 11, the first issue of Sixty35 will hit distribution stands. By combining topics previously found in Colorado Publishing House’s other papers, it will feature business news, along with investigative pieces, politics and government, neighborhood coverage, military news, editorials, letters, and arts and entertainment. “Sixty35 magazine — and Sixty35 Media overall — will expand its commitment to lift up marginalized voices, speak truth to power, and engage the Pikes Peak region in taking actions that make us more inclusive, more informed, and better connected,” said Citizen-Powered Media Board Chair Ahriana Platten, an author and business consultant. “Hyper-local business news isn’t going anywhere.” Distribution will change significantly. Sixty35 Media will place 10,000 free issues of Sixty35 magazine at “the most popular” pickup points in the region. The balance will be mailed to households by ZIP code, with distribution areas changing from week to week. CSBJ print subscribers will receive the publication weekly for the length of their subscription. Readers can renew their subscription under a membership model that has different options based on benefits provided at the various levels. Membership includes early access to the news, as well as engagement with the news team at Sixty35. As more people subscribe, the press run will be increased, Gillentine said. “I see some free mailings continuing, even with a subscription base,” she said, referring to the rotating ZIP code mailing strategy. “With gas prices and delivery driver shortages, we have decided this is a far cheaper way to deliver. “I want to emphasize that we will have a digital-first stance,” she added, “so the print edition isn’t where our main focus will be.” The increasing cost of newsprint — it’s tripled in two years — “eventually will force a lot of papers to digital-only. We are preparing for an inevitable future. So, instead of just weekly news, you’ll receive daily news updates. Our e-newsletters will continue.” Platten said the existing publications’ growth online is already “crazy good.” “That’s the foundation on which the decision [to emphasize digital] was made,” Platten said. “The reality is, if it’s not cost-effective, we go out of business. Ultimately, there has to be enough market demand for the product, and the market demand for a print product has diminished.” There’ll be no paywall on the Sixty35 website; readers can access it at Sixty35media.org starting in early January. Focus groups of local residents have reacted positively to combining the publications so they can “get all their news in one place,” Platten said. Sixty35 Media will launch a campaign soon to promote the new website and publication. Digital first It’s true that readers are gravitating more toward digital platforms and away from print products. Total weekday newspaper circulation nationwide, excluding large papers like The New York Times and The Washington Post, dropped by 40 percent from 2015 to 2020, and Sunday circulation fell by 45 percent, Pew Research Center reported in May. (Alternative weeklies comparable to the Indy have closed or scaled back publication across the country in the last few years, impacted, in part, by the COVID pandemic.) During that same 2015 to 2020 period, digital circulation rose, Pew reports. Nationwide, numerous news operations rely on donations and operate as nonprofits; by 2020, the membership of the Institute for Nonprofit News had surged to 300. In Colorado alone, the Colorado Sun, Colorado Newsline and Colorado Times Recorder and others,seek reader donations. Platten notes that Sixty35 Media will emphasize donations, because donations must surpass advertising revenue in order for the organization to maintain nonprofit status. Besides ad sales and donations, the publication will rely on memberships and grants. Sixty35 Media has received: $75,000 over three years from the Colorado News Equity Project from 2022 through 2024; a $23,500 contribution from Google for the Google News Initiative, which has supported 450 newsrooms from 52 countries; and a $5,000 end-of-year matching grant from the Colorado Media Project. In addition, the publication has received a $250,000 matching grant from Weiss. It’s worth noting, Gillentine said, that several papers that are members of the Association of Alternative Newsmedia and have become nonprofits have received grants from non-journalism foundations and arts organizations, including The Chicago Reader and Boston Dig. Gillentine also noted that 10 percent of membership money will go toward creating a fund for journalism scholarships for people of color in Colorado, and Sixty35 Media will create a media literacy program for middle school and high school students in 2023. When it comes to journalism nonprofits, larger organizations have turned out to be more attractive to large donors than small operations, according to William Birnbauer, who authored the 2019 book, The Rise of NonProfit Investigative Journalism in the United States. “While researching the financial health of U.S. nonprofit news media, I’ve found a huge disparity between the most successful nonprofit news organizations and the smaller outfits, with some operating on the ‘sweat equity, heart and hope’ of journalists who struggle to raise funds,” he wrote in an article that appeared in 2019 on the nonprofit news site theconversation.com. He analyzed the IRS returns of 60 outlets, about half of the Institute for Nonprofit News’ members at that time, and found that foundations and donors contributed $469.5 million between 2009 and 2015. He also found that three national outlets — ProPublica, the Center for Public Integrity and the Center for Investigative Reporting — received $185.4 million, or 40 percent, of that money. “The 20 largest of these media operations amassed the vast majority of the funds: $423.1 million,” he wrote. “In addition to the top three sites, other well-funded outlets included the Foundation for National Progress that publishes Mother Jones magazine in print and online, the Texas Tribune, the Voice of San Diego and the Investigative Reporting Workshop, based in the School of Communication at American University.” Platten said Sixty35 Media hopes to tap in to a loyal following built over 29 years by the Indy and its sister publications. Since the company started asking for donations in 2020, individual readers have given about $36,000, Gillentine said. Sixty35 Media also received a “significant contribution,” Platten said, from previous owner John Weiss. Sustaining local news Corey Hutchins teaches journalism at Colorado College, serves as the Colorado-based contributor for Columbia Journalism Review’s United States Project, is an award-winning journalist in his own right and is a member of The Washington Post’s Talent Network. Hutchins also wears the hat of unofficial Colorado media guru and commentator, issuing a weekly newsletter reporting on the state’s journalism industry, to include media ownership, hirings, firings, First Amendment issues and the like. “I commend the organization [Sixty35 Media] for going this nonprofit route, because I’ve, frankly, been surprised at the ability for weeklies and'}]"

King’s Crown was originally built in 1975 at 200 W. 20th Street and features 134 residential units. In September 2021, King’s Crown MHP LLC proposed to the city building an additional 66 mobile home spaces, requiring an expansion of 21st and 23rd streets. This would allow the applicant to build two additional avenues on its property. But traffic access issues brought up by the Colorado Department of Transportation delayed the project. Jeff Simonson, a civil services sector leader with Glenwood Springs-based engineering firm SGM, said they’re creating a “third way out” of King’s Crown to address the issue. Simonson said this consists of connecting the neighborhood onto the turn lane at the Rifle Bypass. Simonson said construction could start as early as before Sept. 28. City Planning Director Patrick Waller said King’s Crown is working with CDOT to address access issues onto the Rifle Bypass. “We believe the applicant has solutions to the project and plans on proceeding,” he said. Rifle city attorney Jim Neu said extending the conditional use permit to 2023 motivates the city to complete its part to connect the neighborhood directly to the bypass. “We’ve been trying to get that project for 25 years,” Neu said. “It’ll be good for that neighborhood.” May 31, 2024 May 31, 2024 May 31, 2024 May 31, 2024 May 31, 2024 May 26, 2024 May 28, 2024 May 29, 2024 May 28, 2024 May 29, 2024 Readers around Glenwood Springs and Garfield County make the Post Independent’s work possible.

Cases appeared to increase for the first time since January in the week ending March 20, but that increase disappeared as the state added late reports to the previous weeks.Some experts have raised concerns that increasing reliance on home testing kits means that states won’t have accurate data if another surge arrives, according to The Associated Press. Colorado officials have acknowledged most people don’t report their results from home testing.Cases are rising in parts of western Europe and the East Coast as the BA.2 variant replaces omicron, restrictions are lifted and people’s immunity starts to wane. BA.2 appears to be more contagious than omicron, but there’s no evidence that it causes more severe illness or further erodes protection from vaccines or prior infections, Herlihy said. While the state’s wastewater data didn’t turn up any signs of BA.2 in the first week of March, that’s probably because relatively few samples have been processed at this point, Herlihy said. A model used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated about 21% of cases in Colorado are caused by BA.2, which is lower than the national average of 35%.The federal government recently stopped shipping sotrovimab, the main monoclonal antibody treatment currently available, to states where BA.2 has displaced omicron. Lab data indicated it didn’t work well against BA.2. Three antiviral drugs are still available, though, as is a monoclonal antibody called bebtelovimab — though there’s not much data about how that option performs outside the laboratory.Colorado hasn’t made any changes to how it recommends providers treat patients at a higher risk of hospitalization or death from COVID-19. The state will watch for additional guidance from the federal government on how to use treatments going forward, Herlihy said.Guidance on vaccination is expected to change in the near future, said Heather Roth, immunization branch chief for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. It appears that people who are 50 or older will be told they can get a fourth shot soon, but they should ask their doctors if that’s the right step now, she said.“We do expect this to be kind of an optional recommendation,” she said. State epidemiologist Dr. Rachel Herlihy said the positivity rate trended up from about 2.5% on March 17 to about 3.3% on Monday. While that meets the state’s goal of keeping the rate below 5%, it’s something Herlihy said she’ll be “closely watching.” “I think it’s too early to know if it’s a true trend,” she said at a news conference Monday.

As a young adult, she decided she’d keep herself so busy as an FBI agent that she’d have little time to think about the things that made her feel sad or out of place. She suppressed her trans identity as she vied for an FBI job, telling herself she was a cross-dresser because it was easier to see herself getting by in a world where being trans meant stigma and discrimination. Some of her closest friends, she recalls, would tell her, “You don’t want to be trans.

on the one about to mark another chapter of history. In many ways, 2022 ushered the return to pre-COVID times, with in-person events roaring back to life. The Aspen commercial core settled into a new normal, with decades-old haunts being replaced by next-gen restaurants: Las Montanas opened where Jimmy’s once was, PARC moved into the space that was previously L’Hostaria and news broke that even The Red Onion and 508 E. Cooper Ave. will be revived. And of course, the real estate market continued shattering records, putting short-term rentals, residential development and affordable housing as the hot-button issues of the year. It was tough to pick just 10 top stories that best reflect 2022, and so we included four honorable mentions here. Tomorrow, we’ll publish the ADN staff’s picks for the Top 7, as well — we figure what better way to ring in the New Year than with lucky No. 7. —Megan Tackett Anna Hazard, Caroline Iles and Skye Weinglass pose inside of the former Skye Gallery space. Weinglass started the all-female-run gallery in 2018, signing an initial one-year lease for the 535 E. Cooper location. April 15 marked the official departure date in the downtown location, and the local gallerist has been searching for a new space since. Skye Gallery closed its downtown Aspen location, on the corner of East Cooper Avenue and South Hunter Street, in April. Opened in 2018 by longtime local Skye Weinglass, the art gallery mainly showcased emerging female artists and served as a community hub, with lots of public events and free programming surrounding its exhibitions. Similar to the case of many local business owners in Aspen — something that Weinglass had pointed out during an interview in April — Skye Gallery’s closure followed increased rental rates. Her landlord, Andrew Hecht of the Garfield & Hecht real estate law firm, had doubled her rent last December and was threatening to triple it around the time of her departure. Weinglass explained that all of these discussions had taken place between her and one of Hecht’s agents. She said that after trying to negotiate her monthly rent at first, she had eventually agreed to pay the high price in order to keep her business on 535 E. Cooper Ave. alive. There was controversy around the landlord’s motives behind her being pushed out: The agent had told Weinglass that they wanted an international name brand in the downtown space, she alleged. The space is now occupied by the international chain clothing brand, John Elliott. “This has always been happening in Aspen, you know, all locals of Aspen have forever been saying ‘it’s getting so high-end,’ but the past year, it just feels like … quadrupled,” she said. “And I just don't know a way that this town's gonna keep its funky heart and soul if we keep getting kicked out — all our local hangout spots are closing.” Since her official departure date on April 15, Weinglass has been on the search for a new location in Aspen to run her Skye Gallery. The local gallerist said in a recent interview that she plans to find one by summer 2023. — Jacqueline Reynolds A Pitkin County Sheriff’s Office vehicle sits in downtown Aspen. Sarah Elissa Beechler, 34, of Denver, died Sept. 3 when she fell an estimated 900 feet off a ledge near the summit of Capitol Peak, according to the Pitkin County Sheriff’s Office. A witness from another climbing party said Beechler was hiking solo and fell when a rock handhold gave way when she attempted to grab it. The sheriff’s office said Beechler was traversing the route that connects the Knife’s Edge to the Capitol Peak summit. She fell toward the Pierre Lakes Basin. It was undetermined if she had reached the summit and was returning or was headed toward the summit. The accident was reported shortly before 8 a.m. Mountain Rescue Aspen was able to get assistance for the recovery from Flight For Life Colorado and the Montrose Helitack of the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control. An airplane flying for the Aspen-based conservation group EcoFlight also assisted by surveying the landscape during the initial stages of planning. The sheriff’s office said at the time that death was the first of 2022 on Capitol Peak, regarded as one of the toughest standard climbs among Colorado’s peaks over 14,000 feet. There is extreme exposure and loose rock at many high-elevation points. A post by a friend of Beechler’s on the 14ers.com website said Capitol Peak was her “finisher,” or last of the 58 peaks in Colorado over 14,000 feet in elevation for her to climb. — Scott Condon The Aspen Skiers hold up their championship banner following the victory over Centauri in the state high school basketball final in class 3A on March 12. A flawless season saw Aspen High School take home its first boys basketball championship. On March 12, the Skiers topped Centauri High School on the statewide stage at Denver University 50-40, the team’s 27th win in 27 games on the season and securing an undisputed state title. Aspen trailed by one point at halftime, before a back-and-forth third quarter saw Shae Korpela jam a wide open slam dunk that served as the inflection point for the game. Korpela led the game with 17 points. Lifting the trophy was a defining moment for a generation of AHS athletes — the team featured 10 seniors on its 11-man roster, all prioritizing the game of basketball over other sports for the majority of their lives and showing that dedication pays off, even for small Western Slope schools competing against Front Range teams. “It’s just storybook,” head coach Cory Parker said. “It’s just those intangible things that carry us through hard moments and adversity in life.” Parker was part of a core that saw Aspen get close to a state title previously, but had graduated before the team finished in second place in 2010. In the championship run, a group of large and talented seniors led to a defensive-minded team that no other team in the state could match. They were one of 12 teams in the state to allow fewer than 1,000 points in 3A, doing so in a classification-most 27 games. Every other team in the triple digits had played at most 22 games. Opponents regularly scored in the 30s or lower while Aspen scored at least in the 50s. They paraded through league play with just one game decided by fewer than 10 points. Their closest final score was in the state semifinal against Sterling, winning by just five points. But for as little adversity as they saw on the court, it was off the court that the heart of the team was truly tested. Senior Lucas Lee lost his mother the night in between the team’s two home playoff contests, returning to set the tone with early scoring for the team’s home finale amidst a sea of white T-shirts with the words “Aspen Strong” and his number three on them. Parker missed some time attending the funeral of a close friend. Through the adversity, the bond of the team that made it so strong on the court supported it off. Parker was named 3A Coach of the Year and the Korpela twins — Shae and Braden — were named first-team all-state. Porter Lee was named to the second team and also took home Western Slope League Player of the Year honors. Lucas Lee was named an all-state honorable mention. — Rich Allen Your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers:""}]"

The first quarter moon will be on June 7. Considering their distance from us, they’re one of the nearest binary systems to our solar system. Despite that, because they’re so close to each other, they can’t be separated visually, even with a powerful telescope. It was a spectroscope that revealed Spica’s dual nature. A spectroscope is an instrument that splits light into its component colors and reveals the color shift between the two stars. It’s also thought that both stars are egg shaped, with pointed ends facing each other. This is due to their mutual gravity as they rapidly whirl around each other. The best viewing of Spica is spring and summer, so go out and look slightly more than halfway up in the southern sky. And while you’re looking at Spica, try to envision those two giants whirling stars.

City oil refinery for as long as three months due to equipment being damaged at the sprawling facility by last week’s “extreme and record-setting weather.”Grier Bailey, executive director of the Colorado Wyoming Petroleum Marketers Association and the Colorado Convenience Store Association, said “prices will be abnormally high in the next six to eight weeks” in Colorado as the 35% to 40% of the state’s gas and diesel market that is supplied by Suncor goes suddenly dry.“It’s not a cause for panic but I wouldn’t be surprised if there were more of those yellow bags on gas pumps,” Bailey said. “This is a big supply disruption for a large percentage of the market.”Motorists, he said, will start to see the impacts of the shutdown at Colorado gas stations “within a week,” though most of the price effects will be felt closer to the Front Range. He did not project how much of an increase per gallon motorists may see.The average pump price in Denver on Thursday was about $2.70 a gallon, according to GasBuddy.Suncor is the only oil and gas refinery in Colorado and processes about 98,000 barrels of oil a day. It also manufactures most of the asphalt used to pave Colorado’s roads and provides jet fuel to the market. The company says that 95% of what it produces in Commerce City stays in Colorado.Skyler McKinley, spokesman for Colorado AAA, said Colorado drivers will experience a “shock to the system” for the next couple of months. He doesn’t expect there to be fuel shortages, although individual gas stations might have to close for a day or two while waiting for fuel.“It’s going to be frustrating to motorists in the near term, especially when we’ve had every reason to expect declining gas prices,” McKinley said. Bailey said he has never seen a closure of the Commerce City refinery last this long over the past couple of decades he has studied the market. He holds out hope that gasoline suppliers in other states might be able to fill in some of the shortage Colorado will be experiencing over the next couple of months.Calgary, Canada-based Suncor said it hopes to have the plant back up and running by late in the first quarter of 2023, which means the closure could last as long as three months.“Consistent with our operational excellence and safe operating practice, on Dec. 24 it was determined that the entire facility would be shut down and put into safe mode to allow for the inspection of all units and repair of the damaged equipment,” Suncor said in a press release this week. “The inspection and repair of the damaged equipment is ongoing.”The company declined to provide any more information about the shutdown on Thursday when contacted by The Denver Post.

And then, on Tuesday, another fire broke out at Plant 2 as workers were shutting it down.The company said the fire was extinguished and no one was hurt. It also said that data gathered by air monitors around the refinery “did not indicate any acute public health concerns.”“Specifically, concentrations for all compounds measured remained below acute health guideline values before, during and immediately following the event,” the company said in an email.The Commerce City facility is the largest single source of air pollution in the state and is under intense scrutiny because of multiple air pollution violations. In 2020, the company agreed to a $9 million settlement with the state for its violations, and that settlement included more community air monitoring.Last summer, Suncor installed new automated shutdown systems inside two gasoline-producing plants at its Commerce City refinery to prevent a repeat of a 2019 malfunction that blasted a clay-like substance into the surrounding neighborhood.Bailey said the plant needs to “get back online in the safest way possible.” But he said the shutdown highlights the importance of the refinery to Colorado consumers and the state’s economy.“People like to take shots at Suncor in Commerce City,” he said. “It’s important to realize that they provide a pretty essential product and a pretty essential service.”Staff writer Judith Kohler contributed to this report Grier Bailey, executive director of the Colorado Wyoming Petroleum Marketers Association and the Colorado Convenience Store Association, said “prices will be abnormally high in the next six to eight weeks” in Colorado as the 35% to 40% of the state’s gas and diesel market that is supplied by Suncor goes suddenly dry. “It’s not a cause for panic but I wouldn’t be surprised if there were more of those yellow bags on gas pumps,” Bailey said. “This is a big supply disruption for a large percentage of the market.” Motorists, he said, will start to see the impacts of the shutdown at Colorado gas stations “within a week,” though most of the price effects will be felt closer to the Front Range.
