That would be the cure against Coronavirus. How it became viral: Because the audio file was distributed on Whatsapp, it’s hard to track back to its creation. However, we can track when people started to search for the terms Pelo and Biblia. It started in mid March, reaching its peak after the first week of April: A man from the Dominican Republic uploaded a video on April 7th claiming he had found the hair. It reached 84,000 views: Meanwhile, Colombian media reported that a local influencer had come under fire for claiming she had found a hair inside her bible. Answer: The U.S. Food and Drug administration issued a warning letter to a church that was selling the “Miracle Mineral Solution.” The agency said it is “not aware of any scientific evidence supporting their safety or effectiveness and they pose significant risks to patient health,"" and that it “is taking this action to protect Americans as part of its response to the global COVID-19 pandemic.” Background: Documented received a video made by Andreas Kalcker, an anti-vaccination advocate, which had over 120,000 views. In the video, he explains how “Miracle Mineral Solution,” a trade name for chlorine dioxide, a type of home made bleach was used by “a doctor that had contact with people that had been tested positive for Coronavirus. He took this medicine and then called me to say that he is ok.” While Documented can’t speak for that particular doctor, the FDA, CDC and other federal agencies have issued stern warnings against people taking chlorine dioxide, as it can cause kidney failure and developmental delays. “Un médico tuvo contacto con pacientes que dieron positivo por Coronavirus.

The chemical is used as a bleach in paper mills and by municipalities to treat water to make it safe for drinking. It\'s also used to decontaminate buildings, according to the CDC. If you were to eat or drink large amounts of chlorine dioxide, ""you might experience irritation in the mouth, esophagus, or stomach."" Exposure to high levels of chlorine dioxide and chlorite in animals before birth and during early development after birth may cause delays in brain development, according to medical studies. In May 2019, Amazon removed over a dozen books that unscientifically claimed that chlorine dioxide could cure conditions from malaria to childhood autism. One of the books, ""Forbidden Health,"" was written by Kalcker and promoted chlorine dioxide as an autism cure.

They are capitalizing on the public interest in coronavirus and people seeking financial help because of the economic destruction the virus has wrought. Answer: The link in this message is fake. The website has been removed by Blogspot and you cannot access any government coupons by following that link. Background: The coupon appears to be a reference to a program by the Colombian government labeled the Solidarity Income program. It provides 160,000 pesos to Colombians who are not eligible for relief under other government programs. The program will cover 3 million families, according to Colombian President Ivan Duque. If you live in Colombia and would like to know if you are eligible for the program, the Colombian government created this web portal where citizens can enter their ID to find out if they will be receiving support from the program: https://ingresosolidario.dnp.gov.co/. If you are not a Colombian national, this program does not apply to you. Answer: Neem is not a cure for the coronavirus. There is no vaccine available for coronavirus. While there is research on the benefits of neem in fighting coronavirus, there is still more work to be done. Background: In this video, a supposed doctor in Guayaquil, Ecuador claims to have the cure for the coronavirus — a simple tea brewed from the leaves of the neem tree. This deserves a close look, because neem is a promising homeopathic remedy in many parts of the world, particularly in India. The tree’s leaves have been used for thousands of years to help with different ailments. We found two studies that show it potentially has some ability to fight certain types of cancer. And there’s even a scientific study that examines neem’s ability to fight coronavirus — a study that claims neem is more effective than hydroxycholoroquinine at reducing the virus’s ability to replicate. However, the study isn’t peer reviewed yet and neem doesn’t appear to work just from brewing it in a tea. There’s a particular extract that could be helpful — and in reality, neem extract has dangers of its own. Even a small overdose can cause the body to produce too much acid, in which it acts like a poison and can cause seizures or loss of vision. According to one study, a woman lost her vision and showed reduced brain activity after she drank half a cup of neem oil. Answer: This is false. While most people recover from COVID-19 with mild symptoms, there is no research that suggests a good diet will lead to a recovery in six days. Background: Dr. Alonso Vega claims that a good diet can boost your immune system and prevent you from getting too sick or dying of coronavirus. Early on in the video, he even claims that your body can get over the COVID-19 sickness in just six days. This six-day claim is absolutely wrong. Yes, an estimated 81% will recover with mild symptoms. But that means 19% experience extreme pain and fall into severe or critical condition -- and falling into respiratory distress takes 8-12 days, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. If patients could simply avoid falling into a severe condition by eating a fruity breakfast, doctors around the world would have said this already. Vega’s coronavirus cure video has 3,418,528 views on YouTube. For starters, yes. He’s a real doctor. He is registered as a homeopathy practitioner in Costa Rica, and his name matches the contact information for his company, Bethesda.

A regular at the lectern, and often the only woman on stage, is Dr. Deborah Birx. In her role as coronavirus response coordinator, she has become one of the most prominent voices of the administration around this crisis. Her appearances are a cross between a war briefing and FDR\'s fireside chats. She mixes the minutia of disease transmission with deeply personal stories, then pivots to complex discussions of antibody testing for the virus. She scolds and reassures within minutes of each other. Her presence on the task force as been well-received in the world of public health, though recently, some comments have raised eyebrows. On Thursday night, she admonished the media about dire warnings of hospitals running out of beds. And she warned against discussions that New Yorkers need to be drawing up do ""not resuscitate orders"" because the region\'s hospitals have run out of beds and equipment. ""There is no situation in the United States right now that warrants that kind of discussion,"" she said. Birx continued in that vein, attempting to assure Americans that large proportions of the public won\'t get infected quickly. Coming on the night that the U.S. surpassed China with the most confirmed cases globally, Birx\'s comments drew sharp criticism on social media. The pushback came from some of the country\'s top academic epidemiologists. Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who has worked on modeling this virus,tweeted a lengthy rebuttalto her comment that there currently isn\'t data showing that 20% of population could get infected. ""The scenario Dr. Birx is \'assuring\' us about is one in which we somehow escape Italy\'s problem of overloaded healthcare system despite the fact that social distancing is not really happening in large parts of the US... That is unlikely,"" he wrote. Lipsitch called Birx\'s characterization of the current coronavirus situation in the U.S. ""rosy"" and even ""deceptive."" ""I desperately hope she is right, because much suffering will be avoided,"" Lipsitch noted. ""But reassurance that this is likely, or even plausible, with the disorganized track record of the US response, is false reassurance."" These reactions to Birx come as something of a surprise because she isn\'t just another random bureaucrat at a White House known for staff turnover. She\'s deeply respected in Washington diplomatic circles and among public health experts. Prior to being assigned to the coronavirus task force on Feb. 26 (the same day Vice President Pence was assigned to the body), Birx was the U.S. global AIDS coordinator. That\'s an ambassador-level job inside the State Department in which she oversaw the U.S. government efforts to combat the spread of HIV globally. She was appointed to the post by President Barack Obama in 2014. She\'s one of the few Obama-era holdovers at the Trump White House. Her job as AIDS coordinator included running the U.S. President\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the highly praised program launched by President George W. Bush that has gotten millions of people with HIV around the world onto life-saving anti-AIDS therapy. Before that, she spent nearly a decade running the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\'s global HIV/AIDS division. Officials in the White House say Birx was assigned to the task force because of her years of experience as an infectious disease expert and because of her work using data to help with the U.S. response to the global AIDS epidemic. And among many people who\'ve worked with her on HIV, Birx is held in high regard. ""She is seen as somebody who is totally driven by wanting to end the [HIV] epidemic as quickly as possible,"" says Jen Kates, senior vice president and director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""She\'s driven by data and results and getting the job done. I think the one thing probably a lot of people who know her well would say about her is she is driven to get the job done."" Kates says Birx\'s experience both in public health and as someone who knows how to work within the political structures of Washington make her well-suited for her new job as the nation\'s coronavirus response coordinator. ""You know, to say this is a huge assignment would probably be an understatement,"" Kates says. She adds that Birx is good at connecting with a wide range of audiences. When she ran PEPFAR, she knew how to make people care about those affected by HIV, Kates says. ""She\'s always tried to bring it down to a connection on more of a personal level,"" she says. ""Sometimes she\'ll talk about her own experience as a parent. Sometimes she\'ll talk about her experience working 30 years ago in the military and seeing the first HIV cases. But she always does try to make that connection, and I think that\'s one of the hallmarks of her leadership."" In the nightly coronavirus briefings, Birx often compares attacking the current pandemic to tackling HIV. On Thursday night, she said she believes the U.S. can be using a ""laser-focused"" response to the coronavirus outbreak, attacking the virus on a county-by-county level and tailoring the response to each individual community. ""Why am I confident that we can do that? Because we do that in Sub-Saharan Africa right now for HIV,"" Birx said. ""That\'s how we\'re stopping the epidemic there. So we\'ve done it. We\'ve done it in resource-limited settings. So I do believe we can transpose that approach here to the United States and be able to have granular data down to a GPS coordinate of a site of a clinic and hospital."" But even her fellow task force member Anthony Fauci from the National Institutes of Health who also is a specialist HIV has said that the U.S. doesn\'t yet have the data to do this. At times, Birx is the policy wonk. At times, she\'s the matriarch. On Wednesday night, in an appeal to young Americans to take social distancing seriously, she told a story about her grandmother during the 1918 flu pandemic. Her grandmother who was 11 years old at the time brought home the virus that ended up killing her great-grandmother. ""I can tell you my grandmother lived with that for 88 years,"" she said, as she called again for people to stay home. ""This is the message that is important to everybody. This is not a theoretic. This is a reality. You can see the number of deaths that are occurring. We all have a role in preventing them."" One of her biggest challenges may be keeping President Trump focused on how serious this unfolding public health crisis is. Trump has been regularly saying how eager he is to get the economy up and running again. The president at times downplays how bad the outbreak is or might become. He hit on this theme again Thursday night, talking about how he has heard of people who have COVID-19 who never went to the doctor or reported their case. ""You have thousands and — hundreds of thousands of cases like that,"" he said. ""So you have to add that to the caseload also. And the people that actually die, that percentage is — is a much lower percentage than I ever thought. That\'s one of the reasons I say, \'Look, we\'re going to beat this and we\'re going to get back to work\'."" Taming Trump\'s eagerness to restart the economy and his focus on jobs numbers while hospital administrators are making desperate pleas for medical equipment may be one Birx\'s big challenges. Birx has built up a reputation in the HIV/AIDS world as someone who is dedicated and trusted, says A. Toni Young, the head of Community Education Group, a nonprofit that does a lot of work around HIV. Young says that in this current crisis, she was relieved when she heard that Birx, along with Fauci, were on the White House coronavirus task force. ""When I saw she and Dr. Fauci, I said, \'We have a chance. We honestly have a chance,\' "" she says. ""Dr. Fauci, with his scientific perspective and Dr. Birx with her robust knowledge of public health and systems —that\'s what this is going to take. This is going to take knowing what all the systems do and how to pull the right lever at the right time."" Now the question is whether Birx can keep the White House and the nation focused on getting the right resources deployed at the right time to get this health crisis under control. Copyright 2021 NPR.

(WROC) — A miracle, that’s what doctors are saying after glue held a patient’s heart together and saved his life. Al Adams has only been out of the hospital for three weeks, and the glue that doctors at Rochester Regional Health used to fix his heart is still keeping him alive today. “Like I said I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for any of them. I’d be gone,” said Al Adams. 68-year-old Al Adams had a heart attack in September 2019 and had to be airlifted to Rochester Regional. While there, Adam’s says his heart burst and doctors had to use medical-grade super glue to put it back together. “Actually had a free wall rupture of his left ventricle which is very rare and often not survivable,” said Scott Feitell, director of heart failure, Sands-Constellation Heart Institute. His wife also making the journey to be by his side the whole time. “You were with me all the while,” said Adams. The lead surgeon for the case says what the couple went through it not something surgeons see often. “Its what we call a widow’s maker liaison. That’s how sometimes people die suddenly and you were able to survive that and then survive the rupture of the ventricle tear of the ventricle and the two eco runs later I can’t think of anyone who is luckier than you are,” said Soon Park MD, surgeon at Rochester Regional Health. After multiple surgeries, Adams was able to walk out of the hospital and go home. “So thankful because actually what happened was my heart burst while I was here also and they glued it back together. So I wouldn’t have made it,” said Adams. A medical device is pumping blood through Adams’ heart and he will carry this bag for the rest of his life, but Adams says other than that, his life hasn’t changed much. “I won’t be able to go swimming but to tell you the truth I don’t know how to swim anyway. So I really didn’t have to give up anything,” said Adams. Adams was able to walk out of the hospital, something doctors say is a miracle. He does have a permanent pump in his heart and will have to do check-ups every three months, but otherwise, he says he feels healthy and wouldn’t be alive today if it wasn’t for doctors at Rochester Regional Health.
