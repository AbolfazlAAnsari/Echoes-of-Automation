(WLOX/Gray News) - A Mississippi city is mourning the death of its oldest living resident, a World War II veteran who died hours before his 105th birthday. Willie James Smith Sr. died Monday evening, missing his 105th birthday by a few hours. The WWII veteran was the city of Moss Point’s oldest living resident. J.B. Carter, Smith’s 86-year-old nephew, sat with a heavy heart in his home Tuesday, as he mourned his uncle, who was known as “Daddy Willie.” “All those memories just welled up in me,” Carter told WLOX. Carter says Smith loved the Lord and was his role model for as long as he can remember. “He was blessed to have a full life. All he needed to do was work and go to church,” he said. “He had a chance to see his children grow up and his grandchildren, even his great-grandchildren.” Carter also remembers Smith as a WWII veteran, one of the oldest in Jackson County. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1941 and was honorably discharged in 1945. “If you started talking to him about the military, he’d go all day,” Carter said. “He told you about the places he had gone to and what he did in the military.” Moss Point Mayor Billy Knight knew Smith personally and says he should be remembered for the sacrifices he made in war so that we might be free. “He’s one of a kind,” Knight said. “He cared about this country. He’s a patriot. He passed all that and instilled that to us in different ways.” He describes Smith as a man born with a purpose to help others. “If you know what your passion is, it’s probably your purpose. Then, you need to work to carry out that purpose because it really does give you something to get up for in the morning when you have that passion about something,” he said. Moss Point’s flags were lowered to half staff to honor Smith. Smith was honored by the Hattiesburg African American Museum for his service during the war last October. At that time, he said faith is what got him through a long life. Copyright 2024 WLOX via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.'}]"
