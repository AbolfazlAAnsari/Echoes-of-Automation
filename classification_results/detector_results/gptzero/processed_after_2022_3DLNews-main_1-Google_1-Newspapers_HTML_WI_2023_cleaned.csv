But this method is not the most climate-friendly option, according to Blakely — her research focuses on alternative sources of bioenergy. The Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences invited Blakely to speak as part of their Climate, People and Environment Program Feb. 21. Blakely’s seminar centered around alternative bioenergy sources to maize or corn ethanol. As corn ethanol dominates as the current bioenergy source in the U.S., other sources of bioenergy may provide additional ecosystem services, which support the surrounding environment. Blakely researches these bioenergy sources, otherwise called alternative feedstocks, and their impact on carbon storage and the climate. If alternative feedstocks are replacing corn ethanol as a main bioenergy source, they should be more productive, grow in places corn cannot and provide benefits to their surrounding environments, Blakely said. One of these benefits is carbon storage. Immersive program teaches Wisconsin landowners about wooded property management In two studies, Blakely said she identified multiple other bioenergy sources from plants such as miscanthus, native prairie and sorghum to compare their carbon storage ability. Blakely then classified the plants as either a carbon sink or a carbon source. Crops that are carbon sinks take up carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, from the atmosphere. But crops that are carbon sources release more carbon dioxide than they absorb, meaning they contribute to climate change. Blakely said her research found that perennial crops are generally a carbon sink and annual crops are generally a carbon source.
