The soft-rocker also defeated Pink Floyd’s The Wall for Album of the Year honors. In 1981, Cross scored another hit with ""Arthur\'s Theme (Best That You Can Do)"" from the movie Arthur. The song was a chart-topping hit and added an Oscar to Cross’ growing trophy collection. Still, when it came time to release his sophomore studio album, Cross fell flat. Another Page failed to mach the commercial or critical acclaim of its predecessor; only “Think of Laura” was a notable hit. Cross released 13 more studio LPs, but none would match the success of his debut record. More recently, the musician toured with Todd Rundgren, Chicago’s Jason Scheff, the Monkees\' Micky Dolenz and Badfinger’s Joey Molland as part of an all-star 2019 celebration of the Beatles\' White Album.'}]"
