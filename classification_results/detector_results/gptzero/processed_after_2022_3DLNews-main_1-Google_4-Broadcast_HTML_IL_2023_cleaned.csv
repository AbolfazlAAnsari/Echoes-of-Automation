Central Bucks is well known both statewide and nationally for heated board meetings over masks and Pride flags, policies banning certain books and directives to not use students\' preferred names and pronouns. Accusations of discrimination against LGBTQ students have also led to an ongoing investigation by the U.S. Department of Education. ""I couldn\'t have my kids in a school district where these kinds of things were happening,"" Budden said. Standing in the Bucks County Democratic headquarters on election night, Budden sobbed when the results rolled in — Democrats took all five seats up for election. The room erupted in cheers; friends, neighbors and strangers hugged. ""It was very moving and a very joyous feeling from everyone,"" Budden recalled. ""And a sense of relief."" If there was a question about whether the conservative-led school board\'s policies reflected the will of the local community, Tuesday\'s election may have provided an answer. Three of the newly elected Democratic school board members will replace Republicans, including the board president, who helped set a right-wing agenda that aligned with national conservative movements around education. Voters effectively flipped the board from majority Republican to majority Democrat. Republicans also lost majority control of school boards in Iowa, Virginia and a historically conservative district neighboring Central Bucks. Central Bucks School District is the third largest in Pennsylvania with more than 17,000 students. It\'s also in a politically mixed, swing county. ""I wasn\'t supposed to win,"" said Democratic candidate Heather Reynolds, who beat the board\'s current president and sole Republican incumbent in the race. Reynolds\' newly won seat represents a part of the district that\'s more red than others, she said. ""I think that the community has had enough. They\'ve seen what this former board majority has done and they said, \'No more. We deserve better as a district, as a community. This isn\'t who we are.\'"" Reynolds said residents and parents were exhausted by the chaos that had become a normal part of monthly school board meetings. Fiscal responsibility was also high on their list of concerns, she said: In July, the board increased Superintendent Abe Lucabaugh\'s salary by almost 40%, making him the second-highest paid superintendent in the state after Philadelphia. Lucabaugh had stood by the board\'s controversial policies, even as the district spent at least$1 million on a law firm following claims of discrimination and more than $140,000 on a public relations firm that managed media requests, among other things. NPR reached out to Central Buck\'s Republican board candidates for comment; some declined to be interviewed and others did not respond. Only one candidate was willing to go on the record, Glenn Schloeffel. He said the results were disappointing. ""We put a lot of work into trying to get a successful outcome, and it didn\'t go our way."" Schloeffel believes the board majority got ""thrown under the bus"" after the accusations of discrimination. And he doesn\'t think it\'s fair to characterize their decisions around books as a ""book ban."" He said the books the current board removed from libraries ""were highly graphic and sexual in nature. Absolutely disgusting ... There\'s no place for that in our schools."" Republican candidate Steve Mass told the Delaware Valley Journal, ""The only winners in Tuesday\'s elections are the private schools, who will have their enrollment skyrocket in the next few years when parents see what policies are coming into our district."" Across the country, school board campaign funding seems to be on the rise. In 2018, a survey by the National School Boards Association reported 75% of elected officials spent less than $1,000 on their campaigns. But this election cycle, Central Bucks candidates raised about $600,000 combined, as of Thursday, according to campaign finance records. Local venture capitalist Paul Martino bankrolled the Republican campaigns and donated a majority of their funding — $239,000 of the $279,000-plus total. Martino – whose wife, Aarati Martino, ran for the board as a Republican this year – spent a total of $500,000on school board races across Pennsylvania in 2021. He also contributed $40,000 to the Stop Bucks Extremism PAC. During the campaign, the PAC mailed literatureto district homes with excerpts from the often-targeted books Gender Queer and This Book Is Gay. The mailer included the message: ""Extreme Central Bucks Democrats are fighting to keep these books in our middle school and high school libraries. Request an early vote ballot to protect our children!"" In total, the Democrats raised over $315,000. The Democrats\' PAC, Neighbors United, raised over $174,000. Its largest donations came from Turn Bucks Blue, a local PAC that supports Democrats throughout the county, and the Pennsylvania State Education Association. Much of the Democrats\' funding came from smaller individual donations, between $50 and $250. Each candidate also had their own PAC. ""We knew what [Martino] spent the last time, so we had to be prepared to respond to that,"" said Karen Smith, a Democrat who won her race as an incumbent. Martino declined NPR\'s requests for comment. District parent Elizabeth Derham identifies as an independent and has been disappointed with board leadership over the last two years. Derham\'s husband, Jeff, is also an independent and would sometimes split his ticket. But this year was the first time he voted blue down the line, along with Elizabeth. ""No one I talk to is for any of this stuff or cares much about some of the things that they\'re putting so much effort into,"" Elizabeth said of the board\'s conservative members. The Derhams said their votes felt like a small-scale attempt to save their local democracy — and their public school district. ""We just want the government to function... we\'re just tired of it,"" Elizabeth said. ""I just want people to listen to us."" Now that the election is over, she hopes Central Bucks school board meetings become boring again.

Ever since Chicago imposed restrictions on when and where migrants can be dropped off, more buses have been showing up in suburbs with no warning, straining resources and leaving migrants and people who live in those cities in danger. So far, for example, no migrant buses have shown up in west suburban Broadview, but Mayor Katrina Thompson believes it won’t be long until they do. She says it’s not that Broadview wouldn’t welcome them, but village officials need to know when and how many to expect. “We’re going to suffer from something that we can have a conversation about. It’s not that we don’t want them here. It’s just, we have to plan,” Thompson said. The mayor decided to take executive action, because the Village Board doesn’t meet for another two weeks. Thompson does have support for her order that would require bus companies to provide at least five days of notice or risk impoundment of the bus and fines. “If a bus should appear here, I would need resources of the Fire Department, because we don’t know the condition of these people who have traveled cross-country to get here,” Broadview Chief of Police Thomas Mills said. “There may be sick people, so we need Fire Department to help triage.” The village of Matteson, meanwhile, unanimously passed similar restrictions and consequences for “rogue” bus drivers and companies at an emergency meeting Thursday night. “Basically, this is to provide safety for our community and safety for anyone visiting our community,” Matteson Village President Sheila Chalmers-Currin said. And Oak Lawn is considering a plan to require local licenses to operate a bus within the village, on top of restricting extended stays at motels for migrants. Last week, city leaders in Aurora also placed restrictions on migrant buses, as did Chicago Ridge and several others suburbs that have been drop-off points for migrants. On Wednesday alone, Chicago reports that its suburbs saw more than 15 buses with migrants. That’s why places like Broadview are clamoring to get ahead of the issue. “By them taking it upon themselves to circumvent the rules that are already in place by the City of Chicago, (which is) requesting applications, is putting the migrants in danger,” Mills said. Most migrants being dropped off in the suburbs are being told to take trains into the city. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has said he will try and circumvent the restrictions by flying more migrants, as his state did last week. Submit Δ Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Press Forwardis raising money to bring more information and improve engagement in communities. Springfield will join Chicago, Alaska, Minnesota, Philadelphia and Wichita with chapters. The decline of local newsrooms has given way to a rise in misinformation and less governmental accountability. Those behind this project see it as a long-term investment in improving civic engagement. “This has to be a commitment of people who care about America,” said John Stremsterfer, President and CEO of the Community Foundation for the Land of Lincoln. “If we are going to turn the tide of what has diminished in the past two decades in local news and information, it’s going to take a lot of people.” Springfield’s involvement got started thanks toa $1 million gift from Patrick Coburn,the late State Journal-Register publisher. The John D. and Katherine T. MacArthur Foundation is matching that gift. Local contributors will also be sought. In the Community Foundation's original announcement about Coburn's gift, former co-worker Rich Saal said his legacy was quality community journalism. “Not only did he operate an outstanding newspaper – his legacy was his love of Springfield and the support he gave it. He was making gifts to all kinds of organizations and causes throughout his life,” Saal said. Coburn's sister, Maggie Cope, said his family was not surprised he left a generous gift to the city. “A tribute isn’t anything Pat would want,” she said. “He didn’t do this for attention or accolades. He was humble. What he would want – if anything – would be if people would look at him as an example. That those who have plenty might think about doing something similar to give back.” “For local news to be sustainable over the long term, communities will need to stand up and support their local news providers,” said John Palfrey, the MacArthur Foundation’s President. “We will need to invest in local news the same way we invest in arts and culture, hospitals and our alma maters.” The next step is getting a committee formed to determine the best way to move ahead. The American Journalism Project will lead the planning. Stremsterfer said it’s too soon to spell out what kind of coverage will be funded or what organizations, existing or new endeavors, could be awarded grants. He pointed out the endowment will be set up to serve the purpose for years to come. Only a portion – likely less than $100,000 per year at the beginning – will be given out. The first awards are likely 12-18 months away. The focus will be on Sangamon and neighboring counties the CFLL serves. Nearly all news organizations in the region have reduced staff in recent years. Daily newspapers provide more limited coverage. Some weekly newspapers have closed. Television and radio – including NPR Illinois – are also operating with fewer reporters. “We’re not unique in that respect. I think it’s more acute in smaller communities, communities our size and smaller, where you see diminishing newsrooms,” Stremsterfer said. “I don’t know if we’re in what they call a news desert, but it has gotten awfully dry.”""}]"

Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), are ready to make things physical, a trend that is setting off alarm bells on Capitol Hill. Republican and Democratic senators say former President Trump’s bombastic threats and insults, which have proved to be a winning political formula for the GOP, are catching on more broadly in Congress. Senators in both parties say they were shocked when Mullin, a first-term senator and Trump ally, challenged the president of the Teamsters to a fistfight in the middle of a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing, forcing the 82-year-old chair, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), to step in to keep blood from being spilled on his carpet. Mullin told the Teamsters leader to “stand your butt up” and sprung out of his chair while taking off a wedding ring to prepare for melee. The Oklahoma senator, a former mixed martial arts fighter, told CNN on Wednesday he had “full intentions” of pummeling the labor boss right there in the hearing room. “First thing I thought of when I stood up I thought, ‘I’m going to break my hand on this guy’s face’ and will take my wedding ring off,” he said. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who voted twice to convict Trump of impeachment charges and will retire at the end of next year, said that unfortunately, in his view, the Republican Party has become the party of Trump. He said Mullin’s attempt to challenge a witness to a brawl in the middle of a hearing was “clearly unfortunate.” “I can understand losing one’s temper,” he said. “But it’s more important to rein it in.” Romney said “there’s no question” there’s been a coarsening of political discourse in America. “I don’t think that President Trump created something in the population that wasn’t there, but he brought something out that had been held behind norms and comity that is now out in the open,” he said. “Have we coarsened our debates and our dialogue? No question.” The incident reminded some senators of Trump encouraging supporters to beat up protesters at one of his presidential campaign rallies in 2016. “If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them,” Trump told the cheering crowd. “I’ll pay the legal fees.” Trump’s use of violent rhetoric has since become almost routine. Last year, he said Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had a “death wish” because he voted for bipartisan legislation, asserting without evidence that the lawmaker supported the bills “because he hates Donald J. Trump, and he knows I am opposed to them.” In a Veterans Day speech last week, the former president vowed to “root out” the “radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country.” Some lawmakers worry Trump’s belligerent style is starting to spread throughout Congress and politics more generally. “It’s very concerning to me, and I feel like it really was unleashed by Donald Trump in the very beginning, in 2016, when he said I’ll pay your bail if you want to beat up a protester at the rally or ‘punch people in the face.’ All of that has gotten a sense of glorified attention and support, and it’s just gotten worse and worse,” Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) said of the brawl that nearly broke out at Tuesday’s committee hearing. “I worry about our young people looking at this. I worry about what this says about our society and respect for our society and respect for one another. And it leads to things like Jan. 6 and it’s OK to bust windows,” she said. Republican senators echoed Stabenow’s concern when asked about the heated confrontation. “It’s not the route that I’d like to see any of us go,” said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.). “I understand the reason why there was anger.” But he said “both individuals should have had a different approach to resolving it.” Rounds, who endorsed Sen. Tim Scott’s (R-S.C.) now-defunct presidential campaign because he liked its positive message, said “you’re seeing folks on both sides of the political spectrum being less respectful of other people.” Rounds observed that Trump recognized before most other politicians the anger brewing in American society and seized on it for political gain, but he warned it’s a dangerous path for the nation’s leaders. “I don’t know if he changed [norms] or simply responded to what he saw from other people. I think he sensed that the American people were allowing this to go on, and he’s taken advantage of it, but it’s not the direction that I think our country should go,” he said. “I really do believe that the Founding Fathers wanted us to get together here in Washington, work out our differences, and they do not expect us to be caning one another,” he added. Republicans accused Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) of threatening violence against conservative justices on the Supreme Court in 2020 when he warned that Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch “have unleashed a whirlwind” and “will pay the price” if they ruled against abortion rights. Schumer later acknowledged on the Senate floor “I should not have used the words I used” after Chief Justice John Roberts rebuked what he called the Democratic leader’s “dangerous” rhetoric. There was another awkward incident on Capitol Hill on Wednesday when Trump acolyte Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) essentially called her fellow Republican Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) “a p—-” after he said she lacked “maturity and experience.” Another Trump ally, House Oversight Committee Chair Jim Comer (R-Ky.) on Tuesday dismissed a Democratic colleague, Rep.

The actress said the stage 4 breast cancer has spread to her bones. Doherty, 52, was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015. After a mastectomy and chemotherapy, she went into remission. But the cancer returned in 2019. Doherty announced her diagnosis of metastatic stage 4 cancer in 2020. Earlier this year, she said the cancer had spread to her brain. A tumor on her brain was removed. The “Beverly Hills 90210” and “Charmed” star said she’s still undergoing treatment. “I don’t want to die,” she said in a recent interview with PEOPLE. “I’m not done with living. I’m not done with loving. I’m not done with creating. I’m not done with hopefully changing things for the better. I’m just not — I’m not done.” She continued, “When you ask yourself, ‘Why me? Why did I get cancer?’ and then ‘Why did my cancer come back? Why am I stage 4?’ That leads you to look for the bigger purpose in life.” Doherty told PEOPLE she hopes to get into clinical trials and would like to return to work. “People just assume that it means you can’t walk, you can’t eat, you can’t work. They put you out to pasture at a very early age — ‘You’re done, you’re retired.’ And we’re not,” she said in the interview. “We’re vibrant, and we have such a different outlook on life. We are people who want to work and embrace life and keep moving forward.” Doherty’s acting credits date back to 1981. Her first big role was as Jenny Wilder on “Little House on the Prairie.” Now, the actress is launching a memoir-style podcast, “Let’s Be Clear with Shannen Doherty.” It premieres Dec. 6 on iHeartRadio.

Please enter a search term. by: Dominick Mastrangelo, The Hill Posted: Jun 27, 2023 / 04:55 AM CDT Updated: Jun 27, 2023 / 04:55 AM CDT by: Dominick Mastrangelo, The Hill Posted: Jun 27, 2023 / 04:55 AM CDT Updated: Jun 27, 2023 / 04:55 AM CDT (The Hill) – Fox News made major changes to its weeknight lineup on Monday, shifting some of its top pundits into new time slots and signaling the beginning of a new era in primetime at the network. The changes, which go into effect next month, offer clues about the conservative media giant’s strategy ahead of next year’s GOP primary and presidential election. The reshuffling also comes amid a time of upheaval across the cable news business more generally and as Fox specifically deals with the fallout of a slew of legal headaches and controversies it has faced over its coverage of the 2020 election. Here are five takeaways. Jesse Watters, who got his start in Fox’s 8 p.m. hour as a correspondent for Bill O’Reilly’s program, is taking over Tucker Carlson’s primetime hour. That gives him the keys to what has, in recent years, ranked as the network’s most-watched evening hour. Carlson was ousted by the network last month and has since launched a version of his popular Fox program on Twitter. Watters was granted his own show at 7 p.m. last January and has reaped ratings success for Fox, consistently beating out other cable channels in that time slot. Like Carlson, Watters has been no stranger to controversy during his tenure at Fox. Dr. Anthony Fauci called for Watters to be fired a month before his solo show was launched after the host suggested activists ambush Fauci and go for a rhetorical “kill shot” to his credibility in the form of questions about a Chinese lab’s links to the coronavirus’s origins. “The only thing that I have ever done throughout these two years is to encourage people to practice good public health practices: to get vaccinated, to be careful in public settings, to wear a mask,” said Fauci, who has been public about the death threats he’s received. “And for that, you have some guy out there saying that people should be giving me a kill shot, to ambush me?” Fox defended its host at the time, saying his comments had been taken out of context. “Based on watching the full clip and reading the entire transcript, it’s more than clear that Jesse Watters was using a metaphor for asking hard-hitting questions to Dr. Fauci about gain-of-function research and his words have been twisted completely out of context,” the statement said. It was a key moment in Watter’s ascendance at Fox, as the network’s defense of his comments showed it was investing stock in one of the younger, more popular members of its roster. Monday’s lineup shuffle shows Watters, who had been widely viewed as the odds-on favorite to take over for Carlson, has solidified himself as a fixture that the network is now pinning its hopes for a key post on. Greg Gutfeld has been another one of Fox’s rising talents for months, and now he’s getting a chance to bring his flair for comedy to primetime. The network launched an eponymous Late Night comedy program for Gutfeld at 11 p.m. in 2021 and the conservative pundit has responded by beating out Late Night shows on the major broadcast networks for several weeks running. Fox’s experiment with Gutfeld paying off proves that there is an appetite for conservative comedy among its audience, and that the network sees this as a growth area where it can capitalize. Moving into primetime is likewise a significant milestone for Gutfeld, another co-host of “The Five,” who has worked himself from weekend host and comedian to a leading pundit now at the center of Fox’s daily programming during its most-watched hours. But the lights are brighter in primetime, and Fox is wagering Gutfeld’s style will land well in Ingraham’s former time slot as it looks to hold on to its outsized audience share in the hour before the late local news on the broadcast networks airs. Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham are two of Fox’s longest serving hosts and while Hannity is staying in his 9 p.m. time slot, Ingraham’s show is moving up three hours from 10 p.m. to 7 p.m. Ingraham’s Washington-based program focusing on politics and current events will replace Watters, who was given his first weekday solo show after anchor Martha MacCallum’s newscast was moved to mid-afternoons. Fox choosing to feature Ingraham’s conservative commentary at 7 p.m. shows it is committed to opinion-based programming in that hour and is now using one of its household names to kick off, instead of wrap-up, its nightly lineup of punditry. Replacing Watters at 7 p.m. could benefit Ingraham, who will now follow the network’s top-watched newscast at 6 p.m. and will have the advantage of reacting to the top news of the day three hours sooner each weeknight. Keeping Hannity and Ingraham in the primetime mix also suggests that Fox would rather bet on horses it knows can deliver ratings, rather than look outside its ranks to fill key vacancies and stay atop the ultra-competitive cable news business. Keeping Hannity and Ingraham in primetime shows Fox is not straying from pro-Trump commentary, as some critics on the right have suggested in recent months. Text messages from Hannity and Ingraham made public as part of the investigation into the Jan. 6 Capitol riot showed the two hosts pleading with Trumps’ aides to call the mob off, with Ingraham at one point writing the spectacle was “hurting all of us.” The episode was a clear window into the mutually beneficial relationship between Trump, an avid cable news watcher, and the conservative media figures that have long backed him. Watters and Gutfeld, meanwhile, have similarly used commentary supportive of Trump to boost their credibility with Fox’s conservative audience, much of which remains loyal to the former president. As the 2024 GOP primary heats up, the assembling of the four pundits suggests it is unlikely viewers can expect to see a pivot away from Trump on Fox in primetime anytime soon. Fox has always leaned on primetime pundits who appeal to conservative audiences. But in tapping Gutfeld and Watters for primetime shows, Fox News is leaning into the news-entertainment business given the voices of the two up-and-coming conservative media stars. Neither Gutfeld nor Watters are cut from the same kind of mantel as Carlson or Hannity. While Gutfeld has used explicit joke telling to grow his audience, Watters has more often relied on quirky and unorthodox segments to spark shock, awe and sometimes controversy during his nightly show. The pair’s ascendence also comes as Fox makes a push into entertainment programming on streaming, publishing stand up specials with controversial comedians like Roseanne Barr and Rob Schneider on its “Fox Nation” platform. As the news consumption habits of Americans change, and public polling shows more people are growing increasingly tired of partisan politics, Fox attempting to carve a lane out in the political entertainment space can be seen as an acknowledgement the world it operates in is changing rapidly.

However, Bruce, after federal prosecutors sought a stiffer sentence, went up to 102 months of imprisonment. On Nov. 17, Corruthers falsely certified she was buying the firearm, when she was buying it for Lafayette. Lewis admitted that she conspired to cover up the illegal purchases by having Corruthers report the gun stolen to the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department on April 26, 2021. Less than a month later, in May 2021, Lafayette used the gun in a shooting that led to the death of Champaign Police Officer Christopher Oberheim.
