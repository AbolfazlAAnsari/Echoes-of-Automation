I\'m Terry Gross. What\'s changing at Fox News? It paid a settlement of more than $787 million to Dominion Voting Systems. Fox fired its popular host Tucker Carlson. This week Rupert Murdoch officially hands over the titles chair of Fox Corp., Fox\'s broadcast arm, and News Corp., which publishes newspapers and books. My guest, Brian Stelter, is the author of the new book ""Network Of Lies: The Epic Saga Of Fox News, Donald Trump And The Battle For American Democracy."" It\'s a follow-up to Stelter\'s bestselling 2020 book about Fox called ""Hoax."" The new book is about how Fox helped spread the lie that Trump won the election. It also examines the secrets that were exposed about what Fox hosts and executives really thought about the conspiracy theories spread on Fox. Part of the book\'s focus is on Tucker Carlson, who was fired just after Fox settled with Dominion. Dominion Voting Systems was suing Fox for spreading baseless conspiracy theories alleging that Dominion rigged its voting machines so that Biden would win. Just before the trial was about to start, Fox decided to settle, presumably to prevent Dominion lawyers from exposing private communications from Fox News hosts and executives, revealing their hypocrisies. Stelter is the former chief media correspondent for CNN and hosted CNN\'s former Sunday program about the media called ""Reliable Sources."" Before that, he was a media reporter for The New York Times. He\'s now a special correspondent for Vanity Fair and host of the podcast ""Inside The Hive."" He\'s a producer on the Apple TV+ series ""The Morning Show,"" which is inspired by his first book, ""Top Of The Morning."" Brian Stelter, welcome back to FRESH AIR. Your book is really interesting, so thank you for coming back to our show. BRIAN STELTER: It\'s a great privilege. Thank you. GROSS: So this week is a big transition week from Rupert Murdoch to his son Lachlan taking over the reins. How do they compare in terms of their politics and management style and goals for Fox? STELTER: Well, Rupert Murdoch is, in his heart, a newspaper man. He believes he is a journalist. Yes, he comes at it from the right. He has certain very strongly held opinions. But he deeply cares about his newspapers and, to some degree, Fox News. His son Lachlan is, No. 1, in some ways, more conservative and, No. 2, much more business-minded. He\'s not nearly as interested in politics. He\'s not nearly as interested in the polling. He\'s a lot more interested in how much money he can rake in from campaign ad spending at his stations and on Fox News. So he comes to this as a businessman, and I suspect that means Fox is going to continue to be this beating heart of the GOP, supporting whoever becomes the nominee, most likely Trump this year. GROSS: Well, if Lachlan is focused on advertising, I mean, Tucker Carlson\'s extremism cost the network a lot of money. A lot of the sponsors pulled out. They had to rely on MyPillow (laughter) for - as a primary sponsor. STELTER: And that\'s one of the reasons why Lachlan eventually decided to cut ties with Tucker and fired him last August by canceling his show. It was a cold-hearted business calculation. And we can talk about all the reasons why it eventually happened. But I think it goes to show that Lachlan Murdoch, in the words of one source, is minimizing headaches and maximizing profits. He\'s going to do whatever the audience really wants, as long as it\'s not going to cause lots of headaches. And the thing about Tucker Carlson is he was causing a lot of headaches. GROSS: What about Lachlan\'s brother James? What\'s his relation to Fox News now and to his family? STELTER: Anyone who\'s watched ""Succession"" has a little bit of a sense of this because this is a very real drama. James is the more liberal son. He is the outcast at the moment. He is not involved at all in the family businesses. He\'s chosen to break ties from Fox and News Corp., in part because he\'s horrified by the content on Fox News. He says to his friends that it\'s poisoning America. He has a vision for what he would want Fox News to be. He would want to drag it back toward reality, back toward at least an imagined middle ground where facts and journalism were prioritized over the propaganda that currently airs. But right now, James has no ability to do that. He is - as I said, he\'s on the outside. He has a vote in the Murdoch family trust. So in the event of Rupert\'s death, James will have an opportunity to try to take over, try to team up with his sisters and take control of Fox Corporation. But for now, that\'s just in the distant horizon. For now, this is Lachlan\'s company. GROSS: I think James quit the board in 2020. STELTER: Right. He said goodbye - no more board meetings, no more grip-and-grins. But, you know, as his wife, Kathryn, once said to The New York Times, when you\'re a part of the family, it\'s never really over. GROSS: So there\'s - what? - eight votes in the trust - in the Murdoch trust? STELTER: That\'s right. There\'s eight votes. And right now, Rupert Murdoch has four of those eight, which is how he maintains control. So even though we\'re going to hear this week about his stepping aside, becoming chairman emeritus, what some of his aides call semi-retirement, I would really emphasize the word semi because Rupert is going to remain involved in various ways. GROSS: So it\'s a complex family with siblings from multiple marriages. But the siblings with votes are Lachlan, James and their two adult sisters. So where do those two sisters stand? STELTER: That\'s right, Elisabeth and half-sister Prudence. These are described as the adult children, the four adult children. There are two younger daughters who are now in college or beyond college. They are growing up, but they don\'t have voting rights. They only have financial stakes in the trust. So, you know, financially, they all benefit. But in the event of Rupert\'s death, it\'s going to be those four adult children who decide what happens to Fox Corp., what happens to News Corp., what happens to The Wall Street Journal and Fox News and all of these assets. It\'s possible they\'re going to be broken apart, sold off in pieces. It\'s possible the companies will be recombined, will come back together again the way they were a decade ago. There are all sorts of possibilities. GROSS: Yeah, what is Fox now? - \'cause Murdoch sold most of 20th Century Fox to Disney at the end of 2017 for $71 billion, and the children got, like, how many billions a piece? STELTER: Close to $2 billion each, which is why someone like James Murdoch is now off making his own investments, creating his own media company. Now, that 2 billion - that was important, you know, for Rupert to try to give stability to his children. But I also think that Disney deal is really important in retrospect, to realize Rupert sold at basically the top of the market. Listen to the conversation now, five years later, about cable assets, about broadcast, about the dying broadcast business, about streaming, the struggles to make streaming profitable. Rupert - for all of his faults, he seemed to see this coming, and he was able to sell his assets to Disney and get out of those businesses at a really prime time. Now, of course, they still have Fox News and they have Fox Sports and some other assets. But Fox News is the largest profit-driver by far. Fox News is what keeps them in their mansions and on their helicopters. GROSS: What lawsuits is Fox facing now? STELTER: Possibly the largest lawsuit is by Smartmatic. That\'s one of those voting technology companies that I had never heard of until the 2020 election; maybe you hadn\'t either. You know, these relatively obscure companies like Dominion and Smartmatic, these are the companies that help make our elections run, that provide the machines and the software to tally the votes. There were all sorts of conspiracy theories about both companies at the end of 2020. One of the claims was that they were actually the same company, when, in fact, they are not. So Dominion was able to very easily prove that the smears that aired on Fox were, in fact, lies. And a court in Delaware affirmed that earlier this year. All that stuff - it was just made up. Dominion, thus, had a lot of leverage to win a settlement and get almost $800 million out of Fox. But Smartmatic is asking for even more.

'HUMAN_ONLY', 'version': '2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Updated December 12, 2023 at 11:08 AM ET Controversy over last week\'s congressional hearing regarding antisemitism on college campuses continues to play out at Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania. Over the weekend, Penn President Liz Magill resignedafter calls mounted for her removal among students, faculty and donors. All eyes then turned to Harvard — which announced on Tuesday that its president, Claudine Gay, will keep her job amid intense pressure. Critics say Magill, Gay and MIT president Sally Kornbluth failed to convince Congress and the public that they can adequately protect their Jewish students. Those concerns largely erupted after the university presidents were asked whether ""calling for the genocide of Jews"" would violate their school\'s code of conduct. Many felt their answers were too legalistic and lacked moral clarityat a time when both antisemitism and anti-Arab and anti-Muslim incidents are on the rise in the country. But not everyone is in favor of their departure. A growing number of students and faculty oppose the calls for the presidents to go, arguing that such measures go against school values around independence and freedom speech. Here\'s what to know: On Monday, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., told Morning Edition that he supported Gay\'s removal. ""This wasn\'t the first incident,"" he said. ""Despite the fact that these incidents have been brought to the attention of the president of Harvard and the other presidents, there\'s been no action."" Gottheimer was one of the 74 members of Congress who signed a letter last week urging the governing boards of Harvard, Penn and MIT to remove their presidents. Congress continues to investigate their policies and disciplinary procedures. In an open letter on Sunday night to Harvard\'s governing boards, alum and billionaire investor Bill Ackman also accused of Gay damaging the university\'s reputation. ""Knowing what we know now, would Harvard consider Claudine Gay for the position? The answer is definitively \'No,\'"" he wrote, adding that the decision of whether to fire Gay ""could not be more straightforward. Earlier on Sunday, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who posed the question around the schools\' code of conduct, ominously wrote on X: ""One down. Two to go."" She added, ""@Harvard and @MIT, do the right thing. The world is watching."" On Monday, the executive committee of the Harvard Alumni Association expressed its support for Gay and asked the university\'s governing boards to publicly do the same. ""President Gay is the right leader to guide the University during this challenging time,"" the committee wrote. ""We are confident President Gay will address antisemitism, and other forms of hate, effectively and courageously."" Similarly, over the weekend, more than 650 Harvard faculty members signed a letter to the university\'s top governing board, urging it to keep Gay as president, The Harvard Crimson reported. They stressed that yielding to such political pressures is at odds with the school\'s values around academic freedom. ""The critical work of defending a culture of free inquiry in our diverse community cannot proceed if we let its shape be dictated by outside forces,"" they wrote, according to The Crimson. At MIT, the university\'s board said last week it stood by Kornbluth, adding that it has faith in her leadership, judgement and moral compass. ""She has done excellent work in leading our community, including in addressing antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hate, all of which we reject utterly at MIT,"" the MIT Corporation wroteon Thursday. ""She has our full and unreserved support."" College campuses have long been a flashpoint for political controversies but the turmoil unfolding on school grounds over the Israel-Hamas war is also unprecedented in many ways. Angus Johnston, a historian of American student activism at Hostos Community College of The City University of New York, said no issue in recent decades has divided student activists within the same school like the Israel-Hamas conflict. ""It is rare for there to be simultaneous protests on many American campuses where students are taking diametrically opposed positions,"" he said. That\'s not only a challenge to navigate for peers, but also for university presidents, who are balancing the interests of students, faculty, donors and even lawmakers. ""The presidents of MIT, Harvard and UPenn were under fire in a tense, polarized Congressional hearing. That\'s a unique and different environment for most college presidents,"" said Jason Shepard, a communications professor at California State University, Fullerton. He added that the current political climate is also complicated by social media, which can produce viral moments and knee jerk reactions. ""Ten-second snippets of viral videos can move like wildfire, and this sets up a whole new world for university presidents to effectively communicate with a broad and diverse range of constituencies,"" Shepard said. This moment in higher education might become even more perilous with the fall of another university president, Johnston said. ""There is a huge amount of pressure right now on college presidents to restrain student protests,"" he said. ""If we see the departure of another very high profile university leader, then that pressure is going to mount even further."" Copyright 2023 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.'}]"

PRICE Associated Press NEW YORK (AP) — The Republican National Committee’s rules for next year’s nominating contest and convention were released this week without addressing a question the GOP could well face next summer: Can the party’s delegates vote for a different candidate if the presumptive nominee is convicted of a felony? Former President Donald Trump is under four criminal indictments that will proceed through the GOP primary season, an overlap of legal and political calendars with no precedent in American politics. Fifteen states and American Samoa hold their GOP primaries on March 5, known as Super Tuesday, which is also the day after his first trial is scheduled to begin in Washington on charges that he unlawfully sought to overturn the 2020 election. Trump is dominating the Republican field and may secure much of the support he needs by Super Tuesday, by which time almost half of delegates who select the nominee at the GOP convention will have been awarded. Even if he were to be convicted in Washington or another trial, top party leaders and many voters have indicated they would stand by Trump anyway. And Trump and his allies are pushing to dismiss and delay the trials and have worked with state parties to craft rules favorable to him. The RNC rules don’t include any provisions specific to the unprecedented scenario unfolding. Bound delegates must vote for a particular presidential candidate at the convention based on the results of the primary or caucus in their state. As in past years, every state party must bind its delegates to vote for their assigned candidates during at least the first round of voting at the national convention, with limited exceptions for a small number of delegates. A candidate wins the nomination if they clinch a majority, which is 1,215 delegates. At next year’s convention, which starts July 15 in Milwaukee, there will be opportunities to tweak the rules when they are adopted or to suspend them, which can require two-thirds of delegates to approve on a vote. “It’s a parliamentary body,” said Benjamin Ginsberg, a Republican election lawyer. “It can always work its will if it wants to one way or another.” Such last-minute maneuvers are difficult to organize and there are few current signs that delegates might look for another option even with Trump’s criminal cases looming. “They’re all going to be chosen at contests in which people are voting for Trump and I think they’re unlikely, if he wins the primary, to change up because of a court case,” Ginsberg said. The Trump campaign issued a preemptive warning anyway. “Any attempt by any swamp rat, by any Washington, D.C., swamp rat, to mess with the rules will be summarily crushed by those of us that know how to run conventions,” said Trump advisor Chris LaCivita, who was a senior consultant in charge of rules and floor operations for the RNC in 2016, a year when some Trump opponents considered challenging him at the convention. One contingency section of longstanding party rules would allow the RNC to free a state from the rules prior to the convention if “compliance is impossible” and “the Republican National Committee determines that granting such waiver is in the best interests of the Republican Party.” Such a waiver would require action by the Republican National Committee’s executive committee, which is made up of 29 members, including RNC chair Ronna McDaniel. The RNC declined to comment on the possibility of the rules being suspended in the case of the nominee being in jail but instead pointed to recent interviews in which McDaniel was asked if Trump should be the nominee if he’s convicted of a crime, and she said the party would support the nominee that the voters choose. “I know this is newsworthy, but, as party chair, I’m going to support who the voters choose. And, yes, if they choose Donald Trump — the voters are looking at this, and they think there is a two-tiered system of justice. They don’t believe a lot of the things that are coming out in this,” McDaniel said in a Nov. 12 interview on CNN’s State of the Union. “They’re making these decisions. And you’re seeing that reflected in the polls.” Republicans award delegates to candidates based on their performance in state presidential caucuses and primary elections, which kick off in January and run through June. Delegates can be unbound by state parties if their assigned candidate drops out, something Trump seems unlikely to do as he has made his criminal cases the central focus of his campaign and declared the charges to be politically motivated. Unlike in 2016, when the complex delegate process tripped up Trump’s then-novice team, he has a more experienced campaign team for his third White House bid, including LaCivita, and his political aides have been working for years to craft rules in the delegate battles that are favorable for a frontrunner, as he is poised to be. And unlike in 2016, when a large faction within the party resisted Trump’s candidacy, the Republican Party has transformed under Trump. He has more loyalists throughout the state and national parties, making it even more unlikely there will be a repeat of the late-stage, failed effort at the 2016 convention when some activists loyal to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz tried to make last-minute changes to free delegates. ___ Associated Press writer Alanna Durkin Richer in Boston contributed to this report. 23 hours ago in ""I like (my job) because normally victims don\'t have a voice, and I like being that voice,"" McDaniel said. 1 day ago in The pool should be filled with water by the end of the day today. 1 day ago in Entertainment Thirty years later, Nicole\'s three sisters want her remembered for more than those static images or the violent way she died.

Concern about the rise of China has been an early feature in the 2024 U.S. presidential race. Some 58% of Americans say it\'s a critical threat, according to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, which shared its survey data exclusively with NPR ahead of the Biden-Xi meeting on Wednesday. ""A record level of Americans now see China as a critical threat to the United States,"" said Dina Smeltz, senior fellow for public opinion and foreign policy at the Chicago Council. The council has been polling Americans on China since 1990. ""It\'s also the first time in any of our polls that we saw that a majority — some of it\'s a slim majority — of Republicans, Democrats and independents all see China as a threat,"" Smeltz told NPR. Loading... China has loomed large in the Republican primary race, with candidates battling it out in ads and debates to see who can be toughest. The Chicago Council found that concerns about China are particularly pronounced among Republicans, with 71% saying China is a critical threat, and an overwhelming majority saying U.S. leaders aren\'t paying enough attention. That compares to 52% of Democrats and 53% of independents describing China a critical threat. This rising concern about China may be as much about political leaders talking about the threats as the public coming to it on their own. Former President Donald Trump talked about China constantly during the 2016 campaign and made tariffs on Chinese goods one of his signature policies. Then came the COVID pandemic, which Trump — now the frontrunner in the Republican primary — still refers to as the ""China virus."" So the spike in Republican concern is not surprising, said Elizabeth Saunders, a professor in the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. ""We have so much evidence in political science that people pick the candidate they like, and then they adopt that candidate\'s views as the ones that they prefer."" While foreign policy is not the kind of top-of-mind policy issue that drives voter decision — like abortion rights or economic issues — it is something that helps presidential candidates build a narrative of being tough and standing up for America, Saunders said. ""At the moment, China is the easy thing to be tough against,"" she said. At a rally in South Florida last week, Trump peppered his long and meandering campaign speech with references to China, warnings about ""World War Three,"" and assertions that things would be better if he were in charge. On the GOP debate stage last week, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis went after opponent Nikki Haley for allowing a Chinese company to acquire land near a military base when she was governor of South Carolina, echoing a negative campaign ad his super PAC has had in heavy rotation. ""We need to get serious about the top threat that this country faces, which is the Chinese Communist Party,"" he said. Haley, a former U.N. ambassador, has pledged to cut off trade with China to try to stop fentanyl imports. She hit back at DeSantis implying he was soft on China because he wouldn\'t commit to doing the same. At a recent campaign event in New Hampshire, she said China is ""on the march,"" raising alarms about its weapons development. ""They\'re all trying to out-hawk each other,"" said Saunders. Loading... President Biden has also sought to elevate China as his top foreign policy concern, though his administration\'s attention has often been diverted to other parts of the globe, including marshalling support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia, and more recently, backing Israel after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas. Biden has focused on building alliances in the Indo-Pacific to counter its might, and kept Trump\'s tariffs in place while boosting subsidies for U.S. companies making microchips and electric vehicles. ""China is determined to dominate the electric-vehicle market by using unfair trade practices, but I will not let them,"" Biden told a group of United Auto Workers union members in Illinois last week. ""I promise you."" Earlier this year in a closed-door fundraiser Biden described Xi as a dictator, adding strain to an already tense relationship. But most of the time he takes a more measured tone. ""We seek to responsibly manage competition between our countries so it does not tip into conflict,"" Biden said at the U.N. General Assembly in September. ""I\'ve said we are for de-risking, not decoupling with China."" Saunders said she expects Republicans are already crafting their attacks on Biden for his meeting with Xi to describe him as being weak on China. But for Biden, the political risk may not be very high. Even though voters are worried about China, domestic issues like crime, immigration, the economy, abortion rights and pure partisanship are far more likely to drive voting decisions.
