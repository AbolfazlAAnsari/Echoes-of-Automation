Crosse? The biggest thing is recovery from the pandemic. Right now, supporting small businesses in my eyes is the number one priority. We have to be a little bit creative in finding funds for them. I don\'t know if we can tap into the reserve fund that we have for the city or not, but I know for sure that we can definitely suspend some of the fees and licenses, get creative with some of the permits and relax regulations so that we make it easier for small businesses to survive the next year or two. What do you think is the city\'s most urgent economic issue and how do you propose to address it? I think recovering from the pandemic of course but not just for small business. I think everyone needs a little bit of relief. It would be nice to see our property taxes freeze for the next three to four years. Even for people who don\'t own businesses, they did get hurt with the economy, the way things are. There are some sectors like big companies that did prosper last year. I think most of the regular people have felt the pain. We should start looking into ways of bringing people downtown and around the city, try to jumpstart tourism again, bring all the players to the table. We have to work together to get out of this slump we\'re in. What is your assessment of community/race relations and policing in La Crosse? Do you think improvements are necessary and if so, what would they entail? We always need to improve. With that said, I think we\'re doing very well as a community. We need to celebrate our different cultures. We need to eliminate fears and prejudices and just encourage acceptance. I think celebrating our differences would bring everyone together. We can continue the police outreach and all of the community efforts that they\'re doing, maybe just encourage them to do a few more of these.

(WILX) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture is warning that 67 percent of deer tested in Michigan have COVID-19 antibodies. Despite the presence of COVID antibodies in two thirds of white-tailed deer tested in Michigan, the USDA says there is no evidence people can get the disease by eating meat from an infected animal. But it does leave some hunters worried. “The only place I’d be concerned if it were transmittable in the meat because I make them very medium rare,” Hunter Tom Kanalas said. Kanalas is an avid hunter, and he says he’s not surprised 67 percent of the 113 deer tested came back positive for COVID antibodies. However, he’s more concerned about other diseases that deer can carry. “I don’t look at it as something I’m fearful of, I’m more concerned about chronic wasting disease (CWD) than I would COVID,” Kanalas said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture agrees, saying there’s no evidence animals, including deer, play a major role in spreading COVID-19 to humans. “I would assume there will be some guys and people that are concerned, I can’t speak for anybody else but In all majority of the guys I know wouldn’t be affected by it,” Kanalas said. The USDA says hunters can get infected with many other diseases when processing or eating game, and says hunters should always practice good hygiene. Kanalas told News 10 despite being concerned about eating the meat raw, he has no hesitation of going out and hunting. “In fact, it might make me hunt even more out there because it’s not always about the harvest, it’s about getting with nature and God. So no it won’t have any impact at all,” Kanalas added. Michigan’s 67 percent positive antibody rate among deer was the highest of four states tested. The USDA says of the deer that tested positive, there were no signs of COVID-19 symptoms. Copyright 2021 WILX. All rights reserved.
