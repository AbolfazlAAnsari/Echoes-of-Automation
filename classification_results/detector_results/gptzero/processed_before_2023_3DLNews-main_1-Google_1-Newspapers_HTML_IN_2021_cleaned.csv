Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:25 pm According to research found on the CDC website, most Americans live within 5 miles of some kind of pharmacy. For many people, pharmacies are often the hub where some of their most vital medical needs are met — whether that’s through a simple prescription refill or a quick trip for a checkup that they don’t believe warrants a hospital visit. And while pharmacies have always been a critical part of any community, their roles and responsibilities nationwide have also increased over the course of the past two years: providing COVID-19 testing and vaccines on top of their regular duties. As of Dec. 9, for instance, more than 187.4 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine had been administered and reported by pharmacies involved in the U.S. government’s Federal Retail Pharmacy Program, per the CDC. Around that same date, news broke that the United States crossed the threshold of 200 million COVID-19 vaccines, meaning around 93% of them had been handed out in a pharmacy setting. Through October in Indiana alone, the CDC noted that Hoosier pharmacies had given out well over 2 million COVID-19 vaccines or boosters, and that number likely increased dramatically with the addition of COVID-19 vaccinations for children last month. And though the results of their efforts have been life-saving, some experts also say it’s all been taxing on the profession as well — from burnout and staffing issues to long lines and frustrated customers. Pharmacy staffing issues are not anything new. That was the sentiment shared recently by Dr. Veronica Vernon, president-elect of the Indiana Pharmacists Association and an assistant professor of pharmacy practice at Butler University’s College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences. The issue has been building for a few years now, she said, and she feels the state would have been likely having the conversations they’re having now a few years down the road. But the pandemic seemed to speed up and exacerbate the issues. “What we’ve seen as a result of that is many open positions right now in both pharmacists and technicians,"" Vernon noted in a recent phone interview. ""Many of them feel like they don’t want to work anymore in a setting where they feel burned out or stressed. They’re constantly being pressured to fill as many prescriptions as possible and take on all these new tasks as well. ""And they’re just tired,"" she continued. ""The pandemic has really worn our pharmacists and technicians around the state down. They’ve truly been heroes during this whole pandemic, but they’re just getting worn down.” Vernon added that these new pandemic roles are also leading some pharmacy employees to work 12 to 14 days in a row in order to help provide coverage so their facilities won’t have to close down or shift their hours. And that’s concerning, Vernon said, especially from a safety perspective. “We want to make sure that pharmacists and technicians can take their time to make sure your prescriptions are filled properly and that patients receive proper information,” she noted. “Your pharmacist also wants to spend time with you talking about those prescriptions and making sure they’re used appropriately. But with everything new added on with the pandemic, it’s been a real challenge to have that one-on-one time.” Some pharmacists and technicians are leaving the profession and the health care industry altogether, too, Vernon noted, opting for careers with a slower and less hectic pace. Vernon said she doesn’t fault people for leaving the pharmacy profession, admitting that she’s spoken to some in the field who wonder when it will ever get better. Even the recruitment of new pharmacy employees to help alleviate the burden of staffing issues is also difficult right now, Vernon acknowledged. “The Indiana Professional Licensing Agency, which is where the Indiana Board of Pharmacy is housed under, they’ve been experiencing their own shortages as well,” she said. So all that backlogs the system, Vernon added. The application process slows down, along with the time it takes to approve background checks and get potential employees through the education and training process. One pharmacy manager recently told Vernon that she had been waiting two months for a response to an application. In other words, Vernon noted, there are qualified people ready to help, but it’s just difficult to get them in the door. Perhaps the impact is felt worse in those small communities that rely the most on pharmacies for support, Vernon indicated. “If those smaller town or rural-area pharmacies have to close (because of staffing), that can be really devastating because you wouldn’t have a pharmacy in your hometown to get your medications quickly,” she said. “Then there are also the independent pharmacies, the ones that aren’t retail like a Walmart or Walgreens. They are also just as integral to so many people on local levels. Losing any of them, or having to have them shift their open times, that can be so damaging to a community.” Kathy Condo is a pharmacist at Herbst Pharmacy in Kokomo, and like Vernon, she, too, said she’s seen the impact of the pandemic on pharmacies firsthand. “We have been actively involved with vaccine administration and all the education that surrounds the vaccines and virus,” Condo said in an email. “… The added workload of scheduling, administering and documenting vaccines has certainly been a challenge.

But staffing issues aren’t the only impact being felt at pharmacies. There’s the impact of drug shortages, too, which can be as frustrating to pharmacy employees as they can be to consumers. “It used to be that people would go out to their pharmacist and say they needed a medication, and the pharmacist would say, ‘Well we’re out of stock, but we can get it in 24 hours,’” Vernon said. “That was the norm back then. But that’s not the case anymore. It’s taking weeks or longer, and we’re told by suppliers that we don’t know when we’ll be able to get the medications. That’s obviously concerning.” The American Society of Health System Pharmacist has a list of drug shortages that is accessible online. As of right now, the list is over 76 pages long and has over 700 entries. “It’s a constant list,” Vernon said, “and it’s a constant headache for those who need those medications to survive.” And many of these medications — especially if they are being used to treat rare conditions — don’t always have alternatives that might be in stock, Vernon added. So what are the solutions to these challenges and impacts? They’re not always as easy as they sound, experts pointed out. Vernon said she understands that changing state laws or overhauling pharmacies aren’t viable short-term solutions for the chaos that the profession is seeing these days, but she believes there are steps that can be taken to alleviate some of the added stress the industry’s employees are currently seeing. Adding more COVID-19 testing and vaccine sites, for example, are potential steps of action.

It took a lot of effort by a lot of people - members of the city council, Board of Works, Mayor Bryan Wyndham, the city attorney, fire chief and firefighters worked together - to figure out a way to purchase this, evaluate its design and get it here today.\x94 The department, which goes out on approximately 550 calls for service annually, has not purchased a new engine in more than 20 years. In Bradenton, Florida, Pierce Manufacturing Inc. built the engine using the specifics customized for the needs of the city fire department. Bennett explained the \x93Saber\x94 chassis is designed with advanced visibility, allowing for bigger cab space for both the firefighters and their equipment while traveling to calls, improved ergonomics with a lowered hose bed for the water supply and hose lines, increased compartment space for storage of tools to handle the wide variety of emergency responses. Bennett highlighted a unique safety measure visible to the public. An LED water gauge showing four colors on both sides of the engine allows firefighters to keep an eye on the water levels inside the tank on the engine while working to put out fires. The engine also has a rear back-up camera on the engine and overall LED lighting. \x93We wanted an engine that would be ready for whatever situation we might face when called out to serve the community,\x94 said Bennett. \x93The community deserves this, and so do the guys who are dedicated to serving this community.\x94 Officials expect the engine to be fully in service at the end of February. Firefighters will undergo more training on the new engine with the manufacturer in the coming weeks while organizing and equipping the engine. \x93We\x92re used to a truck that was 20 years old,\x94 he said. \x93So we are going to have to get used to a new design.\x94 The city fire department is undergoing much-needed renovations (taking over the Brazil Police Department\x92s vacated offices at City Hall). It has also recently replaced the more than 15-year old self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) equipment. \x93These equipment improvements are a big deal, firefighters have maintained the equipment well but the wear and tear of years of use requires updates and replacement,\x94 said Bennett. \x93Mayor Wyndham was a big help in making both of these new equipment projects a priority last year, and I\x92m thankful\x94. Bennett said the planning and design team felt it was also important to remember the fire service\x92s history. They added a silver Chrome bell to the front of the chassis. \x93It\x92s what they used to use to alert people back in the horse, and buggy days when there was an emergency. Since the invention of sirens, the bell became a signal that all was well, the call to service was over while returning to the station,\x94 Bennett said, adding the department had such a bell on their fire engines for many years but had to remove it and place it in storage back in the mid 1990\x92s We wanted to honor that history by adding a new bell to this engine.\x94 Posting a comment requires free registration:'}]"

The district's 2020 bankruptcy filings totaled 6,833 – 73 business and 6,760 personal – the lowest levels in at least two decades. Data for 2001 are the earliest available online. Business fallout Nationwide, total filings of 544,463 were at the lowest level since 1986, officials said in a Jan. 28 news release. The only category with an increase last year was Chapter 11, which included 7,561 business reorganizations. That was a 19% increase compared with 2019. Chapter 11, commonly known as bankruptcy reorganization, allows a business to propose a reorganization plan that includes debt repayment. The move allows a business to remain open and temporarily stops foreclosure and other debt collection efforts, according to the U.S. Courts website. The news that various local restaurants – and other small businesses – have closed wouldn't necessarily show up in bankruptcy statistics, Welling said “A business can obviously close and not go bankrupt,” she said. A restaurant owner, for example, might not be able to break even when the dining room's capacity is limited. But that same business might be able to cover monthly lease and utility payments – at least for a short time – if it doesn't pay staff or food suppliers, Welling said. It's also possible the restaurateur wouldn't be forced to make full lease or mortgage payments if the landlord or lender agrees to temporarily suspend collection. Some business owners are receiving financial support through public and private grants designed to help them stay afloat until they can fully reopen, Welling said. “I think a lot of those businesses are doing exactly that,” she said, adding that she believes some local restaurants that are closed will reopen when capacity limits are lifted. Chapter 7 business bankruptcy filings – the chapter that usually leads to liquidating assets – totaled 54 last year in all of Indiana's northern district, which also includes South Bend, Gary, West Lafayette and Muncie. The district recorded only nine Chapter 13 business bankruptcy filings in 2020. Families in need The seeming disconnect between bankruptcy filings and many families' and business owners' reality mirrors the fallout from the Great Recession, which began in 2007. New bankruptcy filings didn't peak until 2009 in Indiana's northern district, when the total hit 19,266 – or almost three times last year's amount. Nationally, filings steadily increased after the Great Recession began until they hit a high in 2010 with 1.6 million – also almost three times the 2020 number. Bankruptcy filings could increase after various assistance programs expire, including temporary reprieves from mortgage and student loan payments. Economists have pointed to 2020's two-month national shutdown of all but essential services and ongoing business restrictions as unprecedented in U.S. history. The closures caused a 33% plunge in second-quarter gross domestic product, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Rachel Blakeman, the Purdue University Fort Wayne Community Research Institute's director, refers to SNAP benefits statistics to measure residents' financial pain in real time. The program, previously known as food stamps, provides financial support to help poor families buy food. Indiana officials post SNAP program payments online by county. Not only has the total number of families receiving benefits increased during the past year, but so has the amount each family receives, Blakeman said. That indicates the recipients' income levels have fallen and they qualify for more government assistance. In Allen County alone, the value of SNAP benefits almost doubled from May 2019 to May 2020 to $7.9 million. The average benefit per person was $121.38 in January 2020, before the pandemic began. It jumped to $176.87 in May of last year for Allen County recipients. The highest amount paid to county residents last year was in May, Blakeman said. But after several months of declines, the total bounced back up to $7.4 million in December. Blakeman doesn't rely on bankruptcy filings to measure local need. A delicate balance Welling, the bankruptcy attorney, agreed that bankruptcy filings aren't necessarily a good barometer of widespread economic devastation. The three most common situations pushing people into bankruptcy, she said, are high medical bills, divorce and overspending. “To see how people are hurting right now because of the pandemic, I'd say look at the food banks and social services,” she said. The Rev. Roger Reece, executive pastor for Associated Churches of Fort Wayne and Allen County, oversees a local network of neighborhood food pantries, where demand is 25% to 28% higher than last year. The nonprofit doesn't usually help with rent or utilities, but the United Way of Allen County and some other donors are allowing Associated Churches to use funds for hardship relief related to COVID-19, Reece said. “And that (demand) is up tremendously,” he added. “It's a mess right now for these people who are struggling. Our money is going quickly out of our COVID fund.” Reece estimated the fund is paying out about $1,500 a week in hardship relief. But that's not the nonprofit's main mission, so he has to keep an eye on food supplies to make sure there are enough to serve hungry families. The organization's food banks feed more than 4,800 Allen County residents each week, he said. Money gets directed to the food banks, as needed. But it's a delicate balance. “In some ways, it's almost easier to get food” from other sources, Reece said of families in need. “Once you get evicted and are out on the street, you've got a bigger problem.” “There's a lot that the general public doesn't see. A lot of hurting. A lot of poverty,” he added. Welling said families focused on getting through each day aren't worried about filing for legal protection from creditors. “Bankruptcies are in their heyday when the economy is good, when credit is easy,” she said. Filers “can lose their wages, they can lose their home.” Families with nothing to lose don't need bankruptcy. “If you're not working,” she said, “those lawsuits can stack up forever.” sslater@jg.net Your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers:""}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:18 pm The Indiana State Police S.W.A.T. team brought home some impressive hardware from last summer’s prestigious Connecticut SWAT Challenge. But the real winners may turn out to be the citizens of Indiana served by the ISP’s S.W.A.T. teams, which consist of three different teams of specially trained troopers in the state’s north, central and south geographic areas. Ten members, representing each of those three S.W.A.T. teams, traveled to West Hartford, Connecticut, in August to compete against 23 other specially trained emergency response teams in the Connecticut SWAT Challenge. This year, the Indiana State Police entry finished second, the highest placing ever for the ISP at the event. The Indiana delegation has competed five times at the challenge. According to a news release, the competition is designed to pit law enforcement and military SWAT teams from around the nation against each other in both team and individual head-to-head competitive events, tactical training seminars and other activities designed to enhance the leadership and professional development of tactical teams nationwide. The competitive events in these challenges are generally designed to replicate real-world tactical situations, such as hostage rescues, tactical medical rescues or high-risk warrant service scenarios. Teams apply their knowledge, experience and physical abilities to accomplish each event’s objectives safely and successfully in the fastest ranked times This year’s event was won by the Central Region ERT B team, which consists of officers from the city of Bristol and the towns of Southington, Plainville, and Plymouth in Connecticut. Teams are ranked according to their finish in seven different competitions, with one point awarded for first place, two for second and on down the line. The Central Region ERT B team finished with 29 points. The Indiana State Police S.W.A.T. team finished with 32 points. The Connecticut State Police team placed third with 41 points. The ISP averaged just over a fourth place finish in seven events, and was the only entry to win two individual team events this year. Troopers are used to winning competitions at other venues, but a second-place finish in August’s loaded field was a real feather in their caps. “The second place means more to me just because of the level of teams that show up,” Sgt. Jim Stanley of South Bend said. Even more than the hardware, the troopers also bring back valuable training tips and practices from networking with some of the finest emergency police responders in the eastern part of the country. Improving on ways to respond to emergencies could potentially save a life, if not multiple lives on the streets of Indiana. “The most important thing is to be able to talk to other teams about what they’re doing,” Stanley said. Each individual event is sponsored by a company which specializes in equipment for emergency response teams. “We get the opportunity to get our hands on the latest and greatest,” Trooper Andy Cochran of Warsaw said. The Connecticut SWAT Challenge starts with individual competitions, meant to not only test the ability of the competitors but to hone their real world responses in a crisis. Then comes the team competition. Teams are given scant information prior to be thrust into a scenario. In one of the competitions, Trooper Chris McCreery of Kendallville had to draw his weapon from the driver’s seat of a police car and then hit targets from that awkward position. After registering enough “hits,” he got out of the car and had to shoot from two stacked cinder blocks. Once he had the required number of hits, he was given a color. He then radioed that color to a teammate, who had to use a sniper rifle to hit two colored golf balls at a distance of 50 yards. All of the competitions have a timing element. Time is added for every missed shot as well, preventing competitors from just spraying a bunch of ammunition and hitting targets. Such spraying techniques in the real world could lead to innocent people being put in danger. Being judged on accuracy and speed makes for better responses in actual emegencies. “We’ve added that element back here,” McCreery said. Shooting fast isn’t enough. S.W.A.T. members also have to be incredibly accurate. Then again, in their line of work, taking a long time to squeeze off a perfect shot in a traditional target shooting competition could get them killed. Speed and accuracy are needed. It’s impossible to simulate the stress of being in a shoot-out with a bad guy. But the organizers of the event in Connecticut have worked out ways to make it close. One of the competitions involved snipers have to submerge in large trashcans filled with ice water. They have to sit in the containers for 50 seconds, and then are ordered to submerge themselves completely. Being in the ice water slows muscular function and also causes the heart and lungs to stress. The snipers then have to stand up and shoot at targets. After they hit the targets, they have to submerge again before the next round of shooting. “How do you stress somebody?” Stanley asked. It has to be particularly difficult to stress someone who is used to more stress than even the average police officer. As the “first people in” to a mass shooting casualty event, the responsibility of S.W.A.T. team members has evolved to include emergency medical care for trauma victims after the threat has been dealt with. Officers aren’t taking the place of EMTs, but are now training to provide enough care to stabilize a patient until the EMTs arrive. Stanley remembers when he first joined the Indiana State Police two decades ago. Troopers were all taught CPR, but their only first aid equipment were small kits which included things like bandages. Today, the S.W.A.T. team members carrying clotting agents, tourniquets and pressure bandages. It is crucial training, and incredibly difficult to simulate. Cochard, the newest member of the ISP S.W.A.T. competition team, participated in timed training at the Connecticut SWAT challenge designed to put his emergency medical skills to the test. He was placed in the back of a vehicle with a couple of other S.W.A.T. team members. The “victim” was actually an enhanced mannequin. This mannequin cost in the neighborhood of $100,000 and can simulate a variety of medical emergencies, controlled by a proctor who was also inside the box truck type vehicle. The S.W.A.T. members attempting to save the “victim,” had to do so while the mannequin was bleeding and exhibiting other symptoms. The box truck was also moving in a disruptive way involving hard turns and braking and acceleration. Another team scenario required team members to complete its task wearing gas masks, which make it very difficult to see. It also happened to be raining, and team members learned that when it was so wet, their gas masks immediately fogged up when donned. This kind of training is critical. And while some of the competitions gave a clue as to what was going to be asked of them, one of the ISP’s team wins came in one where they went in blind, requiring teams to have to think on their feet. “You don’t know what’s happening until it’s time,” Stanley said. It’s all meant to replicate as much as possible the chaos that officers face when called to a scene. When faced with a crisis, the body has physiological effects which help it deal with the stress. Some of those effects lead to such things as tunnel vision and loss of fine motor skills, both of which can impede a person’s ability to react. If you’re a police officer, it can be a lethal combination. But most police officers have that tunnel vision trained out them, and also learn to control their fine motor skills when their heart rate jumps. The elite officers on S.W.A.T. teams take that training to another level. The Indiana State Police S.W.A.T. teams are full-time positions which allow them to train to a razor’s edge of sharpness on a continual basis. Having that consistent level of training is what elevates S.W.A.T. team members to another level. “We just have that ability to train,” Cochran said. “Training is serious.” Not every officer is cut out for S.W.A.T., to learning how to control themselves when the average non-law enforcement citizen would crumble. S.W.A.T. members have to thrive in that environment. “It’s a high-drive person,” Stanley said. “If we get that high-drive person, we can train that into'}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:28 pm WHEATFIELD, Ind. — Recently it was publicized that a Kankakee Valley High School Esports team won a state championship, but exactly what is Esports. Esports or electronic sports is the organized playing of video games in a competitive setting wrote Kankakee Valley IT employee and Esports coach Nathan Stall. Games are played on a video game console such as an Xbox, PlayStation, or Nintendo Switch. But may also be played on a personal computer (PC). Not every video game ever made is considered an Esport. Some popular titles include Rocket League, Super Smash Brothers, Smite, Chess, and Overwatch. “Some think of Esports as students just sitting at home wasting time playing video games by themselves or with friends. In the high school setting, students get a new team environment to play in while also developing their 21st-century skills such as communication, critical thinking, and collaboration,” added Stall. “There is exponential growth a student can benefit from being on a team just as they would in a traditional high school sport like basketball or tennis. It even gives students who would not have participated in a traditional extracurricular the pathway to participate in something they are passionate about.” Esports can open the door to other opportunities including college scholarships. “Esports is also more than just playing games,” Stall added. “Students can take advantage of the many career paths offered such as marketing, social media management, IT support, journalism, and graphic design. Esports paves the way for students to earn college scholarships by competing. This comes down to overall skill in the game they play, their rank they achieve in the game, and being an overall team player or leader on the team. Many colleges in our great state of Indiana as well as Michigan, Ohio, and Illinois offer scholarships for Esports. To name a few colleges that offer scholarships Manchester University, Valparaiso University, and Ball State University.” This year Kankakee Valley had one team make it to the grand finals for the state playoffs and win the state championship. This was their Rocket League Red team. This team went undefeated in the regular season against 14 other schools in their division. The team consisted of the following students: Kankakee Valley High School competes in the Indiana High School Esports Network which is a league for all high schools in Indiana. It is similar to the IHSAA for traditional sports. Currently, IHSEN is in its second year and has around 50 schools participating in the following titles: IHSEN consists of six-week seasons with statewide playoffs to crown state champions. This happens two times a year once in the fall and once in the spring. Competing schools are put into different divisions (1A or 2A) depending on school size.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 5:57 pm Leah Carter Northwestern’s girls basketball team outscored West Lafayette 23-8 in the fourth quarter to come from behind and beat the visiting Red Devils 54-44 Tuesday night. Northwestern led 22-19 at halftime but West Side held a 36-31 lead after three quarters. McKenna Layden scored a game-high 31 points for the Tigers, who improved to 2-1. She connected on 7 of 10 shots from the field and 15 of 20 from the line. Layden added five steals and three assists. Leah Carter and Ashley Newell each scored five points, and Carter added seven assists. Lexi Hale grabbed nine rebounds, Anna Bishir had four steals and Bailey Henry had three steals. “This was definitely a team effort win,” NW coach Kathie Layden said. “We had quite a few girls step up and handle the pressure of a good team. We were down by eight points early in the fourth and had some great passes to open players. Ashley Newell did a great job keeping us in our offense, and Lexi Hale had some huge rebounds in the fourth quarter.” Adrianne Tolen led West Lafayette (1-1) with 20 points and nine steals. Playing in their season opener, the Class 2A No. 1-ranked Blue Devils were able to connect consistently on offense, getting 22 points from center Ashlee Schram, 16 from point guard Ella Wolfe, and eight from guard Abbi Parker. Tipton led 20-4 after a quarter and 30-10 at the half. Schram grabbed 10 rebounds. Tipton’s defense smothered host Faith Christian, forcing 28 turnovers and allowing no more than one field goal per player. Faith’s only loss prior to Tuesday was by 16 points to Class 4A McCutcheon. “I’m most pleased with how we came out of the gate defensively,” Tipton coach Chad Wetz said. “Faith is a good team with seniors and they had come in with a strong 2-1 record, and defensively we took them out of their game plan, and that caused the first quarter to be a little lopsided. After that we just got into a really good rhythm. “We didn’t let off or let down in the second half. In the second half we continued playing great pressure defense and they only had four points in the second half.” In a matchup of Class 2A Sectional 37 teams, Cass topped visiting Manchester for its first win of the season. Izzy Tharp led the Kings (1-1) with 11 points. Hallie Coffey backed her with 10 points, Kinsey Mennen had seven, Elly Logan had five and Kendal Johnson had four. Cass ended Manchester’s eight-game winning streak in the teams’ series. The Squires beat the Kings twice in each of the three previous seasons — in the regular season and then again in sectional play. Twin Lakes led at every break in winning a big early season matchup in Flora. Twin Lakes led 11-8 after a quarter, 25-17 at the half and 38-33 after three quarters. The Indians (3-0) were led by Olivia Nickerson with 22 points and Addison Bowsman with 21. Maryn Worl led Carroll (1-2) with 14 points and 10 rebounds. Alli Harness had 13 points and five assists, Madison Wagner had nine points and Jamilah Tillman had 10 rebounds. Eastbrook raced out to a 23-7 lead after one quarter to take control. The Panthers (1-0) led 35-13 at halftime. Eastern outscored Eastbrook 10-5 in the third quarter to cut the lead to 40-23 but Eastbrook shut out the Comets in the fourth quarter. Kara Otto led Eastern (0-2) with nine points and Macy Coan followed with six points. Caston opened up a 17-4 lead after a quarter, led 42-13 at halftime, and 57-21 after three quarters.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:19 pm Special to the Tribune-Star Special to the Tribune-Star/Mike LunsfordPest or friend?: This chipmunk is a model of persistence, a work ethic poster child for the lessons learned from the industrious Aesopian ant. As much as I hate seeing it repeatedly raid my bird feeder, I have to admit that I have come to quietly admire a chipmunk that I have been watching for the past few weeks. He — or she — is a model of persistence, a work ethic poster child for the lessons learned from the industrious Aesopian ant, cute, despite the fact that I wish it gone. Lacking most of a tail that is supposed to be about four inches long, this particular little striped rodent spends its day working and stowing, packing seeds into its warehouse-like cheeks then spitting them out into underground stockpiles for consumption this winter. Only it knows what will constitute a daily ration. This chipmunk — the word perhaps originated with the Ojibwa — is traipsing an imperceptible path a long distance — for it, anyway — between a northern hillside burrow and the mulched spot where the feeder hangs from a black iron rod near my cabin, and I have watched it make the trip over and over, never pausing from its task a minute. For a good while, I thought the little pilferer was leaping from a deck rail to get onto the feeder, that is until I saw him one morning deftly climbing the narrow black pole like a Marine Corps recruit scaling a training rope. I have considered oiling the rod in an attempt to get him to stay on the ground to work on a sort of clean-up detail. My grandfather always called chipmunks “ground squirrels,” and that is exactly what they are. A member of the family Sciuridae, Eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) actually have a diet that resembles that of a human, minus the preservatives and deep frying; they’ll eat about anything, from mushrooms to dandelions, fruits to frogs, bird eggs to flower bulbs, but they tend to make bird feeders and the like their own personal lunch wagons, assaulting them again and again until, apparently, they tire and take long afternoon naps. They are amazing burrowers (I read that their entry tunnel alone can be 20-30 feet long), like their relative, the groundhog, and build an elaborate series of tunnels, often in and around the foundations of houses, barns and decks, which hardly endears them to homeowners at all. Dobbs Park naturalist Carissa Lovett knows quite a bit about chipmunks, and not all of it is good. “They build extensive tunnels that can include many chambers, some for sleeping, eating, storing food, even as a restroom,” she says. “But they can be destructive little creatures. They have chewed through the Nature Center wall and entered the building. I have a hole in the wall under my desk in the drywall where they came in. I can still hear them in the wall occasionally,” Lovett warned in a note that set off alarms of worry in my head about our own place. I wasn’t joking about their napping; chipmunks often sleep in their burrows up to 15 hours a day, not difficult to imagine seeing that they dig like Welsh coal miners and run a marathon every day. As cold weather nears, Carissa says their hard work will pay off: “They store their food for the winter and go into torpor in the late fall. Torpor is like hibernation, but they wake up frequently to eat and move around. Sometimes we will see a chipmunk outside of the den on a nice [winter] day here at Dobbs.” Although my chipmunk (I have seen just one other, and they don’t seem to get along at all) is amusing to watch, I have to admit that I have planned his relocation. Until I read that moving them in the fall can prove fatal, I planned to set a small live animal trap for him (I hear peanut butter does the trick) and merely drive him a few miles down the road for release. But, chipmunks spend virtually all fall in anticipation of stockpiling food for the long winter; if he were moved, he’d have no pantry to draw from just as the weather turns colder. The chipmunk, after all, is doing what comes natural to him, and I’m not inclined to risk his fate, nor do I wish to rid myself of him by rodent poison or calling out some other sort of hit. Poisons, by the way, are overused, and rarely do those who use them understand the tragic chain of events that leads from a pesky but dead raccoon or rat to the birds — hawks and eagles included — that feed on their toxic carcasses. The average lifespan for a chipmunk is only about two to three years, although they are known to reproduce more than fast enough to offset the formidable list of predators who regularly kill them. Snakes and skunks and coyotes feast on chipmunks, but can hardly compare to feral housecats, which are killing machines if there ever was one. Up until a year ago, our old barn cat, not wild but not inclined to come inside, was occasionally seen with a chipmunk in its mouth. The cat’s passing last spring is probably the only reason I now have my bird feeder freeloader. There’s much for which to respect chipmunks — their ability to gnaw into a house or undermine a foundation not two of them — and despite my wanting to send ours on its way, I am also assured that they can be beneficial, particularly as a sower of seeds. It’s my understanding that chipmunks like acorns of all kinds, and don’t hesitate to climb trees when they ripen. A field guide of mine claims that a chipmunk was observed storing a bushel of acorns in just three days of work. All things considered I hope the chipmunk in question survives the cold of the upcoming winter, living warmly and comfortably as a reward for all the labor he’s putting in right now. I’ll just keep watching him as he works. He had, however, better be watching for me come spring. You can contact the writer at hickory913@gmail.com; his web site is at www.mikelunsford.com.

Upholding that right is costing Lawrence County more and more as the criminal caseload has increased dramatically as well as cases involving children removed from their parents. Compounding the problem is the fact the county public defender agency has lost public defenders to other counties that pay more. The issue came to a head in October when the Indiana Public Defender Commission informed the Lawrence County Public Defender Agency that it was out of compliance for attorney caseloads that exceed standards. The state commission also found that compensation for public defenders is not in parity with attorneys in the prosecutor’s office “contributing to multiple attorney vacancies and exacerbating caseload compliance issues.” The letter from the state said if the issues are not resolved, the county risks losing its 40% reimbursement from the state to run the agency. The Lawrence County Council has discussed the issue the past few months. Monday night the council met in special session at the Lawrence County Courthouse to further explore the issue, its causes and how much it will cost the county to resolve the compliance issues. Bruce Andis, director of the local PD agency, and the county’s three judges — John Plummer III, Nathan Nikirk and Bob Cline — and juvenile referee Anah Hewetson Gouty, spoke of the need to keep the PD agency viable and how the public defenders are an integral part in keeping the court system running efficiently. Plummer, judge of Lawrence Superior Court I, spent 14 years as a public defender before the agency was created. For years, the county contracted with local attorneys paying them an hourly rate to defend indigent clients. He explained that system worked well until the wave of meth-making and addiction hit the county and cases soared, leading the county to establish the public defender agency in 2010. “If we had to go back to the contract system and paying attorneys $90 an hour, you’re looking at a tremendous amount of money compared to what Bruce is asking,” Plummer said. “The cost would be in the millions.” Plummer’s court handles the high felony cases like murder, attempted murder and rape; the majority (70%) of defendants can’t afford their own counsel. “This ought to scare the council to death if the public defender agency isn’t properly funded,” he said. “If the agency fails, we will have to go out of county to find attorneys to handle major felonies. Just the drive time alone will exceed what Bruce is asking for now.” Andis has proposed options to the council that would alleviate the burden on attorneys. One option, which would add one investigator and two social workers, would add an additional $103,000 to the current budget. Council members asked how clients’ finances are vetted before being granted a public defender. Plummer explained they sign an affidavit that they are telling the truth about their ability to pay. If it is discovered they are lying, they can be held in contempt and sent to jail. “People charged with major felonies are facing the rest of their life in prison; they don’t have $200,000 to hire a lawyer,” he said. “We’re not talking about misdemeanors. Defending a rape case would cost $75,000 to $100,000 with a private attorney.” The 2020 salary budget for the office is $647,201. The agency pays attorneys fresh out of law school about $41,000. Andis said he lost one young attorney to Greene County, where the salary was $70,000. Andis said the agency struggles to find experienced attorneys to handle high felonies. Lawyers with minimum experience are not allowed to handle high felonies. ‘Critical’ need for public defenders Nikirk, judge of Lawrence Circuit Court and a former public defender, presented reports on case volume from all three courts to the council. He said if contracted attorneys hired at the prevailing rate of $90/hour spent just 5 hours (a conservative estimate) on cases in his court, it would cost the county $816,000. The cost of attorneys working 20 hours on his court’s cases would cost $3.2 million. CHINS cases (children removed from their homes) will easily reach 100 hours, he said. (In 2009, the county had 40 CHINS cases; in 2020 there were 160.) Gouty said when CHINS cases are delayed because public defenders are overloaded with cases, families pay the price as parents are separated longer from their kids and kids are placed in foster care or with other family members. “It’s critical,” she said of having a PD agency. High attorney turnover Councilman Mike Wright asked, “How did we get here?” Andis explained the agency has been out of compliance several times the past few years. In a short span in 2020, “the bottom fell out” when the agency lost three attorneys in a matter of weeks followed by the departure of two more later in the year, Andis said. Brent Steele, chairman of the local public defender board, also spoke about its role in overseeing and advocating for the agency. Council President Scott Smith thanked everyone for contributing to the discussion. The clock is ticking on the issue; the county received a three-month extension, which expires in March, to address the compliance issues. Smith said the council will make a decision on the agency’s funding before the end of the month. Following the meeting, the council met in executive session to further discuss the issue. The next meeting of the council will be Feb. 23 at the courthouse.'}]"

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'An aging workforce, demanding and unsafe work, a less than competitive pay scale, and the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are making it increasingly difficult for the trucking industry to find and retain qualified drivers. The shortfall was first documented in a 2005 report by the American Trucking Associations, which estimated a shortage of roughly 20,000. The driver market continued to tighten and the shortage skyrocketed to roughly 50,700 by 2017. The Association predicts a combination of a tight labor market and an aging truck driver population is expected to keep the shortage near its peak. The average age of the existing workforce plays a major role. According to surveys by American Trucking Associations, nearly 57% of all commercial truck drivers are over 45, and 23% are over 55. In other words, nearly a quarter of the current trucking workforce will hit retirement age in the next 10 years, not including the nearly 8% of truckers who are currently working above retirement age. “As a nation, 65% of baby boomers decided to go ahead and retire when the pandemic hit,” said Emily Morris, logistics manager at Morris Trucking in Terre Haute. “It wasn’t really industry-specific, but across the board, people who were on the verge of retiring decided to retire early and ride it out until their Social Security benefits kicked in.” Conditions drivers face on the road contribute to difficulties of the job, a problem that became especially evident when coping with the pandemic. Drivers “were being applauded as national heroes and essential workers during the height of the pandemic,” Morris said. “But evidence is to the contrary because they had no place to shower or use the restroom and restaurants were closed to dine-in patrons. You can’t simply drive a tractor trailer through the drive-through windows.” Often times, drivers would arrive at loading docks only to be forced to leave because the business had closed its doors and there wasn’t any available personnel to notify the drivers, Morris said. “The pandemic caused a fundamental shift in American mentality,” Morris said. “We’ve forgotten about the absolute importance of the delicate supply chain.” Age also plays a role in contributing to the shortage of drivers. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration limits the minimum age requirement to 21 to drive a commercial motor vehicle in interstate commerce and 18 for intrastate. Although there to protect all motorists, the age restriction makes it difficult to attract people to the profession, said Cathy Davenport, president of PJ Trucking in Terre Haute. “We can’t hire an 18-year-old who’s just graduated high school [to transport across state lines] and they can’t sit around at home waiting to turn of age,” Davenport said. “They need a vocation where they can earn money right away, like in a welding career.” Wages also make hiring difficult. According to a recent Centerline study, 76% of truckers say competitive pay is the top factor in their decision to take a job; yet one in two say current wages are not competitive. Bob Patterson, a 34-year veteran driver with XPO Logistics’ Terre Haute terminal, who also trains new drivers, said a lot of trucking companies are notorious for paying drivers a ridiculously low wage, “like maybe only 22 or 32 cents per mile,” and sends them out on the road for up to a month at a time. Patterson started driving in 1983. His father and uncle were truck drivers before him and that’s why he and his cousins started driving. Although he used to make long-haul transports across the nation, now he drives what he calls a “meet and turn” route which takes him only 250 miles from home. He said he couldn’t drive anymore if he still had to make those long routes and be gone from home weeks at a time. “I just thank God that I’m home every night and the pay scale is good,” Patterson said. “But every time I leave for work, I tell my wife that I hope I make it home. It was just last week that I heard on the news about a driver who shot and killed another driver at a truck stop because the one driver was holding up the fuel lanes and refused to move while he was on break.” According to the Centerline study, 50% of commercial long-haul drivers do not feel safe on the road. Trucking was the sixth most dangerous occupation group in 2018, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Patterson said he drives the speed limit, but he gets passed like he’s standing still. He said drivers aren’t courteous and it doesn’t matter if they’re driving two wheels or 18, they’re in a hurry and usually on their cell phones. He said electronic log books intensify the pressure to be on time. Another factor in the continuing shortage, Patterson said, is that many drivers are coming away from training courses with a lot of book knowledge but not a lot of hands-on experience. He said new trucks are equipped with automatic transmissions and a lot of onboard digital technology, but most seasoned drivers are used to manual transmissions with anywhere from eight to 18 speeds. “I want to be in control of what gear I’m in when I’m driving down a snow-packed road and the automatic transmissions don’t allow that kind of control,” he said. “A lot of drivers don’t even know how to back under a trailer to hook up their king pins [to secure the trailer to the cab].” That’s a problem being addressed by Conexus Indiana and Ivy Tech Community College. They teamed up to launch the nation’s first training program for commercial truck drivers that is covered by federal student loans and enhances a graduate’s employability. It can be completed in three weeks with 160 hours of training, which prepares students to become a Class A Commercial Drivers License holder. The program groups four students and includes 121 hours of operating observation, 30 hours of behind-the-wheel skill development, an eight-week internship and an overview of logistics and transportation. Sarah Seaton, CDL program manager at the Ivy Tech Terre Haute campus, said students’ ages range from 18 up to mid-60s with the majority in their late-20s to mid-30s. She said the campus enrolls about 50 students per year and that women regularly enroll in the course. “There has been a driver shortage for several years, but given a global pandemic, this problem is only magnified,” Seaton said. “There are inefficiencies in logistical facilities that cause excessive wait times for many truck drivers sitting at docks and that leads to less ‘on-the-road’ time. Another contributing factor is that many companies are seeking employees now and there just aren’t enough workers available.” “It seems that everywhere you drive, you see signs out at businesses that are trying to hire employees,” said Heather Hires, supervisor at PJ Trucking. “So we’ve increased our pay rate and added an IRA [retirement package] to help attract more drivers. We really need 10 more to meet the demand of our customers. Many carriers, despite being short on drivers, are highly selective in hiring because they have made safety and professionalism high priorities. According to the Indiana Career Connect website, the average salary for truck driver jobs in Terre Haute is $51,590 with 108 job openings as of April 14.'}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:12 pm Employees of Terre Haute’s United States Penitentiary recently staged an “informational picket” outside the prison, decrying the vaccine mandate for federal workers, which they say threatens an institution that is already sorely understaffed. Harold Smith, organizer of the picket and president of prison union AFGE Local 720, said, “We’re standing in unity that we think this should be a choice, not a mandate. My freedom to choose is not negotiable.” Federal employees and those who work for federal contractors are at risk of losing their jobs if they don’t get the vaccine by Nov. 9. Smith added, “We’re going to lose a lot of good staff. We had a gentleman retire today because of this. He named this as the one reason, and a high-ranking administrator put in for retirement, as well, because he feels this is unfortunate, this coming down this way.” Steve Markle, the treasurer for AFGE Local 720, reported that currently out of 630 employees, 57% of the employees have at least one shot and 47% have both. In 2016, the prison was considered at optimal efficiency with 771 employees. “I had a parent that was sick, so I did take it, but I had the choice to take it – the other people here, their choice was taken away from them. Now they’re saying, you have to take it or you’ll be terminated,” Markle said. “When you think about a federal prison that takes a certain amount of workforce to actually run it, and we’re talking about a prison that was already 130 jobs shorter than it was in 2016, what are you going to do? If we lose 50 employees, if we lose 100 employees, we won’t be able to function. We won’t be able to run a safe and secure prison, and that’s going to affect the community.” Just under 100 people gathered on the grounds of the Dollar General store across the highway from the prison. A Cajun food truck served protestors, and a T-shirt vender peddled shirts and hoodies reading, “Soul Not For Sale” and “Come And Make Me” with the image of a syringe. A flag disparaging President Joe Biden in an obscene fashion waved among those in attendance. Signs read “From Essential To Expendable,” “More Staff = Safer Prisons” and “Jesus Wasn’t Vaccinated.” “When this does go through come Nov. 9 and we see the discipline process play through, we’re going to lose between 50 and 150 staff,” said correctional officer Josh Stonebraker, vice president of the union. “There’s nothing I can think of where something’s been forced so hard by the government onto us. It gives you pause as to what’s really happening. “Everybody’s worried,” he added. “We do what we have to to get by, but nobody likes to be told what to do.” Tiffany Setzer, an employee at the prison, said, “I just feel that we should be given the freedom to choose what we put into our bodies. If you choose to get vaccinated, that’s your choice, but those of us who don’t wish to, we shouldn’t be mandated to do so. I don’t feel that I’m comfortable with some of the different outcomes that people have had.” Bruce Borders, Indiana State Representative for House District 45, spoke at length at the prison picket. Of those who have been vaccinated, he said, “In most cases, they have been misled.” Travis Newman of federal contractor GE Aviation, which earlier in the day had more than two dozen picketers demonstrating in solidarity with prison employees – a reprise of their original protest a week prior – also spoke at the prison event. He contrasted the vaccine mandate from other government regulations, such as mandatory seat-belt laws. “How that is different is that that is not taking something into your physical body that is not otherwise there,” Newman said. “Everyone has a right to refuse medical treatment. You do not have to be medicated by the federal government or your employer.” Tammy Callahan of GE Aviation also attended the prison event. “I’m supporting them,” she said. “To say we’re gonna lose our rights, our jobs, if we don’t take it, to me, I’m sorry, that’s wrong. ... It’s a spiritual battle – not of the flesh and blood, but on the spiritual realm.” “It’s the way it’s been rolled out – it’s more of an authoritative, ‘You’re going to do this and you have no options,’ when other options have worked,” Smith said. “We’ve been front-line workers from the very beginning – we social-distanced, we wore masks and we practiced hand sanitation. Those measures were effective, and a lot of people feel that this is not a true vaccine. It’s alarming to folks that you can take the shot and still carry and transmit it.” David Kronke writes for the (Terre Haute) Tribune-Star.

Winds S at 5 to 10 mph. Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 5:10 pm INDIANAPOLIS — More than half of Indiana’s counties lost population during the last decade, according to U.S. Census figures released Thursday showing growth around Indianapolis and its other largest cities while rural Switzerland County saw the biggest drop. In fact, many rural counties scattered across the state lost population, including 11 that lost more than 5% of their residents. The biggest percentage population decline was 8.3% in Switzerland County. Population declines were recorded for 49 of Indiana’s 92 counties as the state mirrored Hamilton, Boone and Hendricks counties in suburban Indianapolis all had population gains of more than 20% between 2010 and 2020, during which time the census found Indiana as a whole grew 4.7% to about 6.8 million residents. The census data will be used by state lawmakers in the coming weeks to redraw election districts for U.S. House and state Legislature seats. Five of the six Indiana counties gaining the most people over the past decade were in central Indiana. Indianapolis and Marion County grew by nearly 74,000, or 8.2%, to 977,000 people. Northern suburban Hamilton County was close behind as it added 73,000 people, or 26.5%, to 347,000. Overall, Indianapolis and its seven adjourning counties grew by 13%. NEW ELECTION DISTRICTS A high-profile use of the new census figures is the drawing of new congressional and legislative election districts. Republicans have complete control of that redistricting process in Indiana as they hold the governor’s office and have commanding majorities in both chambers of the state Legislature. Republicans have rebuffed calls from Democrats and voting-rights activists to turn the map drawing over to an independent commission. Log In Keep it Clean.

after a state court says he perjured himself when describing the interrogation of a mentally disabled man in a nearly two-decade-old homicide. Elkhart Police Chief Kris Seymore submitted a letter to the city’s Police Merit Commission on Monday, requesting Lt. Carl Conway be fired for “immoral conduct” and “conduct injurious to the public peace or welfare."" Seymore\'s letter extensively cites an April opinion from the Indiana Court of Appeals that states Conway “withheld the truth” by testifying at the 2005 murder trial of Andrew Royer that Royer knew intimate details of the case. At a post-conviction relief hearing in 2019, Conway testified that he fed Royer information about the investigation into the death of Helen Sailor. Royer\'s team demands Conway\'s firing: Case dismissed against Andy Royer after overturned conviction in 2002 Elkhart murder The court also found Conway gave conflicting testimony between the 2005 trial and the 2019 hearing regarding whether he knew and took investigatory precautions relating to Royer’s disability. In his letter to the merit commission, Seymore wrote that Conway’s conduct in the Royer case “undermines the very foundation of the criminal justice system.” “Your conduct amounts to an assault upon the institution of justice which you swore to uphold and constitutes a violation of your oath of office,” the letter reads. “No measure of discipline for your conduct can restore your credibility within the criminal justice system.” Elkhart: Man ""did not receive a fair criminal trial"" appeals court rules Per Indiana code, Conway is entitled to a hearing before the merit commission on Seymore’s request for his firing. He has been on paid administrative leave since April. That hearing is set for early October and comes four months after Seymore requested the termination of officers Taryn and Nathan Lanzen for taking control over the finances of an Elkhart resident. The commission suspended Taryn Lanzen without pay for 60 days and Seymore subsequently changed his request to a 30-day unpaid suspension and demotion for Nathan Lanzen. Elkhart police claim: A man says a husband and wife — both officers —took control of his finances When contacted by the Tribune Monday, Seymore declined to comment on his request for Conway’s termination. Conway declined to answer questions about the pending hearing, saying only, “The appellate court never said I perjured myself; that’s a misstatement on behalf of Chief Seymore.” In April, the appellate court affirmed Kosciusko County Special Judge Joseph Sutton’s ruling to grant Royer a new trial finding that multiple points — including the claim that Conway disregarded Royer’s disability, that Conway fed Royer details of the murder during the interrogation and Conway had been removed from the Elkhart homicide unit prior to Royer’s trial in 2005 — constituted newly discovered evidence in the case. Conway admitted during a 2019 hearing that he did offer Royer details about the crime, including that Sailor, the victim, was hit on the head, that a liquid was poured on her body and that towels were used to clean up the scene, and then thrown away. In its ruling, the court said officers who lie under oath “betray their oath of office, and signal to the public at large that perjury is something not to be taken seriously.” “Detective Conway’s false testimony at Royer’s trial is particularly galling because he was an Elkhart Police Department detective at the time of Royer’s trial and, as of the evidentiary hearing on Royer’s successive petition for post-conviction relief, Detective Conway was still employed by the Elkhart Police Department overseeing the juvenile bureau and the special victims unit,” the court wrote. Following the appellate court\'s ruling, Elkhart County prosecutors dismissed the charge against Royer, effectively ending the 46-year-old\'s legal saga after he spent 16 years in prison. Attorneys who represented Royer during his appeal case have also called for Conway to be fired. Seymore’s letter further states that Conway’s continued employment puts other cases at risk because he cannot give “uncompromised” testimony. Since April, one federal bank robbery case has been dismissed due to Conway being the lead detective, according to the letter. According to Seymore’s letter, Conway was recommended a one-day suspension after he ""misrepresented material facts” in a complaint he filed against a fellow officer. He also received two written reprimands in 2005 for reporting to a drug test 15 days late and for using a fellow officer’s identification number to make long-distance calls to his girlfriend. Conway was also removed from the homicide unit in 2004 after he questioned a person as a suspect in an unrelated homicide, but told the person\'s attorney he was only being questioned as a witness, the chief\'s letter says.

I should have asked it with more nuance and sensitivity. Flowers lie on the Hollywood Walk of Fame star of the late broadcasting giant Larry King, Saturday, Jan. 23, 2021, in Los Angeles.I ask questions for a living, but also out of sheer curiosity. I’ve asked thousands of questions to thousands of people over the past 25 years for this job. Without a doubt, many of those questions could be labeled as “dumb.” Some questions were unintentionally stupid, like that question to the grieving mother. Others have been intentionally dumb, so I could better understand something from the ground up.I often preface a conversation with, “Talk to me like I’m a 5-year-old.” And I mean it.

The smarter the person, the dumber my questions.I once interviewed a professor of geology about the complexities of carbon dating. He explained it to me. Twice. Still, I didn’t quite understand its primary concept so I unearthed my trusty interviewing tool: “Talk to me like I’m a 5-year-old.” He chuckled and explained it to me as if I was a 5-year-old. He used the imagery of a little boy’s dump truck hauling organic matter back and forth, year after year, century after century. I wasn’t insulted. I was grateful.Some people get insulted or impatient with my stupid queries. Others seem annoyed or arrogant by having to address an answer they feel I should already know. And maybe I do. But I’d rather hear their perspective of an answer that may be obvious. This gives me an insight into their character, which is often more valuable than their response.It’s not what they say, it’s how they say it. I don’t believe this is a dumb interviewing technique. It’s one of my favorite conversational instruments in a writer’s toolbox. I blame Larry King to a degree.The legendary talk show host, who died Jan. 23, often joked about his penchant for asking dumb questions to guests. Not so much dumb as unassuming queries that he should have known the answer to, or possibly did know the answer but didn’t let on.“My friend Herbie Cohen – we met when we were 10 – said, ‘You know the secret of your success? Dumb.\'” King told the Los Angeles Times in 2016. “By dumb, he means, ‘Help me. I don’t understand. Why? Why did you do that?\'”This means King asked questions that seemed obvious, naive, or ill-informed. It also means he got answers that other interviewers never did, the story stated. King asked the simplest or stupidest questions to anyone, no matter their fame or fortune or career.King’s habit of asking dumb questions began decades earlier in his career.“That’s easy,” King told the L.A. Times. “I had just started doing interviews – you know, I was a kid. I had the priest on from the local seminary, and I asked him, is he married and how many children does he have?”His admittedly dumb question made the audience fall silent since the priest was from a Catholic church where priests can’t marry or have children. “There was a studio audience there, and there was a pause. I didn’t know what the hell I said wrong,” King said. In this Thursday, Aug. 26, 1999, file photo, talk show host Larry King wipes his eyes after laughing at a joke by comedy legend Jerry Lewis, on the set of “Larry King Live” at CNN Studios in the Hollywood section of Los Angeles.Sometimes I don’t know what the hell I said “wrong” in an interview until I replay it to write that column.

However, some updates can also benefit the mental and physical health of those who occupy the space. While making your home healthier can involve simple steps like decluttering, swapping out cleaning products for natural versions and opening windows to let in more fresh air, there are other projects that can be done to create longer-lasting results. Consider these ideas to create spaces that are not only functional and beautiful but also impart a sense of well-being. Apply a Fresh Coat of Paint Changing the color of a room can transform your space while also positively impacting your mood. Bright, warm colors like yellow may be uplifting while cooler shades like beige, pale green and soft blue can be soothing. Repainting can also help prevent mold and mildew growth on walls while repelling dust and allergens. Traditional oil- and latex-based paints give off gases that may cause issues such as eye and respiratory irritation. Look for paints with no volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and that are certified not to contain heavy metals, carcinogens and other harmful compounds. Upgrade Your Flooring Made of natural materials, hardwood flooring is not only attractive but is a hygienic, easy-to-clean choice. The organic beauty and grain of the wood creates an intrinsic connection to nature. You can set the foundation for your living spaces with an option like artisan-crafted Carlisle Wide Plank Floors. Each floor is handcrafted, one board at a time, from sustainably sourced timbers. Whether you select each detail – wood species, grade, texture and color – or choose from a collection of popular tried-and-true finishes, the result is a unique floor with distinctive character. Learn more at wideplankflooring.com. Add Natural Light If your home lacks adequate natural lighting, adding or replacing windows and skylights can allow more sunlight into your living space. This offers several benefits, including an improved sense of well-being and increased productivity, not to mention the potential cost savings when you install energy-efficient versions. Additionally, light-blocking shades and adjustable light technologies can work with natural circadian rhythms to enhance sleep. Modernize the Kitchen From appliances to countertops, there are a variety of kitchen upgrades that can make your space healthier. Incorporating automated technology like a touchless faucet can reduce the amount of contact with germs while a water filtration system can improve the quality of your drinking water. Updating your countertops with a non-porous material like quartz, which replicates the look of natural stone, provides a contemporary aesthetic, and the antimicrobial surface will not harbor bacteria or viruses. Create a Bathroom Oasis Even a small space like the bathroom can benefit from wellness-focused updates. Soaking tubs and spa showers with hydrotherapy showerheads can help reduce stress and provide a mental respite. Additionally, a heated towel rack not only brings a touch of luxury but can reduce energy usage and keep towels free of mold and mildew between washes. Touchless faucets and toilets can also help reduce the spread of germs while bringing convenience.

HARRISON COUNTY — Amazon has announced its second Amazon fulfillment center in Southern Indiana, which will add new jobs to the growing region. The 270,000-square-foot facility is expected to open in 2022 at 4677 Peter Schickel Way NE in Georgetown. Although it has a Georgetown address, the facility is under the umbrella of Harrison County. It will join the fulfillment center opened several years ago in the River Ridge Commerce Center in Jeffersonville. “We’re thrilled to announce a new state-of-the-art facility in Georgetown, which will allow us to deliver more packages, in a faster timeframe, to our customers across Kentuckiana,” Amazon spokesperson Andre Woods said in a statement. “We are committed to employing hundreds here in Indiana and offering a very competitive employment package with opportunities for long-term growth, advancement and post-secondary education.” Wages start at $18 per hour for Amazon positions in fulfillment and transportation. Full-time employee benefits start on day one. This includes “health, vision, and dental insurance, 401(k) with 50% company match, up to 20 weeks paid parental leave, and Amazon’s Career Choice program, in which the company will pay full college tuition for its frontline employees as part of $1.2 billion in investment to expand education and skills training benefits for its U.S. workforce,” according to information provided by Woods. Although in Harrison County, the fulfillment center will have an impact on the surrounding region, including Floyd County, which borders Harrison. “Of course I’m excited to see Amazon coming to this region closer to Floyd County,” Floyd County Commissioners President Shawn Carruthers said Tuesday. “It will be great to get the jobs that will be available for Floyd County residents as well as Harrison. We can benefit well economically from that. Also it says a lot about our infrastructure and our proximity to Louisville which puts Floyd County in a very unique position.” Wendy Dant Chesser, executive director at One Southern Indiana, which is the chamber of commerce for Clark and Floyd counties, said the announcement of both the Harrison County and Franklin, Indiana, centers signal a focus on the state. “They are definitely recognizing the Midwest’s and Indiana’s connections,” she said. “We call Indiana the crossroads of American and I think Amazon’s continued investment in the state does justify that.” She added that an obvious question many may have is how this will impact the already-struggling job market in the area. “What does this mean for our employment base?” she asked. “Because we know it is already a tight job market and we have employers who have open positions that they cannot fill, but I think what that means for us is that this puts continued pressure on our employers to be creative in the strategies to both recruit and maintain their valued employees.” Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.

Perhaps your choice is a haunting tale of repressive beauty standards like Morrison’s “Bluest Eye” or Angelou’s heroic biography “I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings.” Maybe you’d suggest Souljah’s streetwise epic “Coldest Winter Ever” or Vanzant’s empowering guide “Don’t Give It Away.” Enter Tamara Winfrey-Harris’ “Dear Black Girl,” a love letter for us, by us, that’s powerfully positioned in this moment to remind Black girls of all ages that the only gaze that matters is our own. Winfrey-Harris, author of “The Sisters Are Alright,” says that the idea for Dear Black Girl started as a simple letter writing campaign for a local youth group she was working with. “I just thought it would be a neat idea if the girls could leave with a letter from a Black woman. I just offhandedly went on Facebook and said, I need twelve letters. Can anyone write them for me?” she said. “We showed up and showed out like we do … and I knew this had to be a thing.” Winfrey-Harris collected more than 50 letters from as far away as Europe and placed them into the hands of those young women. She then set off on a mission to curate this experience in book form so that Black girls all over the world could experience this magic for themselves. “I was surprised that women were willing to be so vulnerable and so open because it’s hard for us. Black women can’t afford to be vulnerable a lot in this society that hates us,” she said. “Dear Black Girl,” which consists of more than 30 letters, covers a large variety of subjects from navigating sexuality and gender identity to overcoming challenging familial relationships and reentering society post-incarceration. Her goal was to make sure that each note was affirming to all Black girls. “I wanted Black girls to see themselves in all the ways they show up in the world and the ways that they really are and not how society wants them to be,” said Winfrey-Harris. “I feel like very often you will see the queer girls left out of the discussion or books would leave out important things some of us experience like sexual assault which we know 60 percent of Black women will experience by age 18.
