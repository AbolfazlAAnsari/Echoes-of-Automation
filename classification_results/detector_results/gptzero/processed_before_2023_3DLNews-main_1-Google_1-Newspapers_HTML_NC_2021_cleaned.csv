Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:18 am Rutherford County Commission Chairman Bryan King speaks to the crowd of approximately 35 at the 76th annual Basil Whitener Holiday Breakfast as Michael Gavin, director of marketing and community relations at Isothermal Community College, looks on. Contributed Photo FOREST CITY — The 76th annual Basil Whitener Breakfast was held this past Saturday at Copper Penny Grill in Forest City. Several well-known community and education leaders as well as former leaders came together to celebrate the legacy of Basil Whitener, a former North Carolina congressman. The event is a tradition began after Word War II, by a group of men connected in some way to politics or government service. It is considered a time to set politics aside, and come together as friends who may have different political points of view. For decades it was held at the former Ron and Eddy’s Restaurant, and has been held at Copper Penny Restaurant in Forest City (the old Ron and Eddy’s building) for several years. The breakfast was not held last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Whitener first became a member of the U.S. House of Representatives for North Carolina’s 11th District beginning in 1941. He later resigned to join the war effort. The breakfast tradition in Forest City began when Whitener ran into some of his old friends with whom he had served at what was then Ron and Eddy’s Restaurant. Some of the earliest participants were Ed Thompson, Betram Flack, Russell Northey and Clarence Griffith. While Whitener was a Democrat, the breakfast is a bipartisan event that attracts people regardless of political affiliation. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.

Southport Fire Department covers Caswell Beach and the east end of Oak Island. It took over when the former Yaupon Fire Department disbanded and now, Caswell has a public services building that houses firefighting equipment, public works and a Brunswick County Emergency Medical Services ambulance. The department formally moved the new aerial ladder to the Caswell station last Thursday. “It’s really a great addition to the department and to the community,” said Southport Fire Chief Charles Drew. The 55-foot ladder truck currently stationed at Caswell Beach will go to the department’s Long Beach Road substation, near Surf Cinemas. Drew noted that firefighters had to cut away parts of the wall coverings in the Caswell Beach building to accommodate the new, larger ladder truck. With all its additions, the engine is worth about $450,000, he said. It has only 6,000 miles of service and was provided by an anonymous donor. The Caswell substation now has the larger ladder truck, two 1,000-gallon fire engines, a brush fire response truck, an air tank trailer, and at least two full-time firefighters are at the station around the clock, said Drew. Drew also said the equipment improvement would help give the district a better fire protection rating, which plays into insurance rates - especially for commercial structures. Firefighter Tom Lott said he had worked at several departments and felt “blessed to be a part of a great department.” Several town officials took a brief ride in the new ladder truck and the fire department served lunch to guests who attended the dedication.

A little more than an hour after Congress began its formal session to affirm Joe Biden\'s presidential election win, the U.S. Capitol went into lockdown as pro-Trump rioters stormed into the Capitol building. One person died. Vice President Mike Pence and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris were evacuated. And the D.C. National Guard has been activated. It\'s Ashley. When I mentioned we expected drama today in the nation\'s capital, I was not expecting this shocking turn of events. Let\'s talk news. But first, things are rapidly developing: For the absolute latest updates on what\'s happening at the U.S. Capitol, follow along on our live blog. The Short List is a snappy USA TODAY news roundup. Subscribe here! It started with a peaceful protest. Thousands of President Donald Trump\'s supporters turned up in Washington on Wednesday for multiple ""Stop the Steal"" events to protest the election results. Things took a dark turn. About two dozen people moved in on the U.S. Capitol as debate over certifying the election took place inside. Several flash-bang grenades were launched as tensions flared, and the mass of people outside the Capitol building began to swell. The crowd broke through security fencing, entering the building. The Capitol was locked down, and Pence was evacuated. Rioters swarmed the Capitol, storming the House and Senate chambers on the second floor of the building, shouting and waving flags and climbing over chairs. At least one person entered the Senate chamber and shouted from the dais, “Trump won the election!” Others sat inside lawmakers\' offices. Jaw-dropping pictures and video of the riot shows law enforcement officers with guns drawn to keep protesters off the floor of the House of Representatives while protesters fought police inside the building. A woman who was shot inside the Capitol when rioters stormed the building was taken to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead, police say. At least three others were injured and taken to hospitals. President-elect Joe Biden called the rioting at the Capitol “insurrection” and “chaos” and urged Trump to tell his supporters to end their siege. ""This is not dissent. It\'s disorder. It\'s chaos. It borders on sedition, and it must end now. I call on this mob to pull back and allow the work of democracy to go forward,"" he said. After Biden\'s speech, Trump tweeted a video telling protesters they should ""go home,"" referring to ""a landslide election\'\' in his favor and claiming votes were ""stolen from us,\'\' though federal investigations and court cases showed otherwise. The National Guard was mobilized to support law enforcement, and as of late afternoon, 13 people – all from outside the area – had been arrested. As a 6 p.m. EST, curfew took effect, police in riot gear stood outside the Capitol and held protesters at bay, having secured the premises a few hours after rioters broke in through smashed windows and climbed to the building\'s balconies. Police used tear gas and percussion grenades to disperse the mob. Vice President Mike Pence defied Trump, saying he wouldn\'t block Congress from affirming Biden\'s win. “Only lawmakers can decide today,” Pence said. It earned him a quick rebuke from Trump, who tweeted, ""Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delivered a stern warning to fellow Republicans after an objection was raised to the certification of Arizona\'s 11 electoral votes to Biden and Harris. “If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral,"" he said. Despite the chaos, the outcome of the vote count in Congress was never in doubt. Biden\'s Electoral College win has been certified by all 50 states and the District of Columbia. There are more than enough votes in the House and Senate to formally accept that outcome. Photos: Rioters storm into U.S. Capitol The Georgia runoffs have been called. Democrats won control of the U.S. Senate as Jon Ossoff is projected to defeat incumbent Republican David Perdue in Georgia’s runoff elections, according to NBC News and CBS News. Ossoff and Raphael Warnock became the first Georgia Democrats in 20 years to be elected to the Senate, knocking out Perdue and Sen. Kelly Loeffler, respectively, in runoff elections Tuesday. The Senate will be split 50-50, and Vice President Kamala Harris will have the power to cast a deciding vote for Democrats in the event of a tie. (I told you there was a lot today.)

Saturday morning, volunteers with Saving Haywood tackled the intense job of cleaning up trash left under the Russ Avenue bridge, a popular spot where those without shelter often spend the night. Before the effort started, Waynesville police officers checked the area to ensure nobody was around. Then about a dozen volunteers set out to clean up the mounds of trash at the bottom of the bridge and dismantle the one or possibly two encampments directly underneath the bridge that had become semi-permanent living quarters. Volunteer John Culp, who said he was there that morning because of his good friend Peggy Hannah, took photos before he and fellow volunteer Paul Yeager began tossing the contents of the outdoor home directly beneath the bridge to the bottom of a steep bank. Down came a mattress, tarps that offered a bit of privacy, a suitcase filled with personal items, including a set of keys, a bicycle, unopened food, dishes, a battery-operated hot plate, a pet cage, a jerry-rigged table and rucksacks filled with blankets and plenty of clothing. OVERDOSE KIT — Saving Haywood volunteer John Culp found a drug overdose kit contained in a small black case. When it showed it to fellow volunteer Rep. Mark Pless, the legislator remarked how it is dangerous to distribute Naloxone without providing instructions on using it. Signs decorated the “walls” under the bridge that read “Smile, your (sic) on meth,” and “Danger Low Clearance.” A Trump Pence campaign sign was in one corner and painted in bright orange on the bottom of the bridge (which was the ceiling for the dweller) was the phrase “Home is Priceless.” Culp admitted he didn’t feel great about the task. “When I was a teen, I worked for the JP (justice of the peace) and did evictions,” he said. “This feels a little like that.” Culp said he is a member of a church that makes efforts to help those who are homeless. “There’s got to be a better way,” Yeager admitted, “but this has got to happen. This isn’t good for our town.” SORTING THROUGH A SUITCASE — Paul Yeager and Wanda Brooks sort through the contents of a suitcase and rucksack found beneath the Russ Avenue bridge. Yeager said they found a baseball bat and a cooler of rocks he suspected would have been used to ward off intruders. Hannah said she would donate usable items found at the cleanup site, particularly the new tent that she figured area Boy Scouts could use and wasn’t open to leaving personal items where they could be found. “Why would we do that?” she asked. Down below, volunteers found enough unopened food to fill two boxes. There was a large bag of chips, a 10-pound sack of potatoes, a package of hot dogs, cans of soup and peanut butter, along with some food, like a package of avocados and another package of chicken that had spoiled and was filled with maggots. A small, black container contained several vials of Naloxone and syringes. “The thing about this,” said N.C. Rep. Mark Pless, who was volunteering at the cleanup, “is that they don’t provide instructions on how to use it. There was one fella who squirted it up his nose.” KEYS TOSSED — Among the personal possessions found in the make-shift home beneath the bridge were a set of keys in a suitcase. He cited programs in other communities where the kits to counteract a drug overdose comes with written instructions, along with verbal training on how to use it when it is handed out. That didn’t happen in Haywood, he claimed, citing his time as a county commissioners when he had several tense interactions with the individual in charge of the program. Hannah said she appreciated all the volunteers and noted it took a crew to accomplish what they did that morning. “I will help the homeless,” she said, “but there’s a criminal element that blends in.” She the best way to separate out the criminal element was to end the pre-trial release program. FOOD TOSSED — Volunteers found two boxes of food items that were part of the trash that landed at the bottom of the bridge embankment or were from the pantry of the one or two homeless camps directly beneath the bridge. “We’ve got to quit the hand outs and extend a hand up to help,” she said. The homeless encampment under the bridge is nothing new. The spot has historically been a homeless hang-out and de facto shelter from the elements for three decades. But the semi-permanence of the encampment beneath the Russ Avenue bridge — akin to make-shift apartments between the trusses with a large volume of amassed belongings — had caused alarm. “You would not believe what’s under that bridge. It’s really bad, it’s really really bad,” Mayor Gary Caldwell said at last week’s town board meeting, following comments by members of Saving Haywood. Over the winter, a fire fueled by the accumulated possessions and make-shift shelters destroyed fiber lines that run through conduit under the bridge. But it’s lucky the bridge itself wasn’t damaged — which would have closed a main entry into town — and therein lay Caldwell’s concern. “It could do a lot of damage under that bridge,” he said. Caldwell questioned whether the town could get under the bridge with equipment to clean it out. But due to the high, steep bank that drops away under the bridge — coupled with the short head room against the underside of the bridge deck — town staff wagered the only way to clear it out was by hand. Town Manager Rob Hites said the town doesn’t have the authority to clean out the homeless camps under the bridge, however. The homeless camps are located on railroad property and DOT right-of-way. It’s not town property, so the town would need to get permission first. Waynesville Police Chief David Adams, however, said what was happening beneath state-owned Russ Avenue bridge constitute a public safety issue and the town has the authority to keep trespassers out. He said the Saving Haywood group has permission from the railroad to clean up the trash in its right-of-way, but wasn’t aware of a similar permission from the N.C. DOT. Hannah said four Waynesville police officers came to the bridge cleanup site early Saturday and said, “‘all clear, clear it,’ and that’s what we’re doing.” Adams said officers don’t direct squatters to leave private property unless it’s requested by the property owner or it poses a public health or safety hazard. “We were concerned a fireman could get killed putting out the fire under there or someone else could fall and be hurt,” Adams said, noting that those camped out under the bridge were trespassing, and that town officers had the authority to enforce trespassing laws on state and county property. “This was of more concern on account of the recent fire in that location,” he added. Guide Editor Becky Johnson contributed to this story. LOTS OF TRASH — Volunteers with Saving Haywood worked most of the morning Saturday to clean up trash beneath the Russ Avenue bridge.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 8:13 pm By Carey Phillips Asheville turned three second-half pass interceptions into touchdowns last Thursday and defeated Smoky Mountain 26-12 in the season’s first JV football game at Asheville. “I couldn’t be prouder of their effort,” Coach Zeb Capps said. “We had some good things happen and some unfortunate things happen. Our effort was really good.” The Mustangs took a 6-0 lead in the first quarter on a 5-yard touchdown run by Jayce Stillwell to cap a drive that took nearly eight minutes off the clock. SM trailed 7-6 at halftime, but used a fumble recovery by Hayden Moore to set up a TD. Parker Wilson’s 30-yard scoring pass to Jarek Jones gave the Mustangs a 12-7 edge. After that is when Capps said “the turnover bug got us. The Cougars turned three interceptions into scores to take control. “I felt good about how we competed with Asheville,” the coach said He said Luke Fortner ran the ball hard and Jones played well at wide receiver. He singled out lineman Weston Winchester, who played all snaps on both sides of the ball. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

Harris was sworn in as the first female vice president — and the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to hold the position — in front of the U.S. Capitol by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. The moment was steeped in history and significance in more ways than one. She was escorted to the podium by Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, the officer who single-handedly took on a mob of Trump supporters as they tried to breach the Senate floor during the Capitol insurrection that sought to overturn the election results. Harris was wearing clothes from two young, emerging Black designers — a deep purple dress and coat. After taking the oath of office, a beaming Harris hugged her husband, Douglas Emhoff, and gave President Joe Biden a first bump. Her rise is historic in any context, another moment when a stubborn boundary falls away, expanding the idea of what’s possible in American politics. But it’s particularly meaningful because Harris is taking office at a moment of deep consequence, with Americans grappling over the role of institutional racism and confronting a pandemic that has disproportionately devastated Black and brown communities. Those close to Harris say she’ll bring an important — and often missing — perspective in the debates on how to overcome the many hurdles facing the new administration. “In many folks’ lifetimes, we experienced a segregated United States,” said Lateefah Simon, a civil rights advocate and longtime Harris friend and mentee. “You will now have a Black woman who will walk into the White House not as a guest but as a second in command of the free world.” Harris — the child of immigrants, a stepmother of two and the wife of a Jewish man — “carries an intersectional story of so many Americans who are never seen and heard.” Harris, 56, moves into the vice presidency just four years after she first came to Washington as a senator from California, where she’d served as attorney general and as San Francisco’s district attorney. She had expected to work with a White House run by Hillary Clinton, but President Donald Trump’s victory quickly scrambled the nation’s capital and set the stage for the rise of a new class of Democratic stars. After Harris’ own presidential bid fizzled, her rise continued when Biden chose her as his running mate last August. Harris had been a close friend of Beau Biden, the elder son of Joe Biden and a former Delaware attorney general who died in 2015 of cancer. The inauguration activities included nods to her history-making role and her personal story. Harris used two Bibles to take the oath, one that belonged to Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, the late civil rights icon whom Harris often cites as inspiration, and Regina Shelton, who helped raise Harris during her childhood in the San Francisco Bay Area. The drumline from Harris’ alma mater, Howard University, joined the presidential escort. To mark the occasion, the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, the nation’s oldest sorority for Black women, which Harris joined at Howard University, declared Wednesday as Soror Kamala D. Harris Day. “This event will certainly be a momentous occasion that will go down in the annals of our archives as one of the greatest days the founders’ of Alpha Kappa Alpha could have envisioned,” said Dr. Glenda Glover, the sorority’s international president and chief executive office. She’ll address the nation later in front of the Lincoln Memorial, a symbolic choice as the nation endures one of its most divided stretches since the Civil War. Biden, in his inaugural address, reflected on the 1913 march for women’s suffrage the day before President Woodrow Wilson’s inauguration, during which some marchers were heckled and attacked. “Today, we mark the swearing in of the first woman in American history elected to national office, Vice President Kamala Harris. Don’t tell me things can’t change,” Biden said. Harris has often reflected on her rise through politics by recalling the lessons of her mother, who taught her to take on a larger cause and push through adversity. “I was raised to not hear ‘no.’ Let me be clear about it. So it wasn’t like, “Oh, the possibilities are immense. Whatever you want to do, you can do,'” she recalled during a “CBS Sunday Morning” interview that aired Sunday. “No, I was raised to understand many people will tell you, ‘It is impossible,’ but don’t listen.'” Harris’ swearing-in holds more symbolic weight than that of any vice president in modern times. She will expand the definition of who gets to hold power in American politics, said Martha S. Jones, a professor of history at Johns Hopkins University and the author of “Vanguard: How Black Women Broke Barriers, Won the Vote, and Insisted on Equality for All.” People who want to understand Harris and connect with her will have to learn what it means to graduate from a historically Black college and university rather than an Ivy League school. They will have to understand Harris’ traditions, like the Hindu celebration of Diwali, Jones said. “Folks are going to have to adapt to her rather than her adapting to them,” Jones said. Her election to the vice presidency should be just the beginning of putting Black women in leadership positions, Jones said, particularly after the role Black women played in organizing and turning out voters in the November election. “We will all learn what happens to the kind of capacities and insights of Black women in politics when those capacities and insights are permitted to lead,” Jones said.""}]"

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 8:13 pm By Carey Phillips After losing two straight Mountain Six Conference games, Smoky Mountain (1-3, 0-2) will be trying to get in the win column Friday when Brevard (3-1, 2-0) visits Carr Hooper Stadium/Babe Howell Field. Kickoff for the homecoming game is 7 p.m. “They’ve got some weapons on the perimeter,” Coach Ricky Brindley said of the Blue Devils. “They’ve got two wide outs (Chris Wynn and Jaylen Carver) that are very long and lean and very athletic. They’ve got a hard-nosed tough running back (Garrett Swicegood).” Joe Powell is the quarterback for Coach Craig Pritchett’s team. “He does a good job of managing the football game,” Brindley said. Brevard uses a one-back set on offense and a 3-4 defense. Defensive standouts include Swicegood at linebacker and lineman Bobby Brown. “We’ve got to be able to bounce back and eliminate any kind of mental mistakes and execute consistently and give ourselves a chance in the fourth quarter to win the game,” Brindley said. “We’ve got to be able to finish the game.” After losing its opener to Mountain Heritage (8-6), Brevard has defeated North Iredell (19-7), East Henderson (14-0) and Franklin (35-29). The Devils hold a 20-7 advantage in the series, including a 24-6 win last year. Friday at Hendersonville, the Mustangs saw a 14-0 halftime lead get away in a 35-26 loss. Under a new executive order issued by Gov. Roy Cooper, stadium capacity has been increased to 50 percent or 1,500 fans. “They were able to take advantage of some things in the second half that we were able to stop in the first half, particularly running the football, but also some vertical shots that really flipped the field for them in certain situations,” Brindley said. The Bearcats were held to 44 yards of total offense in the first half but put together 282 yards in the second half. “They didn’t do anything different,” Brindley said. “They executed much better than we did in the second half.” He said a key play was a lost fumble in the third quarter as SM was driving with a 14-7 lead. “When we fumbled and they were able to go down and tie it up, that made it a dogfight in a hurry,” he said. Darien Bird caught eight passes for 126 yards and two touchdowns for the Mustangs. “That may be the best football game I’ve ever seen Darien play, not just catching the football, but he was very good blocking also,” Brindley said. Bird made a spectacular catch on a 35-yard TD in the fourth quarter. “That was a catch that not many people could make,” the coach said. SM missed two extra points due to high snaps. “That’s an area you can’t have mistakes in,” he said. “You’ve got to be able to execute what appears to be routine things. A lot of times we take those things for granted.” Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles. Success!

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 8:13 pm Phase I work began at Cedar Cliff Lake in 2019; based on current conditions, work including increasing the existing spillway width will run into 2024. By Dave Russell Duke Energy has pushed the date for the completion of the Cedar Cliff Dam refurbishing project out about two years. The construction to refurbish the dam that forms Cedar Cliff Lake in the Canada community began in 2019 and now is expected to be completed in 2024. “Based on current conditions, the project construction and lake drawdown will extend into 2022,” Duke spokeswoman Kim Crawford said in an interview in May. “Based on current projections, the lake drawdown and associated construction work should be completed by the fall of 2024,” Duke Government and Community Relations Manager Lisa Leatherman said in an August missive to area property owners. “We communicated an updated completion date in late August to lake property owners,” Crawford said last Thursday. Duke mailed a postcard to property owners the week of Aug. 20, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission posted a legal ad regarding the extensions of the lake drawdown in The Sylva Herald on Sept. 2. “Our original estimate for the drawdown period was optimistic regarding the duration of the auxiliary spillway components of the project and was not based on contractor estimates,” Crawford said. “There was simply not enough information at that time, and the contractor for the primary construction phase was not yet on board. “Additionally, delays due to COVID-19, necessary precursor site work, dam safety vibration limitations when blasting, and unanticipated restrictions on production required to meet turbidity limits resulted in individual and cumulative impacts to the original construction schedule. We regret the inconvenience to lake property owners and lake users while we complete this important dam safety work.” FERC required Duke to make modifications to ensure the safety of the dam during extreme high-water conditions, Crawford said. The spillway upgrade project includes deepening and widening the existing auxiliary spillway channel and replacing the two fuseplugs with a fusegate system, according to the engineering report. A fuseplug is a collapsible dam installed on spillways in dams to increase a dam’s capacity. Fusegates provide a controlled release of water during large floods. In large flood conditions they topple forward, allowing a controlled flow of water. The existing spillway width will increase from 95 feet to 145 feet, and the channel bottom will be lowered by 15 feet on average. That phase was completed and Phase II, the primary phase of construction, began in January of this year. The work will include widening the auxiliary spillway, primarily by blasting, installing a new fusegate system, and refurbishing the crest of the dam including adding a concrete wall, Crawford said Here is the text of the postcard Duke sent property owners around Cedar Cliff Lake: “As your neighbor, we want to keep you informed about activities underway at Cedar Cliff Dam.

North Carolina has Good Samaritan laws that protect people who call 911 to save a life even if they themselves are in possession of unlawful substances. Just about seven people in North Carolina die from drug overdoses/alcohol poisoning every day, and the State wants to reduce those numbers. Through the “Safe to Call” campaign, the State wants people to know that they shouldn’t hesitate to call 911 if they’re with someone who’s in danger of ODing. Often they don’t call because they don’t want to be arrested. Anyone (even minors) shouldn’t worry about being taken into custody as long as they’re acting in good faith to save a life and cooperate with law enforcement by giving their names.

On Sunday, Dec. 5, Democratic Commissioner Kay Cashion informed the Rhino Times that she would file to run again to stay on the board that she’s served on for 17 years. Cashion, unlike the other eight commissioners on the board, must seek votes not just from one district but from every part of Guilford County. She said Sunday night that she’s looking forward to filing. As usual, she’ll be doing so with a group of supporters by her side. The longtime commissioner said she was making the move “after much encouragement from friends and business associates, as well as citizens I know and some I don’t know, and family.” “It just feels right,” she added. Cashion, the commissioner on the board who without question has the most interaction and connection with state and national commissioner organizations and initiatives, said she feels as though that wide range of participation will be a plus for the county’s citizens. “I have the experience by involvement at local, state and national levels – and currently have leadership roles in all these areas – which provide me with knowledge and opportunity to better serve our citizens,” Cashion said. She added that she had “the interest, enthusiasm and time” to continue serving. “It has been an honor to serve our Guilford County citizens over these 17 years as a commissioner,” Cashion said, “and many years previously as a community volunteer.” Cashion, who made her name in the furnishings and decorating business for decades, was chosen by the Democratic Party in 2004 to replace former Democratic Commissioner Jeff Thigpen after he won a better paying gig – and no doubt less aggravating one \xad– as the Guilford County Register of Deeds. Cashion initially represented a former version of commissioners’ District 6, which covered much of southwest Greensboro. Share: Time for new blood! We need new blood. A clean sweep…… You see what the same-ol’, same-ol’ has got us. It’s time for new blood to be elected in Guilford County. Our elders have tried, but they lack the stamina to make things change for the better. Kay is running on her name and her party, not her accomplishments. I’ve written her two or three times and she never responds. She doesn’t seem to have time to do her job so perhaps she should resign instead of pretending to represent us.
