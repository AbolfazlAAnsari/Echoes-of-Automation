People wait in line to vote on Tuesday at the Central Wyoming Fair and Rodeo fairgrounds in Casper. Many voters said they turned out to vote against Rep. Liz Cheney. The Cheneys left Restoration Church in Casper on Tuesday, happy after casting their votes for Harriet Hageman in Wyoming’s U.S. House race. These Cheneys aren’t named Liz or Dick — they’re Al and Margaret, who pronounce their last name “chee-nee” and aren’t related to the representative or former vice president (as far as they know). Why did they vote for Hageman in Tuesday’s primary election? “Because she’s not Cheney,” Al said. Voter turnout Tuesday was unusually high for a primary, poll workers said. A line to vote at the Natrona County Fairgrounds stretched at least 100 yards down Fairgrounds Road around lunchtime. Even Poison Spider School, one of the more rural polling places in Natrona County, had seen about 120 people vote by the early afternoon. “Some might sigh when they see the line, but I think it’s a good sign,” said Davina Mikels, waiting for her turn to vote at the fairgrounds in a red shirt that said “Pray for our nation” over an American flag. “It’s just been consistently busy,” said Beth Worthen, working as an election judge at Wardwell Water and Sewer District in Bar Nunn. “We had more people this time around waiting to vote before the polls opened at 7 (a.m.).” People vote on Tuesday at the Central Wyoming Fair and Rodeo fairgrounds in Casper. In addition to Wyoming's historic House race, the state's top elected offices were also on the ballot. Many voters said they came specifically to vote Liz Cheney out of office. Of those, all said they were casting votes for Harriet Hageman, a land attorney challenging Cheney who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump last year. Several said they felt Cheney had stopped representing Wyoming interests, and that she was no longer in touch with the state. Others said she was a hypocrite for turning on Trump following Jan. 6. “This is Trump country,” said rancher Will Duncan, after voting at Poison Spider School. “He endorsed (Hageman), and I like the way she helps ranchers. ... I don’t like the things (Liz) stands for.” The Cheneys voting at Restoration Church said they were impressed that Hageman had walked in the parade during fair week in Casper. Another voter named Rick said he didn’t know much about the attorney, but liked her television commercials. Cheney’s fundraising is also concerning for many Natrona County voters — the representative raised most of her money from out-of-state contributions, while the vast majority of Hageman’s money comes from Wyomingites. “I don’t believe that you should be taking campaign dollars from out of your state, because they’re not your constituents who you represent,” said Tuke Burgess. Brian Kunert, voting at Poison Spider, said he wanted to vote for state Rep. Anthony Bouchard, R-Burns, a far-right candidate in the House race. But he voted for Hageman instead. “I usually don’t do this, but I wanted to pick the candidate who was going to win,” Kunert said. A truck passes a polling place sign on Tuesday at the Wardwell Water and Sewer District building in Casper. Poll workers said they saw a significant number of people switching their party affiliation to vote on the Republican ballot Tuesday, as well as many registering for the first time. Nearly half of voters at the Natrona County Library had switched or registered on Tuesday, a judge said, and around 20% had done the same at Poison Spider. Jake Thompson said he planned to register to vote for the first time Tuesday, at 31 years old. He wants to sign a pair of petitions aimed at sending marijuana decriminalization and medical use to a public vote, he said, but can’t until he’s registered. He also said he wants to “see Cheney gone.” But Cheney is still getting some votes from traditional Republicans. Jeff Davis planned to vote for her and said he supported her vote to impeach Trump. “The woman running against her just is completely phony,” Davis said. “My support is with Cheney, 100%.” Another voter, named James, said he knows his vote for Cheney will likely be in the minority in the Republican primary. “I’ve been a Republican my whole life, but I know what an insurrection looks like,” he said. Will Duncan presents his drivers license to vote on Tuesday at the Poison Spider School library in Natrona County. Tuesday was the first major test of Wyoming's Voter ID law. Tuesday was also the state’s first major election after a law passed in 2021 requiring voters to bring identification at the polls. Election judges said there were very few problems with the new requirement. “They’d give us IDs even before, so they all think it’s right that we need to be asking for them,” said Poison Spider poll worker Debbie Reddy. “They were all asking why we hadn’t had to do it earlier,” another, Terry Kipp, added. And though lines were long at some polling places, they moved fast. At the fairgrounds, one of the most crowded locations, Ken and Marilyn Neal said they made it through in 20 minutes. “I’ve never seen a primary like this,” Marilyn said. “The whole nation is watching the Cowboy State!” Leticia Lee casts her ballot on Tuesday at the Natrona County Library in Casper.

He also said that even though he followed Trump’s endorsement in voting for Hageman, he opted for Mark Armstrong, a geologist, in the secretary of state race rather than the Trump-backed Rep. Chuck Gray, R-Casper. “Chuck’s kind of flip-flopped on voter rights,” Kunert said. “Don’t flip-flop. Basically, it’s hypocrisy.” James, the Republican voting for Cheney, said he chose Sen. Tara Nethercott, R-Cheyenne, for secretary. Gray’s conduct and repeated warnings in the statehouse concern him, James said, and he feels the representative has no real interest in the economy — not ideal for an office that oversees businesses in the state. “Chuck Gray is a disaster waiting to happen,” he said. “He wants to talk about voter fraud that doesn’t exist in Wyoming. … He wants to be a commentator on Fox News. He doesn’t want to be an actual official.” On the county level, James said he voted for a slate of incumbents for county commission. Polls were set to close at 7 p.m. Tuesday. Most races, especially on the county level, may not be called until late Tuesday or early Wednesday. Monique Meese, communications and policy director for the secretary of state, said her office could be working as late as 1 a.m. to get results in. While early, mail-in and drop-off ballots have been accepted across the state since early July, county officials could not start counting them until 7 a.m. Tuesday. Those totals will likely be in by the end of the day. People wait in line to vote on Aug. 16 at the Central Wyoming Fair and Rodeo Fairgrounds in Casper.

LARAMIE – Wyoming’s current players were in grade school when BYU left the Mountain West after the 2010 season. Head coach Craig Bohl considers counterpart Kalani Sitake to be a friend. The modern-day Cowboys (3-1) don’t view the Cougars (2-1) as rivals on the scale of Colorado State or perhaps even Utah State. That doesn’t mean they won’t study the series history crib notes this week as UW prepares for the challenge of playing No. 19 BYU on Saturday night at LaVell Edwards Stadium (8:15 p.m., ESPN2).

Heard some rumblings about it and different stories. Then when we played the bowl game, I went up to Kalani and I was like, ‘What is the deal?’ “So it’s on. I know our fans embrace it and are excited about it. I think it would be really counterproductive to dwell on all that.

The Cowboys out-gained the nation’s leading rushing team on the ground and finished with 342 total yards (180 rushing) to Air Force’s 272 total yards (171 rushing). Quarterback Andrew Peasley completed 78.3% of his passes with one touchdown and one interception. “I thought we played clean,” Bohl said. “We had one turnover.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 3:20 pm “There’s been a wave of phone scams this week where the caller is using deputies’ names,” Teton County Sheriff Matt Carr said. “They tend to target things by ZIP code, working in a certain area at a certain time. They’re probably pulling our deputies’ names off the internet.” This week, Dispatch Manager for the Sheriff’s Office Riclyn Betsinger said that although she hasn’t been tracking the number of scam-related calls she has received, she estimates she has fielded 30 to 40 this week from people who are reporting scammers. “What’s different this week is they’re posing as law enforcement and using law enforcement names,” Betsinger said. “Sometimes they’re even sending it through our law enforcement numbers so [the phone call] shows up as dispatch. “People are getting calls about missing jury duty, scammers saying because you missed jury duty you now have to send some kind of money,” Betsinger said. “Or that you have a warrant out for your arrest, so you have to pay to take care of it. “A lot of time they’re phishing for identity information, so they will ask you to confirm your personal information on something, and then they’ll steal identities that way.” Another red flag is a request to pay for your so-called debt using gift cards, which are untraceable. “Scammers will ask people to go to Albertsons or Target to buy eBay gift cards or something like that because there’s no way to track it,” Betsinger said. “Recently we had people posing as Lower Valley Energy calling people saying you have to go purchase gift cards. I believe a few people bought them.” Although Betsinger said a wave of scams “happens every few months,” Carr said his concern has been that even folks he considers to be sharp and “very astute businesspeople” are feeling unclear enough to call and verify. “It’s a lot of very intelligent people that are calling,” Carr said. “They’re getting hooked enough to call us to try to confirm. The scammers are very, very good at what they do.” Carr added that the scammers often “prey on the elderly,” and that the recent evolution of spoofing local numbers has added to the confusion. Betsinger offered some blanket advice to folks who receive requests from “agencies” such as the Internal Revenue Service or Social Security Administration to send payment or personal information. “The biggest thing is, most of these agencies, including the Sheriff’s Office, aren’t going to be asking for money over the phone,” Betsinger said. “Most of the time if you did owe money of some sort, they’re going to ask for that in writing.” Carr doubled down on that, citing specific instances when the Sheriff’s Office would call you. “We don’t ever call asking anybody for money. Ever,” Carr said. “The only time we’ll call is for paper service. We’ll either ask you to come in and pick it up or have a uniformed deputy deliver it to your house. We don’t take money at all.” Another scam entails efforts to blackmail middle schoolers and high schoolers. Jackson Hole resident Devon Viehman said that in her weekly parents’ circle she has heard of six instances over the past six weeks of kids being extorted using graphic photos. “I’ve heard from multiple parents that scammers are photoshopping their child’s head onto a graphic murdered body, saying, ‘This will happen to you and your family if you don’t send me money,’ ” Viehman said. Scammers have also been photo editing the heads of children onto naked bodies. “They’ll say, ‘Send money or I’ll post this [nude photo of you] on Instagram,’ ” Viehman said. “I saw one scammer tagged a child on Instagram and said, ‘Are you friends with so and so?
