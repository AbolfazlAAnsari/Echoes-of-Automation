are bracing for the possibility of a more isolationist United States. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to pull the U.S. out of NATO, and lately he\'s been saying that if he\'s reelected, he won\'t protect NATO members that fail to meet defense spending targets. Vice President Kamala Harris sought to reassure European allies at the Munich Security Conference on Friday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAMALA HARRIS: We must be unwavering, and we cannot play political games. MARTÍNEZ: We turn now to Catherine Fieschi. She\'s a political analyst and fellow at the European University Institute, joins us now from Paris. Mark Rutte is the outgoing prime minister of the Netherlands. He said at this conference, quote, that Europe ""should actually stop moaning and whining and nagging about Trump."" So, Catherine, do you think European states can actually ramp up defense spending and ammunition production, regardless of what happens in the U.S.? CATHERINE FIESCHI: Well, I think that Mark Rutte did make a really good point. Europe had become, you know, far too complacent over the past few decades. I think it\'s got the message. It\'s got the message that regardless of whether or not there is a second Trump presidency, things are not likely to get better and that the United States will probably be otherwise engaged and pivot back to their original plan, which is, you know, to be more involved in the Pacific. So Europe needs to get its act together. But I would argue that it is trying to do so. It is increasing its NATO spending to meet the target of 2%. Each member state is doing that. The European Union is behaving more as a geopolitical entity since 2019. They\'ve just released 50 billion for Ukraine. France and Germany have entered into separate bilateral security agreements in order to defend Ukraine, each worth 3 billion. So Europe is stepping up to defend Ukraine, but it also knows that it needs to step up to defend itself more broadly. And, you know, that is partly also an enlarged EU with the Western Balkans and Ukraine, but also an enlarged NATO, with Sweden hopefully soon and Finland already new members. MARTÍNEZ: If Europe were to do all that, everything you just mentioned, would that actually not be a great thing for the United States\' influence in Europe? FIESCHI: I mean, I think that in terms of the United States, you know, the Europeans have argued for a long time that there should be a European pillar within NATO, and it\'s never been very clear to the Europeans whether the United States would resent that, that kind of a measure of autonomy, or whether, in fact, they would take it as as Europe taking its own responsibility. Kissinger, you know, years ago basically said he had no problem with a stronger Europe at the heart of NATO. And I think that no matter what, Europe has to start thinking about being able to expand its own strategic capabilities, and in many ways, you know, very specifically to be able to deploy a nuclear shield and a nuclear umbrella over Europe in a rather autonomous fashion. MARTÍNEZ: If America stops helping Ukraine, Catherine, what are Europe\'s options there? I mean, how prepared would European powers be to step up and help out Ukraine? FIESCHI: I think that they are able to help out Ukraine. I think that the amount of money and weapons that the United States supply is very, very hard to match. The Europeans know this, and therefore, this is why they do want to find a way to bring the parties to a negotiating table. MARTÍNEZ: That\'s Catherine Fieschi at the European University Institute. Catherine, thanks. FIESCHI: You\'re welcome. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. NPR transcripts are created on a rush deadline by an NPR contractor.

state Attorney General Letitia James on Friday. A jury in Manhattan found top executives of the National Rifle Association liable after a six-week corruption lawsuit that she brought against the men. Two of the NRA\'s leaders, Wayne LaPierre and Wilson Phillips, have been ordered to repay roughly $6.4 million dollars between them. Their attorneys say they will appeal. ""This verdict is a major victory for the people of New York and our efforts to stop the corruption and greed at the NRA,"" James said in a statement. Just hours earlier a state judge in New York City finalized a ruling in another case brought by James, ordering former President Donald Trump to pay a total of $454 million in penalties linked to fraud allegations. He has 30 days to appeal. ""Donald Trump may have authored The Art of the Deal, but he perfected the art of the steal,"" James said at a news conference last Friday after the ruling against Trump was issued. She then took a shot at Trump\'s character: ""The scale and the scope of Donald Trump\'s fraud is staggering and so too is his ego and his belief that the rules do not apply to him."" James, 65, is a Democrat who made history as the first Black woman to serve as New York\'s attorney general. A Brooklyn native and a graduate of Howard University School of Law, she wasn\'t widely known outside New York City, where she served on the City Council and later in the largely ceremonial role of public advocate. But after just five years as New York state\'s attorney general, James has built a reputation as a giant-slayer, targeting — and in some cases, toppling — some of the most powerful figures and organizations in the United States. While her track record taking on and winning big cases has won James accolades, it has also drawn criticism. Trump and his allies have long claimed her choice of targets reflects bias on the part of an ambitious Democratic politician. ""We have a totally corrupt attorney general,"" Trump said during a news conference February 16th at his Mar-a-Lago property in Palm Beach, Fla., and he promised to appeal. ""She campaigned on the fact that \'I will get Trump, I will get Trump.\' Everybody\'s seen it,"" Trump added. Indeed, Trump\'s accusation that James is part of a political ""witch hunt"" is fueled in part by her own campaign rhetoric. When James ran for attorney general in 2018, Trump was still in the White House. She made it clear to voters that he was in her crosshairs. In one campaign video, James promised to ""take on President Donald Trump and anyone who tries to deny New Yorkers their most basic rights."" ""I\'m running for attorney general because I will never be afraid to challenge this illegitimate president,"" James said in another campaign video. After winning office, James gave an interview to NBC News in December 2018 where she promised to ""use every area of the law to investigate President Trump and his business transactions and that of his family as well."" She did as promised. During her first year in office, James successfully pursued her first civil lawsuit against Trump, filed initially by her predecessor, alleging he misused donations given to his charitable organization. Trump paid $2 million and his foundation was dissolved. ""These damages speak to the president\'s abuse of power,"" James said in a statement, adding that ""no one is above the law ... not even the president of the United States."" Despite agreeing to portions of the settlement, Trump fired back, denying wrongdoing and complaining he was being ""attacked by the political hacks in New York State."" In September 2022, James sued Trump again, this time on the fraud charges that led to last week\'s jaw-dropping penalties. During a news conference announcing the lawsuit,James acknowledged she would face criticism that her lawsuit is partisan. She said her investigation of Trump\'s business dealings ""only started after Michael Cohen, his former lawyer, testified before Congress about this conduct."" ""We have produced evidence about the scope, the scale, the depth, the breadth of the illegality, the fraud that personally enriched Donald Trump and his family,"" James said. Trump again blasted James, using a racially charged nickname and accusing her in a post on his Truth Social site of being a ""fraud who campaigned on a \'get Trump\' platform."" Conservative media have amplified claims by Trump, who faces dozens of criminal charges in four separate cases, that he is being attacked unfairly by Democratic prosecutors, including James, as part of an effort to cripple him politically. In Manhattan, Trump faces a criminal trial, brought by District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, linked to allegedly illegal hush money payments. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, also a Democrat, is pursuing criminal charges against Trump linked to allegations that he tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. Trump also faces federal charges linked to alleged election interference and charges that he improperly handled classified documents after leaving the White House. ""They\'re going in with a predetermined agenda and making that a campaign promise,"" said Fox News personality Sean Hannity in October on the TV channel. ""Does that sound like justice?"" Speaking on Hannity\'s program, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley echoed the concern that James, in particular, acted improperly. ""When James was running for office, I wrote that I thought there were serious ethical problems with a prosecutor really trying to secure office on the pledge to nail one person,"" Turley said. ""This a trophy pledge that \'I\'m going to bag Donald Trump.\'"" This month, a close Trump ally, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., filed an ethics complaint against James. ""Ms. James has displayed a personal vendetta against President Trump that renders her unable to impartially handle cases,"" Stefanik said. Members of Andrew Cuomo\'s inner circle have also accused James of bias, saying she used her office\'s sexual harassment probe to force him out of office. ""It\'s all about what serves [Letitia] James,"" said Rich Azzopardi, a longtime Democratic operative in New York and an adviser to Cuomo. ""It has nothing to do with the responsibilities of the office. I\'ve never seen a more political attorney general."" James did briefly run for governor after Cuomo\'s resignation, but her campaign faltered. She withdrew from the governor\'s race and instead won a second term as state attorney general in November 2022. James didn\'t accept NPR\'s repeated requests for an interview for this story. In public appearances, however, she has addressed accusations that her lawsuits against Trump are political. ""This case has never been about politics or personal vendettas or about name-calling,"" James said last year. ""This case is about the facts and the law."" Christina Greer, a political scientist at the City College of New York who has studied James\' career, said it\'s common for prosecutors to take firm public positions, sometimes controversial ones, on policy and the law. ""It\'s an elected position. Isn\'t there always going to be politics for an elected position? I mean, she has to have a point of view."" Greer noted that James\' lawsuits are all tested in court, before judges or juries. Powerful defendants, typically represented by top-tier legal teams, have the opportunity to prove that cases are flawed or biased. Instead, James continues to prevail. ""She\'s able to take on these very high-powered men, Democrats and Republicans alike, because she also had a very dedicated team of lawyers [who build strong cases],"" Greer said. Attorneys for the NRA, too, attempted to argue in court that James\' lawsuit was politically motivated. The gun group claimed repeatedly in legal filings that James\' lawsuit was politically motivated, part of a ""witch hunt"" designed to weaken and silence a conservative advocacy group. In 2022, however, state Judge Joel Cohen rejected the NRA\'s argument of political bias and allowed the case to move forward. ""There are no factual allegations [by the NRA] suggesting that the stated concerns driving the investigation – reports of fraud, waste, and looting within the NRA – were imaginary or not believed by the Attorney General,"" Cohen wrote. On Friday, a jury again validated a complex civil case brought by James and her team, finding that LaPierre and others leading the NRA violated their duty to manage the non-profit ethically. ""We will not hesitate to pursue justice against any individual or organization that violates our laws or our trust, no matter how powerful they are,"" James said in a statement. Copyright 2024 NPR.

'HUMAN_ONLY', 'version': '2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — Consumer inflation in the United States cooled last month yet remained elevated in the latest sign that the pandemic-fueled price surge is only gradually and fitfully coming under control. Tuesday’s report from the Labor Department showed that the consumer price index rose 0.3% from December to January, up from a 0.2% increase the previous month. Compared with a year ago, prices are up 3.1%. That is less than the 3.4% figure in December and far below the 9.1% inflation peak in mid-2022. But the latest reading is still well above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target level at a time when public frustration with inflation has become a pivotal issue in President Joe Biden’s bid for re-election. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, so-called core prices climbed 0.4% last month, up from 0.3% in December. On a year-over-year basis, core prices were up 3.9% in January, the same as in December. Core inflation is watched especially closely because it typically provides a better read of where inflation is likely headed. Biden administration officials frequently note that inflation has plummeted since pandemic-related supply disruptions and significant government aid sent it soaring three years ago. And a raft of forward-looking data suggests that inflation will continue to cool. Still, even as it nears the Fed’s target level, many Americans remain exasperated that average prices are still about 19% higher than they were when Biden took office. From December to January, average national gas prices tumbled 3.3%, the government said. Yet so far this month, the average price has climbed higher, rising 15 cents to $3.23 a gallon as of Tuesday, according to AAA. Grocery prices rose 0.4% from December to January, the biggest such rise in a year, though compared with 12 months earlier, food prices are up just 1.2%. The costs of physical goods, including clothing, used cars and prescription drugs, fell for a third straight month. Lower prices for goods are the key driver that is cooling inflation. By contrast, the prices of services — hotel rooms, restaurant meals, auto insurance, apartment rents and the like — are still rising faster than they did before the pandemic and keeping overall inflation persistently high. The cost of car insurance has soared more than 20%, on average, compared with a year ago. The mixed data released Tuesday could reinforce the caution of Fed officials, who have said they’re pleased with the progress in sharply reducing inflation but want to see further evidence before feeling confident that it’s sustainably headed back to their 2% target. Most economists think the central bank will want to wait until May or June to begin cutting its benchmark rate from its 22-year-high of roughly 5.4. The Fed raised its key rate 11 times, from March 2022 to July of last year, in a concerted drive to defeat high inflation. The result has been much higher borrowing rates for businesses and consumers, including for mortgages and auto loans. Rate cuts, whenever they happen, would eventually lead to lower borrowing costs for many categories of loans. Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted during a recent news conference that most of the decline in inflation so far has stemmed from lower prices for goods, including used cars, furniture and appliances, which have dropped in six of the past seven months. By contrast, the costs of services — auto repairs, health care, hotel rooms, concerts and other entertainment — are still rising briskly. Core services prices, which exclude energy, jumped 5.3% in 2023. The Fed will want to see some cooling in services prices to become more assured that inflation is declining. A rate cut by the central bank typically lowers the costs of mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other consumer and business borrowing, and could bolster the economy. But a much stronger economy could also pose a challenge for the Fed because faster growth can accelerate wages and consumer spending. If businesses aren’t able to keep up with greater customer demand, they typically respond by raising prices, which would worsen inflation. In the final three months of last year, the economy grew at an unexpectedly rapid 3.3% annual rate. There are signs that growth remains healthy so far in 2024. Businesses engaged in a burst of hiring last month. Surveys of manufacturing companies found that new orders rose in January. And services companies reported an uptick in sales. 1 day ago in Entertainment Thirty years later, Nicole\'s three sisters want her remembered for more than those static images or the violent way she died.

Police efforts to stop or find stolen vehicles often lead to car chases and crashes. National and local arrests show many of the thieves are juveniles, but are they being punished? News Center 7′s Mike Campbell talked with victims and those working in the justice system about the increase in car thefts. We all fear it, walk out to our driveway or employer parking lot and our car is missing. For many people, it’s the beginning of a long nightmare, made worse by the fact they can’t tell if anyone is being arrested or punished. We see it every day when officers are chasing a stolen car. Young people crash or dump the car and run. The owner hears nothing but bad news. Kathrine Trigg, who was the victim of a stolen car, said, “It had been involved in a crime in Oakwood and then crashed in Middletown.” Her car was stolen in July 2022. “I didn’t get much information from Dayton or the Prosecutor’s office,” Trigg said. She learned two young people got away and one juvenile was caught. That juvenile was out within two weeks and eventually ordered to pay restitution but didn’t have a job. “Financially it was rough. Just a rough time,” Trigg said. Jennifer Hunter’s car was stolen in August of 2022. She said, “It’s like a domino effect that you don’t expect to have happen.” Police found Hunter’s car within 10 minutes of her calling to report it stolen. Officers told her a group of juveniles took her vehicle, which they found six blocks away, wrecked, and trashed. “They all ran, and I never heard another thing,” Hunter said. She was forced to miss work, like many victims, which was a big money misery. “You can’t take people’s cars. Many are working paycheck to paycheck,” Hunter said. She was forced to pay for a new car, her payments went up and so did her insurance. If police arrest someone under 18, accusing them of a crime, they are brought to the back of the Montgomery County Juvenile Court building and are registered. Critics say the problem is many of these young people, under 18, walk right back out the doors, are released to their parent’s custody, almost before police finish paperwork, and are free to commit more crimes. News Center 7′s Mike Campbell asked Eric Shafer who is the Administrator for the Montgomery County Juvenile Court “You understand that people are frustrated when kids come down here on a car theft charge and they are released to their parents that night?” Shafer replied, “That is, that’s, I understand.” Shafer continued by saying, “Perception is not reality.” “We’ve been watching care theft cases very closely and over 70% of kids that come to our attention with that offense are held,” he said. According to Shafer, the rest of the juveniles accused of car theft are placed on electronic home monitoring if they are released. But the problem still seems to be growing, even spreading to businesses. JB Davis is the General Manager for Performance Chrysler, Jeep, and Dodge Ram in Centerville. That business has been hit a half dozen times by organized car thieves. “I’ve been doing this for 30 years and I’ve never seen anything like this,” Davis said. The car thieves are young, many of them juveniles. Davis said he had video of thieves inside his showroom one time and then another occasion on a back lot, driving away several vehicles at once. Davis said the thieves use every method available to make off with a vehicle. They are doing the same to stop them, blocking lots, adding camera systems and security teams, and even placing tracking devices in vehicles. “We are literally spending an hour or two a day, every day, to prepare,” Davis said. According to Davis, most of the stolen cars are prime merchandise. They average anywhere between $40,000 to $100,000 vehicles. The dealership’s insurance rates are up, their deductible is up, and they are forced to self-insure. Davis said several police agencies have worked with them and everyone is frustrated. “I think a lot of us feel like people are getting away with it,” Davis said. “I think the legal system is broke.” “I would say that is not true,” Shafter said. He believes they are working with community partners to improve their responses to this issue. “We’re focusing on rehabilitation at the juvenile court, that is truly our mission.

It’s like high school all over for her again.” “But I didn’t win bingo,” Donna interjected with a laugh. High schoolers took up most of the floor when it came to the dancing, but a handful of seniors got up to move when Elvis Presley’s classic rendition of “Hound Dog” came over the speakers. True to form, the event concluded with the crowning of a prom king and queen, followed by a slow dance to Presley’s “Can’t Help Falling in Love.” Prom queen Becky Barber poses for a photo with high school student Kianna O’Brien.

No, Jon Stewart really wasn’t sitting at his desk at Comedy Central for the last nine years, waiting for someone to turn the lights back on. Yet it almost felt that way during Stewart’s return to “The Daily Show” Monday night. His signature moves — blunt satire, facial grimaces, incisive use of video and some occasional lectures — were all intact. Public figures are served notice that the media’s sharpest bull detector is back on the job. Stewart has said that the lack of a comedic outlet for his observations as the presidential campaign unfolded largely drove his decision to reprise his most memorable role, one night a week through the election. The much-diminished Comedy Central, unable to find a successor to Trevor Noah as host, happily welcomed him back. Questions about the future of late-night TV, which is rapidly shedding viewers and losing influence, won’t be answered in one night. Neither will that night prove Stewart can regain the position of prominence he stepped away from in August 2015. But it was a promising start. “Are you disappointed yet?” Stewart said after one sophomoric joke, about naming “The Daily Show” election coverage, “Indecision 2024: Electile Dysfunction.” HE DOVE DIRECTLY INTO THE NEWS OF THE DAY Stewart seemed to take a page from MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow when she turned a daily hosting role into a weekly one. Both resisted trying to do too much, to cram a week’s — or in Stewart’s case, nine years — worth of material into one show. He moved swiftly into the news, and up-to-date doings of President Joe Biden and his Republican rival. In Biden’s case, it meant directly addressing questions about his age and fitness for office, which the president’s supporters surely want to avoid. He examined Biden’s news conference last week meant to counter characterizations in special counsel Robert Hur’s report on classified documents found in Biden’s home. “Joe Biden had a big press conference to dispel the notion that he may have lost a step and, politically speaking, lost three or four steps,” he said.

His main point: Worries about whether either the 81-year-old Biden or 77-year-old Trump are up to the toughest job in the world shouldn’t be swept under the rug. “It is the candidates’ job to assuage concerns, not the voters’ job not to mention them,” Stewart said.

Get more on that and other topics that were covered in the audio files below and in the Facebook live video at the bottom of this story.
