'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'NEW ORLEANS (WVUE/Louisiana Illuminator) - Gov. Jeff Landry has picked the longtime leader of a controversial juvenile detention center in north Louisiana where staff members faced allegations of sexual abuse, violence, and psychological torture to run Louisiana’s Office of Juvenile Justice, according to two people who work in the juvenile justice system. They declined to comment on the record for fear of professional retaliation. Kenneth “Kenny” Loftin ran Ware Youth Center in Coushatta from its opening in 1993 to 2015 and again from 2021 to 2022. He also served on the Louisiana Board of Pardons and Parole after being appointed by former Gov. John Bel Edwards in his first term and ran, unsuccessfully, for sheriff in Red River Parish. Current OJJ Deputy Secretary Curtis Nelson announced Thursday that his last day would be Fri., Feb. 2. The Ware detention center was the focus of a lengthy investigation into rampant child abuse and neglect by The New York Times and the Investigative Reporting Program at the University of California, Berkeley, Graduate School of Journalism. “In interviews and documents, 42 people at Ware held over the last 25 years described being sexually abused by staff members,” the October 2022 article reported. “In all, they identified 30 staff members who had sexually abused children at Ware.” Loftin declined to comment for this story on Wednesday morning. Landry’s office refused to answer questions about Loftin’s appointment or confirm he had been picked for the position. While no accusations of physical violence or sexual assault were made against Loftin personally in The New York Times story, the report includes many allegations of rape, choking and other violence by other Ware staff against detained children while Loftin was in charge of the facility. “Former residents and employees, in interviews, said Ware’s leaders were largely indifferent, even apathetic, in the face of abuse allegations,” the Times reported. Specific accusations included claims from eight formerly incarcerated girls and three staff members against one former employee, Mallory Parson, over alleged sexual assault taking place from 2005 to 2011. At least four of the girls accused Parson of rape, but none of them recalled investigations into his behavior taking place, according to the news report. Another longtime Ware manager, Raymond Lloyd, was accused of choking a child in custody at Ware until she was unconscious in 2021. Lloyd was still working at the facility in late 2022, when the investigation was first published in The New York Times. RELATED STORIES Political connections The article suggests Loftin was initially picked to run Ware because of his close relationship with former state Sen. Don Kelly, a Democrat from Natchitoches Parish who was close to former Gov. Edwin Edwards. Kelly helped set up Ware, which is run by a state board made up of local law enforcement officials and judges, and helped direct tens of millions of dollars of public money to the facility over several years. As the new head of the Office of Juvenile Justice, Loftin would oversee the agency that has traditionally provided Ware with most of its funding and is partially in charge of making sure it follows state laws and government regulations. One former state juvenile justice official, Glenn Holt, told The New York Times Loftin had little respect for state oversight of Ware when he was running the center, describing state inspections as a waste of time. The news investigation also revealed the Ware did not always report sexual abuse allegations made against staff at the facility to the state as required. Loftin’s ascent comes at an interesting time for the Office of Juvenile Justice’s relationship with Wade. The state had contracted with Wade to house all of the girls and young women put into the juvenile justice system’s secure care program under a contract Loftin helped secure for the detention center in 2009. But the Office of Juvenile Justice abruptly ended that arrangement with the facility last September. Outgoing state juvenile justice director Curtis Nelson said his agency could not afford to pay the additional $600,000 Ware requested this year to house just 24 young girls and women. The detention center was already receiving $2.9 million annually to take care of that same group. Ware had also erroneously enrolled the girls in Medicaid to cover their healthcare needs, even though the federal government prohibits incarcerated people from receiving Medicaid benefits, Nelson said. As a result, the state had to absorb an extra $2.5 million to $3 million per year for the girls’ healthcare expenses. Even with this contract canceled, Ware isn’t sitting empty. The state still pays the facility to run juvenile justice substance abuse programs and group homes on the site. Some of those contracts would likely fall under Loftin’s control at the Office of Juvenile Justice. State Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, has expressed concern about Loftin’s appointment. ”The reports about Ware from the NYT were beyond disturbing. OJJ clearly needs wholesale reform,” Duplessis wrote in a text message Wednesday. “If Mr. Loftin was in charge of Ware at that time, there are serious questions about whether this is a move in the direction toward improving OJJ.” Loftin will need Senate confirmation to take the post. Senate President Cameron Henry (R-Metairie) said he was not familiar with the NYT story and would need to read it before commenting. Senate Pro Tempore Regina Barrow (D-Baton Rouge) said she was concerned by the allegations and would contact Henry. State Rep. Alonzo Knox (D-New Orleans) crafted a task force on juvenile justice policy and said he wanted to speak with Loftin. “[The article] is beyond troubling, most of what I read was disgusting. To have something of that nature to go on for as long as it has, and have little investigation to produce outcome is troubling to me,” he said. Thursday morning, Inspector General Stephen Street confirmed an “exhaustive” probe into Ware is ongoing. He declined to comment on the NYT allegations. However, Thursday afternoon (2/1), Landry’s office sent FOX a letter from Street dated Feb. 1. It stated the letter was sent at the request Landry’s legal team. It stated the investigation into the facility was complete, but the report is not finalized. It reads in part: “We have no information that Mr. Loftin violated any laws, rules of ethics, or otherwise engaged in any conduct that would be disqualifying from appointment to government service.” When contacted about the seeming conflict between the two statements, Street reaffirmed the letter’s contents. Parole board past Loftin’s time on the parole board may also give insight into his approach to criminal justice issues. He was considered one of the more conservative and rigid board members appointed by John Bel Edwards. Loftin was perceived to be more reluctant to grant release to incarcerated people than most of his other peers on the board. Notably, he was one of two members in 2018 who denied release to Henry Montgomery, then a 71-year-old incarcerated person whose Supreme Court case was instrumental in extending the possibility of freedom to hundreds of prisoners across the country. A model prisoner, Montgomery served more than 50 years behind bars after being convicted in the 1963 killing of East Baton Rouge Sheriff’s Deputy Charles Hunt when Montgomery was 17. He was given life without parole, meaning he was supposed to die incarcerated without the possibility of release. In response to an appeal from Montgomery, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that he and other people sentenced to a life of imprisonment as minors needed to be given an opportunity for freedom. The court said teenagers don’t have fully developed brains and should not necessarily be held responsible for the rest of their lives for actions they take as children. Their cases require reexamination. Montgomery was eventually granted parole, on his third try, when Loftin was no longer a member of the parole panel weighing his case.

(AP) — For months, the underdog in the presidential primary refused to concede defeat. He fought hard in state after state, even as the front-runner amassed a delegate advantage that would be virtually impossible to overcome. The extended feud between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in 2016, which turned more bitter as time passed, left behind Democratic divisions that would ultimately contribute to their party’s crushing general election loss. Eight years later, some Republicans fear that history may soon repeat itself. Nikki Haley ‘s path to the GOP nomination is rapidly shrinking following recent losses in Iowa and New Hampshire. But she’s vowing to stay in the race indefinitely, backed by thousands of committed donors, a key slice of the party’s moderate wing and a new willingness to attack the mental fitness and legal baggage of 2024 Republican front-runner Donald Trump. And the harder Haley fights, the more Republican officials fear she may hurt his long-term prospects in the all-but certain general election ahead against Democratic President Joe Biden. Former Trump adviser David Urban described Haley’s continued presence as a distraction, a drain on resources and a source of frustration. “Nobody on Trump’s team thinks (a Biden matchup) is going to be easy. It’s going to be a bumpy road. It’s going to be a tough race. They want to hit the starter’s pistol and get going,” Urban said. “People need to start coming together and working together. But right now, none of that is happening because she’s still out there stoking the anti-Trump fire.” Of course, Haley is in a much different position than Sanders was during the epic 2016 campaign. The Vermont senator actually won contests, including his 22-point victory in the New Hampshire primary. Unless she manages a dramatic turnaround, Haley’s 11-point deficit in the same state last month may prove to be the high point of her presidential bid. Haley decided to skip Nevada’s presidential caucuses next Thursday in favor of a state primary election two days earlier that does not award delegates. Trump could embarrass Haley in her home state of South Carolina later in the month, where the former president has a loyal following. A Washington Post-Monmouth University poll on Thursday found Trump with a 26 point lead in the state. Yet in practical terms — and in Haley’s calculus — the GOP primary has barely begun. Just two states have voted so far in a process that will ultimately span all 50 before concluding at the GOP’s national nominating convention in July. “I am not going anywhere,” she told reporters on Thursday. “We have a country to save. And I am determined to keep on going the entire way. As long as we can keep closing that gap, I’m gonna keep staying in.” Such comments increasingly draw Trump’s ire as he’s eager to move past the primary completely and focus on Biden. At roughly the same time Haley was speaking, Trump was attacking her on social media. One post he shared said, “Nikki Haley is bought and paid for by our political enemies,” and another described Haley as “deeply disliked” by a growing number of Americans. Some Republicans worry that Trump’s preoccupation with Haley, whom he frequently calls “birdbrain,” might further alienate moderate voters and suburban women. Haley is getting stronger by some measures. Her campaign has raised $5 million from small-dollar donors in the days since she finished in second place in New Hampshire, according to spokesperson Nachama Soloveichik. She’s also in the midst of a four-state fundraising tour that will feature at least 10 closed-door events with wealthy donors. This week’s initial swing through New York netted more than $1.5 million, Soloveichik said. Republican fundraiser Eric Levine, who co-hosted one of the New York events, said the few hundred Haley donors who gathered earlier in the week “remain as committed to Haley as ever.” Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney highlighted the candidate’s commitment to the race during a meeting with some of the GOP’s leading donors earlier in the week in Florida, according to two Republican officials in the room granted anonymity to share private discussions. Trump senior adviser Susie Wiles also delivered a presentation to the group, which was designed to highlight the former president’s tightening grip on the nomination. Many major donors remain critical of Trump, but some of the biggest would-be Haley supporters are essentially in a holding pattern ahead of South Carolina’s Feb. 24 primary. They believe she is essentially fully funded for the rest of the month and there’s little more they can do in the short term, according to the officials. Two of the group’s founders, billionaire hedge fund managers Ken Griffin and Paul Singer, each donated $5 million to Haley’s 2024 bid in recent weeks, according to federal filings made public this week. Trump also continues to report strong fundraising totals. But his legal troubles are consuming a huge portion of his donors’ dollars. Two of Trump’s political action committees spent roughly $50 million in donor funds on the former president’s legal fees last year, according to federal filings made public this week. And his legal costs are continuing to grow. Haley has begun to ratchet up attacks against Trump, a deliberate strategy designed to highlight the former president’s glaring liabilities, including his legal baggage and his age. The campaign lumped Trump and Biden together in a new attack ad this week calling them “Grumpy Old Men.” She’s also working to link the 77-year-old Trump’s refusal to debate to questions about his mental acuity. And in a Wednesday interview on the “Breakfast Club” radio program, she blamed Trump for the state of the nation’s politics. “He’s made it chaotic,” she said. “He’s made it self-absorbed.” Her message appears to be resonating with a key group of swing voters who play a pivotal role in general elections. In New Hampshire’s recent primary, for example, Trump won a decisive victory against Haley backed by his popularity among traditional Republican voters. But he lost a majority of moderates and about two-thirds of those who identify as independents, according to AP VoteCast. He also lost about 6 in 10 who have college degrees, and he’s shown a persistent vulnerability among voters living in suburbs. But the Republican base is still decidedly behind Trump. And a growing group of Republican elected officials on Capitol Hill are calling for Haley to quit the race. Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel said recently that it was time to unite behind Trump. B.J. Hopper, an 81-year-old self-described “Never Trumper, is doubtful that Haley will catch Trump, but she attended Thursday’s stop in South Carolina’s capital city because she’s trying to be hopeful. “It’d be a miracle,” Hopper said of a Haley victory in the state’s upcoming primary. As much of the attention shifts to South Carolina, Haley’s campaign insists her goal there isn’t to win, but simply to show growth compared to New Hampshire. She’s building campaign infrastructure in next-up Michigan and several states that host primary contests on March 5, also known as “Super Tuesday.” The Haley campaign has already rolled out leadership teams and “Women for Nikki” chapters in all 15 Super Tuesday states. A pro-Haley super PAC is also coordinating get-out-the-vote efforts in South Carolina, Michigan and multiple super Tuesday states. That’s in addition to the Koch-backed conservative group, Americans for Prosperity, which has devoted its army of grassroots activists on the ground in several key states to helping Haley. Specifically, the group is knocking on doors, sending pro-Haley mail and running online ads in Tennessee, North Carolina, Arkansas and Virginia. But the Koch network will not continue to support her if it determines there is no path to victory, according to conversations between Koch officials and donors at a private retreat last week in California, where Haley discussed the state of her presidential campaign during a short video call. During a separate session with top donors, AFP Action senior advisers Emily Seidel and Michael Palmer reaffirmed the group’s decision to endorse Haley given that she is the last Trump alternative standing, according to an official with direct knowledge of the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy. Seidel and Palmer also made clear to donors that the group would not make future investments to any campaign if there is no opportunity to win, the official said, pointing to the Kochs’ longstanding business-like approach to politics. Meanwhile, other Republican operatives believe Haley’s continued candidacy creates unnecessary risks for the notoriously undisciplined Trump. “The longer she hangs around and the more Trump focuses on her, the greater likelihood you get unforced errors,” said Republican pollster'}]"

hiring to begin 2024, adding 353,000 jobs in January in the latest sign of the economy’s continuing ability to shrug off the highest interest rates in two decades. Friday’s government report showed that last month’s job gain — roughly twice what economists had predicted — topped the December gain of 333,000, a figure that was itself revised sharply higher. The unemployment rate stayed at 3.7%, just above a half-century low. Wages rose unexpectedly fast in January, too. Average hourly pay climbed a sharp 0.6% from December, the fastest monthly gain in nearly two years, and 4.5% from January 2023. The strong hiring and wage growth could complicate or delay the Federal Reserve’s intention to start cutting interest rates later this year. The latest gains showcased employers’ willingness to keep hiring to meet steady consumer spending. It comes as the intensifying presidential campaign is pivoting in no small part on views of President Joe Biden’s economic stewardship. Public polls show widespread dissatisfaction largely because even though inflation has sharply slowed, most prices remain well above pre-pandemic levels. Some recent surveys, though, show public approval gradually improving. “America’s economy is the strongest in the world,’’ Biden said Friday. “Today, we saw more proof, with another month of strong wage gains and employment gains of over 350,000 in January, continuing the strong growth from last year. ‘’ This week, the Fed took note of the economy’s durability, with Chair Jerome Powell saying “the economy is performing well, the labor market remains strong.” The central bank made clear that while it’s nearing a long-awaited shift toward cutting interest rates, it’s in no hurry to do so. The details in Friday’s jobs report pointed to broad hiring gains across the economy. Professional and business services, a category that includes managers and technical workers, added 74,000 jobs. Healthcare companies added 70,000, retailers 45,000, governments at all levels 36,000 and manufacturers 23,000. The unemployment rate has now come in below 4% for two straight years, the longest such streak since the 1960s. “Overall, the labor market remains strong and continues to defy expectations of a softening,’’ said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. “For Fed officials, these data strongly support patience on rate cuts. Policymakers will be in no rush to lower rates if job and wage growth continue to be robust over coming months.’’ Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su brushed aside any concerns that last month’s wage growth might prove inflationary. “Wage growth has now been consistently beating inflation,” Su told The Associated Press. “Working people and families have more money in their pockets. They have more security.’’ Julia Pollak, chief economist at the job marketplace ZipRecruiter, noted that not everything in the January report was consistent with gangbuster job growth. She pointed out, for example, that Americans worked an average of 34.1 hours a week last month, the lowest such figure since 2010 excluding the COVID-19 recession. “When consumer demand slackens, companies often cut workers’ hours before they cut payroll,” Pollak said. “Today’s reading could be a warning sign that demand for workers is softening and that job cuts are looming.’’ That said, she suggested that the decline in work hours might simply reflect January winter storms that kept some people away from work. To fight inflation, the Fed raised its benchmark rate 11 times beginning in March 2022. The higher borrowing costs were widely expected to boost unemployment and likely cause a recession. Yet the economy has managed to deliver enough job growth to avoid a downturn without accelerating inflation pressures. Inflation cooled throughout 2023, making it likelier that the Fed would achieve a “soft landing” — taming inflation without derailing the economy. January’s blowout job gain is all but sure to cause the Fed to take a cautious approach toward cutting its key interest rate, which affects many consumer and business loans. A March rate cut now seems definitely off the table. A series of high-profile layoff announcements, from the likes of UPS, Google and Amazon, have raised some concerns about whether they might herald the start of a wave of job cuts. Yet measured against the nation’s vast labor force, the recent layoffs haven’t been significant enough to make a dent in the overall job market. Historically speaking, layoffs are still low, hiring is still solid and the unemployment rate is still consistent with a healthy economy. Indeed, some companies are still struggling to fill positions. Ryan Parnow, general manager of Blue Rocket LLC, in Coralville, Iowa, said that hiring workers to do commercial and residential cleaning remains a struggle even though the company is raising pay and offering year-end bonuses, ranging from $750 to $2,000, for new hires as well as existing staffers. For a window washer job it posted a few weeks ago, Blue Rocket brought in six applicants for interviews, including one who walked out in the middle of the conversation. The others rejected job offers. Now, the company has to start again from scratch. “It’s frustrating,” Parnow said. ”I am spending more time on the job site.” While jobs are plentiful in most sectors of the economy, those that offer attractive perks — like the ability to work from home — are drawing particular interest. Among the beneficiaries have been Anthony Pappaly, who began looking for a job in corporate communications or public relations after leaving the Coast Guard in November. “I was noticing new job postings all the time,’’ said Pappaly, 30. “I also noticed just a swarm of people going to the same jobs … especially the hybrid jobs or the work-from-home jobs.’’ Pappaly landed at Upbring, a Texas nonprofit that runs programs to help children across the state. He works from home most days and likes the flexibility to occasionally visit his mother in California and work from her home. Upbring, with 1,100 employees, has managed to fill jobs by increasing its recruiting staff, offering work-from-home options where possible, raising pay and surveying employees about their top priorities, said Carolyn Paganoni, who oversees its human resources staff. Competition for top talent remains tough, said David Lewis, an executive at Wed Society, an Oklahoma-based media franchise brand that promotes wedding vendors. To compete for job applicants, the company has raised pay by up to 15% in the past two years. “It’s costing more money to find top talent,” Lewis said. “If you’re looking for sheer number of applicants, it’s up. But what it seems to be is people that are currently employed looking to trade up as opposed to unemployed people needing a job.” ___ AP Writers Anne D’Innocenzio in New York and Christopher Rugaber in Washington contributed to this report.
