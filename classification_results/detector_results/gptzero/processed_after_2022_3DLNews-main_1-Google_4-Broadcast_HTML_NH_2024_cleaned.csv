(Sophia Germer/The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate via AP) Photo: Associated Press By KEVIN McGILL Associated Press NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Carnival season 2024 entered its final days in New Orleans on Friday as a parade of “fabulous women and the men who support them” walked the narrow streets of the old French Quarter handing out hand-decorated bras. The krewe of “Bosom Buddies & Breast Friends” is one of the smaller clubs that have flourished in recent years as the weekslong pre-Lenten bash in New Orleans has evolved. More traditional parades — larger affairs with scores of masked riders on colorful floats — roll through the city Friday night and throughout the four-day end to the holiday. Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday, marks the party’s climax and the celebration will be citywide, with costumed revelers jamming the Quarter and parades proceeding from Uptown to downtown with other events in the suburbs. Communities in other parts of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast also celebrate. Mobile, Alabama, lays claim to the nation’s oldest Mardi Gras observances. WHAT’S THE HOLIDAY ABOUT? While it’s a secular celebration, Carnival in New Orleans — and around the world — is rooted in Christian and Roman Catholic traditions. The season begins on Jan. 6, the 12th day after Christmas, and continues until Mardi Gras, which is the final day of feasting, drinking and revelry before Ash Wednesday and the fasting associated with Lent. New Orleans has the largest and best-known Carnival celebrations in the U.S., with street parties, fancy balls and boisterous parades. The processions range from neighborhood-based walking clubs — like Friday’s “Bosom Buddies” march — to elaborate, high-tech extravaganzas that feature massive floats laden with flashing lights and giant, animated figures. HOW DO PEOPLE CELEBRATE THE END? Carnival celebrations — parties, fancy masked balls and other markers of the season — may start on Jan. 6, but the big buildup to Mardi Gras happens in New Orleans in the final 12 days of the season, with large parades rolling past mansions on St. Charles Avenue and into the downtown area of office buildings and hotels. Large parades also roll through the suburbs and in various areas across the Gulf Coast. WHAT’S THE VIBE? The atmosphere varies from neighborhood to neighborhood, and from street to street. Along the parade routes the vibe is family friendly. Groups stake out picnic areas just off the route and food trucks hawk cotton candy, funnel cakes and corn dogs. Families can be seen wandering the streets of the historic French Quarter as well — but the night club scene, which includes strip clubs on Bourbon Street, can get raunchy as Mardi Gras draws nearer. WHAT DOES ‘THE THROWS’ MEAN? “Throw” is a noun in New Orleans used to describe prizes that float riders in parades and members of walking krewes give to spectators. The prized throws at “Bosom Buddies” are hand-decorated bras. Participants in the parade of the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club, hand out highly sought-after painted coconuts. At Thursday’s Muses parade, glittery hand-decorated shoes were souvenirs. Shimmery strings of plastic beads are ubiquitous, although some krewes are exploring alternatives out of environmental concerns. WHERE DID THE BABIES COME FROM? If someone asks “Did you get the baby?” during Mardi Gras, they’re not asking you whether you’re pregnant. A standard seasonal treat during Carnival is the ring-shaped king cake. Baked inside is a tiny, plastic baby figuring. “People will pick up a king cake and take it to work, and whoever gets the baby has to bring one the next day, so people are eating it all the time,” food historian Liz Williams said in a recent interview. Like other Carnival customs, it’s a practice that has evolved. Williams says the roots of king cake culture date to Saturnalia celebrations in ancient Rome, when a cake was baked with a bean inside and whoever got the slice with the bean was deemed king for a day. Over the centuries it became part of modern Mardi Gras traditions, Williams said. The custom of the bean baked into a cake survived — but in the 1960s a local, now-defunct, bakery chain began inserting tiny baby figurines, made of china, into their cakes. “A log of people started to get their king cakes there because it was more fun than getting a bean,” said Williams. WHAT ARE THE BIG PARADES? The final weekend brings the biggest parades, produced by organizations that borrow traditions from European royalty — anointing kings and queens to rule over the proceedings. The Rex Organization, founded in the 19th century, rolls every Fat Tuesday, with the role of Rex, King of Carnival, filled each year by a different local dignitary. The Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club, founded by Black laborers in the early 1900s, also rolls on Tuesday. Newer “super krewes” started parading in the late 20th century. The best known is Bacchus, which taps a nationally known celebrity as king each year. (This year, it’s actor Kevin Dillon from the TV show “Entourage.”) Bacchus, Endymion, Orpheus and Muses all parade during Carnival’s final days, employing state-of-the-art lighting effects on floats, many of which have local and national celebrities aboard. Some of the parade krewes have been around since the 1800s. Some are secretive and still hard to join — while others stopped parading in the 1990s to avoid signing a non-discrimination affidavit. WHAT ABOUT CRIME AND CROWD CONTROL? Large Mardi Gras crowds cause some to worry about a rise in crime in New Orleans — which, like other cities, saw its crime rate rise and police ranks shrink during the COVID-19 pandemic. The New Orleans Police Department, which for several years has had a diminished force of about 900 officers. For the holiday, they’ll be joined by more than 100 state troopers, 170 Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Department deputies and more than 200 deputies from other Louisiana jurisdictions.

That\'s the question many are asking after a wild week in Washington. A bipartisan bill on immigration legislation could have been a major shift in U.S. border policy, but it fizzled almost immediately in a divided Senate. Joining us to discuss what is next is NPR immigration correspondent Jasmine Garsd. Hi there. JASMINE GARSD, BYLINE: Hi. SHAPIRO: Does the end of this bill mean nothing will change on immigration? GARSD: Yes and no. I definitely think there\'s a sense that on the legislative side, nothing can change, not with this level of political polarization. But the flow of people trying to reach the southern border, that continues. People coming from Latin America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East - that\'s not stopping just because Congress did. SHAPIRO: And why does this keep happening? GARSD: Well, look. The U.N. has said that last year there was a record rise in displaced people around the world. That\'s obvious at the border. I\'ve met folks fleeing from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, escaping repression in Turkey, government persecution in Venezuela and a lot of people who are simply leaving collapsed economies. There also is a lot of misinformation. I constantly talk to migrants on the border who have been told that once they get to the U.S., they\'re going to be allowed to stay, legally, permanently if they ask for asylum. But getting asylum in the U.S. is difficult. It can be expensive, and there\'s a massive backlog. Only about half the cases that reached a decision last year got granted asylum. SHAPIRO: The bill that died in the Senate, a lot of it was focused on border enforcement. So with that gone, what\'s enforcement going to look like going forward? GARSD: The Biden administration has ramped up deportations. Also, the Mexican National Guard is increasingly stopping migrants coming north to the U.S. SHAPIRO: But this issue also extends way beyond the border. Migrants have been sent all over the country. GARSD: Absolutely. I mean, New York City alone has received around - over 170,000 migrants in the last two years, and city government says it can\'t afford it. Now, while cities like Chicago, New York and Denver are struggling to manage that influx, you have parts of the Rust Belt, like Erie and Pittsburgh, for example, where there\'s a pretty severe labor shortage. And some politicians and business leaders are wondering, where is the immigrant labor? So last week Fed chair Jerome Powell went on CBS\'s ""60 Minutes,"" and he talked about labor and immigration. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""60 MINUTES"") JEROME POWELL: I will say, over time, though, the U.S. economy has benefited from immigration. And frankly, just in the last year, a big part of the story of the labor market coming back into better balance is immigration returning to levels that were more typical of the pre-pandemic era. GARSD: So the border bill that died this week, one thing that got missed in all the drama surrounding it was that it would have expedited work permits for asylum-seekers, something which a lot of cities and business leaders have been asking for. SHAPIRO: Well, if there\'s not likely to be any more action in Congress, what is next? GARSD: Well, again, there\'s Texas. Texas is still in a standoff with the federal government about who gets to enforce immigration law at the border and how. Texas Governor Greg Abbott recently said that he is going to keep busing migrants to cities like New York and Chicago. And the Biden administration has said it needs Congress to pass legislation in order to ramp up border enforcement. SHAPIRO: NPR\'s Jasmine Garsd. Thank you. GARSD: Thanks.

An attorney for Tyler Anderson of Dover is arguing text messages he allegedly sent threatening to ""disembowel"" and ""impale"" a presidential candidate are protected free speech under the First Amendment. Assistant federal public defender Dorothy Graham is representing Anderson, 30. He has been indicted on three federal counts of transmitting in interstate commerce a threat to injure the person of another, announced previously by New Hampshire U.S. Attorney Jane Young’s office. Each charge carries a sentence of up to five years in prison, up to three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000. He has pleaded not guilty. Charging documents filed in his case accuse Anderson of sending threatening text messages in response to texts from presidential candidates’ campaigns between Nov. 22 and Dec. 8. Former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy’s campaign reported in early December he was threatened prior to a breakfast campaign event at the Roundabout Diner in Portsmouth on Dec. 8. The first charge alleges Anderson texted one candidate’s campaign with a threat to “impale” and “disembowel” the candidate. The second charge alleges Anderson threatened to “blow” the head off of another candidate and conduct a “mass shooting,” while the third charge alleges Anderson threatened to “blow” the “brains out” of a third presidential candidate and “kill everyone” who attended the candidate\'s campaign event and desecrate their corpses.

A Justice Department special counsel found that while Biden may have mishandled classified documents after he left the vice presidency, he should not be charged. The report also took aim at a core vulnerability for Biden - his age. There\'s been a lot of fallout in the last day since the report came out, and NPR\'s Domenico Montanaro is here to bring us up to speed. Hey there. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey. SHAPIRO: How bad is this for Biden? MONTANARO: Well, I mean, it\'s not good for him because it plays into a bigger existing narrative about his age and fitness for office. You know, polling shows age is a bigger issue for Biden than for former President Trump, even though they\'re pretty close in age. An NBC poll out this week found that three-quarters of Americans have concerns about Biden\'s age and ability to do the job, as opposed to just half who said the same about Trump despite, again, the fact that Trump also makes these kinds of missteps. And he\'s also only four years younger. You know, he said that - he\'s confused Nikki Haley with Nancy Pelosi. He mixed up President Obama with President Biden multiple times. He\'s confused Sioux City, Iowa, for Sioux Falls, S.D. But because Biden\'s age is a bigger factor in people\'s minds, it plays into this broader narrative about whether he\'s up for the job. Fundamentally, though, I mean, I have to say I don\'t think this really changes a whole lot about this election. I think the frame is still which weighs out here - concerns about Biden\'s age or this very strong dislike for Trump, which is very real, that we\'ve seen and helped Biden get elected in the first place. SHAPIRO: Well, what\'s the White House said in the last day to try to help counter this? MONTANARO: Well, Biden\'s lawyers call the insinuations of memory loss, quote, ""gratuitous and inappropriate."" They say that those descriptions don\'t belong in a report that ultimately cleared Biden of charges. You know, they have also emphasized that Biden fully cooperated with the investigation. Here was White House spokesman Ian Sams today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) IAN SAMS: I think the public is smart, and I think that they can see what\'s going on. I think that they see a president who fully cooperated. I think they see a president who did the right thing and made sure everything got back. And I think that they see that this was a long investigation that ended without a case to be made. MONTANARO: Yeah. And in addition to Sams, Vice President Kamala Harris is out there today. She\'s also a former prosecutor. She was asked about this at the white House and blasted the language in the report, too. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: The way that the president\'s demeanor in that report was characterized could not be more wrong on the facts and clearly politically motivated, gratuitous. MONTANARO: So she defended the Biden that she sees behind the scenes. But a lot of this was really clean-up after Biden himself held a press conference last night, and he wound up stepping on his message, playing into the very thing that he was trying to refute - these questions about his age - when he mixed up Mexico and Egypt, for example. You know, that detracted from the message that he was trying to get across - his anger about this prosecutor, mentioning his son Beau and trying to get into the substance of what\'s happening with Israel and Gaza and how he believes Israel\'s response has been, quote, ""over the top."" SHAPIRO: Put this into context for us because, as you mentioned, Trump is nearly as old as Biden, has also confused people\'s names and was actually criminally charged with mishandling classified documents. So how do the two situations compare? Why do you think this has stuck to Biden so much more than it has to Trump? MONTANARO: I don\'t know that it stuck more to Biden than it has to Trump. I mean, certainly today we\'re talking about this. But, you know, half the country certainly or more has a very negative opinion of Trump and even higher than for Biden. It\'s just that, you know, you have Democrats who are willing to also talk about this as a potential problem for Biden because you have Democrats, too, who are saying that they think his age is an issue. When it comes to what Trump did versus what Biden did, though, as even the special counsel, Robert Hur, said, after being given multiple chances to return classified documents and avoid prosecution, Mr. Trump allegedly did the opposite, which is unlike what Biden did. The bottom line here is Trump probably wouldn\'t have been charged either had he just given the stuff back. SHAPIRO: NPR\'s Domenico Montanaro. Thank you. MONTANARO: You\'re welcome.
