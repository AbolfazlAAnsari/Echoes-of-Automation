Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:52 am LINCOLNTON – What a great year it’s been. To go back through the 2022 editions published by Lincoln Times-News is like taking a walk back in time – yet it’s only been a year. Perhaps the biggest news as it relates to the paper is that Times-News is going into 2023 under new ownership. After more than six decades of being owned and operated by the Leedy family, the paper is now being managed by Lanny Ford. It's hard to decide what’s the biggest news for the county. Perhaps it’s the new “Taj Mahal” of a courthouse that opened in July. It was many years in the making, three stories and 104,000 square feet of space. Sheriff Bill Beam was chair of the Lincoln County Commissioners when the decision was made to build a new courthouse and he has the unique opportunity to now be the county sheriff at the time the old courthouse closes and the new one opens. This new courthouse carries the price tag of $32 million. “We haven’t built too many courthouses over the past 300 years,” then County Manager Kelly Atkins said at the grand opening. “I think this is number three. Over the past nine years that I’ve been county manager of Lincoln County, we’ve done a lot of capital projects here. None are as important to me, personally, as this one. This is a beautiful building that I think all of Lincoln County can be proud of. I know we’ve spent a lot of time and a lot of different folks have been in the current courthouse in Lincolnton. This one will serve us for the next 100 years, we hope.” It all started with a conversation, Atkins added. The current courthouse, while it’s tired and weary, will be revamped into something new. No decisions have been announced on the use of the old Lincoln County Courthouse in downtown Lincolnton which now sits vacant. Several long tenured employees of Lincoln County retired in 2022, including Kelly Atkins, Tony Carpenter, the director of the Lincoln County Department of Social Services, and Lincoln County and Magistrate Deedie Martin who retired after two decades of service. Prior to his retirement, Atkins received the prestigious Order of the Long Leaf Pine award. Laura Elam, the long-term planning director for the City of Lincolnton also retired in 2022. Back to life as normal The COVID pandemic released its hold on the county and events that had been either cancelled or held virtually were enjoyed in person including the Lincolnton 4th of July parade and fireworks, the Lincolnton Easter Egg Hunt, and Lincoln County Schools graduations were held as they had been before the pandemic. The folks that attend Tucker’s Grove Camp Meeting were able to come back to the campground to worship for the first time in three years. Special Olympics returned to the Lincolnton High School stadium with a huge turnout. Also related to Special Olympics, in March, Lincolnton High School hosted a basketball game like no other. It was unified to the core and it’s likely safe to say that it’s unlikely that there was louder cheering or more smiling at any other game held in the Lincolnton High School gym. Students cheered and danced in their seats as the players ran up and down the court – exceptional students who attend Lincolnton High School as well as those from the community all took part. After a two-year hiatus, the 50th Apple Festival was also held in downtown Lincolnton. Speaking of apples, this year’s Lincoln County Apple Queen Scholarship Pageant made history. There was a tie for second runner up which has never happened in the history of the pageant, according to Pageant Director Erica Miller. Anaia Mayner was crowned as the new Lincoln County Apple Queen. First runner up was Savanna Brooks, the second runner-up tie was shared by Kathryn Burgess and Samantha Cox. Jasmine Campos was the third runner up. Making the old new First Presbyterian Church in Lincolnton which closed its doors in 2020 after 206 years as a congregation, has a new purpose. Lincoln County resident Byron Sackett didn’t want to buy the church, he wanted to help preserve it, but the universe had different plans. He purchased it and is in the process of rehabilitating the beautiful church to use it as an event venue. Also in Lincolnton, the Crowe Mansion, which has been vacant for some time now, was recently purchased by three women, Kayla Fuller, Allison Fuller, and Brandi Wyant with the intention of using it as a wedding and event venue. Although it looks like a historic southern plantation house, the Crowe Mansion was built by Alda and John Crowe in 1976. The house was modeled to look like Carter’s Grove Plantation in Williamsburg, Virginia. Crowe finished the interior of the house with ancient beams, flooring and mantels from old homes and barns as well as antique furnishings. There are exciting plans for the future of the mansion including building a pavilion that will seat 400 with tables and a dance floor in the same style as the home with a full catering kitchen. They’ll also install a second full catering kitchen in the carriage house adjacent to the main home. It’s not uncommon for former textile mills to either be torn down or rehabbed into breweries or restaurants. This wasn’t the case for the former Black Ox – Duplan Corporation Mill on Bonview Avenue in Lincolnton. This eyesore has become a state-of-the-art community-focused manufacturing facility, Sparty Mill, owned by Deanna Hodges. Brick by brick a new Amy’s House shelter is also being built. This has been a dream almost a decade in the making. The current shelter, which is Lincoln County’s only shelter for domestic violence victims, is an ancient mill house that’s just four-bedrooms with two bathrooms, one small kitchen and a tiny laundry room with one washer and dryer. The new state of the art facility will allow Amy’s House to assist at least three times as many survivors and serve them more comfortably than it can right now. The building was designed by Skip Steele and his daughter Kelly, who’s an architect. It’s planned that the new structure will provide constantly comfortable working and living space for the people the shelter serves with almost no on-going utility costs. Lincoln County Animal Services, which is still one of the few no-kill county run animal shelters in North Carolina, hired a full-time veterinarian and installed a surgery suite this year where they’ll be doing their own spays, neuters, dentals, and other surgery needs. The surgery was built in an area that used to be the euthanasia room. “It says a lot that we don’t need a room for that,” Director Hannah Houser said. “There’s no need to have an entire room designated for euthanasia. We’re not doing it. Back before I was here, that back area was a gas chamber, and an incinerator was there. We’ve just got positive things back there.” A piece of Lincolnton Fire Department History was returned to the city. “Old Hulley,” a pumper truck that was purchased by the city in 1925 came home a few weeks ago. The truck was kept in service by the fire department for more than 50 years before she was retired. When they no longer had a suitable place to store her, the decision was made by Lincolnton officials to lease Hulley to the Wagoneers of the Oasis Temple in Charlotte for $1/year. While they had her, the Wagoneers drove her in parades to help raise money for the Shriners’ hospitals for crippled and burned children. Through the combined efforts of Lincolnton City Councilman Roby Jetton, Lincolnton Fire Chief Ryan Heavner and Capt. Brent Turner, Hulley came back to the Lincolnton Fire Department. Anniversaries we covered One hundred years ago, the North Brook community got their first school. The surviving North Brook school, North Brook Elementary celebrated their anniversary with a Heritage Day. Times-News reported on two Lincoln County industries celebrating 50 years in business. The first, Lincoln County Fabricators, a metal fabrication company with a product line in the textile industry called a creel which holds spools of yarn to feed to the knitting machine, as well as other products for the textile industry for material handling and ladder applications. The second, Thornburg Machine which began as a small manual machine shop doing work for textile industries around the Lincolnton area.

6:08 pm Friday, April 8, 2022 By Holly Taylor AHOSKIE – The gym at Roanoke-Chowan Community College isn’t quite the same as a stage in Hollywood, but the cheers there were just as loud and enthusiastic. Hertford County Early College High School, which is housed on the community college campus, welcomed alumni Tobias Hill on Wednesday, April 6 to honor his achievements on American Idol. Hill, a Como native who graduated from the Early College in 2014, competed on season 20 of the popular singing competition show. In his audition, he earned a Golden Ticket to Hollywood week. During that week, the contestants competed in several challenges – including genre, duets, and showstoppers. Hill made it all the way to the showstopper challenge, but ultimately was not selected to be in the Top 24. But the end of Hill’s idol journey didn’t dampen the enthusiasm at Wednesday’s event. Current Early College students piled into the gym, some waving supportive signs. Some of Hill’s former classmates attended the event via Zoom. And a few of his former teachers shared words of encouragement. “Tobias has always been a great kid,” said Lyndsay Britt, Principal of the Early College. “His class was the first class I ever taught as a high school math teacher in this very school.” “We are so excited for you, Tobias, and so proud of all that you have accomplished,” she continued. “Continue to follow your dreams and encourage those around you.” Hill was invited to speak to the current students of his former high school. “My word of encouragement is a slogan that me and my father have adopted since 2018, 2019. It’s called ‘humble but hungry’,” Hill explained. “Humility will take you further than your talent. It’ll take you further than all the knowledge that you have. It’s important to stay humble.” He urged students to work hard to follow whatever dream they have. “I came from Como, where there’s literally less than 100 people. There’s no dream that’s too small,” he continued. “You can do anything that you set your mind to.” Following his speech, Hill performed two songs for the audience: “All of Me” by John Legend and “Knocks Me Off My Feet” by Stevie Wonder. The latter song was the one from his American Idol audition which earned him a ticket to Hollywood. Tobias Hill is shown performing a song during his visit to Hertford County Early College High School from where he graduated in 2014. Staff Photo by Holly Taylor Early College teachers Jennifer Smyth, Kenyatta Ward, and Michael Kinkead also spoke during the event about Hill, recalling his time as a student and praising the way he’s used his talents for singing and dancing in the years since his graduation. “His talent is but one of the things that makes Tobias great,” said Smyth, explaining that Hill likes to lift others up and help them shine. Ward encouraged Hill not to give up by sharing the story of how Formula 409 cleaner got its name. The number represents how many times the inventors worked on the product until they got a batch that was perfect. Ward reminded him that this was only the beginning. Others who spoke briefly at the event included Hertford County Schools Superintendent Dr. William Wright, Hertford County Board of Education Chair Sheila Porter, and RCCC President Dr. Murray Williams. They all shared encouraging words for the aspiring singer, and congratulated him for his accomplishments so far. Hill is the son of Tyris and Brenda Hill. He credits his late grandfather, James Albert Long, Sr., as the person who taught him the foundations of music. In addition to being a Hertford County Early College graduate, Hill also earned a degree in music from North Carolina A&T University. He currently works as a music teacher at Southampton County Middle and High School, the music director at Celebration Church in Franklin, VA, and as an office assistant in Murfreesboro. After Wednesday’s event, Hill sat down with the News Herald to talk about his American Idol experience and his plans for the future. “Hollywood week was on a whole other level,” Hill explained. “It was scary but I loved it. It was some long nights. Some very long days of filming. But I loved every second of it. That’s the life I want to live.” Hill said he enjoyed getting to interact with his fellow competitors as well as the show’s celebrity judges Lionel Richie, Luke Bryan, and Katy Perry. He recalled one moment when he ended up in the same elevator as Bryan and Perry. Bryan said he remembered that Hill was the “guy with the nice jacket,” a compliment he had received during his audition. “I was happy I made an impression,” he said. In the end, the 100+ competitors were narrowed down to a group of 24 as Hollywood week concluded, and Hill was not selected. “When I found out I didn’t make the Top 24, it kind of devastated me a little bit,” he admitted. “Because I wasn’t auditioning for myself. I was more so doing it for this community. It’s not every day that somebody gets to go on American Idol, and do something as grand as being on the Hollywood week stage.” “I was doing it for everybody here,” he continued. “I wanted to show the students that I teach, and the students here, that you can do it.” Even though his American Idol journey is over, Hill doesn’t plan on giving up his dream to pursue singing. It all goes back to that slogan he and his father follow, the one he shared when speaking to the Early College students. “Stay humble but hungry,” he emphasized. “Your humility will take you further than your talents, and stay hungry for your dream. Don’t ever quit. Keep pushing and keep striving, and you’ll get there.”'}]"

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:46 am John McPherson and his daughter, Jennifer McPherson, recently closed their family restaurant, Archdale Bar-B-Que, after 20 years in business. ARCHDALE — For John McPherson, the decision to close his popular longtime restaurant, Archdale Bar-B-Que, was difficult but unavoidable. “I’m 73 years old. We had a real good business. I enjoyed working; I really did. I had a few good employees,” he said. “But it’s tough to run to a restaurant when you ain’t got no help.” A persistent labor shortage since the coronavirus pandemic took hold ultimately left him no choice but to shut down, said McPherson and his daughter, Jennifer McPherson, who also worked at the restaurant. “If we had adequate help, we would 100% be open,” she said. Instead, the restaurant’s sign at Surrett and Sealy drives in Archdale broke the news to the community earlier this week. It brought an end to a 20-year run for Archdale Bar-B-Que, which routinely drew steady streams of customers who packed the dining room and lined up at the drive-thru, beginning early in the mornings. “They love the barbecue and the breakfast tenderloin biscuit. That was the going thing,” McPherson said of his menu. He’s part of a local family that’s been in the barbecue business for decades, operating the Country Barbeque and Country Barbeque Express restaurants. When McPherson set out on his own, he and his late wife, Linda, opened Archdale Bar-B-Que in January 2002, constructing it from the ground up on a site just south of High Point near the Thomas Built Buses plant. He would come in at 1 a.m. each day to prepare for breakfast and cook the barbecue in the wood-chip smoker in the back of the restaurant. “It takes a family to have a restaurant, unless you’re Burger King or McDonald’s,” he said. After the pandemic decimated the restaurant industry, McPherson said they tried everything to weather the labor shortages, offering staff raises, going to drive-thru service only and closing at 2 p.m. each day. But he said it took too much of a toll on his family, especially after the unexpected death of his wife in July. “If I pack this place full and only have one server, that’s a hard choice to make as business owners,” said Jennifer McPherson. “It’s overwhelming.” Archdale Bar-B-Que — the land and building, as well as the business itself and all of the kitchen equipment, furnishings and other personal property associated with the restaurant — is being offered for sale for $4.5 million, John McPherson said. It’s available for immediate use as a restaurant, but the family is open to prospective buyers who might have other plans for the property. Despite the recent challenges, McPherson said he’s at peace with retirement. “It’s just time,” he said. “We accomplished all of our goals.” Jennifer McPherson added, “He should be proud of himself and happy for his success. He worked hard here.” Sorry, there are no recent results for popular articles. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular images. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

called TikTok, the fastest growing online platform in the U.S., a national security threat. “The TikTok app is a malicious and menacing threat unleashed on unsuspecting Indiana consumers by a Chinese company that knows full well the harms it inflicts on users,” Indiana’s Attorney General Todd Rokita said in announcing new lawsuits against the company. Oh really? Well, let’s open the app, shall we? The first video I was served was of French President Emmanuel Macron announcing free condoms for young people starting in January for his official account on the platform. It’s the kind of use that officials in various states like Texas, South Dakota, and Maryland have banned for public officials, citing a risk to information and infrastructure. There’s no such panic over the platform’s here in Europe, but according to one of the recent U.S. lawsuits, there should be. The filing refers to access of user data by individuals in China and outside of Europe or the Western world. Criticism of the app is starting to resemble a red scare. “If, at the end of the day, if the Communist Party and President Xi can dial up or dial down the content that your kids may be seeing, that would worry me,” said Sen. Mark Warren (D-VA) in a recent Yahoo Finance interview, referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping himself, as though he personally has nothing better to do than tinker with an app. Is this scaremongering really about a Chinese company having access to data on Western users? Or is it about the inability of Western gatekeepers to get their hands on that same data themselves? The Biden administration’s proposed deal with TikTok involves a transfer of data into the control of U.S. Defense Department contractor, Oracle. How convenient. While that would certainly increase the odds that user data is safe from the Chinese government, how could the same be said for potential U.S. government access? You also have to wonder how much of the objection to TikTok is about the U.S. government’s insistence on maintaining narrative control over their own citizens. During a congressional hearing last month, FBI Director Christopher Wray conflated the app with Chinese government data harvesting operations. Perhaps the U.S. government is just worried that TikTok’s rapidly growing popularity risks surpassing the platforms that routinely cooperate with the U.S. government? If American users shun these outlets in favor of a Chinese app over which U.S. authorities have limited control and access, then it risks compromising their own electronic dragnet. “[Dangers] include the possibility that the Chinese government could use it to control data collection on millions of users or control the recommendation algorithm, which could be used for influence operations if they so chose or to control software on millions of devices,” Wray said. Ah yes, “influence operations” and perception shaping. Let’s talk about those. Journalist Matt Taibbi, who worked with Musk to release the company’s internal communication this month, pointed out that requests from Joe Biden’s presidential campaign to delete inconvenient tweets were routinely indulged by Twitter executives. “Twitter acting by itself to suppress free speech is not a 1st amendment violation, but acting under orders from the government to suppress free speech, with no judicial review, is,” tweeted Musk.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:42 am Who knows how many vehicles have driven right through the Township of Milton, NC and not known an earthly thing about it? But soon, the little town with one traffic light is just about ready to shed that anonymity and it’s time it should. There is so much rich history that has escaped recognition only because its residents weren’t really interested in a high profile starting in the 1950’s. This status-quo sentiment was verified by a long-time Milton resident in his late 70’s. That was then, this is now, and there’s a new positive energy and feeling about Milton and its 200+ significant years in Caswell County. Not only will the glorious work of skilled furniture-craftsman Thomas Day move more to the public forefront, other vital chapters of Milton’s history will begin to gradually open. Thanks to historical-minded citizens like Vanessa “Twinkle” Richmond-Graves, the name and appreciation meter is starting to tick upward. “My name is Vanessa Richmond-Graves. My nickname is ‘Twinkle,’ which everybody knows me by. When I was born, my tear ducts were closed, so my pediatrician decided my eyes were sparkling and he wanted my name to be ‘sparkle.’ But the nurse intervened and said ‘no, Twinkle!,’ hence the name,” laughs Richmond-Graves. Twinkle is working with the Thomas Day House/Union Tavern Restoration, Inc. in Milton. Currently, she is president and conducting different programs for homeschooled groups and regularly schooled groups. There had been tours on a regular basis, but due to Covid, significant cancellations affected the over-all scheduling. Lately, the restoration project is waiting on the group, Preservation Greensboro, Inc., who had 40 people coming for one big tour, but called to say half of them had Covid and were rescheduling. Not only was there a revenue loss, but the good word-spreading of 40 people was lost, too. Richmond-Graves was born in Danville, Va., raised in Milton, lived in Greensboro, but came home to Milton every weekend. She just loves Milton and calls herself a “Miltonian.” She attended Bennett College in Greensboro, received her master’s degree at NC A&T, and half of a doctorate at UNC Chapel Hill. During that time, she contracted cancer and couldn’t finish the course study. Richmond-Graves decided not to pursue it because she didn’t care to be known as Dr. Twinkle! “I worked here in Caswell County for vocational training, and I worked at Bartlett Yancey High School. When I moved to Greensboro, I worked in several schools there and taught at Bennett College as well. I didn’t get married until 1999 to my husband, Ray Lee, and we take care of both our elderly mothers, mine here in Milton and his in Reidsville. We have a beautiful marriage,” she confides. The people that take the tours (ticket is $6) of Milton’s historic district are a mixture of all types. Many are there to view and appreciate Day’s iconic work, but there are also the curious and antique dealers from far and wide. Some visitors have claimed they have signed pieces by Thomas Day. But Twinkle has a vital reference source in the book, Tom Day, “Master of Mahogany” by Pat Marshall. This comprehensive work provides positive proof to the identification of his work or that of an imposter. “If you go on a tour, some of them are long and some of them are short. We do the Thomas Day Museum, the Union Tavern, we tell them about the history of Thomas Day and how he came to Milton and his many accomplishments in woodworking. Then, we’ll take you on a tour of the High Street Baptist Church. There is a Thomas Day church pew there and that’s the only African American church in the Milton Township. Then, we’ll come down to the Milton Presbyterian church and he has the walnut pews there. That has been our basic tour before Thomas Day began as a museum.” Then, the group will go down to the Milton Baptist church where Day has pews and architecture displayed. There, one gets a true appreciation of three different types of pews and the fine woodworking he did. If there is time, the enclave will go down Broad St. and have an informal outside house tour and view informational signs posting the history behind each house. Yanceyville realtor, Cindy Millay, helps the museum with the signage. Time-permitting, the tour will go up to Oak Tree Tavern ( at nearby Virginia International Raceway) as Day did almost all the architecture there in the stately, 1800’s manor. “And if it’s a pretty day, and you really feel like going, we’ll go to Cedars Cemetery and you can see the mass grave, where we have Union and Confederate soldiers buried there from the Civil War. They were in a battle in Farmville, Va., during Lee’s retreat south and there were thousands of casualties. A train came through and so many soldiers died on the way to the Danville hospital, that the train just continued on to Milton, and they were taken up the hill and buried together.” Even though the town is small, the landscape prevents a walking tour with its hilly incline. Tour members can drive their cars down, park and walk down Broad St. After seeing all the historical houses, the tour will take them to the small businesses in town (several blocks worth) , especially the Renaissance Museum. There are two restaurants and the brand-new Milton 66 Beer Garden. After leaving there, guests may inspect the Milton Mural that depicts much of everything that’s happened in Milton from the 19th century on. It’s on the side of the Milltown Eatery and Saloon on the building’s north wall. Then, there’s the renowned artist, Shirley Cadmus’ Milton Studio Art Gallery, Aunt Millie’s Antique Shop and then wind up at Aunt Millie’s Pizza (try the cheesy breadsticks with sauce!). There are plenty of things to see and do, it’s just up to the individual. The all-day tour is very popular because it ends up at Oak Tree Tavern, known for its fine cuisine with an imported Irish bar named “Connie’s Pub.” In addition to the guided tours, the Township Milton presents “Christmas in Historic Milton” on the first Saturday in December (this December 3). All the merchants share a little something special in their stores like cookies, brownies, homemade treats, and that takes place from about 1-5 p.m., right after the Yanceyville Christmas Parade. Covid prevented that for two straight years, so the merchants are hoping for the best this year. It is possible food may not be served this year, but at least customers can walk in, shop, and enjoy some free bottled water. As for project funding, grants and Milton’s immediate future, the State of North Carolina is going to be taking over and making the town a state historical site. Though the town is already a national landmark and has been for 20 something years, this title may be more prestigious and beneficial. The restoration staff is currently working with the state on that project. Hopefully when the designated funding gets approval in the legislative budget, Richmond-Graves can get things started and fast-track events for next year. “We’re hoping to restore many more of Mr. Day’s furniture and architectural work and give it the international focus it deserves,” concludes the director.

Chance of rain 50%. Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 8:34 pm NCGrowth is deepening its connection to Western North Carolina through a grant from Dogwood Health Trust. NCGrowth, an affiliated center of the Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise, helps local economies challenged by industry transition, high unemployment and poverty. Its work in Southwestern North Carolina will provide direct technical assistance to businesses and capacity-building support to local governments to build and strengthen a robust entrepreneurial ecosystem that leverages regional assets. The expanded commitment in the seven counties that make up the southwestern corner of the state, including Jackson, includes the hiring of Stacy Guffey as program manager. Guffey will be based in the area to oversee NCGrowth’s efforts here. “We are grateful to partner with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, Southwestern Commission, and Western Carolina University,” said Mark Little, director of CREATE/NCGrowth. “Coupled with having Stacy, a phenomenal local leader, on board, we are very excited to expand our work and impact in Western North Carolina.” Guffey is a native of Macon County and serves on the Franklin Town Council. Guffey will manage a program that will directly support businesses and communities in creating jobs and new wealth in the region, and provide capacity support to regional entrepreneurial network development led by the Southwestern Commission Council of Governments. “Businesses and communities throughout our region were hit hard by COVID and many are still recovering. We are excited to support NCGrowth in their efforts to tap into trusted local talent to help address the needs of local governments and businesses, especially in our westernmost counties,” said Susan Mims, CEO of Dogwood Health Trust. “Specialized technical assistance and capacity building support in rural areas and for under-resourced communities is a consistent need that is critical to economic growth and recovery.” Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

cubs — highlight a serious problem with poaching in the mountains, a bear advocacy group says. The N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission said the case may be the result of poaching, but its investigation is ongoing. Poaching is a serious problem in the mountains, Wildlife Resources Sgt. Brandon Bryson said, but hunters also sometimes just dump carcasses. “This time of year we get a lot of complaints about people dumping bear and deer carcasses, because the seasons are current,” Bryson said, referring to hunting seasons. “They pick random places. That particular location is somewhere that is easily accessible off the road, not that far from the interstate, so someone could’ve used it as a dumping area.” Bryson confirmed Dec. 1 the animals were found off private property off Moore Street. Wildlife Resources is investigating the case, but the agency has not determined the cause of death for the bears, or if they were a mother and cubs. “Three bears — that’s what we could determine,” Bryson said, adding that they don’t know the age or sex yet. “We’re going to contact our biologist and see if they can’t get a little more specific information.” The Help Asheville Bears advocacy group has offered a $5,000 reward in the case, posting a video on its Facebook page. The group identified the dead bears as a mother and two cubs. The HAB Facebook page says the bears “were skinned, their paws were removed, and their entrails were placed in a large plastic bucket that was left with their remains.” HAB Founder Jody Williams said the case is “a sad situation.” “There’s not much left of the bodies at all,” he said. “There was only one paw left.” Controversy has swirled about the issue of poachers killing bears for their paws, viewed as trophies in some circles. Bryson, who supervises Buncombe, Haywood and Madison counties, said they have no evidence of that in this case. In fact, the investigator in this case recovered numerous bear paws. “We found eight of them, maybe more,” Bryson said. “We don’t believe there’s any type of removing the paws for some sort of criminal activity in the area.” There is a global market for bear parts, including for bear paws, Bryson said, although he added that it’s been “on the decline the last several years.” Bear legs are removed during skinning for meat. “Sometimes they’re removed with the leg a little further up in skinning an animal,” Bryson said, referring to people harvesting the meat. “And where they were cut off at [in this case], that’s what that looked like.” Poaching — the illegal killing of game animals — happens frequently in the mountains, Bryson acknowledged. Asked if Western North Carolina has a serious problem with poaching, Bryson responded, “A serious problem with poaching? Yes. With the sale of black bears on the black market? No.” But like other game animals, black bears are killed illegally every year. Hunters legally can take one black bear per season, and the animal has to weigh at least 75 pounds. The first part of bear season in the mountains ran from Oct. 17– Nov. 19, and the second part runs from Dec. 12– Jan. 2, according to the WRC website. “From Asheville west over the past few years, we’ve had over 150 charges that solely involved the illegal taking of black bears,” Bryson said. “Whether that is illegal baiting or hunting during the closed season, etc.” For 2021, hunters legally killed 2,371 black bears in North Carolina, according to WRC statistics. That includes 1,230 bears taken in the western region. Poaching of other game animals is a problem, too, Bryson said. “We have a lot of illegal poaching activity — we stay very busy,” he said. “But in regards to the illegal black market sale of black bear parts, not in the current (climate) in this area.” Williams, the HAB founder, maintains that poaching is “more common than Wildlife (Resources) will let on.” “Anywhere bears are — or any animal, really — they’re being poached,” Williams said. “People do not follow the law.” Williams said his group has reported cases of poaching of deer, turkeys, bald eagles, and other animals. “People just don’t follow the law, and the bear part trade is alive and well,” Williams said. “There’s paws and gall bladders being sold everywhere.” Poachers often are after the animal’s meat, Bryson said, but they also sometimes have more cold-hearted motives — “the sport of it,” he said. “We have a big problem with people spotlighting deer at night,” Bryson said. “Night deer hunting we call it, and a lot of times they will just leave those. They’ll do it for sport. We’ve caught people in poaching rings who have bets to see who can kill the most and leave them.” Poaching is a misdemeanor offense, he said. The investigation is ongoing in the Woodfin case, Bryson stressed. “It may have been a hunter; it may not have been a hunter,” Bryson said. “We try to distinguish (between) a hunter and a poacher. They’re not the same thing.” Bryson said it was not immediately clear what the cause of death was for the bears in Woodfin. “I could not tell (if there) was a gunshot wound or anything, but the meat had been removed,” Bryson said. “We have had them killed in the past — more than one bear at one time, if they’re small — by vehicles.” But he added “that’s pretty unlikely, obviously,” in this case, “with the meat being removed.” In cases like the Woodfin incident, a necropsy [an autopsy of an animal] is unlikely, Bryson said. “It’s just not practical to do that on every dead animal,” Bryson said. “We have one biologist that serves pretty well the western 17 counties, and we pretty much wear him out as is.” If an investigation leads to multiple culprits or incidents, that may change things. In some cases, Wildlife Resources has sent DNA samples to the University of Tennessee for analysis. “With this particular thing, we don’t know if it’s isolated or not,” Bryson said. “This is not the only place I could take you to this hunting season that has a couple of bear carcasses dumped.” “So as of right now, this one doesn’t look any more unique than other ones in the area,” Bryson continued. “We do take it very seriously, of course. This is what we do.” It was also impossible to determine if the gall bladders had been taken in this case, Bryson said, because of decomposition and the possibility of scavengers removing body parts. Bear gall bladders are prized for alleged medicinal purposes in some markets, particularly China. “We couldn’t tell if they were intact, but there was what looked like a bucket of the entrails,” Bryson said. “We couldn’t differentiate what was in there, because of what had decomposed and what small animals had drug off.” Asheville Watchdog is a nonprofit news team producing stories that matter to Asheville and Buncombe County.

Catalyst The news source of the NC Foothills May 18,2022 The Republican primary is over and Ted Bell has won yet again. There was a total of 12,433 votes cast for District Attorney in the District 29A Republican primary out 57,776 eligible voters. Ted Bell received 7562 votes making him elected by only 13% of the eligible voting population in the district. He has no opponent from any other party so the office is his yet again. SSDD as the younger generation says. That being said does not mean that the “cloak and dagger” mentality that has existed in the DA’s office under Ted Bell can continue. It was hoped that electing someone new would “clean up” the office but since that is not going to happen then other avenues must be pursued. Can Ted Bell change? It’s possible but unlikely at this point in his career. Removing an elected (even if only by 13% of voters) District Attorney is difficult, but not impossible. A District Attorney who has admittedly falsified video evidence in a death investigation (considered prosecutorial misconduct), discussed confidential information with others outside his office, and seemingly protected his friend, former Judge Randy Pool, who committed criminal acts (with 33 known victims at this time) so he could retire with his full benefit package to just name a few of his “behaviors,” does not need to be in office. Last year in Henderson County District Attorney Greg Newman, representing Henderson, Transylvania and Polk counties was removed from office on April 27 by Judge Robert Irwin. On Feb. 11, 2021, an affidavit was filed with the Clerk of Superior Court in Henderson County asking for D.A. Greg Newman’s removal on various grounds pursuant to NC Gen. Stat.7A-66. At the center of Newman’s removal hearing was a sexual assault case in which the victim’s family claims Newman denied them the right to be heard in court. More than a dozen families from his district came together to file a motion to have Newman removed from office due to an alleged pattern of willful misconduct. Last year Newman was disciplined by the state bar for making a false statement in a child rape case. He was suspended but still allowed to practice North Carolina state statute 7A-66, allows any person to request Superior Court to hold a proceeding to suspend or remove a district attorney from office if certain criteria are met. Under the state statute, the following are grounds for suspension of a district attorney for his or her removal from office: If a D.A. is guilty of even ONE of the seven points listed above then ANYONE can request a Superior Court hearing to have them either removed or suspended from office. According to the state statute, at the hearing the Superior Court judge will hear evidence and make findings of fact and conclusions of law, and if he/she finds that grounds for removal exist, he/she will enter an order permanently removing the district attorney from office, and terminate his or her salary. The procedure for removal, as set out in GS 7A-66, includes these steps (from UNC School of Government): In practice, district attorneys, who prosecute the bulk of criminal cases in the United States, answer to no one.

felony offenses in a case involving a diamond ring with a platinum band worth about $53,500. A Wilkes County Grand Jury indicted Reece, 46, and Debra Lee Goldman, 59, of Fuquay Varina, on one count each of felony insurance fraud on Oct. 31. Goldman is charged with knowingly falsely saying the diamond ring was stolen in a claim for an insurance policy payment from USAA Casualty Insurance Co. The indictment charging Goldman with insurance fraud said she actually “had given the ring to Kevin Ray Reece to hold.” Attorney Matthew L. Benton of Statesville emailed the following statement on behalf of Reece on Monday, “Kevin is thankful that he lives in a country in which he is presumed innocent. He will not engage in any public statements other than to say he looks forward to his day in court, where he intends to vigorously defend himself. We look forward to the truth being exposed in this matter."" Robert Joyce, professor of public law and government at School of Government at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, wrote that under the N.C. Constitution, a person who isn’t eligible to vote for an elected office isn’t eligible to hold that office. A person convicted of a felony offense isn’t eligible to vote unless that right is restored in the manner prescribed by law. Goldman didn’t respond with a comment when the Wilkes Journal-Patriot reached out to her via social media. The indictment charging Reece with insurance fraud said that when Det. Jason Adams of the Wilkes Sheriff’s Office asked him about the theft of the ring soon after Goldman reported on Sept. 20, 2018, that it was stolen from her home, Reece said he didn’t know anything about the larceny. “In fact, the statement was false as the defendant (Reece) knew that the ring had not been stolen and was, in fact, in the defendant’s possession. At the time of the defendant’s statement to Detective Adams, the defendant knew that Goldman was going to file an insurance claim” for the ring, stated the indictment charging Reece. The same indictment stated that Reece came to know Goldman filed a claim with an insurance company and received payment for the ring. Also on Oct. 31, a Wilkes Grand Jury indicted Goldman on four counts of felony obstruction of justice by knowingly making false statements to law enforcement. In one of the four counts, Goldman is charged with obstructing justice by knowingly falsely telling State Bureau of Investigation Agent Josh Hawks on Oct. 25 that she never told anyone that she sold the platinum-banded, diamond ring to Reece or his business for $17,000. The indictment said Goldman actually told CPA Lisa Wall of Elkin in 2019 that she sold the ring to Reece or his business. A Wilkes Grand jury returned indictments charging Reece with eight counts of felony obstructing justice on Sept. 6, all charging him with making false statements about the ring to law enforcement. Seven involve statements made to Hawks on Jan. 26 and two involve statements to sheriff’s office detectives the first week of January. The grand jury indicted Reece on one count of felony possession of stolen goods, which was the ring, on Sept. 6. On Sept. 30, Hawks applied for and obtained a search warrant to search Goldman’s 2018 tax file in Wall’s Elkin office for any document regarding the sale or other transaction involving a diamond ring between Goldman and Reece and anything else of evidentiary value. According to “details of the investigation” with Hawks’ application for that search warrant, Goldman reported on Sept. 20, 2018, that a platinum band, 5.98-carat diamond ring and other jewelry were stolen from her residence at 685 Factory Street, Ronda. This is Reece’s current address. The sheriff’s office closed the case when leads were exhausted. In January 2022, Goldman reported to District Attorney Tom Horner’s office that Reece, whom she identified as her ex-boyfriend, had stolen a very valuable piece of jewelry from her while she was living in Wilkes. After Horner asked the SBI to investigate the larceny, Hawks interviewed Reece on Jan. 26, 2022. Hawks said Reece claimed to not have the ring when he showed him a photo of it, but investigators found and seized the ring when Reece let them search a safe in his residence in Ronda that same day. Hawks said Goldman provided documentation of an appraisal of the ring by Windsor Jewelers saying it was worth $53,500. Hawks also said in a search warrant application that Goldman told him on Jan. 13 that Reece showed her the ring in question during a Facetime video chat they had on Dec. 8, 2021. Hawks said the ring held by Reese in a screen capture image from this video chat, provided by Goldman, matched the description of the ring she reported stolen. He said Goldman provided him a copy of a photo of the ring that Reece sent her in a text message on Aug. 2, 2020. Hawks said Goldman also stated that Reece texted her a photo of the ring and a message stating, “Would you like for me to give you that or?” Hawks said he received a copy of notes prepared by Wall while she prepared Goldman’s 2018 tax return and a copy of a subpoena completed by attorney Bob Laws on behalf of Reece to obtain the notes. Hawks said that according to this record, Goldman told Wall that “Kevin’s business bought ring $17,000.” On Oct. 4, Hawks applied for and received a search warrant to search Reece’s tax file in Walls office for any documents regarding the sale or other transaction involving the ring in question between Goldman and Reece and anything else of evidentiary value. Hawks said Wall told him in an interview that while preparing Goldman’s tax documents around March 2019, Goldman told her she had sold a ring to Reece’s business. Wall said she made a note of this. The felony charges against Reece and Goldman are scheduled to be heard in the January session of Wilkes Superior Court. Reece is also charged with possession of non-tax paid liquor and with violating an ex parte domestic violence protective order by possessing ammunition in a magistrate’s order issued Jan. 28. Those misdemeanor charges were scheduled to be heard Nov. 16 in Wilkes District Court. Success! An email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup. Error!

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:55 am Taylor Phillips came home Sunday night and was embraced by Lee County residents who turned out for his second annual 2022 Taylor Phillips HITS Lee County with Friends concert. Phillips, 33, didn’t return empty-handed. Tagging along were some of the brightest up-and-coming singers/songwriters on today’s country music charts. Joining the Sanford native, who has written or helped write a plethora of hit songs, were Frank Ray, Andrew Jannakos, Sam Grow, Drew Green and Chase Matthew. Broken into two groups, the artists sat on sat on stools and took good-natured pot shots at one another, drawing rousing laughter from a crowd of about 1,200 people in the Dennis A. Wicker Civic Center. The show was entirely acoustic — the singers and their guitars. There was no band, no amplifiers, no smoke or lights in this concert. Grow, Jannakos and Green performed the first set, rotating among them with each singing three of their favorite or well-know songs. The others — Phillips, Matthew and Ray — played the second half of the show. Each took a few moments before performing to explain the story behind the song. Ray and Jannakos each cited their children and families as song inspirations. The performers were taken with Sanford, complimenting the small-town feel and rural nature of the area. Phillips took a turn performing as well, singing about an elderly man who wore overalls and worked the fields for a living. It was, Phillips said, a tribute to his grandfather. This is the second year Phillips has brought friends from Nashville to Sanford for the concert that he hopes will bring an awareness of suicide and the need for people to realize there is no shame in seeking help. “It brings people together and shines a light on them,” Phillips said. Phillips found out first-hand when Brian Kindle, his best friend and fellow firefighter at the Pocket Fire Department, died by suicide on Christmas Eve two years ago. “He had a heart bigger than this place,” Phillips said. The other recipient of the concert proceeds is the Lee County Burned Children’s Fund. It was a natural choice for Phillips, bringing two causes close to his heart together. Just before the show began, Phillips told the audience that, minutes earlier, he had been introduced to a child who was recovering from burns. Jennifer Long, 42, and her two teenage children, drove from Apex for the concert. She said they attended the event in 2021 and came back this year. Long completely understands who Phillips is helping with the show. Years ago, she said, her brother was severely burned in an accident when he was 16. Her brother died by suicide at the age of 25. “It’s for a good cause,” she said. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.

His Facebook post last week claims elected officials have created a toxic work environment as it relates to the chief administrator's position with the city. One of Southport’s aldermen has expressed his frustration on social media about the city’s approach to the council/manager structure of government, particularly when it comes to the use of employees. On Oct. 5, Alderman Rich Alt posted on his “Rich Alt for Aldermen 2021” Facebook page that the reason why Southport has gone through five city managers in the past 10 years is due to a “toxic work environment as it relates to the chief administrator’s position.” Alt: city issue needs to be corrected Outgoing City Manager Gordon Hargrove, who was hired in May 2020, submitted his resignation last month and is leaving his position with the City of Southport Oct. 28 to take the same position in Boiling Spring Lakes. In the Facebook post, Alt wrote that Hargrove’s departure wasn’t over a slight pay increase, but more about his relationship with Southport elected officials. Southport raised Hargrove’s annual salary to $127,125 in July. In Boiling Spring Lakes his salary will be $129,000. Alt praised Hargrove’s work while in Southport and his success in helping the city secure millions of dollars in funding for key infrastructure projects. When it comes to the council/manager form of government, Alt said, the city has an issue that needs to be corrected. “It really is out of frustration, in that we have elected officials going around giving directions to department heads without consulting with the manager,” Alt said. “We’ve had five managers in 10 years. You can put lipstick on that pig ... but that shows a toxic work environment and we have to stop the behavior patterns that we’re doing right now. We simply have to stop it.” Alt said while he has not physically seen elected officials acting outside of the city manager, he has first-hand accounts from people who have, and the practice is concerning. “They’re just running amok doing whatever they feel like doing,” said Alt. “I wasn’t physically there when each one of them happens, but I do know that the manager is not leaving Southport because of a $2,500 raise in pay.” Alt claimed some of the other aldermen wanted to fire Hargrove over the summer because of a personnel issue, but were ultimately unsuccessful. “That was just a pretext,” Alt said. ‘A warm body is not what we need’ On Monday, aldermen interviewed half a dozen candidates for the interim city manager position, but ultimately did not make a hire. Hargrove’s replacement, said Alt, needs to come to Southport with a specific skill set, in both infrastructure and the relationship with elected officials. The eventual interim city manager will be allowed to work as little as three days a week for up to nine months, and that may not be enough time to tackle everything Southport has on its plate right now, Alt said. “We’ve got $100 million worth of things that need to be resolved, and I don’t know that you can do it in three days,” he said. “There are a gazillion deadlines out there, so just getting a warm body in there is not what we need.” Alt said that the recent successes under Hargrove’s leadership will be washed away because the deadlines won’t be met. “We will miss out on the gravy train,” stated Alt. “We need someone who has a proven record of managing programs that are in the $50-million range and leading the team in city hall to put that together,” added Alt. “I want someone with a history of handling big projects because we have a lot of big projects,” The alderman said he also wants to see the city hire someone who will put an end to what he perceives as inappropriate behavior. “... somebody who has a proven record of pushing back if an elected official is going around and giving orders to your department heads ... we have to stop this behavior right away, because it’s so toxic that managers do not want to work here because they’re not in charge,” stated Alt. Hatem: ‘None of it is true’ In his Facebook post, Alt said future city managers will have to hurdle “near daily violations of the council-manager form of government by elected officials and family members who order city employees to perform tasks, conduct individual, or small group negotiations with outside entities, without going exclusively through the city manager.” When asked about the social media post, Mayor Joe Pat Hatem pushed back on Alt’s claims that elected officials are acting out of line with city employees, calling the assertion “totally false,” especially when it comes to family members. “I think, first of all, it’s very untrue, extremely false and inappropriate,” said Hatem. “That’s not how it works. We talked about the form of city government (Monday). The city manager is going to run the city and we are a part of that process, but through the manager. We just don’t pull (Public Utilities Director) Tom Stanley aside or the services director and say we need this on Ninth Street or whatever. That’s just not how it’s done.” Hatem added, “You don’t go after an elected official’s family. None of it is true.” The aldermen’s monthly meeting is scheduled for Thursday at 6 p.m. at the Southport Community Building.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:58 am Principal Continental Divides of North America. Jackson County is a gem among the Blue Ridge. Nestled among the verdant mountains, Jackson is home to countless imperiled species sheltered among our environments. This is largely due to the Blue Ridge Mountains themselves, the rising bluffs of which snatch water out of the atmosphere while at the same time making large-scale development dangerous and costly. Jackson County is also a rarity for another reason – our watersheds. Not only is it a critical source of headwaters for the Little Tennessee and Savannah river basins, but the county sits on top of the Eastern Continental Divide, a line that runs along the east coast delineating where a major sloping occurs on our side of the continent. Most of the eastern shore of the United States is sloped towards the Atlantic Ocean. This is believed to be a consequence of the separation of our continent with Africa over 200 million years ago, after they had slammed together to form the Blue Ridge and other mountains. Because of this sloping, all of the water that falls to the east of the Eastern Continental Divide makes its way downhill to the Atlantic Ocean. The Continental Divide sits atop some of the highest points elevation-wise in the area, which is somewhat unsurprising, and also unsurprisingly water that falls to the west of the line tends to continue traveling south and west, ending up in the Gulf of Mexico. Most of southern Jackson County falls on the eastern side of the Continental Divide, however the northern half is actually on the other side. The water that falls onto Jackson County therefore does not all flow to the same place. The most obvious culprit for this split should be the mountains themselves – but interestingly enough, it seems to be the land immediately surrounding the mountains that plays a key role in the final destination of our waterways. The high elevation of Jackson and surrounding counties means that most of the water that falls here ends up flowing downhill for hundreds of miles until it reaches its final destination. This makes us critical suppliers of fresh water for almost everyone living in areas to the south, east, and to a degree southwest of us. The region’s lush forests and other natural lands also work to help filter and control the flow of these waters. These important waterways and their natural filters are under attack from several main aggressors, the most costly being invasive species and human development, both of which can degrade or destroy habitats as well as imperil animals. While the impact of humans and introduced species can be rapid and devastating, it isn’t the only force being wrought on the waterways of Jackson County. Natural erosive forces like wind and water have been chipping away at the area for millions of years. While the Blue Ridge Mountains are an imposing barrier for almost anything that approaches, including water, the Eastern Continental Divide does not run directly along the mountains.

11:58 am Monday, August 29, 2022 By Pam Stone Dear Aunty Pam, I’m writing to you because I’m feeling pretty heartbroken and rejected. Get the latest news sent to your inbox I’ve spent most of the year working on a quilt for my son and daughter-in-law as a surprise for their 10th wedding anniversary. I’m a member of a quilting club and have made some beautiful quilts over the years and my DIL has even remarked on them. As she had been complimentary, I decided I would make a special quilt for them. It’s taken a long time but I’ve always enjoyed spending time over a quilt that I know people are going to love. However, when I presented it to them, I could tell from her face she didn’t like it. We were at their house for dinner and I overheard her say to my son in the kitchen, “What are we going to do with that quilt? It’s so ugly.” It was all I could do not to start crying and I made an excuse that I wasn’t feeling well and went home early with my husband. Once we got in the car, I did start crying and my husband said it’s always a risk to surprise people with a gift that they might not like and I only have myself to blame. It’s been two weeks and I still feel very hurt, but I wonder if my husband is right and I just need to get a grip? Thank you for any advice you can give me, Aunty Pam! Signed, Sad Mom Dear Mom, I guess I need to get a grip too, because your letter choked me up. But first, let me say this: I think your husband was being incredibly unsympathetic to your hurt feelings on that ride back home. Plus, his reply made no sense. What does he mean that ‘it’s always a risk to surprise people with a gift?? I mean, isn’t that what gifts are? Nicely wrapped surprises for birthdays, holidays, anniversaries? What’s the difference between giving someone a quilt that they hate and, say, a bottle of champagne they might hate? They’re both gifts! I guess you could always give them a gift card to Cracker Barrel, or Home Depot, but that’s not terribly original, is it? That reeks of, “Oh, crap, I forgot their anniversary, so let me swing by the Dollar Store and see if they have any gift cards.” You spent so much time and love in every stitch of that quilt and it’s heartbreaking indeed to overhear that your DIL thinks it’s ugly. And may I say that the fact that she would say such a thing to your son immediately after receiving it, knowing that it was made by his own mother, was also ugly. Tastes are subjective and even if your DIL thinks the quilt is ugly, would it have killed her to plaster on a big smile and say she loved it, then hide it in the bedroom closet, along with the black velvet portrait of Elvis, given to them by somebody else? So at the end of the day, Mom, you’ve got a husband who treated you in rather a cruel manner, a DIL who was also quite cruel, a son who didn’t speak up, and a quilt that nobody wants. You know what, Mom? To heck with them all. Send me a private email and we’ll go have a beer together. Cheers, dear! Aunty Pam What would you like to see more on tryondailybulletin.com?

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:54 am HUDSON — Residents of the town of Hudson will no longer have to drive all the way to Granite Falls or beyond to enjoy a hot fast-food meal from McDonald’s, as a new location has opened on Mt. Herman Road. On Thursday, Dec. 15, right before the morning breakfast rush, McDonald’s owners and staff, along with the Caldwell Chamber of Commerce, Hudson Mayor Janet Winkler, the Hudson Police Department, and members of the Hudson community gathered at the new McDonald’s at 301 Mt. Herman Road to celebrate the fast-food restaurant’s grand opening with a ribbon cutting ceremony. The South Caldwell High School marching band, under the direction of Jason Childers, began the ceremony with a rousing performance. Afterwards, Christine Nevant, the owner of the new Hudson McDonald’s and the McDonald’s in Granite Falls, presented the South Caldwell students with a check for $500. “You’ve made our grand opening very special,” she said. “We are so excited to serve the community.” Next, Hudson Mayor Janet Winkler addressed the crowd, saying she was “thrilled” to see the town of Hudson get its own McDonald’s. “I’ve told everybody that ‘Hudson has now arrived,’ ” Winkler said, and the crowd cheered. “We’re super excited to have a McDonald’s in Hudson and another McDonald’s in Caldwell County,” said Ashley Bolick, director of the Economic Development Commission. “We’re excited to see all the great success you guys will have here.” Nevant has been a McDonald’s restaurant operator for just over 10 years, following in her family’s footsteps. Her brother owns 43 restaurants in the West Virginia/Pittsburgh area. Nevant herself now owns 12 restaurants in Caldwell County, Hickory, and Asheville. “[My husband] Chris and I take a lot of pride in offering jobs to this community, and also offering great food at a great value,” Nevant said. “We’re thrilled to be a part of Hudson. So far, we’ve been so impressed with everybody.” Nevant said she is proud to be part of a business that provides wonderful opportunities for employees, including a $2,500 tuition assistance program for students. “I just love this brand and I love what it does,” she said. “I believe in McDonald’s and what they do for their people, what they provide for their communities.” Sixty-five% of Nevant’s workforce are women. “It isn’t that I just choose to hire women, but I love to give them that opportunity because I think about what McDonald’s has done for me,” she said. “I think it’s so important to be a great role model to anyone who works with you … It’s a great support system.” Nevant is also passionate about giving back to the community who supports her business endeavors. “In every one of my locations, we support the neighboring restaurants.

'HUMAN_ONLY', 'version': '2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'By Sally Kestin, Asheville Watchdog Fox News last week told a national audience that Asheville has seen a 31% increase in violent crime in the last five years. “Asheville once touted as a top-10 tourist destination back in 2017, but with crime raging, the city now ranks, get this, in the top 10% of most violent cities in America,” anchor Todd Piro said. “That’s tough to believe.” Yes, it is. The 31% increase is not current. It refers to a period ending in 2020, when crime had increased nationwide. Violent crime — murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault — went down in Asheville in 2021. And the reference to Asheville being among the most violent cities came from an analysis, also based on 2020 data, that combined all violent crimes — a potentially misleading way to view the statistics, said Christopher Herrmann, an assistant professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. For instance, Wilmington, a city of 115,000 people on North Carolina’s east coast, had double the number of murders as Asheville but a lower overall violent crime rate: 685 violent crimes per 100,000 population versus Asheville’s 805. Since the beginning of 2022, Asheville has seen an uptick in aggravated assaults, defined as attacking someone with the intent of causing severe injury. But the raging crime, carjackings and Mexican drug cartel activity described by Fox News? “Crime is a serious issue and one that I hear about as a top concern for our community,” said Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer. “Is our community unsafe as the picture is painted by Fox News? No, absolutely not.” The Fox News report blamed Asheville’s left-leaning politicians for the city’s purported violent crime problem. “CRIME SOARS IN DEM-RUN TOURIST TOWN,” said the chyron. Another chyron proclaimed “TOWN BECOMING HUB OF ANTIFA.” The segment featured ex-Buncombe County Sheriff Van Duncan, a former Democrat who blamed “leftist politicians” for what he said was anti-police sentiment in Asheville. Duncan, who retired as sheriff in 2018, ran the department for 12 years, replacing Bobby Lee Medford. Duncan said in the segment that crime started to climb as those leftist politicians set an agenda that included reducing the jail population. He also said Antifa and activists were active in Asheville and described the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 as “riots.” Duncan’s successor, Buncombe County Sheriff Quentin Miller, told Asheville Watchdog, “We’ve seen some violent crime numbers go up,” but like Asheville Police, the Sheriff’s Office saw a decline in violent crimes in 2021. Miller said he has not encountered an anti-law enforcement sentiment. “The Buncombe county commissioners have stood with me 100%,” he said, supporting pay raises and new equipment. The jail population did decline, especially during the worst of Covid, as some non-violent inmates awaiting trial were released. But the sheriff said, “We didn’t see an increase … as far as crimes being committed.” An online version of the Fox News report said, without citing any details, that there was evidence in Asheville “of increased Mexican drug cartel activity in the area, according to multiple law enforcement sources who spoke to Fox News Digital.” Sheriff Miller said, “Fentanyl is killing our folks locally,” as it is across North Carolina and the U.S. But the drug-dealing arrests in Buncombe thus far have not included Latinos. “We haven’t really seen as you would call it the cartel,” he said. More people today are armed with weapons and guns, said Miller, an Asheville native. “But as far as Asheville being safe, I think it’s safe.” Herrmann, a former crime analyst supervisor with the New York City Police Department, said he looked at crime statistics in cities with liberal and conservative majorities last year and found no discernible difference. “There were plenty of Republican-mayor cities with crime also going up,” he said. Mayor Manheimer said, “Fox News is doing their best to try to highlight these evil Democrat blue cities like New York and Chicago and L.A., and I guess now we’re going to focus on Asheville. It is a continuation of this theme of, ‘You should worry. You’re not safe in your own home. You’re not safe in your community. You’re not safe walking down the sidewalk.’ And that’s not the case in Asheville.” Fox News host Tucker Carlson last week took aim at Manheimer, whom he described as wearing “complicated eyeglasses that all the girl bosses now wear.” Under her leadership, Carlson claimed, Asheville as a beautiful place “should have no crime, but it has a lot now.” And he said Asheville had “a lot of carjackings.” Carjacking is not a criminal charge in North Carolina. Asheville police spokesman Bill Davis said the department has had 16 robberies involving theft of a vehicle since the beginning of 2021. Four police press releases or news reports in the past two years mentioned “carjackings,” including one in February 2022, when police said a man forced a 91-year-old woman from her car and drove away. Asheville Watchdog dug into the city’s crime statistics and found violent crime in Asheville disproportionately affects Black residents, especially young Black residents. “There certainly are people that are at higher risk,” Manheimer said. But the violence, the mayor said, “is fairly isolated in our community. And it’s not typically random.” Asheville Watchdog made three requests over two days to interview Asheville Police Chief David Zack about crime trends, but Davis said he “has a very busy schedule.” Zack did find time to talk to Fox News and said the exodus of more than 100 officers since May 2020 had limited the department’s ability to be proactive and visible. He was quoted as saying, “There certainly have been questions about support [for police] from elected officials, from the president of the United States right on down, so it’s not just local leaders.” In 2021, while Asheville’s police force was drastically reduced, violent crime decreased. When police departments add or lose officers, there’s not a direct correlation in crime, Herrmann said. “It’s a little bit of a leap to suggest that cops have this much of a crime-fighting skill,” he said. Cities across the country are hiring after losing officers in the past couple of years. “There’s no doubt that the social justice protests of 2020 and Covid have certainly strained all the police departments,” Herrmann said. Zack told Fox News that Asheville is operating with nearly 42% fewer officers “every single day.” The department has 61 vacancies out of 238 sworn officers and another 26 in training or on leave, Davis said. Manheimer said Asheville’s police department is understaffed, “and we’re working hard to build back the ranks to be able to keep our community safe and respond to calls for service when the call is made.” The Asheville Police crime dashboard shows crimes against people down 10% in the past year and crimes against property down 20%. Those numbers include a broad range of offenses. Since the beginning of this year, “violent crime is increasing,” Davis said. “It’s primarily attributable to the rise in aggravated assaults.” Aggravated assaults are up 44% over the same period last year, and domestic-related aggravated assaults are up 64%, Davis said. Robberies are also up, 29%. “The only violent crime that has seen reductions is rape, down 28%,” he said. Asheville Watchdog sent the police department a list of questions about the increases: How many are drug- or gang-related? What are the demographics of the offenders and victims, and are the weapons being used mostly guns? Do the people involved have criminal histories for violence or drugs? Is the violence centered in or near public housing? Are armed gang members or drug dealers coming into Asheville from Charlotte, Atlanta or other cities? Have any assaults been random, aimed at residents or tourists? Is downtown safe? Chief Zack, through Davis, answered one question: “There are loosely-organized, neighborhood-specific groups that could fall under a broad definition of gangs here in Asheville.” But within those groups, the chief said it was doubtful that police could build a case to prosecute members under the federal racketeering law designed to combat organized crime. Crime statistics don’t provide the full picture of crime in a city. “What I’ve learned over the years is you can apparently slice and dice crime data however you’d like,” Manheimer said. “You can take five-year snapshots, ten-year snapshots, one-year, year-over-year.” Asheville’s 5-year violent crime rate cited by Fox News, a 31% increase from 2016 to 2020, becomes a 15% increase from 2017 to 2021. And the most recent one-year look, from 2020 to 2021, shows a 6% decrease. Each year, aggravated assaults made up the majority of Asheville’s violent crimes, accounting for about two-thirds to nearly three-quarters. The Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics samples U.S. households about crime victimization each year. “What they show is over half of serious crime doesn’t even get reported to the police,” Herrmann said. “When you tell me that your assaults are up, I’m going to say you don’t really know that'}]"

His undergraduate studies began at North Carolina Agriculture and Technology University as an architecture major. At A&T, Ernie found a love of writing in one course that required frequent essays. Studies at NC A&T were interrupted when Ernie entered the U.S. Army, serving a stint in Vietnam. Later he acquired an associate degree in English. A career counselor suggested he pursue a four-year degree, and he applied to University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). On admittance to UNC, Bennie Renwick that took Ernie under his wing. Ernie vowed to not let Renwick or the University down with his admittance. Ernie graduated from UNC in May 1974. In his senior year, Pitt’s assignment for an investigative journalism course was to research an article and “get it published.” His article was an expose on the rate of failure on the BAR exam for black law students in North Carolina. He uncovered that most of the black students not passing the BAR attended North Carolina Central University while the white law students at the same university were passing. Pitt’s article detailed the inherent racism of the BAR exam at the time being centered on a white experience and societal protocol in the south. Satisfied with his article, Ernie submitted his piece to a few local newspapers and it was never published. The story was later picked up by a local newspaper in the Triangle, but the research was expanded and turned into more a national story with no credit to the original investigator. This was the sole impetus to him starting his own newspaper, The Winston-Salem Chronicle, in Winston-Salem, NC. Now operating as The Chronicle) The Winston-Salem Chronicle, established in 1974, had one goal and that was to expose and uncover disparities in the black community: giving voice to that community and its successes and challenges. The Chronicle was a trendsetting weekly newspaper, published weekly on Thursdays. The Chronicle was the first black newspaper in North Carolina to be ABC audited with 7,500 in annual distribution. Indeed, the Chronicle was the first black newspaper to join the NC Press Association. Through this association, Pitt honed his skills as a publisher, focused on the local Winston-Salem community, and market for local news, receiving the top honor of Excellence in Community Newspapers. Later Pitt joined the National Newspaper Publishers Association (NNPA), winning hundreds of awards over a 20-year span. The Chronicle’s list of awards includes Best newspaper, Best Feature, Best news story, Best investigative story, Best layout and design, and many more. Pitt also earned Publisher of the year twice. Much of The Chronicle’s success could be attributed to the quality of Editors who joined Pitt and who would then go on to succeed at daily newspapers. Of note were several UNC graduates to include Allen Johnson, Angela Wright, and T. Kevin Walker. As The Chronicle grew, Pitt expanded to establish a printing company, call Newspaper Printers, Inc which specialized in student newspapers; Winston-Salem State University, Wake Forest, UNC Greensboro, and NC A&T were among those publications as well as some high school newspapers. Many local high school students visited The Chronicle to learn about newspapers. For many years, The Chronicle also published Black College Sports Review, a monthly insert sold to over 200 black newspapers across the country with sports highlights from Historically Black Colleges & Universities. Always looking to fill a niche in the community, other Chronicle publications included NC Black Business Directory, MLK Jr and Black History month inserts, a local guide to the National Black Theater Festival, monthly magazine, For Seniors Only.. Ernie’s attention to the details and look of his paper garnered attention from the Society of Newspaper Design and was asked to lead workshops on layout design. The impact of the Chronicle was entrenched in the community; with an annual awards banquet recognizing Man and Woman of the Year awards, an annual MLK Prayer Breakfast tackling themes of racism, sponsoring a Junior Varsity Basketball tournament, and the historic Family Day celebration in the summer. Family Day was like a large group family reunion with free food, games, tents with the family’s names, giveaways, and t-shirts. In the black community, family reunions are a big deal; it is a time of reconnection and fellowship sacred to that community. Pitt even secured Dr. Maya Angelou to be a speaker one summer and sometimes over 1,000 families attended. Ernie ensured that Family Day would take place in a park inside of the black community. He wanted to spotlight the natural beauty of the black community at a time when it seemed like the popular thing was to highlight its challenges. Ernie held several volunteer and leadership positions in the community. He served the Housing Authority for seven years as its Chairman of the Board; he was the second Vice President of NNPA and a board member; sat on the board of the Winston-Salem Chamber of Commerce, several bank boards, and the local YMCA board; he was also a founding member of the Piedmont Club (a club established for black leaders out of segregation of other social clubs). Pitt started a real estate development firm and constructed the Hope 6 neighborhood of Lansing Ridge in Winston-Salem; and served on the planning committee of the late Larry Leon Hamlin in the creation of the National Black Theater Festival. Ernie is currently retired and working on establishing a Black Newspaper Museum in Winston-Salem to tell the story of the Black Press through The Chronicle’s varied artifacts and archives. Ernie’s accomplishments and forward thinking are noted in journalism texts about the Black Press. 5171 Glenwood Avenue Suite 486 Raleigh, NC 27612 Email us Phone: (919) 516-8000 Since 1873 NCPA has supported North Carolina newspapers, readership and advertising.

In the Northwest, battery storage and voluntary programs that rewarded customers for reducing demand kept the system running. More: \'A \'Wow\' moment\': US renewable energy hit record 28% in April. In Texas in July, a heat wave caused the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to take emergency measures, including urging residents to restrict their use and paying power operators as much as $5,000 per megawatt hour to keep generators running. ERCOT said two factors affected its ability to meet soaring demand: low wind power generation and outages at coal- and natural gas-fed power plants. Blaming renewable energy as the cause of power crunches is unfair, said David Doniger, senior strategic director in the Natural Resources Defense Council’s climate and clean energy program. “Their answer is always \'Stick with fossil fuel because renewables and efficiency can’t fill the need.\' This is the lie; those are the problem and not the solutions,” he said. “Some of the biggest lies these days are focused on slowing the transition from fossil energy to cleaner alternatives by saying problems or shortcomings for renewables make it impossible.” Energy experts say the percentage of U.S. power that comes from renewables can go much higher than today\'s relatively low numbers without causing severe stress on electrical systems. In April, records were set when 28% of U.S. electricity came from renewable resources. They do acknowledge that decarbonizing the final 10% of the electric grid will be tricky but say that\'s not a reason to avoid decarbonizing the first 90%. Making investment decisions with environmental, social and governance factors in mind has been around for decades. But recently it has been decried as “woke capitalism,” and a concerted effort has been waged to stop companies from taking all three, known as ESG, into consideration when they make investments. That\'s especially true when it comes to taking environmental risk management. More: GOP vs. ESG: Why Republicans are fighting \'woke\' ESG investing In the past year, 18 states have either proposed or adopted rules limiting the ability of the state government and public retirement plans to do business with entities found to ""discriminate"" against certain industries based on environmental, social and governance criteria, according to JD Supra, a legal news source. For example, Arizona’s State Board of Investment said in August that ESG considerations could not be considered in the investment management of its assets. “It’s a sinister lie that’s deeply counterproductive, not just to the climate but also to people’s pocketbooks and pensions,” said Alicia Seiger, who teaches sustainability and energy finance at Stanford University\'s law and graduate schools of business in California. Telling companies they can’t consider all available information to make solid long-term investments “is insanity,” she said. “That should be determined by the investor, not the political system.” Experts have noted an effort by some to lump in climate change with other liberal and progressive causes, such as racial justice. The implication is that those who believe global warming is an issue to be dealt with must also support a host of other objectives that are considered ""far left."" This also comes amid a movement to pressure businesses to view climate change as a hot-button political issue. “Conspiracy theorists connect climate change to other lightning-rod issues to generate emotional, irrational responses that drive online engagement,"" said David Di Martino, co-founder of triplecheck, a nonprofit that works to combat the spread of misinformation, including climate misinformation. But that position ignores the many conservatives who are concerned about global warming and are working to fight it. They include the American Conservation Coalition, Conservatives for Clean Energy, Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions and Congress\' Conservative Climate Caucus. An increasingly frequent message centers around “doomerism,” the lie that it’s totally impossible to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to near-zero without devastating the economy and significantly reducing our standard of living, so there\'s no point in even trying. This is wrong because the technology to decarbonize much of the electrical grid already exists. Meanwhile, wind and solar, along with battery storage, are increasingly cheaper than coal and natural gas. Decarbonizing more hard-to-reach areas, such as steel and cement production and aviation fuel, will take longer but are in the works. An Oxford University study released in September found a fast transition to decarbonized energy systems is cheaper than a slow one or not transitioning at all. Achieving zero-carbon energy systems is ""possible and profitable"" and will save the world at least $12 trillion compared with continuing current levels of fossil fuel use, it found. A long-term lie has been that climate change isn’t real, but as shifting climate patterns have made that argument harder to make, it has moved to one that says there are either no good alternatives to fossil fuels or the alternatives themselves cause problems and are too expensive. “In other words, we are stuck with fossil fuels and there are no good alternatives, so burn baby burn,” said Jason Smerdon, a professor of climate physics at Columbia University in New York. These arguments are mostly in aid of fossil fuel producers who want to keep making money as long as they can. “Climate disinformation has always been about delaying any action on global warming,” Smerdon said. “They simply perpetuate the false assumption that we have no choice but the same old reliance on fossil fuels.” More: We have the tools we need to fix climate change If fact, the business community is jumping in with both feet because they see solid opportunities, said Julio Friedmann, chief scientist at Carbon Direct, a carbon management firm and former professor at Columbia University. “We have the technology we need and we have a lot of the market-aligning policies we need,” he said. It’s no longer a question of “Is this even possible?” but instead “How quickly can we do it?” “It’s a fundamentally different mindset,” Friedmann said. “That’s why I’m bullish on our ability to round these corners and get the job done.”'}]"

Wilke has been a regular at the sheriff’s office since winning the November election, working alongside retiring Sheriff Greg Christopher to ensure a seamless transition. Christopher even gave Wilke an office and a desk to work from and a county car for driving to meetings. “Sheriff Christopher was very gracious to open the doors, so we had a really smooth transition period,” said Wilke, the county’s first Republican sheriff in more than a century. Wilke campaigned on a 10-point plan to modernize the sheriff’s office, bolster crime fighting and improve community outreach. “We are trying to assemble a group of people and the resources for each portion of that plan. Over the next several months, you’ll see some things come into play, including the community advisory panel,” Wilke said. To wit, Wilke has put together a new leadership team: a new chief deputy and three new captains. All were promoted from within. When a new sheriff takes office, every deputy must be sworn in again, from jailers to detectives. The new sheriff has sole discretion over who remains on staff. Wilke kept the vast majority of the 170-some employees — a number that includes not only sworn deputies but civilian officers, jailers and 911 dispatchers. But eight weren’t invited back. “Those are probably some of the hardest decisions someone in my position has to make,” Wilke said. Wilke said turn-over is not unusual when a new sheriff’s administration comes in. “When you compare it to the turn-over rate that typically happens during a transition period, it’s far lower than in other counties,” Wilke said. Wilke said it was paramount to assemble a leadership team who was on board with his vision and goals for the sheriff’s office, however. “You have to have a senior management staff that shares your vision and is inspired by it and can inspire people below them,” Wilke said. Wilke made a campaign pledge to voters and has an obligation to fulfill it, which means moving forward with a team who’s on board. “The vast majority of voters were looking for change,” said Wilke, who won by a resounding 61% of the vote. “We don’t change for the sake of changing, we change for the future. You always want to improve. I think that’s why the voters selected me and that’s what I plan to provide.” Every sheriff’s office employee got a letter inviting them to re-up their service under Wilke, or, in the case of the eight who were let go, letting them know their “services were no longer needed.” “I wanted them to have some advance notice, so it wasn’t just, ‘Hey, don’t come tomorrow,’” Wilke said. Wilke said his decision on who to let go wasn’t based on politics or whether someone supported him in the election. Numerous deputies who openly supported his opponents either in the primary or general election remain on staff. However, two candidates from within the sheriff’s office who ran for sheriff in the primary — namely Tony Cope and John Hemmingway — left their jobs voluntarily after Wilke won the election. Haywood County hasn’t seen a true changing of the guard in the sheriff’s office for many years, however. Over the past two decades, Haywood County has only had two new sheriffs. In both cases the torch was passed to a hand-chosen successor when the outgoing sheriff retired mid-term. The party of the outgoing sheriff — in both cases the Democratic Party named the replacement, who then ran for the position when the next election rolled around. Wilke named a new second-in-command chief deputy the day after the election. Former Chief Deputy Jeff Haynes had planned to retire anyway. Wilke began an informal process of assessing skills and strengths of potential leadership staff from within the sheriff’s office months ago, but didn’t make formal offers for his three new captains until last week. “We had some offline conversations, but none of them were promised anything, and I think in all cases it came as a surprise,” Wilke said. Wilke has restructured the sheriff’s office into three bureaus. One is the detention bureau, which is over the jail. One is the operations bureau, which is over patrol, drug enforcement and investigations. A new one is an administration bureau, which is a catch-all over court functions, serving of warrants, training, community outreach and various admin functions. Here’s who he’s named: • Chief Deputy Matt Trantham: Trantham has been at the sheriff’s office for 17 years. A third-generation law enforcement officer, Trantham got his basic law enforcement training at Haywood Community College at the age of 21, and that same year began his career at the sheriff’s office. Since 2005, Trantham has worked in numerous positions, from bailiff to patrol deputy. He is currently sergeant over the criminal suppression unit with a focus on narcotics and high crime areas, plus the K9 supervisor. • Captain of Operations Bureau Eric Batchelor: Batchelor began with the sheriff’s office in 2019 and is a retired U.S. Army Lt. Colonel, having served for more than 20 years on active duty including combat deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Africa. • Captain of Detention Bureau Kevin Burress: Burress has been with the sheriff’s office since 2019. Prior to becoming a deputy, he worked for the N.C. Department of Corrections and retired as a Superintendent and is also a U.S. Air Force Veteran. • Captain of Administration Bureau Kevin Brooks: Brooks has been with the sheriff’s office since 2014 and previously worked as a Master Officer with the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission, is a state certified law enforcement and firearms instructor. Looking good! I like the new chief and captain selections. Haywood County should be in good shape.

She says there was a lot of planning to get everything set up to participate in the voting process for which schools could start a chapter of Kesem during the 2019-2020 school year. Twelve schools were in the running but only five schools were chosen. WCU was one of the lucky ones. For some of the student members, this organization has a personal impact. Director Will Allen has been through this tough ordeal and connects with Kesem’s purpose. “When I was growing up my parents got divorced. My father moved out of state and my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, so I just felt very alone at the time and very unsure about a lot of things, so when I found out about Kesem coming into college I felt immediately drawn to it and wanted to be a part of it,” said Allen. Allen, along with the other student organizers have set a goal of raising $30,000 for the 2022-2023 year. They are also hoping for 35 campers next summer. “We are a nonprofit so all of the fundraising that we do to make camp free for everyone is completely funded by us and the work we do throughout the year,” said Madison Jordan, outreach coordinator. In November, they will be hosting a Friends and Family Day which is an opportunity for returning and prospective campers to see what activities they do at camp as well as an info session for parents where they learn what Kesem has to offer. Returning families must register campers by December. New families have until Jan. 24. “There is so much that goes on in our lives from our personal lives to our family lives and Kesem is that one place that you can forget about it and enjoy the presence of others,” said Aidan Koschnitzki, the organizations treasurer.

Three years after selling his first newspaper, Ketchie launched High Country Press Publications on May 5, 2005 and has been going strong ever since. As Ketchie began to contemplate retirement, he questioned what the next chapter would be for the publications so many people enjoy. “Sam and I were having lunch last fall – which had become tradition. I was having a bad day and complained about working too much when Sam piped up and asked if I wanted to sell the company,” Ketchie recounted. Although taken aback, he began to consider saying yes. “It was a pleasant surprise to find Sam interested in buying High Country Press Publications. I had become a fan of his through our lunches. His work with Casting Bread was impressive, as was his background with nonprofits, and his networking in the High Country. He cares about his surroundings and dedicates his energy to getting things done,” Ketchie said. What is next for High Country Press Publications? Garrett is enthusiastic about continuing the legacy established by Ketchie. “High Country Press Publications will remain committed to sharing stories from all around the High Country with a focus on integrity, curiosity, and wonder.” PO Box 152, Boone, NC 28607 info@highcountrypress.com You must be logged in to post a comment.'}]"

spoke at Monday’s GOP Forum. Scott Efird Former board chair and current commissioner Scott Efird faces local farmer Levi Greene in the March 5 primary. Efird, who served as mayor of Locust from 2009 to 2012, talked about giving back to the community, including the Kerri D. Efird Bike run, a fundraiser in memory of his daughter that has raised $117,000 in scholarships for West Stanly High School students over 25 years. Greene described himself as the “farm first candidate” and said farmers are the “backbone of our society.” He advocates protecting farmland. Levi Greene When asked about growth in the county, Greene said he was not anti-growth, but pro common sense. He likened current commissioners expressing concerns about growth to a “morbidly obese eater saying, ‘I sure wish I could lose weight,’ while at the same time, they’re reaching for another box of Little Debbies.” Greene said growth has overburdened law enforcement, first responders, schools and infrastructure. He said he would fight to protect agriculture. Efird said growth in Stanly needs to be managed, adding the county needs “good sustainable growth.” He said growth “should be in the municipalities, not in the county.” The incumbent said the 2014 county land use plan will help control growth and noted systems fees have been created by the board for new residential and commercial customers. Efird said for every dollar of residential property revenue, the county spends $1.32 on services. For commercial property, the number spent for every dollar is 47 cents, and 31 cents for agriculture. “We need a balance of residential and commercial growth,” Efird said. Regarding schools, Efird said the main priority is public schools and safety. He noted that out of the average $122 per month people pay in taxes, $29.49 goes to Stanly County Schools, while $20.24 goes to public safety (sheriff’s office, jail, etc.). He said the board has increased the school system’s budget the past two years by $1 million each year. Greene said he felt like he was having déja vu hearing the same concerns from commissioners two years ago. He said inadequacies of the jail and disrepair in school facilities have not been dealt with. “You think with all the residential development in the county that we’d have those two basic issues taken care of already,” Greene said. “We simply can not continue to keep kicking these cans down the road.” Greene said he would want a review of all spending by each department and would favor community schools which he said “have a better scholastic and behavioral outcome than super schools.” “If the people of Stanly County want change, then the citizens need to change some people on the board,” Greene said. When asked about improving healthcare access, quality and trust in local providers, Greene said the government is “way too involved in our health care decisions.” He added appointments to boards like the Consolidated Services Board “are extremely critical.” He said those appointments should be “board members who possess common sense and reflect the true values of the people of Stanly County.” Greene said mask mandates for children were “an assault on individual freedom.” He said kids were “oppressed daily, required to wear masks, report their friends for being sick or forced to miss valuable school days so the health department can chase an arbitrary infection rate triage for a disease that posed zero risk to children.” He also said, “when the health department mandates healthy kids get sent home, I’m not going to trust them. When a commissioner sends an email to county staff telling them to mask up and get a faulty vaccine, no one’s going to trust them.” Efird said he voted against the mask and vaccine mandates, and people should “have the freedom of choice for their own provider.” He said commissioners “can do a little to improve access. We can be transparent to our local providers to form trust.” Regarding appointments to the CSB, Efird said “I put a lot of thought and prayer into every vote as a county commissioner. I do not take this job lightly.” Efird said he felt this election is “about proven, experienced leadership and where you want to see Stanly County in the future.” He noted 341 new jobs and $54.9 million in private sector investment in the county took place while on the Board of Commissioners. Greene said experience is a relative term, adding, “a bad mechanic with 20 years of experience is still a bad mechanic.” He said while not having government experience, he had experience in “running successful businesses with revenues approaching the revenue of this entire county…our county needs strong leaders who will have uncomfortable conversations and won’t shrink from difficult decisions. I’ll offer a fresh perspective.”'}]"
