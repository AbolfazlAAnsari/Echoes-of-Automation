(AP Photo/David Zalubowski) Photo: Associated Press By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — Consumer inflation in the United States cooled last month yet remained elevated in the latest sign that the pandemic-fueled price surge is only gradually and fitfully coming under control. Tuesday’s report from the Labor Department showed that the consumer price index rose 0.3% from December to January, up from a 0.2% increase the previous month. Compared with a year ago, prices are up 3.1%. That is less than the 3.4% figure in December and far below the 9.1% inflation peak in mid-2022. But the latest reading is still well above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target level at a time when public frustration with inflation has become a pivotal issue in President Joe Biden’s bid for re-election. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, so-called core prices climbed 0.4% last month, up from 0.3% in December. On a year-over-year basis, core prices were up 3.9% in January, the same as in December. Core inflation is watched especially closely because it typically provides a better read of where inflation is likely headed. Biden administration officials frequently note that inflation has plummeted since pandemic-related supply disruptions and significant government aid sent it soaring three years ago. And a raft of forward-looking data suggests that inflation will continue to cool. Still, even as it nears the Fed’s target level, many Americans remain exasperated that average prices are still about 19% higher than they were when Biden took office. From December to January, average national gas prices tumbled 3.3%, the government said. Yet so far this month, the average price has climbed higher, rising 15 cents to $3.23 a gallon as of Tuesday, according to AAA. Grocery prices rose 0.4% from December to January, the biggest such rise in a year, though compared with 12 months earlier, food prices are up just 1.2%. The costs of physical goods, including clothing, used cars and prescription drugs, fell for a third straight month. Lower prices for goods are the key driver that is cooling inflation. By contrast, the prices of services — hotel rooms, restaurant meals, auto insurance, apartment rents and the like — are still rising faster than they did before the pandemic and keeping overall inflation persistently high. The cost of car insurance has soared more than 20%, on average, compared with a year ago. The mixed data released Tuesday could reinforce the caution of Fed officials, who have said they’re pleased with the progress in sharply reducing inflation but want to see further evidence before feeling confident that it’s sustainably headed back to their 2% target. Most economists think the central bank will want to wait until May or June to begin cutting its benchmark rate from its 22-year-high of roughly 5.4.

The Protect Arkansas Act was signed into law by Governor Sanders in April of last year. Among other things, the act redefines some felonies to misdemeanors, but most importantly, the Act lays out what felons will have to look forward to if caught and convicted in Arkansas for the felonies below. Namely, no reduced sentences. Whatever time they are sentenced to serve in prison, that is what they will serve, period. Residents of Arkansas who work and earn over $24,300 per year will be getting a tax cut starting this year. Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders wants to phase out the personal income for the state and this is as good a place to start as any. This cut has reduced personal income tax in Arkansas from 4.9% to 4.7%. Not what you would call a ton of extra cash in your pocket, but a reduction is a reduction. The corporate tax rate will also see a reduction in this plan, from 5.3% down to 5.1%. It will remove about $124,000,000 from the state budget, but Arkansas was working on a $1.6 Billion surplus during the previous fiscal year.

It began about 10 months ago, when the Sudanese military and a powerful paramilitary group began fighting each other for political control. Last week, the U.N. pleaded for more aid to the region. It said the fighting had displaced more than 10 million people — many of them fleeing to neighboring countries. It\'s also left 18 million people facing acute food insecurity. James Elder is a spokesperson for UNICEF — the U.N. agency that provides humanitarian aid to children — and has just returned from a trip to the border of Sudan and Chad. He spoke to NPR\'s Sacha Pfeiffer about what he saw. And a warning: Some of what is discussed may be difficult to read. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Sacha Pfeiffer: Could you describe what you saw, your strongest visual memories of being there? James Elder: I think probably the strongest is just the eeriness of when you walk around communities, it could be a rural area or a neighborhood like a middle-class neighborhood, and it\'s empty. It\'s just absolutely silent. You can only hear the crunching of glass under your feet. And you look and its buildings are pockmarked, clothes and things, everything\'s been burned and looted and there is no one. There\'s no one. This is the largest displacement of children on the planet, it\'s mind boggling. And then just this exhaustion of people that you see, whether it was in Chad, where the refugees have gone, or whether it\'s those in Darfur who are still terrified because they\'ve had homes looted and burned. There is just that look amongst people that they\'re battered, they\'re exhausted, and they\'re still terrified because war is very much still raging in Sudan. Pfeiffer: Despite that emptiness, were you able to talk with some people? And if so, what did they tell you? Elder: Yeah, I spoke to a lot of people. I was in Chad, where you\'ve had a lot of refugees come in, and I was in Darfur, where the war continues. People speak to a couple of things. They speak to the horrendous violations, what we call ""grave violations."" The sexual abuse, seeing children killed, seeing rape of sisters or of mothers — this horrible level of kind of human suffering. As a woman said to me, ""If they couldn\'t steal it, they burned it."" You know, I heard stories of someone\'s brother having sand stuffed so far down his throat into his esophagus. Deliberate attempts just to terrify and torture people. So the stories are endless, as are the stories of those people who walk for days and days with badly malnourished children, desperately seeking help. They\'re repeated time and again. Pfeiffer: Your work focuses specifically on children. What are the unique or particular challenges that kids are facing in this? Elder: Nutrition has to be a huge one. You\'re talking about hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of children with a type of malnutrition that is the most dangerous, the most likely to kill someone. Because the health system\'s been shattered, that\'s something UNICEF is desperately trying to sustain. We get ""therapeutic food"" – it\'s basically ""magic"" peanut paste — to children, we try and get that across the country. That\'s difficult as well because aid is blocked in areas. But nutrition is a big one, and when you have a health system in tatters and when you have millions of people not actually accessing safe water and these relentless attacks on people, you have this vicious cycle of nutrition and water and disease, and that\'s what will kill children. Pfeiffer: All these people fleeing are obviously going to other places. You mentioned Chad as an example. Where else are people going? Elder: Chad is taking the most refugees, for sure. South Sudan has taken a large number. I have spent a lot of time in South Sudan, it is a very difficult place to end up as a refugee. It\'s a very difficult place to be if you\'re South Sudanese. As ever, the poorest countries around the globe — not just in this crisis — absorb the most refugees. Those with the least tend to constantly be asked to give the most, and that\'s what we\'re seeing here. Within this, we\'re seeing people die from nutrition, seeing people die from bullets, seeing people die from clean water. But there\'s another type of death that I really noticed going on. I was in Darfur 20 years ago. I went back this last week for the first time in 20 years ... and met a lot of 20-somethings and their dreams had died. And I found that devastating. These were youth who would have been very small kids during those massacres in Darfur of 20 years ago. But somehow their parents kept them alive, and they latched on to life. They\'re studying. They\'re doing economics, medical sciences, I.T., you name it – all the things that a country needs. But these brightest minds are having to abandon their studies and their ambitions are being shattered. I sat with many people, but one sticks in my mind — this electric 22-year-old woman in Darfur. And we\'re talking about being a woman in Sudan, and life, and war. And she said, this is pretty much verbatim: ""I had a dream. It was to study medical science. I was living that dream. Now, I have nothing. I do not dream. Sadness is my friend."" Pfeiffer: In this part of Africa, there are numerous countries experiencing all types of instability, and instability can lead to power vacuums that can create a rise in violent extremism, which also has ripple effects globally. Is there any particular role that you think the U.S. or other countries in the world should be playing here? Elder: Across the entire region, east to west Africa, there is a demographic of our population boom that is pretty much unprecedented in human history. And any economist will tell you, if you get that right – and by ""getting it right,"" that means education and making sure that that education gives those young people the right skills and there\'s a labor market to absorb them — then you have an economic boom. You have this huge base of the working population, almost like the envy of an aging Europe. If you don\'t get it right — and there\'s a clock that ticks on this — you have a massive youth population, they\'re disaffected, you have tensions, political disorder, all these things, security, instability. So it\'s either a demographic dividend or a demographic disaster. And that is very much in the United States\', the Europeans\', everyone\'s interest, to make sure that this youth bulge is a dividend to the region, to the countries and the world.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: If you picture a map of Gaza, Rafah is at the very bottom at a border crossing to Egypt. It\'s now the refuge for people from all over the rest of Gaza who fled Israel\'s offensive in recent months. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told the army to prepare some kind of plan to evacuate more than 1 million civilians from Rafah, although it\'s not clear where they could go. FADEL: NPR\'s Eyder Peralta is following the story from Tel Aviv, and he joins us now. Good morning. EYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Leila. FADEL: So let\'s start with these threats from Israel. Palestinians have been displaced multiple times over. Now, a majority of residents of the strip are in this small piece of land in the southernmost part of the Palestinian territory. Why is Israel now moving into this part of Gaza? PERALTA: Well, Israel says that it\'s going after Hamas. Remember, last October, Hamas launched an attack in southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people, and Israel vowed to destroy Hamas. And so far, they have swept from Gaza\'s north to itself. The bombing has killed some 28,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\'s health ministry. And in the past few days, Israel\'s defense minister and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu say that Rafah, a city that, as you said, is along the border with Egypt, is Hamas\' final stronghold. Netanyahu was interviewed by ABC yesterday, and he reiterated that Israel was poised to launch a military operation at Rafah. Let\'s listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: Those who say that under no circumstances should we enter Rafah are basically saying lose the war, keep Hamas there. FADEL: And part of this may have already started. We\'re hearing reports of airstrikes this morning and some good news about hostages taken from Israel. What are you learning? PERALTA: So we know there\'s been an increase in airstrikes generally in Rafah. But the Israeli military says what happened overnight was about hostages and that the airstrikes were a diversionary tactic. The military says that they rescued two of the 136 hostages who Israel believe are still in Gaza, and they say both are in good condition. A hospital official tells NPR that at least 50 Palestinians were killed last night. NPR producer Anas Baba was on the street in Rafah. Let\'s listen.

Al-Huda Mosque is one of the most known mosques all over Rafah, and it got bombed to pieces. Could you exactly tell me your name, please? AMZA NEDAL ABUL: Amza Nedal Abul (ph). BABA: Could you tell me what\'s happened exactly? ABUL: Every day we lose everything. We lose our family, we lose our health, we lose our mosques. We lose our children and our houses. You know, where\'s the humanity? I mean, where\'s the humanity? PERALTA: Where is the humanity, she keeps asking, where is the world? FADEL: OK, so let\'s ask that question. Where does the world stand on this? PERALTA: I mean, pretty much everyone - the U.S., the U.N., the EU, the U.K. - is warning Israel against moving into Rafah, and that\'s because Rafah is the last remaining relatively safe space for Palestinian refugees. Some 1.4 million Palestinians are now in Rafah. I spoke to Yousef Hammash, who works for the Norwegian Refugee Council, and he describes a desperate atmosphere. To the north you have bombing and hunger, and to the south you have Egypt, which does not want to take refugees. So everyone feels like they\'ve been painted into a corner, that there is nowhere to run. And if bombing begins, he says, it feels like the only choice you\'re left with is - the only choice you\'re left to make is how you want to die. It\'s worth noting that in a phone call, President Biden caution Prime Minister Netanyahu, saying that any military operation in Rafah should be accompanied by a credible plan to protect civilians. FADEL: That\'s NPR\'s Eyder Peralta reporting from Tel Aviv. Thank you, Eyder. PERALTA: Thank you, Leila. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: Former President Trump has reignited questions about what he\'d do to U.S. alliances as president. INSKEEP: At a campaign rally, the ex-president told a rambling tale of a supposed conversation with the leader of an unnamed nation in NATO, the North Atlantic Alliance. Trump pictured himself saying that if the NATO ally didn\'t pay enough, he would not protect them against Russia. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills. (CHEERING) INSKEEP: The ex-president, who is famous for failing to pay his own bills, appeared to misspeak about the nature of the NATO alliance, whose members do not owe bills. The nations do commit to spend a percentage of their budgets on defense. They are also committed to defend one another and came to the United States\' defense when it was attacked in 2001. FADEL: NPR\'s Stephen Fowler in Atlanta was at the rally and joins us now. Good morning. STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: So Donald Trump says he would encourage Russia to, quote, ""do whatever the hell they want"" to NATO countries in Europe that, in his mind, aren\'t spending enough on defense. Pretty controversial statement to make at a time Russia\'s actively at war in Ukraine and NATO allies feel threatened. What\'s his message with this statement? FOWLER: Well, Leila, Trump has been critical of NATO for a while. That\'s not a new development. FADEL: True. FOWLER: I mean, in fact, his presidency was marked by consistently questioning the value of international alliances broadly and NATO specifically. I mean, he repeatedly threatened in private to withdraw the U.S. from the alliance and publicly harangued other global powers like Germany and France to contribute more to defense spending. Over the last decade, NATO members have aimed to increase spending levels to 2% of their GDP, and as of last year, only 11 of 31 countries hit that target. That includes the U.S., which spends about 3.5%. As we heard, Trump falsely implies there are countries that haven\'t paid their bills or owe the U.S. or NATO directly. I mean, it\'s not like a country club where there are dues to be considered a member, it\'s a club of countries that have promised to defend and protect each other from threats. So why more spending over the years? Russian aggression over the last decade, which is complicated by Trump\'s vocal support of Russia. FADEL: What\'s the reaction been to his comments? FOWLER: Well, the White House issued a rare statement late Saturday calling the comments, quote, ""unhinged,"" said it was promoting deranged chaos and stressed that the stance of President Joe Biden\'s administration is that NATO is the largest and most vital it\'s ever been. And of course, the campaign wants to make that front and center. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Sunday that any suggestion NATO allies would not honor the commitment to defend one another, quote, ""undermines all of our security."" Republicans in Congress largely shrugged it off as Trump being Trump. FADEL: An excuse we hear often from his Republican colleagues. So he\'s made a lot of people upset. Who is he appealing to here with these comments, Republican voters? FOWLER: Well, yes and no. I mean, remember, Trump isn\'t a fan of NATO. And if he\'s elected again, there\'s no telling what he would advocate for. But some of Trump\'s defenders do point out the veiled threat from his anecdote was ultimately successful because other European countries and NATO did start stepping up to the plate and beefing up their spending. There are GOP primary voters that want America\'s global footprint to retreat a little bit and focus more domestically, but this meandering message about NATO and funding and foreign policy is typical Trump. I mean, think stories where people say, sir. It was part of a nearly two-hour riff in front of his biggest supporters, but it didn\'t really make that much of an impact to the crowd. FADEL: That\'s NPR\'s Stephen Fowler in Atlanta. Thank you, Stephen. FOWLER: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: Now let\'s check a claim that\'s made in the immigration debate. Republicans who blocked a bipartisan immigration plan in Congress have been insisting it\'s not really needed. INSKEEP: House speaker Mike Johnson is among those making that assertion. The Republican leader has been saying that the president can close the border without the help of Congress. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE JOHNSON: I told President Biden this myself on multiple occasions, most recently a'}]"

An ad for “hair club for women” was running. Photos flew by with before and after shots of women. Most had been afflicted with bare spots or thinning manes and the “after” photos showed them with gloriously full tresses. Then I saw it. Down in the corner, the small print said, “Results may vary.” Ahh. Yes, indeed. Results may vary. The old “caveat emptor.” The ad might as well say “These are not typical,” as advertisers are forced to do by truth-in-advertising laws. Sadly, in our culture, we’re used to such come-ons and slick sales spiels. No one expects the used car salesman to tell you why we should be cautious in buying this particular car. We’ve learned to turn a suspicious eye toward the seller of the house who cannot quit raving about all its fine points. What, we wonder, is he not saying? Which brings up another point… The fine print of the gospel Has anyone ever found “fine print” in the Lord’s offer of salvation? Is there anywhere that we are told things such as: –You’re going to love Jesus, but not everyone has the complete package–which may include sins forgiven, name written in the Book of Life, acceptance into God’s family, and the Holy Spirit’s entrance. –You’re going to love Jesus but not everyone gets all their sins forgiven. Some get all, some get 40 percent, and some more. Results vary. –What we are offering is the truth, but not everyone has to call on the name of Jesus. Other deities may also be invoked in various cultures of the world. –Results may vary, although John 3:16 applies in most cases. Has anyone ever seen any of that? No, and you won’t. Thank God, you will not find any such in God’s Word. Instead, we find statements such as: –Whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely (Revelation 22:17). –As many as believed, to them He gave the right to become children of God (John 1:12). –Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved (Romans 10:13). –If anyone thirst, let him come unto me and drink…. (John 7:37). –Whoever comes to me, I will in no wise cast out (John 6:37). May I make a suggestion or two? First, look up those Scriptures. Second, in reading them in your Bible, look closely for an asterisk. See anything directing you to footnotes with qualifying statements such as: “Only for residents of Israel or New Jersey”? Or “Results may vary” “Not typical” or even “Only for the educated.” Third, smile really big. You are included in every one of those “whosoevers!” You are an “anyone.” You can come to Jesus! Freely come drink, words the soul to thrill. O, with what joy they my heart do fill. For when He said ‘whosoever will,’ Jesus included me. (Hymn by Johnson Oatman) And fourth, for the rest of your life, thank Him for accepting someone like you–someone who deserved hell (yes, you do!), someone who brings nothing to qualify for heaven–into His eternal family. Thank Him for loving you! Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called the children of God!
