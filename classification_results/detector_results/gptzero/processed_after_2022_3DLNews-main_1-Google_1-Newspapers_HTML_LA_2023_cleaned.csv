Baker, hired at KATC in 1994, has been the station’s longest-tenured meteorologist and was named GMA co-anchor in 2017. “This young Midwesterner fell in love with Acadiana back in 1994,” Baker wrote. “I came for a job, but instead I found a home.

Baker was rumored to be leaving the station amid Fontenot and Hummel’s news last month. The changes are coming at a time when the station’s parent company, E.W.

Larry Richard On Monday, November 13, 2023, at the Sliman Theater we held our annual State of the Parish presentation. This event provides an invaluable opportunity to reflect on the progress we have made as a community and to outline the path forward for Iberia Parish. I would like to share a few highlights from that presentation. First, I would like to draw attention to how hard I and my administration have worked to improve the financial stability of Iberia Parish Government. In 2016, our parish government had 29 days of Cash on Hand. This represents how many days of cash we have available to run the government in case of an emergency. Today we have increased that fund to represent 256 days of available cash. In my eight years in office, we have increased this fund 783%. Next, I would like to mention the remarkable advancements that have been made in Water Works District #1 (Coteau), a region that has faced persistent challenges. We have dedicated multiple resources to address the issues that were affecting the Coteau area. We can assure our Coteau residents that they have access to safe and reliable water services. The State of the Parish presentation also highlighted some of the exciting developments taking place in Iberia Parish. Delta Biofuel’s $100 million project in Patoutville is set to be a transformative endeavor, creating 126 jobs with an average salary of $62,500 plus benefits. First Solar, the largest solar manufacturing company in the Western Hemisphere, has chosen Iberia Parish as the location for its newest manufacturing plant. Representing a $1.1 billion investment, this state-of-the-art facility spanning 2.3 million square feet will generate 700 jobs with an average salary of $80,000 plus benefits. These are just a couple of the projects currently underway. They exemplify our commitment to economic growth and job creation in Iberia Parish. The collaboration between public and private sectors exhibits our determination to build a vibrant and prosperous community. As new companies, such as these, move into Iberia Parish we must make sure we have the infrastructure in place to support not only the companies themselves but the families that will follow. We have placed a strong focus on new road development. Construction is complete on Innovation Boulevard, Access Way and a new roundabout at Corporate Drive (LA Hwy 3212). Currently, construction is underway to straighten Louisiana Highway 88 from U.S. 90 through Coteau. Both of these projects improve access to Acadiana Regional Airport from US Hwy 90. In October, I and members of our state delegation went before the Louisiana Joint Legislative Committee to request funds to construct the extension of Hanger Drive to Louisiana Highway 3212 while adding a roundabout and turning lanes to Louisiana Highway 3212. We were awarded $16 million to complete this project, which will begin in 2024. This is only the second time in history that the Legislative Committee has awarded funds from the Capital Outlay Savings. I am very proud of this accomplishment and would like to thank Senator Bret Allain, Senator Elect Blake Miguez, Senator Fred Mills, Rep. Beau Beauilleau and Rep. Denise Marcelle for their unwavering support. I would also like to thank Governor John Bel Edwards for his continuing support. This would not have been possible without their commitment to the betterment of Iberia Parish. Now it is our turn to show our commitment to improving our home. We must do our part. I ended my State of the Parish presentation with a request. In April 2024 I will ask the residents of Iberia Parish to vote to approve a .75 sales tax for a dedicated road fund. This fund will address road maintenance and overlay of the 400+ miles of Iberia Parish roadways. Our Public Works department does an outstanding job with the limited resources we have. It takes $1.3 million to maintain our roads annually. This tax will provide approximately $4.8 million annually which will allow us the ability to provide the necessary overlay to get our roads back in top condition. As we move forward, it will take us all working together to shape the future of Iberia Parish and I thank you for your ongoing commitment to our community.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 4:05 pm Kimberly Womack and Kathryn Simpson When her landlord found Kimberly Gail Womack’s nude and lifeless body in the bedroom of her mobile home, sheriff’s deputies told Kathryn Simpson that her mother had slipped in a puddle of chocolate syrup and hit her head. Following her mother’s cremation, investigators admitted to Kathryn that someone murdered her mom. Born in Magnolia, Mississippi, September 6, 1959, and growing up in Kentwood, her father’s hometown, Kim Womack, likely never imagined being murdered in Pointe Coupee Parish before her 49th birthday. Kim’s death certificate recorded her cause of death as “blunt force trauma to head by assault” and a “leftsided subdural hematoma” (brain hemorrhage) induced by multiple blows to her skull. Dr. Alfredo Suarez performed the autopsy on orders from the Deputy Coroner, Dr. Ty Chaney, accomplishing little more than confirming the coroner\'s initial observations. Dr. Harry Kellerman initially noted “multiple fractured ribs” and “multiple bruises on her upper and lower extremities as well as the mid-frontal region of the face” where dried blood had “emanated from her oral cavity and both nostrils.” Kathryn Simpson recalled a trail of blood leading from her mother’s kitchen into the bedroom where Kim Womack died. Days after her mom’s memorial at the Florida Boulevard Baptist Church, the Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff’s Office phoned Kathryn, asking her to make the drive from her home in Baton Rouge to their office in New Roads. On the road, she felt optimistic, confidant they had scheduled the conference to tell her who killed her mother. Instead, sheriff’s investigators only told her who didn’t do it. Even today – 12 years after the homicide – the sheriff’s office insists that the man Kim Womack was dating – a married sheriff’s deputy – did not kill her. When the deputy, whom Kathryn says she had known all of her life, dodged her mother’s memorial, she grew suspicious. She asked 18th Judicial District Assistant District Attorney Tony Clayton to share the district attorney’s insights on the case. “He let me see the information,” Kathryn said, “but I couldn’t get a copy. He said if the contents of the file reached the media, it would ruin the deputy’s life.” He implied to Kathryn that she “will never know” the full story of her mom’s death. Almost immediately, Kathryn said she went to the office of the deputy’s wife. “I slapped my mom’s picture down in front of her,” she said. “And I asked if she knew the woman in the picture.” Kathryn said she told the deputy’s wife that Kim Womack had an affair with her husband and that she had taken a road trip with the officer three weeks before she “turned up dead.” Kathryn described in detail the sheriff’s deputy’s “training event” in Lake Charles and explained how her mother had covertly accompanied him. The deputy’s wife said she would confront her husband that night and call Kathryn the next day. “I couldn’t wait for the call,” Kathryn said, “I called her the next morning, but she just wished me luck and said she would not be talking to me again.” Sometime later, an ornate lawn brick appeared on Kathryn’s mother’s doorstep. The sheriff’s office told Kathryn they had found it there, engraved with her mother’s name and the monograms “DFB.” Investigators said they could only guess what the initials represented. According to her death certificate, Dr. Kellerman pronounced Kim Womack dead at approximately 11:10 a.m., August 1, 2008, in her rented mobile home at 5448 Lazare Jarreau Lane, following an injury sustained “approximately July 31, 2008.” Dr. Kellerman wrote that the sheriff’s office had called him after neighbors reported that Kim Womack had “not been seen for a day or so,” and he described the crime scene this way: “When I arrived, I went into the trailer with a sheriff’s deputy. The trailer was in a state of disarray. A door from bathroom going into bedroom appeared to have been pulled from its hinges. A bedside table in the bedroom was on its side, partially blocking the entrance to bedroom. I stepped over this to get into the bedroom. A totally nude female was lying crosswise across the bed. The decedent showed swelling around lids of eyes and dried blood from the nose and also what appeared to be multiple contusions of all extremities.” “I did not touch the body, but released to the sheriff’s deputies,” he wrote, “Will treat this as it appeared to be, a homicide until proven otherwise.” “The sheriff’s office contacted the state police crime lab to investigate this,” he added, “Big help in suspicious deaths.” Dr. Kellerman signed the autopsy report on August 3 and the Coroner’s Permission to Cremate on August 4, and Rabenhorst Funeral Home of Baton Rouge commissioned the Lafayette Crematory to incinerate the remains the following day. By signing the Permission to Cremate, Dr. Kellerman, perhaps unknowingly, violated Louisiana state law. Louisiana R.S. 13:5716 states, “If the cremation of a body is requested, the funeral director shall immediately notify the coroner who has jurisdiction in the death. If, after the necessary investigation, the coroner is satisfied that no suspicious circumstances surround the death, he shall issue a permit for cremation.

Here\'s a look back at some of 2023\'s top stories in Acadiana. In 2023, Lafayette Parish turned 200 years old, and we were part of a yearlong celebration of its history. We looked back at how we got here, the people who shaped the parish and what we want our next 200 years to look like. We also produced a seven-part documentary that reflects the many diverse cultures that make up the fabric of Lafayette Parish. The year culminated with the burial of time capsules containing letters, photos, T-shirts, video recordings and other items commemorating Lafayette Parish\'s Bicentennial. Find all the Acadiana Advocate\'s bicentennial content at theadvocate.com/acadiana/200for200. In August, Youngsville Police Chief Rickey Boudreaux announced his resignation. It had been a tumultuous year for Boudreaux, which included criminal and ethics investigations, a formal complaint, an audit and a lawsuit. Boudreaux is reportedly the subject of an investigation with the Sheriff\'s Office and the Louisiana Board of Ethics. The Sheriff\'s Office investigation was allegedly launched after a police department employee found methamphetamine in the doorway of the chief\'s office on the morning of July 17. The Louisiana Board of Ethics is also reportedly investigating Boudreaux for his involvement in a November traffic incident involving former council member Kayla Reaux. The problems came into public view in a March 26 story in The Acadiana Advocate that detailed how Reaux, a former councilmember, may have received special treatment after she called Boudreaux from the scene of a November crash in Sugar Mill Pond. Reaux left the scene of the crash in the chief\'s vehicle without receiving a citation or sobriety test. She resigned from her elected position days after the story published. In November Monique Blanco Boulet ousted Josh Guillory, becoming Lafayette\'s first woman to be elected mayor-president. In the Oct. 14 primary, Guillory led with 40% of the vote. Boulet was second with 34%. Jan Swift finished third, eliminating her from the runoff. On Nov. 18, Boulet received 52% of the votes cast, compared with Guillory\'s 48%. A daughter of the late Raymond “Coach” Blanco and the late Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, who was the state’s first and only female governor, Blanco Boulet was CEO of the Acadiana Planning Commission for seven years and has spent a long time working in economic development circles, but this is her first elected office. A broad kickback scandal played out in 2023 with ties to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and the 15th Judicial District Attorney\'s office. The scandal’s central figure, Dusty Guidry, has admitted taking more than $800,000 in kickbacks from firms that provide programs aimed at helping people accused of crimes stay on track. Provided the programs are approved by the DA, those who complete them can have their records cleansed. Along with Guidry, Leonard Franques, who is best known for opening a series of Pizza Hut franchises in the Lafayette area, was accused of being involved in a December bill of information. Weeks earlier, Joseph Prejean, of Church Point, was charged in a similar bill of information. The prosecution\'s primary targets in the sprawling case appear to be two prominent public officials. The first is Gary Haynes, Lafayette\'s city prosecutor and an assistant district attorney from the time Landry took office in January 2021 through May 2022, when Landry put him on leave, shortly after FBI agents raided the DA\'s offices. The second is Jack Montoucet, who served as secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries under Edwards before resigning earlier this year. Over the summer, a cyberattack on the St. Landry Parish school system resulted in thousands of students, teachers and business owners who had their personal information exposed online. Among the district’s breached documents are thousands of health insurance records with the Social Security numbers of at least 13,500 people, some 100,000 sales tax records for local and out-of-state companies and several thousand student records including home addresses and special education status. System administrators neglected to inform victims that their data may have been exposed, leaving them vulnerable to identity theft. The lack of notification could run afoul of Louisiana’s data breach notification rules. A federal judge ruled that a predominately white school in St. Martin Parish, opened during the height of desegregation, can reopen only for students in pre-K through first grade with older students attending a different school. The decision comes as part of a decades-long desegregation lawsuit involving the St. Martin Parish School Board that alleged the district did not do enough to desegregate its student and faculty populations as demanded by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. Despite requests to gain unitary status, which would mean it has eliminated the effects of past segregation to the best of its ability, the district remains under the supervision of the Department of Justice and a federal judge. In addition to this ruling, Foote has made a series of others this year in an effort to desegregate St. Martin Parish schools. She identified several practices the school district must implement to diversify its faculty, equitably apply discipline and help its Black students follow paths to higher education. She also ruled that the district must create two unique magnet programs, which are tailored to offer specialized course learning to attract students from all backgrounds, at two of its lower-grade schools. The Lafayette Public Library continued to be at the epicenter of a broader culture war, with religious conservative fighting to remove books with ""sexually explicit"" and LGBTQ content from teen and children\'s sections. In August, Danny Gillane, library director for less than a year, was fired by the library\'s board of control, a group under conservative leadership, which met illegally in executive session to discuss Gillane\'s employment. Gillane filed suit against the board and was allowed to resign and keep benefits such as accrued sick leave and health insurance. In December, the board voted to cut ties with the American Library Association and forbid the library from spending tax dollars on any programs, materials or services provided by the ALA. The ALA, the nation\'s oldest library organization of 150 years, supports libraries across the country with resources and training. State auditors identified two dozen potential problems with Lafayette Consolidated Government’s 2021-22 operations, including possible violations of state bid law, the state constitution, the Home Rule Charter and its own policies and procedures. Some of the noted issues are related to a controversial spoil bank removal in St. Martin Parish and the construction of detention ponds. City-parish administrators have disagreed with most of the findings, and said they were not given adequate time to address the findings. Ian Howard, the man accused of fatally shooting Lafayette Police Cpl. Michael Middlebrook six years ago, entered a plea deal in October that will keep him off death row. Howard, 33, had earlier pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to shooting Middlebrook as the officer responded to a complaint at a Moss Street convenience store Oct. 1, 2017. Howard faced a first-degree murder charge in Middlebrook\'s death and prosecutors said they would seek the death penalty. He also faced three attempted murder charges for shooting at three others during the incident, including another police officer. Students, teachers, school board members, district staff and other community stakeholders in tossed shovels of dirt to celebrate the start of construction at Lafayette High School. The ceremonial groundbreaking in September officially marked the start of the two-year construction project that will replace the 70-year-old building. The $100-million, three-story new building will be able to accommodate 2,300 students, which is about 400 more than the current building. Construction will start and continue even while students are on campus. The new building is expected to welcome students and staff in fall 2025. Judith Estorge in 2023 completed her first year as Lafayette\'s police chief. She is the Lafayette Police Department’s first woman and openly LGBTQ+ chief. Estorge launched numerous efforts to restore public trust in the police department. Standard meetings with elected officials, nonprofit and organization leaders and community stakeholders became routine. The department’s community walks, in partnership with the Lafayette Parish Sheriff’s Office and Lafayette City Marshal’s Office, resumed. They also launched a series of “Coffee with a Cop” monthly meet-and-greets later this month, where Estorge, her command staff and various officers will be available to have coffee with community members at coffee shops and restaurants around the city. After eight years with the only Democratic governor in the Deep South, Louisiana elected Republican Jeff Landry by a wide enough margin in October to avoid a runoff. Republicans also took control of all other state offices and supermajorities in the state legislature. Landry and his fellow elected officials are expected to pass some of the conservative policies that outgoing Gov. John Bel Edwards blocked on crime, LGBTQ issues and renewable energy.

Sterling Snowdy declared a contested 1990 ordinance null and void, returning a tract of farmland in Wallace from industrial use back to its original residential zoning. This ruling has major implications for the construction of Greenfield Louisiana’s proposed grain terminal. In his ruling, Snowdy referenced the fact that the Parish Council passed an amended version of the ordinance in April 1990 without first submitting the amended text to the Planning Commission for review and recommendation. Sisters Jo and Joy Banner, founders of The Descendants Project, have been fighting against the Greenfield development since 2021. In a lawsuit filed against St. John Parish, the Banner sisters argued that residents of Wallace are faced with the development of a grain elevator in their quiet community as a direct result of an injustice that happened more than three decades ago. Ordinance 90-27 rezoned a tract of land from residential to industrial use in 1990. Six years later, then Parish President Lester Millet Jr. was sentenced to 57 months in prison after being convicted of extortion, money laundering and violation of the Travel Act in connection to his efforts to assist Formosa Plastics Group in locating a rayon pump facility in Wallace. At the time, the Court of Appeals cited that these efforts included convincing nearby property owners, through illegal means, to convey their property to Formosa. Plans for the facility eventually fell through, but not before the Wallace tract was rezoned for industrial use in April 1990, the same month Formosa completed the purchase of the land. The rezoning has remained on the books, and the land has since been used for farming sugarcane. Today’s ruling declares Ordinance 90-27 null and void ab initio, meaning it was null from the beginning and never had any legal effect. While the lawsuit centered on Millet’s alleged corruption, Snowdy noted that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate Millet’s fraudulent acts extended to the rezoning of Wallace farmland. According to Snowdy, plaintiffs would need to demonstrate that Millet obtained something of economic value, directly or indirectly, through the enactment of Ordinance 90-27. Instead, Ordinance 90-27 was declared null based on a procedural concern. The St. John the Baptist Parish Council voted unanimously, with one recusal, to enact Ordinance 90-27 on April 19, 1990. Immediately prior to voting on the ordinance’s enactment, Councilman Haston Lewis introduced an amendment that would place a 300-foot I-1 buffer wherever an I-3 district buffers an R-1 residential district. The Parish Council voted to enact the amended Ordinance 90-27. Minutes from the April 19, 1990 meeting indicate that Councilman Lewis’ amendment was added without being formally submitted to the Planning Commission for review and recommendation as required by parish policy. “In summarizing the judgment above, the court grants summary judgment to Plaintiffs and declares Ordinance 90-27 null and void ab initio due to the council’s failure to submit Councilman Lewis’ amendment, which changed the zoning classification considered by the planning commission, to the planning commission for review and recommendation prior to the enactment,” Snowdy wrote. “Notable, Plaintiffs request a plethora of relief. However, the relief grant is limited to the declaration that ordinance 90–27 is null and void ab initio.” Jo and Joy Banner issued the following statement in response to the ruling: “We thank the Court for ruling that the Greenfield site in Wallace be returned to residential zoning, which will prevent the continued development of environmentally devastating projects like the proposed Greenfield Terminal. We are hopeful this ruling puts an end to the illegal 30-year-old rezoning ordinance that categorized the historic St. John the Baptist Parish in Louisiana as an industrial area. Judge Snowdy and the 40th District Court have soundly rejected the notion that the rich history of this region and the environment and health of our community should be disregarded in favor of corporate greed.” L’OBSERVATEUR has reached out to Greenfield Louisiana for comment on today’s ruling. On May 9, the National Trust for Historic Preservation named the 11-mile corridor along the Mississippi River on the West Bank of St. John Parish as one of the “11 Most Endangered Historic Places for 2023.” The tract of land is also under consideration to be designated a National Historic Landmark. When the West Bank was named to the Endangered Historic Places list, organizers of the Greenfield project shared a desire to co-exist with historic preservation and responsible economic revitalization. Greenfield has set aside land and funding for the purpose of preserving and protecting West Bank history and to “tell a more complete story that connects to Louisiana’s historic tourism infrastructure.” According to a Greenfield spokesperson, a community-based board funded through the West Bank Prospers Foundation was created to guide these efforts. Update – Greenfield Louisiana issued the following statement: “On Friday, the 40th Judicial District Court for St. John the Baptist Parish ruled that a procedural issue with the original buffer zone established in 1990 has affected the zoning on Greenfield’s proposed grain export facility site. While we are disappointed with this outcome, we remain fully committed to resolving this issue and moving forward with our plans to build the grain export facility, including by proceeding with the ongoing permitting process. We appreciate the overwhelming support from the Wallace community and the extended West Bank region, and we firmly believe that these procedural hurdles will be overcome.

The U.S. Department of Transportation announced last week its Build America Bureau has provided an $88.3 million loan to the Louisiana Bond Commission for the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development to build the La. 415 Connector, a new link between La. 1 and La. 415 at Interstate 10 in Port Allen. By providing Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act and Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing loans and other financing, the bureau helps communities expedite infrastructure projects and reduce project costs. “The project is critical to improving resiliency and enhancing safety for people in the region by providing a direct connection and evacuation route for areas south of I-10,” Deputy Transportation Secretary Polly Trottenberg said. “The new access west of La. 1 will also support regional economic growth for residents and businesses in this area.” This loan is part of a plan that includes $38 million in other federal funding for the $268 million project. The project will build 2.7 miles of a new two-lane roadway to connect La. 1 and I-10, bridge structures over the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, a new interchange between La. 415 and La. 1, and modifications of the I-10 ramps at La. 415. “Louisiana strategically leveraged funding from a settlement with BP to finance a bundle of projects, which helped make the loan process more efficient,” Executive Director Morteza Farajian said. “This is the state’s seventh loan closed since 2021 for a total of $289 million, accelerating delivery of critical transportation solutions, including five rural projects.” “If all projects funded by the BP settlement were to be funded on a PAYGO-only basis, the construction would not be able to begin until 2025,” DOTD Secretary Dr. Eric Kalivoda said. “By prioritizing the eligible projects that are ready and accelerating construction by borrowing through the TIFIA program against the BP settlement funding, the state has accelerated the project lettings by four years and saved approximately $75 million in inflation costs from a delayed construction start.” The U.S. Department of Transportation has closed $39.8 billion in TIFIA financing, supporting more than $136.1 billion in infrastructure investment across the country. Traffic tie-ups – some along the Intracoastal Waterway, others along Interstate 10 – often lead to bottlenecks that stretch several miles west of La. 415 and extend well past the I-10/I-12 split in Baton Rouge. The move would help speed up the transportation of goods along one of the most crucial stretches of Interstate 10, which extends from Los Angeles to Jacksonville, Fla. The project was included in a $700 million infrastructure bill Gov. John Bel Edwards signed in June 2019. As part of the legislation, the bill provides $125 million for a 2.7-mile connection from I-10 at La. 415 to La. 1 to an area near La. 988 (Beaulieu Lane) near the Intracoastal Waterway. The project will require elevated structures, including flyover ramps northbound from La. 1 to southbound La. 1, according to DOTD. The origins of an alternate route go back to 1972 when West Baton Rouge Parish government included it in the master plan, one year before completion of the stretch of I-10 between La. 415 and U.S. 167 (now I-49) in Lafayette. This new connector will assist in improving connectivity on I-10 in West Baton Rouge, as well as provide a relief route for local traffic during peak hours, divert traffic from accidents along La. 1, and provide a direct connection for commercial vehicles to facilities at the Port of Greater Baton Rouge. It also will serve as an additional evacuation route for areas south of I-10.'}]"

""It\'s not just a signature issue for me but for my constituents,"" McCormick said. ""I live in a rural district and my people like raffles and they like guns."" McCormick carried his concealed carry expansion bill each of his four years in the House, but it has stalled in the Senate. His said his bill would ""restore Second Amendment rights in Louisiana."" ""There\'s nothing more unjust than to make citizens pay for a right they already have,"" McCormick repeated this week. McCormick said he has raffled off guns in the past, each time raising thousands of dollars. The tickets are $10 for a $699.99 Sig P365 Macro pistol that is advertised as ""what a concealed carry pistol should be."" Supporters of McCormick\'s legislation refer to it as ""constitutional carry"" because they believe the Second Amendment already grants that right. ""With your help we will make Constitutional Carry the Law in 2024,"" McCormick said in his email to supporters. ""It puts law-abiding citizens on equal footing with criminals,"" Kelby Seanor of the National Rifle Association said during a hearing this summer on McCormick\'s bill. ""It removes the burden to exercise a constitutional right."" In advertising the raffle, McCormick says: ""The Second Amendment is my gun permit. Issue Date: 12/15/1791. Expiration date: none."" Louisiana is already an ""open carry"" state, which means people can carry visible firearms without a permit or training. Twenty-seven states already permit a form of concealed carry, including all of Louisiana\'s neighbors. Louisiana still requires permits and training to carry concealed guns. Fabian Blache with the Louisiana Chiefs of Police called the bill ""ill-conceived,"" and said it ""would pose a danger for the community and police officers."" But McCormick said expanding concealed carry ""won\'t turn Louisiana into the wild, wild West."" ""I\'m not scared of law-abiding citizens exercising their constitutional carry rights,"" McCormick said.

Chance of rain 60%.. Scattered showers and thunderstorms. Low near 70F. Winds S at 5 to 10 mph. Chance of rain 60%. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 4:00 pm Hammond City Council members may soon have the authority to oust a sitting police chief at will, including current Chief Edwin Bergeron, as early as spring 2024. Acting on a recommendation by Councilman Kip Andrews, the council on Tuesday night approved the introduction of an ordinance which would let voters decide if the council should be allowed to fire police chiefs. As proposed, the ordinance says “the police chief shall be subject to removal and termination by a majority vote of the City Council.” A majority includes three votes of the five-member council. A two-thirds vote, which is what Councilwoman Carlee Gonzales is advocating, would require a 4-1 vote. The current Hammond City Council’s decisions are often 3-2, with council members Sam DiVittorio, Devon Wells, and Andrews forming a bloc. If approved during the council’s Dec. 26 meeting, when a public hearing is scheduled prior to the regular meeting, the ordinance would go to a vote of the people possibly in March. “We have been having options on the table,” said Andrews, who introduced the ordinance. “We need to define how we are going to head in this process. I developed this option to be another option to discuss.” Andrews caught some by surprise, especially since recent council discussions have centered on voters deciding if the chief should be an elected position. Currently the city’s home rule charter calls for the mayor to appoint the chief. Bergeron was appointed by Mayor Pete Panepinto. “Nothing surprises me with the members that are on the city council right now, specifically (DiVittorio, Andrews and Wells),” Bergeron told the Daily Star Wednesday. “What is concerning is that (those three council members) seem to have missed their ninth grade civics class and do not understand the difference between the executive branch of government as compared to the legislative branch of government.” His concern is that a chief would come on board without a clear understanding of who his or her boss is. Bergeron said the chief would not work for the citizens but for the mayor and city council. “There are multiple people who could terminate you,” he said. “How would you know who to take the lead from? If there is an issue between the city council and the mayor, they can both fire you; what do you do? That is the scary thing.” DiVittorio told The Daily Star the issue boils down to accountability. He said an appointed position only has one governing body to answer to. “I think that’s good democracy,” he said. Regarding the simple majority vote, DiVittorio said he “feels good” on that point. “It gives more accountability to the city residents,” he said. ”The chief has to work for all of the people in the city. This is a great compromise and a great start.” The proposed ordinance raises several unanswered questions, one being if the council can fire other city personal, including department heads, in a similar way. Sources did say that each case would require a change of the home rule charter. When asked if he believes this has become personal, Bergeron, who is frequently criticized by Wells, DiVittorio, and Andrews, emphatically said, “Absolutely.” “Councilman Andrews claims it is not personal, but from the very beginning he wanted somebody else to be chief,” Bergeron said. “When that person did not get the job, it has been personal since that point.” DiVittorio said the proposal is not personal but rather something the charter review committee has previously discussed. He admitted the council has been lax in recent years regarding looking at and implementing some of the proposals of that committee. “This is nothing more than the woke ideology seeping its way into our Hammond city government,” Bergeron said. “If you don’t like what is going on, you change the rules and fire that person in position.” “I believe this is a continuation for almost five years of a hostile work environment set by (Andrews, Wells and DiVittorio) against myself and the department heads of the City of Hammond,” he added. “I will do everything I can to speak with all of the citizens of Hammond to get out the message of the intentions (of those three council members) of changing our society similar to the ones with a ‘cancel’ society.” In the process to be put on a ballot, the city must first pass the ordinance, which cannot be vetoed by Panepinto since it pertains to a potential home rule charter change. Next, it goes before the bond commission for its approval, required by the state constitution because it involves a change to the home rule charter. Finally, it will be submitted to the Louisiana Secretary of State for approval to be put on a ballot. Louisiana has elections scheduled in March and April in the spring, before the fall elections, which includes the presidential race. Log In Keep it Clean.

'Republican Louisiana Congressman Mike Johnson was elected speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday, ending three weeks of chaos in a leaderless chamber that has been closed for business since former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted by a small group of rogue GOP members. ""The people\'s House is back in business,"" Johnson said after the election. Johnson, 51, makes history as Louisiana\'s first speaker and gives the relatively small state the top two positions in the House with Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Metairie already in place. ""The challenge before us is great, but the time for action is now and I will not let you down,"" said Johnson, who is the 56th speaker of the House."" He was officially nominated on the floor by New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who described Johnson as ""a man of deep faith"" and a ""servant leader."" Stefanik said Johnson is ""a friend to all and an enemy to none."" Johnson secured unanimous support from Republicans on the floor with a 220-209 vote margin. All 209 Democrats voted for Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Democratic President Joe Biden congratulated Johnson on his election and said he will seek to work with Johnson ""in good faith on behalf of the American people"" to find common ground. Now Johnson faces the daunting task of uniting a fractured Republican Conference that holds a razor thin majority in the House. Johnson told USA Today Network he was up to the task in a recent interview. ""I have a vision,"" he said. ""I know how to build coalitions."" On Tuesday night, he said, ""Democracy is messy sometimes, but it is our system. This conference that you see, this House Republican majority, is united."" The three previous Republican Conference nominees - Scalise, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan and Minnesota Congressman Tom Emmer - went down in flames. Scalise and Emmer dropped out when they realized the votes weren\'t there, while Jordan forced two unsuccessful floor votes before the Republican Conference ushered him out of the race. Emmer secured the nomination Tuesday but was torpedoed in less than five hours by former President Donald Trump\'s Truth Social post calling him a Republican in name only (RINO). That left the door open for Johnson, who had finished second to Emmer Tuesday morning. Late Tuesday night, Johnson landed the nomination in dominant fashion. Johnson passed the Trump test as a member of the former president\'s inner circle during his time in office, when Johnson was a leader on Trump\'s impeachment defense team. Trump was impeached by the then Democratic-controlled House twice but was acquitted in the Senate. The four-term congressman also voted against certifying the 2020 election that Trump lost to President Joe Biden and was a leader in the unsuccessful lawsuits that followed challenging the election, which has proved to be valid on every front. On Wednesday, when Trump was asked about Johnson, the former president called him ""a tremendous congressman respected by everybody."" Johnson faces immediate urgent issues that have been stalled during the House\'s paralysis, chief among them aid packages to Israel and Ukraine and a looming government shutdown with a Nov. 17 deadline. He has expressed full support for Israel in its war with Hamas, but he voted against the most recent aid package to Ukraine and against a compromise bill last month that temporarily funded the government to avert a shutdown. Johnson, who served on the Armed Services and Judiciary committees, was already in leadership as vice chair of the Republican Conference. He represents Louisiana\'s 4th Congressional District with Shreveport-Bossier City as the population hub. Republican Louisiana Gov.-elect Jeff Landry congratulated Johnson immediately. “Congratulations to my friend Mike Johnson on becoming speaker of the House,"" Landry said in a statement. ""Mike is well-liked by everyone, and he has the work ethic and tenacity to lead our country in this prestigious position. Louisiana is proud.” More: Louisiana\'s Mike Johnson, candidate for speaker, was trusted member of Trump inner circle Greg Hilburn covers state politics for the USA TODAY Network of Louisiana.

campus in Baton Rouge, La. A former LSU professor has been accused of allegedly using a graduate assistant with whom he was reportedly having an affair to lobby the Louisiana Legislature to approve legislation targeting critical race theory. The professor denies the accusation, one that a university investigation has cleared him of wrongdoing. Charges from the Louisiana Ethics Administration allege David Sobek, a former political science professor, instructed a graduate assistant to investigate material in courses his “estranged wife” taught. The graduate assistant was allegedly told to look for anything that touches on critical race theory (CRT) and to distribute that information to legislators who might favor anti-CRT legislation. Critical race theory is an advanced academic subject that holds that race is socially constructed and examines how legal structures are used to oppress people of color. It is typically used in graduate programs. The term is used as a political rallying cry by some conservative politicians who target basic and accurate teaching of American history and slavery. In an interview with Sobek and an email statement from wife, who is also a professor at LSU, both said they are happily married. Sobek declined to comment when asked whether he had a relationship with the graduate assistant. Louisiana law prohibits state employees acting in their official capacity or on behalf of their agency from lobbying the legislature. Sobek denied the veracity of the ethics charges but said he intends to settle the case to put the situation behind him. Sobek, who was a tenured professor at LSU, was terminated by the university earlier this year. While the lobbying allegations came up during his termination process, a committee of faculty and administrators found them to be unsubstantiated and not the reason for his termination. LSU has declined to provide records related to its Title IX and human resources office investigations into Sobek’s conduct. The graduate assistant, who is not named in the complaint and the Illuminator has been unable to identify, was not acting on his orders, Sobek said. She contacted lawmakers of her own volition because of her own interest in critical race theory legislation, he added. Before she reached out to legislators, Sobek told the Illuminator he asked the graduate assistant not to contact him and only found out she had contacted legislators after the fact. Sobek said he also reported the student for harassment. LSU’s Title IX office, which handles such complaints, later contacted Sobek’s colleagues as part of an investigation into the harassment, but Sobek said nothing came of it. Records LSU released to the Illuminator in response to a public records request shed light on the unusual aspects of the allegations. An email from the graduate assistant to several members of the political science department alludes to a conspiracy to force her to participate in the lobbying, or else she and students in her courses would face “harm.” The grad assistant does not say what specific harm she feared, but described Sobek as “becoming angry” and used the word “harm” multiple times in the same email. “He (Sobek) was instructing all of this and telling me I was doing this work for his coalition with the Provost in connection with the Faculty Senate,” the graduate assistant’s email reads. Additional emails from political science faculty raise concerns about disturbing language in the graduate assistant’s repeated emails. “This last set of messages includes lurid details that have nothing to do with the purported purpose of her email,” political science department chair Robert Hogan wrote in an email to Title IX representatives. “[The email] contained disturbing language in which [name redacted] draws parallels between her present situation in our department and a play involving Greek mythology.” “In it, she discusses aspects of killing and death,” Hogan added. The emails indicate the graduate assistant made other claims about Sobek that were found to be untrue, including that he funneled additional payments to her for her work lobbying the legislature. Hogan’s investigation into the matter found Sobek could not have been and was not involved in the extra payments. They were actually the result of a clerical error, according to Hogan’s findings. “This is a pattern in many of [name redacted] claims, there is often some degree of truth in them, but they are accompanied by additional information that is far less credible or even false,” Hogan wrote. “She is already implicating the department administration as part of a conspiracy.” Hogan later raised concerns the university was not following procedures when investigating and reprimanding Sobek, a concern other faculty members have raised since June 2021 when the university implemented new procedures for terminating tenured professors. Sobek agreed his termination was mishandled but declined to go into details, maintaining his desire to move on from the situation. Sobek is no longer in a teaching position. Ethics charges are initiated by a complaint to the Louisiana State Ethics Board, which then conducts a confidential investigation. If sufficient evidence is found, charges are recommended that are then handled in an Ethics Adjudicatory Board hearing. The Board of Ethics recommended a fine of $10,000 against Sobek.

Jefferson Parish’s Planning Advisory Board (PAB) voted Thursday, Nov. 2 to approve explosives maker Dyno Nobel’s special permitted use request to construct a new boiler for its ammonia plant within the 800-acre Cornerstone Chemical Complex in Waggaman. The decision on the new boiler amendment had been postponed in both September and October’s Planning Advisory Board meetings before finally being approved in last week’s meeting. The special use permit amendment will now be placed before the Jefferson Parish Council for final approval on Dec. 6. The Cornerstone Chemical Complex sits immediately east of the St. Charles and Jefferson Parish line. The approval of the Jefferson Parish PAB zoning request did not come without controversy. Jefferson Parish officials acknowledged the special use construction permit was approved this past week, with the public knowledge that the boilers had already been constructed by Dyno Nobel earlier this year. Reports earlier this year surrounding Louisiana Department of Environmental Air Quality (LDEQ) air permits with the proposed boilers indicated use of the boilers could bring an expected increase in the facility’s current sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions by as much as 25 percent, which some local activists raised alarms over. Dyno Nobel was fined last month by the LDEQ after it was disclosed Dyno Nobel had already built a $27 million boiler at its Waggaman ammonia plant without the proper air permits. The fine LDEQ officials settled on, just $1,725, was considered by some Jefferson Parish area politicians and local environmental activists to be an understated response. “The penalty is not sufficient to discourage and prevent other applicants from building now and paying a small penalty later,” River Ridge resident Lisa Karlin, a member of the local Harahan/River Ridge Air Quality group, wrote in a letter to state regulators in response to the fine. Despite Dyno Nobel admitting to state regulators in a letter dated March 17 to prematurely building the boiler without proper air permits, Dyno Nobel nor LDEQ appeared to mention the boiler had already been built when regulators held a meeting on March 21 to gather public input on the proposed air permit. In a later statement, management at Dyno Nobel said the pre-mature construction was an oversight. A subsequent review conducted by LDEQ found no evidence Dyno Nobel attempted to conceal the violation. “Dyno Nobel regrets the oversight and has improved project management processes to ensure future LDEQ permitting experiences meet all requirements,” a Dyno Nobel spokesperson said in an official company statement reported last month. According to its website, Dyno Nobel is an international company with 32 manufacturing facilities on three continents. It markets itself as a global leader in the commercial explosives industry, and currently employs over 3,770 employees worldwide.

While Steve Moosa, the CPA from Darnell, Sikes and Fredericks, was reviewing the line items in next year’s city budget, Touchet voiced his opinion that the Mayor of Abbeville should be the highest-paid employee in the city. Currently, Mayor Roslyn White earns $79,000 a year, while Abbeville Police Chief Mike Hardy makes $85,000 yearly. Touchet felt that the Mayor deserved a raise, as some employees were already making more than her. However, certain steps need to be taken by the council before the Mayor’s salary is increased. They first need to introduce the pay raise proposal and then vote to change the yearly pay ordinance for a Mayor. The council must also approve the $11,000 pay raise. The council can vote to approve or deny her raise in January 2024. Mayor Roslyn White was taken aback by Touchet’s suggestion. She expressed her gratitude but stated that she had taken the job knowing what her salary would be. “I appreciate that,” said White. “Like I have said many times, I took the job knowing what I would make. I am willing to do the job for whatever I make. I do appreciate that.” 318 N.
