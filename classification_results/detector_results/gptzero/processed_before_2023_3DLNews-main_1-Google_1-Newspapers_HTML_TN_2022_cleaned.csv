In this article, we will explore the normal finance rate for a business line of credit, the factors that influence it, and considerations when choosing a credit option. The finance rate for a business line of credit can vary significantly based on several factors, including the financial health of the business, the creditworthiness of the borrower, and prevailing market conditions. Generally, finance rates for business lines of credit fall within a range, with rates commonly expressed as a percentage above the prime rate or as an annual percentage rate (APR). Prime Rate as a Benchmark: The prime rate is the interest rate banks charge their most creditworthy customers. Lenders often use the prime rate as a benchmark to determine the finance rate for business lines of credit. The finance rate is typically expressed as the prime rate plus a certain percentage. For example, if the prime rate is 4% and the finance rate is prime rate + 2%, the total finance rate would be 6%. Creditworthiness and Risk Assessment: The finance rate offered to a business can be influenced by its creditworthiness and risk assessment. Businesses with strong credit scores, stable financials, and a proven track record of timely payments are more likely to receive lower finance rates. On the other hand, businesses with lower credit scores or perceived higher risk may be offered higher finance rates to offset the lender’s risk. Market Conditions: The prevailing market conditions and interest rate environment also play a role in determining the finance rate for a business line of credit. In times of low-interest rates, finance rates for business lines of credit may be more competitive. Conversely, during periods of higher interest rates, finance rates may be higher. Type of Business Line of Credit: The type of business line of credit can also impact the finance rate. For instance, secured lines of credit backed by collateral may offer lower finance rates than unsecured lines of credit. Line of Credit Amount: The credit limit or amount offered by the lender can also affect the finance rate. Larger credit limits may come with more favorable finance rates. Consider a business line of credit if you need access to funds for short-term working capital, managing cash flow fluctuations, or taking advantage of time-sensitive opportunities. Evaluate the credit limit, finance rate, and terms different lenders offer to find the best fit for your business needs. No, business lines of credit can be available to both established businesses and startups. However, startups may face more stringent qualification requirements and higher finance rates due to their limited operating history. No, a business line of credit is specifically intended for business-related expenses. Mixing personal and business expenses can lead to accounting complications and legal issues. To improve your chances of securing a lower finance rate, improve your business’s creditworthiness by making timely payments, reducing outstanding debts, and maintaining a healthy financial profile. Additionally, compare offers from different lenders to find the most competitive rate. Yes, in some cases, it may be possible to negotiate the finance rate with the lender, especially if your business has a strong financial position and credit history. It’s worth discussing your financial standing and exploring if the lender can offer a more favorable rate. The normal finance rate for a business line of credit can vary depending on factors such as the prime rate, the creditworthiness of the business, prevailing market conditions, and the type of credit. To secure the best financing option, businesses should shop around, compare offers from different lenders, and carefully assess the terms and conditions of the line of credit. By understanding the finance rate and other considerations, businesses can make informed decisions that align with their financial goals and ensure smooth access to funds when needed. Remember to evaluate your business’s financial health and consider the credit limit and terms before finalizing the best business line of credit option for your specific needs. visibility_offDisable flashes titleMark headings settingsBackground Color zoom_outZoom out zoom_inZoom in remove_circle_outlineDecrease font add_circle_outlineIncrease font spellcheckReadable font brightness_highBright contrast brightness_lowDark contrast format_underlinedUnderline links font_downloadMark links Reset all optionscached'}]"

'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Hello, friends. I wanted to share some of the month\'s highlights from my weekly email subscriber-only newsletter called The Good News with Brad Schmitt. The newsletter is a wonderful collection of feel-good stories I find from the Nashville area. Below, you\'ll find a super-nice Metro Police officer, a Nashville woman who reunited with her long-lost birth mom from Greece, and a Nashville native NFL star who came back to hang with kids at his old high school. You can even check out a fun video above about a Dickson woman who babysits her neighbor\'s pet pig! It\'s fun, and it\'s a nice break from the heavy stories we often see in our social media and online news feeds. Check out these highlights. He got a call July 4 about a house alarm going off in the Green Hills area. When Metro Police Officer Sekou Samassi arrived, he discovered a 75-year-old widow sitting outside in a soaked shirt. The woman, Mary Catherine, was taking a break from cutting her grass. They both checked the house alarm, and there were no intruders or anything else wrong inside. Samassi started to leave but stopped when he saw the lawnmower sitting on the grass. ""Hey, sorry to bother you,"" he told Mary Catherine, ""but I\'d really like to cut the rest of your yard for you, if you don\'t mind. It\'d make me happy."" She resisted for a few moments, but then agreed to accept his offer. Mary Catherine was so moved that she took a picture of him cutting the grass and sent a thank-you email to the police chief. ""I am writing to let you know about my encounter with a Metro police officer yesterday. It was delightful,"" she wrote. ""His visit and concern on an otherwise lonely and bleak holiday was the highlight of my week. ... What a pleasant encounter with a Metro police officer this was. I thought you should know. He is a terrific ambassador for the police department."" Samassi, 31, a five-year veteran on the police department, said he was moved by the email. ""It kind of made me blush, actually,"" he said, laughing. ""But I loved doing it. The pleasure was all mine."" Hear directly from Samassi in this video The Tennessean posted. Since she was a little girl, Linda Carol Trotter knew she\'d been adopted from Greece. But Linda loved her adoptive parents so much, she didn\'t think a lot about her bio parents, and she never sought them out — until her adoptive parents died several years back. Then, in her late 50s, Linda said, she suddenly felt like an orphaned little girl. Even though she was married with an adult daughter, Linda said, ""I felt like I was all alone."" That started a wild, emotional search through papers, Facebook and Greek professors, all documented in a giant binder Linda labeled ""My Big Fat Greek Adoption."" Linda found her family in Greece — and discovered her biological mom was still alive and very much wanting to meet her long-lost daughter. They hugged and wept when the two reunited in June 2017 in a Greek airport. Since then, Linda has been back to her home country dozens of times, and she and her husband, who live in Franklin, bought a house in Greece. And Linda discovered there are thousands of Greek babies born in the 1950s and \'60s who, like her, were flown to the United States for adoption under questionable circumstances. She decided she would try to reunite other Greece-born Americans with their biological families. Linda formed a nonprofit called The Eftychia Project — Eftychia is the name her bio mom gave her at birth — to help adoptees find their Greek families. ""I found that joy and that peace from getting closure, getting that piece of my identity that was missing,"" Linda told me. ""I wanted everybody to feel that peace."" Linda and members of her small nonprofit board have helped 15 people reunite with their Greek families. Linda herself was there for two of those reunions, crying right along with long-lost children and parents. On the weekend of Aug. 4, The Eftychia Project is hosting a weekend in Franklin for any and all U.S. adoptees from Greece and their biological families. Linda thinks at least 50 adoptees will be there in the first gathering of this kind in the world. Events will include Greek dancing, Greek meals and a visit to the Parthenon. All to celebrate the feeling Linda had that first time she landed in Athens. ""Stepping on Greek soil and feeling an instant affinity for Greece and Greek people? Amazing,"" she said. ""I wanted everyone else to feel that way, too."" 5 worth the drive: The best restaurants about an hour away from Nashville Read this: Why this adoptive dad decided to go to law school NFL safety Ugo Amadi went back to his alma mater, Nashville\'s John Overton High School, July 17 to run a mini-camp for kids.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Jeremy Tate by Danny Wade Each year during the Strawberry Festival, the festival president always puts his or her own stamp on the week-long celebration. This year is no different. Strawberry Festival President Sherry Jo Smith is bringing back a position that has been inactive for over a decade—the honorary parade grand marshal. Smith proudly announces Jeremy Tate will be this year’s honorary grand marshal of the Grand Floats Parade. “The idea came about after the (Gibson County) Mass Band had just performed at the Rose Bowl Parade,” Smith said of how she came up with the plan to bring back the honorary position and selecting Tate. “He’s a Humboldtian and went to school here. I thought he would want to give back.” Tate had been Gibson County High Schools’ band director for the past several years. He spearheaded putting the Mass Band together in 2020 before covid hit. Tate sent an application to the Rose Bowl Parade Committee for the Mass Band to perform. He was so surprised when his email was returned and Gibson County’s Mass Band had sparked interest of being one of the 20 high school bands selected to participate in the Rose Bowl Parade. Then came the big news in 2020 that the Mass Band had been chosen to perform. But that year, the Strawberry Festival had to be canceled and eventually, so was the 2021 New Year’s Day parade. But things got better and the Strawberry Festival was on for 2021. Rose Bowl Parade President Bob Miller came to Humboldt to see the Gibson County Mass Band perform in person. With all the ups and downs over those two years, President Smith knew Tate had gone through a lot. She knew he was the perfect person to be honored. “Never in a million years would I have thought this would happen,” Tate said of being recognized as honorary parade grand marshal. “I’m not one for all the fanfare.” HONORARY PARADE MARSHAL – West Tennessee Strawberry Festival President Sherry Jo Smith (right) and General Chairman Shane Lynch (left) announced last week that Jeremy Tate (center) will be the honorary parade marshal this year. Tate was born and raised in Humboldt, graduated from HHS and last year served as lead band director of the Gibson County Mass Band. After Smith had made her decision, she contacted School Resource Officer Tosh and asked him to have Tate call her. Tate called Smith, thinking she was going to ask him if the Mass Band would perform at this year’s festival. But instead it was to ask if he would be willing to be the honorary grand marshal. Tate asked Smith about the responsibilities of being grand marshal, to which Smith replied, “Nothing.” Tate, not liking to be in the spotlight, had reservations. That was until Smith said he and his wife, Erika, and kids would be recognized during the Presidents Reception and they would ride in the parade. Having his two daughters, Katherine and Cassidy, riding in the parade sweetened the strawberry pot, so he accepted. “They already have their strawberry dresses,” Tate said with a smile for the excitement his daughters have for riding in the parade. “It’s all about the kids.” But before Smith asked Tate to be honorary grand marshal, she ran the idea by the actual parade marshal, Michael Longmire. Longmire thought it was a great idea. Tate was born and raised in Humboldt. He attended kindergarten at East End Elementary School, first through fourth grade at Main Street Elementary School, and fifth and sixth grade at Stigall with his assistant band director David Koeltz. When he moved up to Humboldt Jr. High School, Greg Stover was band director. When Tate finally reached high school, Koeltz was once again his band director. Tate graduated from Humboldt High School in 1999. While attending HHS, current Strawberry Festival General Chairman Shane Lynch was his high school geography teacher. Lynch joked, saying Tate still owes him a geography paper. Tate attended the University of Memphis on a full band scholarship, thanks to Koeltz. Tate had ambitions of being a neurosurgeon. That was until he got a job in the trauma center at The Med in Memphis when all of a sudden he did not want to be a neurosurgeon anymore. Tate switched his major to biology with a minor in music, graduating in 2004. Tate moved back home and got a job at Jackson-Madison County General Hospital. Then he found out Bethel University offered a 2-year music certification program. Bethel had just started up their band program. Tate was hired to be the assistant band director 2004-06. As a side job, Tate would assist with high school band camps. While helping out at Gibson County High School, B.O. Booth offered him the band director’s job, which he accepted. He held the band director position up until this school year when he took the position of consulting advisory teacher. He also teaches college level biology. He and Erika married in 2009, but they actually met in the band program at the University of Memphis. Tate laughed and said she wanted nothing to do with him at the time. Apparently that changed and the two have a wonderful family. They now make their home in Medina. “With all of his hard work and everything he’s gone through with the Mass Band, he’s come back to the community in more ways than one,” Smith said of her honorary marshal Tate. “To take on the Rose Bowl Parade, he gave back to not only Humboldt but the whole county.”'}]"

Occidental Petroleum (Oxy) filed a settlement agreement Tuesday with Santa Fe-based WildEarth Guardians (WEG), agreeing to spend $5.5 million to reduce emissions at its facilities, pay a $500,000 penalty and invest another $500,000 in local air quality projects. The settlement filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico stemmed from a November 2021 suit brought by WildEarth Guardians, alleging the company was in violation of the Clean Air Act at a natural gas compression facility and tank battery near Carlsbad. In that suit, WildEarth Guardians, citing its own research of alleged emissions events at Occidental's facilities, estimated the company could be liable for up to $350 million in penalties.

In signing the agreement, Occidental admitted no wrongdoing, a spokesperson said, but agreed to operational changes to limit both venting and flaring at facilities throughout the region. After it was agreed to by both parties, the settlement will be finalized when signed by a federal judge. More:$330M sale continues Oil and gas company's Permian Basin buying spree amid region's boom “We believe the facilities in question received appropriate permits, and as noted in the Consent Decree, Oxy has denied WEG's allegations,” said Occidental spokesperson Jennifer Brice. “As part of our agreement with WildEarth Guardians, we look forward to working with the communities in Southeast New Mexico on public health improvement projects.” She said the company intended to use new technologies to improve gas capture, replacing gas driven valves with lower-emission electric components, converting facilities to tankless operations and increasing leak detection. Brice said the company was already working to reduce emissions in response to recent regulations enacted by two New Mexico State agencies. More:Oil executives argue Permian Basin fossil fuel growth could be blocked by state policy The New Mexico Environment Department earlier this year enacted new rules to increase leak detection and repair and reporting requirement for emissions throughout the oil and gas supply chain, aiming to reduce the release of chemicals like volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are known to form cancer-causing, smog-inducing, ground-level ozone. That followed last year’s imposition of emission controls at the State’s Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, calling for operators throughout the state to cut emissions by 98 percent by 2026 while banning flaring except in emergencies. Meanwhile, the federal Environmental Protection Agency was considering designating the entire Permian Basin region, both in Texas and New Mexico, in violation of federal air quality standards which could slow permitting and reduce oil and gas drilling in the region. More:Oil and gas industry plans to defend itself against 'prohibitive' policy in New Mexico “Oxy is committed to responsible environmental performance and applying innovative technologies proactively to reduce flaring and emissions,” Brice said. “We also have a history of collaborating with environmental organizations that share a commitment to minimizing emissions and support the new methane and ozone rules in New Mexico.” Climate and Energy Program Director Jeremy Nichols with WildEarth Guardians said the State and EPA lacked the resources to fully enforce their own rules, but that the settlement should show oil and gas companies that they still must comply with environmental laws. The initial legal complaint was filed under a provision in the Clean Air Act that allows citizens to call for enforcement in federal court, a move Nichols said was needed amid what he called a lacking government response. More:Solar farm to power Chevron's oil and gas operations near Carlsbad to be complete by December “With this agreement, we hope to send a message to the oil and gas industry that just because the state of New Mexico or the EPA aren’t enforcing clean air laws, doesn’t mean you won’t be held accountable,” Nichols said. “While the New Mexico Environment Department or the EPA might turn their backs on illegal air pollution, that won’t prevent us from doing our job as advocates for clean air, public health, and a safe climate.” Attorney with WildEarth Guardians Daniel Timmons said the agreement addressed alleged violations but would also prevent Occidental from future air pollution events throughout its New Mexico operations. More:$1.6 billion in oil and gas assets sold in Permian Basin merger as market recovers As oil and gas operations continued to grow in the Permian Basin, which spans southeast New Mexico and West Texas, the region became the U.S.’ busiest oilfield producing about 5 million barrels a day – almost half of the nation’s total crude output of about 11 million barrels a day, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. “This is an extremely comprehensive agreement that doesn’t just resolve outstanding violations, it lays the groundwork to ensure Oxy doesn’t violate again,” Timmons said. “With air pollution plaguing the skies of the Permian Basin, this is critical progress for clean air.” Adrian Hedden can be reached at 575-628-5516, achedden@currentargus.com or @AdrianHedden on Twitter.""}]"

The park was meant to celebrate the growing diversity of UTC and the perserverance of the historically African American fraternities and sororities known as the Divine Nine. Friday, October 29, 2021. With the beginning of the semester already flying by, Chancellor Steven Angle speaks on the exciting developments that are happening on campus and his appreciation for UTC’s community. “A fun day [for me] is to walk across campus and see Chamberlain Field filled with students, enjoying themselves, playing frisbee and just enjoying being on campus,” Angle said. Coming off of a successful Welcome Week with some of the largest event attendances, Angle is hopeful that students will continue to take advantage of UTC’s upcoming events and resources. “We want [our students] to be involved and engaged,” Angle said. “So much of a college education is not just the classroom experience and what you learn, but the clubs, organizations and the projects you do. Do something for fun and do something that relates to a career. Whether it's research, being on The Echo or volunteering in the community.” With Homecoming and Founder’s Week activities right around the corner, students will have no shortage of events to attend. Angle hopes that students will feel “a little more of a push and then they'll meet people, get involved and engaged and that'll carry through the rest of the semester.” According to Angle, the 2022 freshman class is the second largest that the university has seen, just barely following behind the freshman class of 2019. “This new class of students is going to add so much and determine the personality of UTC and how we're viewed by our community and others and future students,” Angle said. From our new mocs flocking Finley to alumni returning for Homecoming, there are plenty of exciting opportunities coming up this semester. While reflecting on all things UTC, Angle said, “It's really an honor to be invited into students' lives to be a part of that. I do feel like what we do as a university, as faculty and staff, as alumni supporters, it really matters and makes a difference. It gives students the opportunity to find themselves, who they wanna be and where they want to go. We're trying to do the very best we can, and we sure are lucky to be in Chattanooga because what a great community and place to be.” Log In Keep it Clean.

But what happened? Everybody whispered. But nobody ever proved it. Editor's Note: This is an installment of Murders in the Heartland, a series delving into the history of nine homicides that have occurred in Scott County's history. The list isn't intended to be exhaustive, and these stories are not intended to reopen old wounds. In many cases, descendants of the victims or the perpetrators may still live in Scott County. These stories are written with an attempt to be mindful and respectful of them, while properly documenting the historical value of these famous incidents. This particular story recounts the 1872 death of Angeline Moore, the first murder in Scott County for which there is a solid historical record. – – – A widow woman, riding through the night on a pale grey horse, a teenage orphan girl on the saddle behind her. It sounds like the makings of a murder mystery … and that's exactly what it became. The widow's name: Keziah Thompson, a middle-aged woman who lived near what we now know as John Hall Flats on Huntsville Mountain. The teen's name: Angeline Moore, a 15-year-old Kentucky girl who was indentured to Thompson. The story began on Jan. 6, 1872, when a young girl's mutilated body was discovered in the Station Camp area of what is now the Big South Fork National River & Recreation Area. Her body was discovered on Huckleberry Ridge. That's roughly the area of present-day Big Island Road. Back then, it was along the Monticello Road, the mail route running from Huntsville to Monticello, Ky. and crossing the river at No Business. When the girl's body was discovered, a dog stood guard over it. “Her collar bone and one rib were broken,” wrote a reporter for the Knoxville Daily Chronicle. “The left eye was mashed in, apparently by a severe blow, and the entire body, most horribly mutilated, bore witness to refined cruelty, which is at once sickening and a burning shame to advanced civilization.” Another reporter, writing for the Alexandria Gazette in Virginia, gave a similar account: “One eye was mashed in, the collar bone dislocated, several ribs broken, and bruises innumerable bore evidence of the most inhuman treatment.” No one knew the girl, who was estimated to be 12 or 13 years old, so she was buried near Chimney Rocks, on the plot of land that would come to be known as Chimney Rocks Cemetery. As news spread of the mysterious and gruesome discovery at Huckleberry Ridge, it didn't take long for folks who mattered to put two-and-two together. In Huntsville, some 15 miles to the southeast by way of the Monticello Road, the 15-year-old indentured girl, Angeline Moore, had turned up missing. Suspicions arose, and a court order was issued for the body of the young girl found dead at Station Camp to be be exhumed. It was identified as Angeline Moore, and an inquest determined the manner of death to have been homicide. But what happened? That part of the mystery was never answered. The newspaper accounts of her battered body would lead one to believe that Angeline Moore had been badly beaten. That was never confirmed, however. As speculation swirled, someone stepped forward to report that they had seen the widow Thompson on her grey horse, riding at night along the Monticello Road near Pine Creek outside present-day Oneida — roughly halfway between her Huntsville home and where the body was discovered. Angeline was behind her on the horse, the witness said. As the story went, Angeline — who had been indentured to Thompson for two years — was no longer wanted at the home. Writing for the Scott County News many years later, A.C. Terry speculated that when Thompson was seen riding at night, it was to abandon Angeline in the remote forest near the river, believing that she would wander into the settlements at the bottom of the river gorge and be taken in by someone there. But The Daily Chronicle painted a different picture at the time of Angeline's death. The newspaper reported that she had been “driven” from Thompson's home by “harsh treatment, since which time she has been wandering through the mountains homeless, friendless, freezing and starving.” And the Alexandria Gazette told a still different story, writing that Angeline had been “subjected to severe and cruel punishment, so inhuman that she was not given necessary clothing and in consequence had her fingers and toes badly frozen.” The Virginia newspaper speculated that Thompson had killed Angeline and carried her body deep into the forest near the Big South Fork River in an effort to avert suspicion from herself. So who was Keziah Thompson, and was she the cruel killer that the newspapers depicted? In the 1860 census, a 34-year-old Kisiah Thompson lived in Huntsville with her husband, James, and their 13-year-old daughter, Sarrah. In the 1870 census, Thompson — now spelled Kessiah — still lived in Huntsville with Sarah. Their ages are listed as 42 and 21. James Thompson is no longer listed and is apparently deceased. Although certainly circumstantial, the names and details seem to fit. Newspapers at the time reported that both Thompson and her daughter — named by the Alexandria Gazette as Sallie Thompson — were indicted by a grand jury on charges of second degree murder. They were arrested, and held on a $10,000 bond. The Alexandria newspaper speculated that the only reason why Thompson was not lynched was because she was a woman — but it also pointed out that the only evidence that existed against the two women was “entirely circumstantial.” Keziah and Sallie Thompson stood trial, but a mistrial was declared, and they were never tried again. As for Angeline, her body was reinterred at Chimney Rocks, a simple but professional stone marking her grave. Nobody was ever convicted in connection with her death. Justice was never delivered for the poor teen girl found so badly beaten along the Monticello Road. Keziah Thompson disappeared from Scott County. What happened to her isn't clear, but by the 1880 census, she was no longer listed. With time, the old Monticello Road — which originally ran along Flat Creek, across present-day U.S. Hwy. 27 at High Point, then across Pine Creek and through present-day Coopertown to No Business — disappeared, as well. Today, you won't find Huckleberry Ridge on any topographical map.
