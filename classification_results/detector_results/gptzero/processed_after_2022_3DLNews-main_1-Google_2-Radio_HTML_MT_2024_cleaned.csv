The twelve-egg omelet breakfast at The Cracked Egg in Laurel is a doozy, and so far no one has been able to complete the monstrous meal. The cozy new restaurant at 7 1st Ave N in Laurel was bustling Saturday morning (2/10/24) when we stopped by to inquire about their fun food challenge. Laurel locals Janel and Mark Allison opened the restaurant on October 6th, 2023. The breakfast/lunch spot is open Tues - Sunday from 6 am to 3 pm and the majority of their entrees are made from scratch, utilizing locally sourced ingredients whenever possible. Janel took a break from her spot behind the busy counter to share that - as of today - 19 people have attempted the challenge, but none have won, adding that one person recently came this close to finishing. Twelve eggs might not sound like much. I can easily eat four or five eggs, and I'm in no way a competitive eater. But we're talking about a massive, one-dozen egg omelet filled with your choice of meat, one vegetable, and cheese. The thing probably weighs five pounds. And you have to finish a generous side of hashbrowns too. The huge breakfast is served on an oversized, 14-inch plate. Winners receive a hat or t-shirt and get their meal for free. There is a bonus prize for the first person to complete the challenge. For those with normal appetites, The Cracked Egg has a full breakfast and lunch menu. Stop by next time you're in Laurel and check it out. Gallery Credit: Madison Troyer Gallery Credit: Madison Troyer""}]"
