weeks ago 4 weeks ago 4 weeks ago Himika Akram reporter The visual symphony of strength and emotion is Ridley Scott’s Napoleon, an epic historical drama that chronicles the rise and fall of the French monarch. Featuring an enthralling portrayal by Joaquin Phoenix as the title character, the film transports audiences on an enthralling voyage through the amazing life of Napoleon, spanning his humble origins, his rapid rise to power, and his ultimate exile. Napoleon, who is shown against the background of the French Revolution, is a man whose ambition, insecurities, and love overwhelm him. With a raw intensity that is at once fascinating and unnerving, Phoenix personifies Napoleon’s intricacies. Rather than presenting him as a heroic or villain, the film shows him as a multi-faceted human being impacted by the turbulent era in which he resided. Just like the lead actor’s performance, the story of the film is riveting. The historical events that Scott skillfully interweaves—the military victories, political maneuverings, and turbulent personal life of Napoleon—make for an exciting and engaging read. Incredibly stunning are the film’s battle scenes, which realistically depict the mayhem and horror of war. About Joaquin Phoenix’s performance, he did complete justice to the character. The line where he says, “I found the crown of France laying in the gutter. And I put it on my own head,” was impressive, but several times, it seemed to me his performance was influenced by “Joker.” I am not sure if I am the one to have felt like that, however. The person who truly stands out as a performer was Vanessa Kirby. She was so convincing as Josephine that multiple times, I felt this should have been a movie on her life instead of Napoleon’s. Impressive cinematography by Dariusz Wolski makes Napoleon a visual treat, capturing the majesty and splendor of the French landscape and the lavishness of Napoleon’s court. Costume designers Janty Yates and David Crossman did an equally amazing job for the film, with elaborate ensembles that authentically and stylishly represent the period. I loved how the major fight scenes looked like paintings. The coronation was flawless as well. Napoleon delves into the themes of ambition, power, and the sacrifices that come with them. This film explores the shadowy side of Napoleon’s personality, showing how he was willing to resort to cruelty and ruthlessness to achieve his goals. Nevertheless, it reveals man’s charm, intellect, and ability to love. One of the best historical dramas of all time, Napoleon is entertaining and makes you think. Phoenix gives a riveting performance, Scott confidently directs, and the film looks breathtaking. After the last credits have rolled, Napoleon will still be fresh in your mind. It took 6 Empires, 23 Kingdoms, 7 European Wars, 156 Battles, 4 Coalitions, 25 years of war, 9 million soldiers, and 6 million dead to defeat Napoleon Bonaparte. One can easily imagine the level of magnitude of Napoleon’s life. I would say it is a must-watch due to its mesmerizing Joaquin Phoenix performance and breathtaking cinematography; the film manages to be both entertaining and intellectually stimulating. The early 2000s were a time of big-budget historical movies, and they were all magnificent and, to this day, remain classics, but I feel that, for a solid decade, that genre nearly came to a halt.

constante aux détails. L’un des aspects essentiels de cette gestion est la mise en place d’une base vie sur le chantier. La base vie, également appelée campement de chantier, joue un rôle crucial dans le bon déroulement des travaux de construction. Dans cet article, nous explorerons en détail l’importance de la base vie dans la gestion de chantier, en mettant en lumière ses multiples facettes. Sommaire La première et la plus évidente fonction de la base vie est de fournir un lieu de vie et de repos aux travailleurs du chantier. Les chantiers de construction sont souvent situés dans des endroits éloignés, loin des zones urbaines, et il est essentiel d’offrir aux travailleurs un endroit où ils peuvent se reposer, se restaurer et se détendre pendant leurs pauses. Un logement adéquat, des installations sanitaires, une salle à manger et des espaces de repos sont des éléments essentiels de la base vie. Offrir un environnement de vie confortable aux travailleurs contribue non seulement à leur bien-être, mais cela a également un impact positif sur leur productivité. Des travailleurs reposés et satisfaits sont plus susceptibles de travailler de manière efficace et en toute sécurité, ce qui est essentiel pour le bon déroulement du chantier. Une base vie bien organisée est également cruciale du point de vue logistique. C’est là que sont stockés les matériaux, les équipements et les fournitures nécessaires au chantier. La proximité des matériaux de construction permet de réduire les temps de déplacement et d’optimiser la gestion des ressources. Cela contribue à accélérer le rythme des travaux, à réduire les coûts et à minimiser les retards., la base vie est l’endroit où les équipes de gestion du chantier peuvent planifier et coordonner les différentes étapes du projet. Des réunions, des briefings et des sessions de formation peuvent y avoir lieu. Cela garantit que tous les membres de l’équipe sont informés des objectifs, des délais et des tâches à accomplir, ce qui favorise la cohésion et l’efficacité. La sécurité est une préoccupation majeure sur tout chantier de construction. La base vie joue un rôle essentiel dans la promotion de la sécurité. Elle est souvent équipée de postes de premiers secours, de kits d’extinction d’incendie et d’autres équipements de sécurité. En plus, elle offre un espace où les travailleurs peuvent recevoir des formations sur les protocoles de sécurité et les meilleures pratiques à suivre. La base vie est également le point de départ des procédures d’évacuation en cas d’urgence. Les plans d’évacuation et les points de rassemblement sont généralement établis à partir de cet endroit. En cas d’incident, la base vie devient le centre de coordination des secours et de la communication avec les autorités compétentes. La gestion d’un chantier de construction comporte également des responsabilités environnementales. Les bases vies modernes sont conçues pour minimiser leur impact sur l’environnement. Les installations sanitaires sont équipées de systèmes de traitement des eaux usées, de l’éclairage à faible consommation d’énergie est utilisé, et des procédures de tri des déchets sont mises en place. En outre, les bases vies peuvent être conçues pour intégrer des solutions durables, telles que des panneaux solaires pour l’alimentation électrique, des systèmes de chauffage et de refroidissement économes en énergie, et des jardins potagers pour fournir des produits frais aux travailleurs. Cette approche respectueuse de l’environnement contribue à l’image positive du projet et répond aux exigences légales en matière de développement durable. La base vie est également un lieu de communication cruciale sur le chantier. C’est là que les travailleurs peuvent accéder aux tableaux d’informations, aux annonces importantes et aux mises à jour sur le projet. Une communication efficace est essentielle pour maintenir l’harmonie et la coordination sur le chantier. De surcroît, la base vie est souvent le lieu de vie de travailleurs originaires de régions éloignées ou étrangères. Elle joue un rôle essentiel dans le maintien du moral de ces travailleurs en leur offrant un endroit où ils peuvent se détendre, socialiser et rester en contact avec leur famille et leurs proches. Le bien-être des travailleurs est une composante clé de la gestion de chantier, et la base vie y contribue de manière significative. Une base vie bien gérée contribue à réduire les coûts et les retards sur un chantier de construction. En offrant un lieu de vie adéquat aux travailleurs, elle contribue à maintenir leur productivité et à éviter les arrêts de travail dus à la fatigue ou au mécontentement. De plus, la gestion efficace des ressources logistiques depuis la base vie permet d’optimiser les coûts liés à la logistique et à l’approvisionnement. La base vie est également un point central pour la résolution rapide de problèmes et la coordination en cas d’incidents imprévus. Cela permet de minimiser les retards dus à des problèmes de coordination ou à des événements imprévus, tels que des pannes d’équipement. Enfin, la base vie a un impact sur l’image globale du chantier. Une base vie bien entretenue, propre et organisée reflète positivement sur le chantier de construction dans son ensemble. Elle montre le professionnalisme de l’équipe de gestion et l’attention portée au bien-être des travailleurs. Une base vie désorganisée ou négligée peut au contraire ternir l’image du chantier, ce qui peut avoir des conséquences négatives sur la perception du projet par les parties prenantes, les investisseurs et le public en général. C’est pourquoi la base vie doit être considérée comme une extension du chantier lui-même et gérée avec la même rigueur.

What many don’t know is that, according to owner Chuck Maltbie, Aah Spas is the only spa manufacturing facility in the state of Kansas. “Actually we are the only spa manufacturer within 700 miles of Kansas,” said Maltbie. “So what we do here is we actually take it from a flat sheet of acrylic and vacuform it, fiberglass it, drill it, build the cabinetry for it and make a complete spa.” They then sell those both direct from the factory as well as through a network of dealers. “Right now we have 14 dealers in seven states that we sell hot tubs to,” said Maltbie. He said that anyone in Marion County or Harvey County can come directly to the factory and buy a spa directly from there. “I mean we get folks from Sedgwick County. Anybody can come to the factory and get one,” said Maltbie. “We try to get those further away to go through dealers so we can help them better. But yeah, we service, we sell and we deliver from here at the factory as well. We do evening appointments and weekend appointments as well. So that way folks don’t have to take off work to come talk about hot tubs. The factory will do free factory tours to show step-by-step how they are built. Maltbie recommends it. “We offer a free factory tour so folks can call us up. We prefer to do it by appointment, just that way we got somebody that can explain stuff and walk people through it. We’re building every day. If we schedule it then that way we can make sure that give ’em our undivided attention,” said Maltbie. Maltbie said he is also proud of the fact that his company is the only small manufacturer in the United States right now that currently has a five-star Google rating. “Even the Hot Springs and jacuzzi and all of them, you know, the best that they have is a four to a 4.5. We also have a zero-complaint history with the Better Business Bureau. We won several awards for that. So we take kind of great pride in making sure that we take good care of our customers and that we put out a quality product,” said Maltbie. Aah Spas also support shopping local as much as possible. “We are a big pro-shop-Kansas, shop-local proponent. So when you support Ahh Spas, you’re not just supporting us, you’re supporting other businesses here in the community, because we buy all of our paint from Nicole down at the hardware store. We buy all of our lumber from over in McPherson. We also buy through Farhas. We just bought a $150 bucket of screws from the local lumber yard here,” said Maltbie. “All of our propane comes from the co-op. We buy all our fuel locally. We buy as much as we can locally. All of our sheeting that we use on the bottom of our tubs is manufactured for us in McPherson. We have a company in Emporia that does the injection molds of some of the parts that we use in our production. So anything that we can do to buy and support Kansas businesses is what we do.” Aah Spas also is a big part of the local Hillsboro Chamber of Commerce often sponsoring the local cruise nights and other activities such as Easter egg hunts and holiday events. “I tell folks that you can buy cheap stuff on Amazon, but you know, Amazon’s not gonna donate to your kid’s basketball team. He is not gonna cook, buy chocolate bars to support your swim team tryouts or whatever. So you can’t expect local businesses to support your causes and your adventures if you’re not supporting them,” said Maltbie. To learn more about the company or see how they make their hot tubs, you can check them out on YouTube. You can also reach them at 785-825-8888 or call or text Maltbie directly at 785-819-2215.

I hail from a small town in Kansas, and I know the importance of small-town newspapers covering local news to stay viable and relevant. I finished my reading by thoroughly taking in the classified section. Any reader of the Sept. 6 edition surely noticed the two large employment advertisements for Marion County, each two columns wide. One was for a custodian for the Marion County Courthouse complex; the other was for an administrative specialist to work with the Marion County clerk. Both are advertised as full-time positions. Did you read them? The irony of these two employment advertisements and the front page, above-the-fold article “Poor vetting can mean poor hires” is simply too much. The custodian advertisement states, “Background check and references required.” The administrative specialist position includes no such requirements. To be clear, by all outward appearances the courthouse complex janitor needs to clear more pre-employment hurdles than the City of Marion’s chief of police, Marion County ambulance director and, via the employment posting, the Marion County clerk’s administrative specialist. Is it a leap or merely a small step to conclude the Marion County clerk position must not require a background check or confirmed references? A monster leap forward for both the city and the county is simple and clear: background checks and reference checks for all, and every employment advertisement should states that. Every single one. It would appear the city’s recently passed budget includes money to cover what would be an obvious increase in employment costs. Do better. The world is watching now. Janet L.

State law prohibits such licenses being issued to applicants with felony drunken driving convictions or multiple alcohol-related convictions within a certain time frame. The same limits apply to any applicant’s spouse. The information received by Herbel and the Record listed conditions Newell would have to meet to have her license reinstated.

At the meeting, council members voted, with Herbel opposed, to endorse Newell’s request to the state for a license that would allow her to serve liquor at virtually any location, but not in the same location for more than a specified number of days. According to state records, Newell does not have a liquor license. Her restaurant, Chef’s Plate at Parlour 1886 in the Historic Elgin Hotel, was licensed under hotel owner Tammy Ensey. Newell took ownership Feb. 1. However, state law forbids transfer of liquor licenses because each owner must be subjected to separate background checks. Ensey’s license will expire later this month.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Meeting becomes shouting match By ERIC MEYER Staff writer What started out as a quiet, 15-minute Marion City Council meeting turned into a longer shouting match Monday night, so heated that one of a dozen spectators not involved in the discussion interjected, “Stop acting like children!” Tempers flared after resident Ryan Newell, speaking during a public comment section at the end of the meeting, accused Mayor David Mayfield and council members Zach Collett and Kevin Burkholder of violating the Kansas Open Meetings Act by discussing city business during an election results “watch” party Nov. 7. Typically, candidates welcome news media coverage of victory celebrations. However, mayor-elect Mike Powers, who organized the party, attended by a majority of council members, ejected a Record reporter, yelling: “Why are you here? You have no right to be here!” In an interview afterward with the Kansas City Star, Powers denied that he had yelled. He also characterized the party’s setting, Marion Country Club, as being more like a one-room school than an elitist venue. He said only that he had invited “friends” to watch election results. He did not indicate why he had chosen to invite Mayfield, whom he spent considerable words distancing himself from during a just-ended election campaign. Texts not turned over Monday night’s exchange began with Newell criticizing the city for its refusal, in apparent violation of state law, to turn over emails and texts about city business sent to and from city employees’ private accounts. “Are you going to start sharing your private emails now that it was ‘rules for thee but not for me’ when you were hounding on (vice mayor) Ruth Herbel about using her private email?” Newell asked city administrator Brogan Jones. Mayfield interceded: “I’m never answering any of your questions.” His voice raised, Newell shot back: “Oh, guess what. We got your answer right then and there. I guess we’re going to have to include this in the lawsuit under KOMA for the illegal meeting outside of the city limits that you hosted along with the mayor-elect, Mr. Powers. “Mr. Collett, I know you were there. Mr. Burkholder, I know you were there…. It was an illegal meeting because there was business being discussed. The city election is city business. And guess what: You had a quorum. And you kicked out the media from the quorum. “I’ve already contacted the attorney general…. That is an open meeting. I don’t care if it was private property or not and a private party. You had a quorum — illegal in the State of Kansas under the KOMA.” In addition to raising concerns under the Kansas Open Meetings Act, Newell pressed Jones under the Kansas Open Records Act about whether emails and texts from city employees’ private accounts had been turned over to the city’s insurance company lawyer, Jennifer Hill. Hill is redacting documents requested by citizens and the media related to Aug. 11 police raids on the office of the Marion County Record and the homes of Herbel and the newspaper’s owners. “Jennifer Hill is the person who decides what emails are released,” Mayfield said. But Newell countered that Hill had told him some records were not available because Jones, the official custodian of records, had not provided them to her. “Are we just going to have to get a subpoena?” Newell asked. Mayfield responded: “File with the attorney general’s office…. If you receive the information, we’ll be glad to give it to you.” “Awesome,” Newell responded. “OK, can I have your emails, sir?” “No, you’re not getting nothing from me,” Mayfield shot back. “You’re not going to give a f***ing—” Newell started to say before attempting to rephrase, without a swear word. “You watch your mouth,” Mayfield interrupted, “or you’ll be removed from this meeting. We have ladies in here, and they don’t need to hear that kind of stuff from you. You need to stop! You stop. You watch your language.” “Next time you say something,” Mayfield continued, motioning to interim police chief Zach Hudlin, “I want you to remove him from this meeting. You understand?” “I said one bad word,” Newell responded. “Way worse is what you’ve done.” Open meetings violation As tempers calmed a bit, Herbel noted that the Kansas Sunshine Coalition for Open Government had determined that the country club party violated KOMA. “Absolutely,” Newell said, “and so has the League of Municipalities.” Mayfield was incredulous that he was being accused of participating in an illegal meeting. “I didn’t hold anything,” he said. “What are you talking about? I didn’t hold a meeting about anything. I didn’t call a meeting to order. I didn’t call anything.” Newell responded: “You don’t have to. Under the KOMA law, as soon as one part of city business is discussed, that triggers the KOMA.” Mayfield objected: “You know everything that was said in that meeting, correct?” Newell said that as long as city business such as election results was being discussed and a quorum was present, the event was an illegal meeting. “You know what?” Mayfield responded. “File your complaint. We’re done. File your complaint.” Why texts are being sought Newell is the estranged spouse of restaurant owner Kari Newell. Police raids Aug. 11 focused on a document that her former friend, Pam Maag, had sent to the newspaper and to Herbel. The document revealed that Kari Newell had been driving illegally for a dozen years. Herbel notified Jones of the document, and the newspaper separately notified Police Chief Gideon Cody and Sheriff Jeff Soyez. For reasons still unclear, Cody regarded as a lie the newspaper’s statement that it had received the document from a source and later verified its authenticity through legal means. Cody assigned Hudlin to ask state officials who had accessed the document. According to released documents, Hudlin was unable to reach officials in charge and instead contacted a technical support person. The support person reported that a newspaper reporter had viewed the document, albeit two days after Maag already had sent it to Herbel and the newspaper. According to documents obtained under KORA, Cody immediately launched an investigation of the newspaper’s editor and Herbel. According to Kari Newell, he sought her out to tell her she had been a victim of a crime in which the newspaper obtained the document illegally, gave it to Herbel, and Herbel posted it on social media. None of those assertions were true. Documents reveal that he then conferred much more extensively than others have admitted with County Attorney Joel Ensey and agents of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation before obtaining warrants, later withdrawn, to conduct the Aug. 11 raids. Among the reasons citizens and media have been asking for messages exchanged via personal phones and private email accounts is that the first person to contact Kari Newell about her records having been obtained was council member Zach Collett. At a time at which only Cody and Soyez would have known that the newspaper had the same record that Herbel did, Collett informed Kari Newell that the newspaper was involved in what he wrongly characterized as an attempt to deny a liquor license for her catering business. How Collett became aware of this and whether he and Mayfield, who regarded both Herbel and the newspaper as opponents, might have influenced Cody’s investigation is unclear. Cody reportedly bragged to Newell about how he concealed his investigation using personal phones and private email accounts. He also allegedly told her to delete messages the two had exchanged lest they be misinterpreted as suggesting there was a relationship between them. Mayfield refused to suspend Cody until that allegation came out. Cody resigned four days later. Last modified Nov. 15, 2023'}]"

How the Lawrence Police Department (LPD) responds to 911 calls is about to undergo some changes. Lawrence is one of the several jurisdictions nationwide that will be researching and testing ways to respond to 911 calls that don’t involve sending armed law enforcement. Alternatives to armed law enforcement include sending social workers or other unarmed responders who have been trained to de-escalate situations without the use of violence. Callers may also be connected to community resources that can help with their citations. Lawrence and Douglas County have been chosen by the Harvard Kennedy School Government Performance Lab (GPL) alongside 14 other jurisdictions across the country. The different counties selected will share research with each other and will receive aid from the GPL. “Alternative teams have the potential to reduce overreliance on traditional law enforcement and emergency medical responders by instead dispatching professionals equipped with the tools necessary to resolve a crisis without creating unnecessary criminal justice system involvement,” according to the GPL website. “This can create more equitable outcomes for communities of color and others disproportionately impacted by the criminal justice system.” According to the GPL website, one of the new methods that will be tested is creating call decision trees that will be used to access what response a caller requires. Testing will be done on how to make these decision trees as effective as possible. The GPL will also help in training non-armed responders on how to peacefully de-escalate situations. “Many times, officers are called to situations where a crime is not necessarily occurring, rather a person is experiencing mental health issues or is in crisis because of substance abuse. Some, but certainly not all these calls, can be handled by behavioral health specialists”, Laura McCabe, the communications manager for the LPD, said. “Because a mental health crisis often also involves some element of criminal activity or danger, it’s very important to deploy the right responder at the right time for the right reasons to keep the community safe and keep the person in crisis safe,"" McCabe said. The desire for non-armed responses has increased in recent years, in large part due to public outcry against police brutality. Lawrence Police Chief Rich Lockhart said, “the people we serve are asking for new ways to respond to crises.” This year, the 14 different jurisdictions were selected from a pool of 40 applicants. The selection process was highly competitive. They were chosen based on their “vision and commitment to equitably improving community safety and wellbeing; support from local leaders; collaboration across government departments; and commitment to have alternative response teams respond directly to 911 calls,” according to an LPD press release. Lawrence Douglas County Fire Medical (LDCFM) will also be taking part in the research and testing, alongside LPD. No date has been announced yet for when these changes will be implemented.

The second part of this series will run in Thursday’s paper. No. 8: Emporia State placed on AAUP censure list Emporia State University was placed on the American Association of University Professors’ censure list in May, as the organization claimed it to be one of the worst run universities in the country. The AAUP’s governing council released an investigative report on May 1 which found the ESU administration and Kansas Board of Regents violated AAUP-recommended standards regarding tenure and academic freedom. The investigation was launched in Oct. 2022 following the university’s implementation of the “ESU Model” under the Framework for Workforce Management in Sept. 2022, which allowed the university to suspend, dismiss or terminate employees. The university said the framework was necessary based on factors such as low enrollment, cost of operations, reduction in revenues for specific departments or schools, among others. ESU subsequently terminated 33 tenured and tenure-track professors and staff members. “The AAUP’s investigative report on Emporia State University, published May 1, found that the ESU administration and the Kansas Board of Regents disregarded AAUP-recommended standards in terminating thirty tenured and tenure-track faculty members, thus violating the joint 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure and the Recommended Institutional Regulations on Academic Freedom and Tenure,” the AAUP said in May. “The report also found that the board’s enactment and reactivation of an emergency COVID-19-related policy allowed system institutions to disregard existing university regulations with respect to AAUP-supported principles and procedural standards. “The board’s action thus initiated a process that assaulted tenure and imperiled academic freedom at Emporia State University. The investigating committee concluded that the termination of faculty appointments, the ‘realignment’ of curricular programs, and the development and approval of the university’s ‘Framework for Workforce Management’ all occurred without meaningful faculty involvement, demonstrating ‘that conditions for academic governance at Emporia State are deficient.’” ESU media relations director Gwen Larson told The Gazette that the AAUP’s decision would not impact Emporia State’s plans for moving forward. “The AAUP is not a governing body for Emporia State University and their activities have no impact on our plans for the future,” Larson said. “Emporia State does not agree with the allegations for many reasons, not the least of which are the factual errors within the report. The university did not participate in the review because legal and personnel rules and regulations protect much of the information requested.” Larson reiterated that the university was moving ahead with the ESU Model. “Emporia State University continues to move forward with our plans to restructure and invest in the successful elevation of our academic programs,” she said. “Throughout this academic year, Emporia State has successfully attracted and hired talented faculty who join us in delivering an excellent education that serves today’s students.” No. 7: Lieurance named as suspect in Estrada, Ford murder investigation A week after their bodies were found in Kiowa County, Colorado, a suspect was identified in the murder of two Emporia women in September. An arrest warrant was issued for 36-year-old Phillip Lieurance in the murders of 44-year-old Linda Estrada and 39-year-old Amy Ford, both of Emporia. The Kiowa County Coroner’s Office announced it had identified the human remains located in Kiowa County as Estrada and Ford, after the women’s remains were located on Sept. 20. “This active homicide investigation is being conducted by the Kiowa County Sheriff’s Office with assistance from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation,” the CBI said in a written release in September. “An arrest warrant has been issued for a suspect in connection to this investigation: Phillip Lieurance (DOB 09/14/1987) is being held in Emporia, Kansas on unrelated charges. Because of the active nature of the investigation, no further information can be released at this time, but will be made available as details become available.” As previously reported by The Gazette, Lieurance is being held in jail after he reportedly struck another vehicle several times near the Emporia toll plaza on Sept. 10. According to the Kansas Highway Patrol, Lieurance is accused of intentionally striking another vehicle several times with his SUV just after 11:10 p.m. The vehicles then crashed and were disabled about five miles northeast of the Emporia toll gate. Five individuals from the same family were transported to Newman Regional Health for observation while Lieurance was also transported by a Lyon County deputy to the hospital before being booked into the Lyon County Detention Center. Lieurance is currently facing extradition proceedings. News and Online Editor Log In Keep it Clean. Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexually-oriented language.

multiple times that St. Luke Hospital (SLH) and Living Center CEO Jeremy Ensey is planning to open a pharmacy in Marion which would compete with Lanning Pharmacy, also located in Marion. “MCR said that St. Luke was starting a pharmacy which is absolutely not true,” Ensey said in an email to the Free Press. Ensey expressed frustration that his efforts to clear up the inaccuracies have been ignored by the Record and he is going on record regarding his side of the events. The following is his response: St. Luke Hospital would like to take this opportunity to correct some recent false or inaccurate public statements and reporting concerning SLH. First, SLH is aware of recent reports asserting that SLH will be opening a pharmacy in Marion. These reports are completely false. While SLH is committed to doing everything in its power to serve the health needs of the residents of its district, SLH is not pursuing opening its own pharmacy, and it has no plans to pursue opening a pharmacy in the future. Again, any claims that SLH is working to create a new pharmacy in Marion County are simply false. Second, there has been a variety of inaccurate statements and reporting regarding SLH’s responses to policies issued by Marion County Emergency Medical Services in August 2022 and then revised in December 2022. Shortly after the policy was first issued, SLH sent Marion County EMS a joint letter with Hillsboro Community Hospital responding to the policy and advising County EMS that the policy did not comply with applicable federal regulations. In that letter, the hospitals requested a meeting with County EMS to work to resolve the issues between the parties. The hospitals received no response from County EMS to that request, nor did SLH receive any response to its repeated additional requests for meetings with County EMS to resolve issues related to the policies in September 2022 and November 2022. Contrary to recent reporting, no meetings or discussions between County EMS and SLH or their attorneys occurred after the initial policies were issued in August 2022 until April 2023. There have also been reports regarding a particularly contentious meeting between County EMS and SLH that occurred in June 2022, prior to the issuance of the County EMS policy. To the best of SLH’s knowledge, no meeting between County EMS and SLH occurred in June 2022. There was a meeting between the parties that occurred in July 2022 that was unrelated to the policies issued in August, but at least from SLH’s perspective, that meeting went well, was not contentious and ended amicably, and was discussed with SLH’s board at its July 2022 meeting. Recent assertions about a combative June 2022 meeting between SLH and County EMS are baseless. SLH and County EMS finally did meet to discuss the policy in early April 2023. This meeting was also requested by SLH’s attorney, and again, it was the first meeting that occurred between SLH and County EMS since County EMS’s initial policy was issued in August 2022, despite SLH’s repeated requests for a meeting. The meeting was very civil and productive. At that meeting, County EMS acknowledged to SLH for the first time that it is not permitted to bill SLH for transfers from SLH to hospitals offering a higher level of care, as the hospitals had pointed out in their August 2022 joint response letter. County EMS also agreed at that meeting with the hospitals’ position that, in order for County EMS to bill SLH for any other services, a written agreement between the parties is necessary and that the fees charged for those services must be consistent with fair market value.
