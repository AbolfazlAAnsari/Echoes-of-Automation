The C-list celebrity cameos, the mid-2000s tolerance for slurs on national television ... it stuck out to me as an instantly captivating piece of programming; a cultural relic that should be studied rather than merely watched. Since I was introduced to the world of the Los Angeles celebrity ecosystem, it\'s all I\'ve been thinking about for weeks, trading quotes about Aquaman and Johnny Drama online between friends like its own currency of shared fixation. The show centers around five characters and their misadventures in Hollywood, but perhaps the most interesting of them all, to me at least, is Salvatore ""Turtle"" Assante. Turtle (played by Jerry Ferrara) is the definition of ""just some guy."" He\'s a personal assistant who plays video games and smokes a lot of weed; he wears basketball shorts, backwards fitted caps and jackets two sizes too big; and somehow, he gallivants around LA without a care as he courts women straight out of a Maxim spread. For these reasons and more, he\'s also my favorite character — it\'s the way he\'s a grade-A, bonafide schlub, but still with a boyish charm. From the moment he stepped on screen Turtle has captured my heart, immediately invoking a vibe that I have assigned to many things over the past few months: the elusive concept of t-boy swag. So what is t-boy swag? To those not familiar, it\'s hard to quantify. It\'s less bound by identifiable qualities and more of an overall vibe: the Tumblr aptly named ""people with tboy swag"" defines it by saying it\'s about ""having the swagger of a trans man. it is not hard to understand."" And, to me, it isn\'t! It\'s not about saying Turtle is transgender, but rather, the idea of Turtle deeply connecting to me, as a transmasc person. I\'ve spent a lot of time figuring out my gender by clinging to objects that embody the masculinity I yearn to emulate — I love the band Ween (massive t-boy swag from that duo), Harmony Korine movies and on most days, I dress like Turtle – and it\'s his presentation of gender that embodies a distinct and irreplaceable vibe that I wish to harness in my gender journey. The Big Dogs clothing brand, the one with T-shirts emblazoned with an anthropomorphic dog boasting slogans like ""if you grill it, they will come""? T-boy swag. Fozzie Bear, with his silly hat, scarf, and unrelenting bad comedy? T-boy swag. Even the recently deceased Meat Loaf, with his penchant for drama, frilled shirts, and always being sweaty? Reluctantly, he, too, has t-boy swag. It\'s in part, to me, about admiring the ideal image of accepted masculinity. Take Jackass, for example, a franchise that has lasted more than two decades and has been reanalyzed in several years as a manifestation of homoeroticism. Anchored by only cisgendered men (until Jackass Forever), the franchise is the pinnacle of what the culture has dictated to mean to be a man: destruction, stupid decisions, getting hit in the nuts, etc. But for me, when I watch Jackass, I don\'t feel excluded by this vision of male utopia — in fact, I feel euphoric, like I\'m in with the boys, welcome to partake in the masculine rituals of watching other boys get the wind knocked out of them. T-boy swag is meant as a loving expression of appropriation; a vibe check, if you will. Big Dogs has come to be known as a symbol for a (white) man\'s America, and Entourage has been studied as an example of the cultural crisis regarding toxic masculinity. But for me, who currently self-identifies as a nonbinary t-boy (and a Latinx one, at that), it resonates on a different level: it\'s an embodiment of a certain je ne sais quoi that is not rooted in the physical, nor in practice, but rather, in the recontextualising of certain masculine entities through a self-recognizing frame of mind. Reclaiming things and spaces where you feel as though you don\'t inherently belong is an essential part of the trans experience. Entourage, and all the other things I\'ve latched onto over the past few months, capture a similar feeling for me. As stupid as it seems, I identify with Johnny Knoxville\'s masculinity, as he playfully goads his friends into genital trauma, and Turtle\'s, in all of his Ecko Unlimited-wearing glory.

Singer Stephanie “Stevee” Wellons can trace her personal journey with music back to one defining moment: standing up in her crib and singing along with the jingle in a beer commercial. Or so she says. These days, Stevee sings in a group called Soulful Femme, along with her musical partner, guitarist Cheryl Rinovato. The pair have an undeniable swagger that shines on their “kiss-off” anthem, “Set You Free.” Wellons recently spoke about her musical life and Soulful Femme’s new song “Set You Free” with Morning Mix Host Joey Spehar. This conversation may be lightly edited for content, clarity, or length. What’s your musical history up to this point? My musical history began with a jingle of a beer commercial … I recall standing in my crib singing what I heard on the radio. The real journey began with my mother at the piano with myself and my siblings singing with her while she played. Music was always a staple in our household as well as academics. My dad had a wonderful baritone and would sing to us, too. As time went on, music was an essential part of my life as a kid growing up in the ’60s, ’70s, and into my adult life. How do you describe your sound? I describe my sound as “eclectically soulful.” I’m not a big proponent of being labeled. I have been privileged to have been able to perform many different genres of music and I incorporate them into my sound. Tell us more about the song “Set You Free.” What inspired you to write it? The song “Set You Free” was written by my friend and music partner, Cheryl Rinovato. I have first-hand knowledge as to the origin of this particular song. There were a few people who were quite toxic and very disruptive in both of our lives. So, these people had to be “cut-off” from our lives and they should never, ever, come knocking on our doors again … or else. What was the first album that really changed your life? The first album to change my life was “Are You Experienced” by Jimi Hendrix. Blew my mind and changed my life!! I was listening to a lot of Rhythm and Blues, which was great, however, that’s all that I knew at that time. When Jimi Hendrix came into my life, he opened my eyes and my ears to much more! The music world opened up for me right then and there! Can you talk about what it means to be a Black artist in Pittsburgh? Being a black artist in Pittsburgh has it challenges. We are often overlooked. I’ve been a part of many music events and have been the only person of color in the entire building. There are places in Pittsburgh that I won’t perform in because of racist club owners and there are places here that exclude people of color. Some want to be more inclusive but don’t know any “black bands” or “black artists.” Some are apprehensive about going to places to “check-out” musicians of color. There is nothing to fear folks, just sayin’. Any other super interesting things about you we should know? I am a proud mother of two wonderful sons and grandmother to two fabulous granddaughters. I love dancing. I miss the dance clubs and going to cabarets. I love salsa, Afro-Latin, Reggae, Soca, Ska and more I’ll get up and start dancing. Wooo! My body just has to move. I enjoy cooking .. .so relaxing and creative. I meditate a lot, too. I love to teach. I am adjunct professor at CCAC, as a vocal instructor for adults. There’s a lot more to me but so little time. Maybe next time. Learn more about Soulful Femme: WebsiteFacebook Check out previous Pittsburgh Artists of the Week here.'}]"
