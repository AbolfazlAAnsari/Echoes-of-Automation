Trump are asking Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows to disqualify herself from deciding whether the former president should appear on the presidential primary ballot. The attorneys argue that the Democrat is biased against the president and already decided that he engaged in an insurrection in social media posts. The late filing by Trump's legal team came as Bellows is preparing a decision that could make Maine the second state to attempt to remove the Republican from the ballot because of his role inciting the riots at the U.S. Capitol in 2021. Her decision could turn on an interpretation of a section of the 14th Amendment drafted after the Civil War that bars Confederate enlistees or sympathizers from seeking office. Trump's attorneys assert that Bellows has already prejudged Trump as an instigator in the storming of the Capitol and characterized the event as an insurrection, something they dispute. Bellows, who is playing a quasi-judicial role in the ballot access case, has not responded to the attorneys' claims. However she rules, her decision can be appealed. It will also be affected by an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the Colorado law court's ruling last week that Trump should be disqualified from that state's primary ballot. In a recently filed legal briefing, attorneys for the petitioners in the Maine case argued that Bellows is bound by the Colorado court’s ruling to disqualify Trump, citing a legal doctrine designed to prevent the relitigating of a case when another court has already done so. Trump’s attorneys counter that Bellows has no jurisdiction in the matter and that Maine law prevents her from removing the former president from the ballot. Their letter asking Bellows to remove herself from deciding the case centers on several social media posts around the time of the riots and the subsequent impeachment trial in Congress that, if successful, would have barred Trump from seeking office again. In one post Bellows described the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol as an insurrection and “an unlawful attempt to overthrow the results of a free and fair election.” She simultaneously applauded votes by U.S. Sens. Susan Collins, a Republican, and Angus King, an independent, to convict Trump for provoking the rioters with false claims of a stolen election. “Today 57 Senators including King & Collins found Trump guilty. That’s short of impeachment but nevertheless an indictment. The insurrectionists failed, and democracy prevailed,” she wrote on the social media site X, adding, “Not saying not disappointed. He should have been impeached. But history will not treat him or those who voted against impeachment kindly.” The Jan. 6 riots were commonly described as an insurrection, although now that term is central to the legal interpretation of a section of the 14th Amendment. It reads, “No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.” Trump supporters dispute that the former president engaged in insurrection as defined in the Constitution. The Colorado law court ruled that he did. Petitioners in more than a dozen states have launched similar challenges to Trump’s ballot access, although most of those are winding through the courts. The Maine case could end up in the courts as well, but state law outlines a process for the secretary of state to weigh challenges to candidates appearing on the primary ballot. Trump’s lawyers assert that the law limits the secretary of state’s role in the matter. _""}]"

From our interview with Gov. Janet Mills on the Lewiston shootings to the efforts to get Trump off the ballot, our political analysts weighed in on the top political stories of the week. NEWS CENTER Maine aired an exclusive on-camera interview with Gov. Mills this week on the Lewiston tragedy. She talked about everything from how the shootings impacted her personally to the ongoing investigation and guns. Zach Blanchard specifically asked Mills if Maine\'s yellow flag law failed. He also asked if she had changed her stance on strengthening gun laws. Mills said that ""everything"" was on the table and did not rule out a potential assault weapons ban. ETHAN: ""You know, when Connecticut happened, Sandy Hook happened, Governor Malloy, at that time, within four months had passed a broad range of legislation. We are now today, about two months after what happened and Janet Mills has proposed nothing. We already know what works. We know assault weapons bans work. We know that background checks work. We know red flag laws work. We know that waiting periods work. There is no more need for study. Over 40 people this year have been shot in mass shootings, not simply Lewiston. Remember, Westbrook, Yarmouth, 40 people shot. It\'s time for the governor to take a lead on this and propose serious legislation as soon as the new year starts."" RAY: ""Yeah, I\'m I\'m going to disagree with my friend Ethan on that. I\'m not certain that those things are going to work. I mean, we see this happen all over the country all the time. What I\'m hoping happens and I\'ve said this repeatedly to everybody on both sides of this, let\'s wait until former Chief Justice John Wathen has completed what he\'s doing. We need some answers. Why in the world was Mr. Card released from the mental health facility in New York? We still don\'t have clear answers on that. There\'s a whole lot of stuff. What we usually do in America is knee-jerk everything because it\'s politically advantageous. And this is going to be twice now on the same morning. I\'m glad the governor is taking a cautious approach here."" Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video Former President Donald Trump has been disqualified from Colorado\'s 2024 primary ballot by the state\'s Supreme Court. The court declared that Trump is ineligible for the White House under the U.S. Constitution\'s Insurrection Clause. This is the first time in U.S. history that Section three of the 14th Amendment has been used to disqualify a presidential candidate. RAY: ""I think it was terrible. What they did was a 4-3 decision in Colorado. What the Colorado Supreme Court essentially did is something we don\'t believe in in this country. They were judge, jury, and executioner, except the person they went after was never charged with a crime. I mean, Jack Smith, he\'d charge him with eating a ham sandwich, if he could get away with it."" ZACH: ""I want to be very transparent here. Ethan, you are behind the efforts here to get Trump off of the Maine ballot. The secretary of state is set to announce her decision next week. You really think this is going to happen?""ETHAN: ""Well, I don\'t know what Secretary Bellows is going to do. Obviously, the Colorado decision was monumental. They made the right decision. Look, everybody, you just have to look at it to know that he committed insurrection. And Ray, just to correct one point, he has now by two courts been found guilty of insurrection. Two courts have now said, yes, he committed insurrection."" Nikki Haley is gaining ground on Trump in New Hampshire. According to a new Saint Anselm College poll, Haley has doubled her support in the Granite State. The former U.N. ambassador, now sits at 30 percent support, up from 15 percent from September. Former President Trump remains the front runner with 44 percent support of Republican likely New Hampshire primary voters. ZACH: ""Ethan, we don\'t put a ton of weight in these polls these days, but if that\'s legit, this is a big deal, following her endorsement, of course, from Governor Sununu."" ETHAN: ""Yeah, look, it\'s a big deal in the sense that she\'s probably going to come in second in Iowa. I predict actually she will win New Hampshire, but then she\'s going to lose Nevada. She might do okay in South Carolina maybe. And then it\'s all going to fall apart. Right? This is the same kind of thing that John McCain might have had. You know, you have somebody who rises up like this and then, of course, everything falls apart. Donald Trump has the full support of the party, has all of the money, etc.. She just doesn\'t have the resources. New Hampshire likes to be quirky. We know that they like to sort of throw their weight behind somebody. They don\'t sometimes, and then that person often flames out in the end."" RAY: ""I mean, it\'s not surprising she\'s risen in the New Hampshire polls, Chris Sununu won with, I think, 68 percent of the vote, he\'s a very popular governor. They begged him to run again and he chose not to. We\'ll see. I said earlier this week, if she\'s within three or four points in New Hampshire on primary day, January 23rd, I think she gets some momentum. I think she\'ll get some money coming in. People say there might be a crack in Trump\'s wall. I think Trump\'s got the nomination barring something we don\'t know about. But the media likes to make this fun and this is going to make it fun.""

Wittington says the bus driver, James Jackson, was trapped and that pulling the bus from the fire was all they could do to help the situation. “We started to check the kids to make sure they weren’t too seriously injured and waited for help to get there,” Wittington said. “Those kids had a lot of guardian angels looking over them.” Wittington, who spent 40 years in law enforcement, commended Jackson for how he handled the situation. “He did a remarkable job of protecting those kids,” Wittington said.

The driver of the pickup, whose identity has not been confirmed by authorities, died of his injuries. “The ones you can’t save are the ones that bug you.

disqualifying former President Donald Trump from Maine’s primary ballot. Maine\'s Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows ruled the former president violated the constitution by inciting an insurrection on January 6, 2021, disqualifying him from future office. This ruling makes Maine the second state to disqualify former President Donald Trump from the ballot, following the decision from the Colorado Supreme Court, but it is the first time a secretary of state has made that decision. Bellows\' ruling came after a small group of Maine citizens filed a complaint to remove Trump from the primary ballot. “We cannot allow somebody who is in the highest office in the land to commit insurrection against our country to try and block the peaceful transfer of power and then be able to get back into that office,” said Former Portland Mayor Ethan Strimling, who was among those who filed the complaint. “That would be the worst and most dangerous precedent for us to set.” Strimling joined two former republican state representatives to file the complaint. They claim the former president’s role in the January 6 Capitol riot violated Section 3 of the 14th Amendment and disqualifies him from office. “We are going to continue to fight to make sure the constitution is upheld, and nobody is above the law,” said Strimling. Trump’s legal team presented their defense at Maine’s hearing two weeks ago. Then, the team argued Trump did not incite insurrection, and claim Bellows didn’t have the authority to disqualify a presidential candidate under the circumstances. “If the legislature had intended to delegate to the secretary the authority to add restrictions to this process they would have done so explicitly,” said Scott Gessler, Counsel to former President Donald Trump. Wednesday, Trump’s legal team unsuccessfully requested that Bellows recuse herself from this ruling, claiming she was biased against the former president, citing 3 statements on Bellows’ social media which refer to the former president’s second impeachment, and call January 6 an insurrection. ""We are witnessing, in real-time, the attempted theft of an election and the disenfranchisement of the American voter,"" said Trump Campaign spokesman Steven Cheung in a statement. Bellows responded to the recusal request in her ruling, writing that the motion was denied because it was not submitted on time. She went on to say even if it was submitted on time, she can preside without bias. Bellows says she did not make the decision lightly, and says it is her duty to ensure all candidates on Maine’s ballot are qualified for office. “The US Constitution does not tolerate an assault on our government, on the foundations of our government and Maine election law required me, indeed obligated me, to act,” said Bellows.
