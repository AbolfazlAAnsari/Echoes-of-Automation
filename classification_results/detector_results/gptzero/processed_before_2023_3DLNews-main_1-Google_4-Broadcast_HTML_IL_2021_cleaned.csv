January 2016 file photo, then-Illinois Speaker of the House Michael Madigan, D-Chicago, attends a joint session of the General Assembly at the state capitol in Springfield. Seth Perlman Edward Guerra Kodatt, who was handed a state legislative seat on Sunday, abruptly turned in his letter of resignation today after allegations emerged about unspecified “questionable conduct.” Former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan — who announced his resignation this month after holding the seat for a half century — plucked the little-known Kodatt from a constituent service office run by Madigan and Southwest Side Ald. Marty Quinn. Kodatt, 26, has worked on three Democratic legislative campaigns but has never held public office. He had been working as a budget assistant and performing bilingual outreach at the constituent service office. Madigan still has the power to pick his replacement. A committee led by Madigan will reconvene Thursday to make a selection from the remaining pool of candidates. [Chicago Tribune] Meanwhile, Madigan’s resignation as head of the Democratic Party has led to a messy political battle. U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly, state Sen. Cristina Castro and Chicago Ald. Michelle Harris are all in the mix to replace Madigan, who held the position since 1998. The Chicago Sun-Times’ Lynn Sweet looks at the behind-the-scenes drama. [Sun-Times] The Food and Drug Administration today said the one-shot coronavirus vaccine from Johnson & Johnson works well enough to protect recipients from severe illness or death from COVID-19. With demand for vaccines still far outpacing supply, the FDA could authorize the Johnson & Johnson shot as early as Saturday. Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech make the only other two vaccines currently approved in the U.S. But unlike the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, which require two shots and storage in freezers, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine provides a single-dose option that will also be easier to distribute because it only needs to be stored in a normal refrigerator. [New York Times] In Chicago, public health officials want to work with Rush University Medical Center to track COVID-19 variants. City officials say they don’t have the resources to conduct this research in-house because it requires a highly specialized test that isn’t widely available. [WBEZ] Meanwhile, the Biden administration announced today that it plans to send more than 25 million masks to community health centers, food pantries and soup kitchens across the country. [CNN] Embattled Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told a House panel today that the U.S. Postal Service might soon slow first-class mail and greatly reduce the use of air transportation. The agency plans to buy up to 165,000 delivery trucks over the next 10 years to replace its 30-year-old fleet. The cost: $482 million. The price tag has many lawmakers wondering how the post office can sustain itself as mail volume continues to decrease. DeJoy testified that the Postal Service conducted multiple studies in the past year in an effort to improve reliability and lower costs. Many Democrats want to oust DeJoy, but President Biden has limited control over the post office. That’s because DeJoy reports to the Postal Service’s governing board, a nine-member panel chosen by a bipartisan group in the Senate. [Washington Post] For the first time in years, the Chicago City Council is debating which banks should hold city funds. And some aldermen are using a pair of hearings this week to apply pressure to banks to improve their dismal mortgage lending records in Black and Latino neighborhoods. At any given time, Chicago has $400-$500 million in banks. The city currently uses large institutions — including Chase, Fifth Third, BMO Harris and PNC Bank — to collect payments, pay its bills and for operations such as payroll. But on Monday, aldermen refused to vote on an annual measure certifying 13 banks as “municipal depositories” that are approved to do business with the city.
