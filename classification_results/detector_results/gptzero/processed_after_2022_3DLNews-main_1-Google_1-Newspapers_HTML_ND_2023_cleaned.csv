Near the end of the meeting, Tim Wright of Wright Implement told city leaders that he had concerns about the city’s beautification committee. Hillsboro City Commission President Levi Reese, who serves on the beautification committee, contacted BNSF Railway in a series of emails earlier this spring asking for clarification about who owns and leases land in BNSF’s right of way in the city. Wright told city officials that he was contacted by a BNSF representative in Dallas who alleged that Wright Implement, which lies directly east of the railroad tracks on the corner of Caledonia Avenue and Highway 81, was storing equipment on railroad property without permission. BNSF Railway based its claims on outdated photographs, which appeared to be at least 3 years old, which were sent to the company by Reese, Wright said.

Kristi Noem’s personal life became very public over the weekend with salacious reports in London’s The Daily Mail and the New York Post . The stories suggest that South Dakota’s governor has been involved in a long-term extra-marital affair with Corey Lewandowski, a former campaign manager and current advisor for Donald Trump. Lewandowski also advises Noem and once served in an official capacity to the governor. The stories have circulated widely since publishing on Friday, Sept. 15. The revelations, the details of which have not been denied in the stories by the governor, rippled through political circles over the weekend. The story was first published online in the conservative-leaning Daily Mail, a London-based tabloid with one of the highest daily circulations in the U.K. The story includes a number of anonymous sources who say they witnessed Noem and Lewandowski together and detailed instances of the two traveling, often on private planes funded by donors, to political events around the country. ADVERTISEMENT The New York Post article referenced the Daily Mail's story and added five additional anonymous sources describing interactions between them at a hotel bar during the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, in 2021, as well as Trump's resort at Mar-a-Lago in 2020. Noem, a loyal Trump supporter who recently endorsed the former president’s bid to retake the White House at a rally in Rapid City, is often mentioned as a potential running mate. She’s also been a much-sought after speaker for candidates and causes across the country, raising her national profile with appearances on national news networks. Those national ambitions have rankled many Republicans, particularly those who aren’t all-in for Trump, the current front-runner for the presidential nomination in 2024. But the tabloid headlines in London and New York City have taken that behind-the-scenes criticism to a new level. South Dakotans are less concerned with the private lives of their leaders than they are the day-to-day challenges of getting by, said one long-time political adviser and GOP donor. “As South Dakotans, we pay for these distractions,” the donor said. “Young families in Sioux Falls have been priced out of buying a beginner home, counties are broke and property taxes across the state are skyrocketing. People are hanging on by a financial thread and distractions aren’t going to help them.” Noem’s communications director, Ian Fury, declined to speak on the matter when contacted by Sioux Falls Live on Friday. On the record, most Republicans in the state choose their words carefully. ADVERTISEMENT Senate President Lee Schoenbeck said he would be the last to know what Gov. Noem does in her personal life, that he attends no meetings with her and rarely talks with her. “I think extremely highly of her family,” Schoenbeck said. “[Her husband] Bryon Noem is as good a person you would ever want to have for a friend, and I like her kids a lot, but I don’t have any dealings with her.” Rep. Greg Jamison of Sioux Falls said Noem seems more focused on national issues rather than traveling the state talking to people about their challenges and potential solutions. “Those kinds of things always seem to come out about people who are a rising political star,” Jamison said. “The Kristi Noem that I know doesn’t match any of those descriptions or accounts, but Kristi and I don’t chit chat either.” Other lawmakers simply don’t believe it’s true. “Those stories are tabloid garbage,” said House Majority Leader Rep. Will Mortenson of Pierre. “I don’t believe them and am not paying attention to them.” Spencer Gosch, who was Speaker of the House in 2022, said if the relationship between Noem and Lewandowski is a rumor, it’s one that’s been going on for a long time. “I haven’t seen anything to corroborate it. I couldn’t even speculate to its truth or not,” said Gosch, who’s from Mobridge. “Of course you hear things but you hear a lot of things in politics. You let a lot of it roll off your back.” ADVERTISEMENT Gosch was defeated in a Republican primary for a seat in the Senate by a candidate endorsed by the governor. Lewandowski was not a public figure during his time in Pierre, Gosch said. “I wouldn’t be able to point Corey Lewandowski out of a room. I’ve never known much about the guy and I never really cared to.” Jamison, who serves on the tax committee, said soaring property taxes are the biggest challenge facing South Dakota right now. Keeping people on a fixed income in their homes, and not having them priced out by a property tax bill they can’t pay, needs to be the focus. “Somebody said to me recently, ‘Wouldn't it be nice to go back to the governor being boring?’” ADVERTISEMENT""}]"

Trust me. As someone whose job it is to write about what's happening in state an local government, there just aren't enough hours in the day for me to cover all the things I'd like to write or talk about. That being said, a new source for news in the state can't be a bad thing, right? The North Dakota Monitor is a new state-based iteration of a nonprofit news organization called the States Newsroom. They fund reporters in some 38 states who cover politics, courts, government and other matters. They don't charge for subscriptions, and they don't run ads. Donors fund their reporting. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Amy Dalrymple, the former editor of the Bismarck Tribune who is now heading up the Monitor, joined this episode of Plain Talk to discuss it. She answered questions about what her organization will be covering, and criticism the States Newsroom organization has taken from media watchdogs like NewsGuard over their nonprofit model. Also, on this episode, co-host Ben Hanson and I discuss the NDGOP's hiring of Andrew Nyhus to be its new executive director and the most recent court ruling about North Dakota's legislative map. District Court Judge Peter Welte is refusing to move a December 22 deadline for lawmakers to introduce a new map. Will the Legislature have to rush into their second special session of this year? Or will an appeal to the 8th Circuit, at the very least, move the deadline?

The album’s worth of songs that make up Christmas Mixtape don’t celebrate Christmas but merely acknowledge the emotional weight of the holiday season & its sometimes dreary realities. Over sparkling electric piano & warm electronic drones, Ashworth sings of lonely Midwesterners negotiating complicated family dynamics while trudging past storefront Christmas displays on their way to dead-end jobs. The songs are funny as often as they’re sad, but always full of the rich humanity that fans have come to expect from Ashworth’s bruised balladry. Every December, Owen Ashworth tours the Advance Base & Casiotone for the Painfully Alone Christmas Mixtape songs through different corners of the US and Canada. He performs his melancholic acknowledgements of Christmas to holiday lovers and haters alike. “As both Advance Base and Casiotone for the Painfully Alone, Ashworth has traversed America, carefully detailing the coldest Christmases imaginable ... It\'s all strangely comforting."" - Alex Robert Ross, Vice ""Listeners won’t find reindeer, glad tidings, or piping cups of hot cocoa in Ashworth’s lyrics. Rather, his songs follow aimless twentysomethings, lonely housewives, and troubled siblings as they trudge through the slush, undone by the weight of expectation and the hope for a better year ahead.

On the whole we are in a mood, probably, to expect more surprises and to expect that the results of the unforeseen may be more favorable to our economic life than unfavorable. Historically, North Dakotans have been inclined to be in that mood as a year ends, and sometimes with less justification for hope than we have now.” We do not know what will happen in the new year — 2024 — in our lives, in our communities, in our state, country and globally. But we enter the new year with an attitude of optimism. We enter the new year celebrating achievements, counting blessings, but also acknowledging perseverance through trials faced in the past 365 days. Another year is over, and we can start anew with the year ahead of us. For those who make New Year’s resolutions, those resolutions give time to ponder what we might want to change or do better, whether it’s living healthier, seeing family and friends more or something else in our lives.

I used the trip as an opportunity to see how Minot measured up. I wanted to see how we compared to other places. I didn’t have a lot of time, so my stops were brief. Most were maybe an hour – just enough time to walk around, take some pictures, grab a cup of coffee, and form a first impression. It’s hard to get an honest sense of a place by looking at its McDonalds, so I made the downtowns my focus. I stopped eighteen times: Dawson, Eufaula, Montgomery, Tupelo, Conway, Fort Smith, Ponca City, McPherson, Lindsborg, Salina, Concordia, Hastings, Aurora, Grand Island, Broken Bow, Valentine, Pierre, and Mobridge. So how did Minot measure up? Better than I expected. We’re doing pretty well. There are more places behind us than ahead, but the margins are slim, and we are definitely still in the pack. The places that are ahead are really ahead; they’ve separated themselves and are far in front. So what separates them? All I have as evidence is what I saw and some ideas, but here goes: pride, focus, and polish. Those aren’t tangible things, they’re values. But when those values are expressed through actions and investment, the results translate into outcomes that can be felt. I don’t know how else to put it, but you just know when you’re in a place that has its act together. I think we’re on the verge of that in Minot. If you haven’t been downtown in a while and looked at and felt what’s happening, do it. Get out and walk around. Is it a wildly thriving environment? Not yet. There’s plenty of room for progress. But the energy is there; it’s unmistakable. Both private and public investment have gotten us where we are. The question is what’s next? Will we keep our foot on the gas? Or will we lose focus? Are we proud enough to keep investing in ourselves, or will we trust the cynics who say we can’t, it’s impossible, or we’ll never ‘be’? We’re going to find out this Monday. City Council will take up wayfinding and welcome signs as a potential investment in ourselves. These items have been long-identified as part of our improvement plan going back to the International Economic Development Council’s recommendations to the City in 2018. But five years is a long time, and every year that passes makes it easier for elected and city officials to say we’ve done enough. From what I saw on my trip across the country, we still have work to do. And what happens if we skip the polishing? In my cynical moments, that’s what I expect we’ll do; we’re good at almost doing things well. But I hope my cynical side is wrong. Or if negativity about our past is justified, I hope we break the trend. Because from what I saw driving across the country, the places that really have it together didn’t skip the polishing. They were all proud of their place, and they were happy to have me there. I know that for sure because they had all built beautiful welcome signs to tell me so. If you’re like me and want to see Minot’s recent progress continue, it might make sense to reach out to the City Council and let them know.

Jasmine rides in the combine with her mom, Jen Meyer, at left, as Jen combines. Jasmine Meyer in the combine with her mom, Jen, watching James operate the grain cart, while Jen cuts corn. WILTON, N.D. – The Meyers finished soybean harvest thanks to a string of sunny, warm days without rain – perfect harvesting weather. Following soybeans, they started preparing their combine and header for corn harvest. “The weather has just been beautiful this week. It is a little chilly and it has been a little windy, but as far as mid-October, it’s beautiful,” said Jen Meyer, who farms with her husband, James, and daughter, Jasmine. “We finished our soybeans and that was just fun trying to get that finished. There were some little repairs on the combine. You are using your combine for as long as you can, and little stuff is going and breaking down on the last 50 acres.” After cutting their soybeans, they augered them into empty air bins. They air dried their beans from 15 percent moisture down to 12.5-13 percent, and it was easy to air dry in the warm temperatures. The Meyers were mostly pleased with their soybean results. “All in all, I was pretty happy with it. It could have been a little better in some spots, but the weed pressure just took over in a couple of spots,” Jen said, noting there were some wet spots last year that they couldn’t get rid of in the fall due to the early snow, so those spots had more weeds that were underneath the soil. The Meyers did not want to leave the soybeans in the field any longer than they had to. “The beans will dry down in the field, but if they get too mature and then they hit a hot day, they’ll actually bust open their pods and the beans will fly out,” she said. They started combining corn on Oct. 21. Jen had to change the combine header to the corn header. “We have some corn ready to go, but we’ve got a new corn header and we knew it was going to rain, so we just kind of went fast,” she said. “It is supposed to rain and we just figured we’d get a couple of acres off.” Later, Jen added that the rain held off until about 2 p.m., so they were able to combine about 80 acres of corn. The Meyers purchased another corn header just for the year. Starting next year, they will be switching to a 22-inch corn planter. “We have a 30-inch row corn planter right now, and James wants to switch to a 22-inch planter next spring, so we actually had to buy this header just for this year,” Jen said. “I really like this header. It’s a great header. I love it. I wish he wanted to stay on 30-inch rows.” The Meyers filled up the rest of their empty bins with corn. They didn’t want to move to another bin site, which was farther away in a different area entirely, so they decided to utilize the Brandt bag loader and bag the corn. “For all the work that it would take to move to a different bin site, we are bagging our corn,” she said. They will haul their corn to the ethanol plant in Falkirk, N.D. The custom silage chopper was not able to make it out to their farm, so they had to hire a different custom chopper. James helped pack the silage pile and he understands silage because he used to work for a dairy farmer in Minnesota when he was going to college for business and gunsmithing. “The silage chopper came and James had to help pack the silage tight into the pile, which wasn’t a big deal, but it just took him away from doing other things,” Jen said. “We were a little worried that it wasn’t going to be high enough moisture, but they said about 50 percent moisture, so that’s good. It was enough to ferment and it has to be packed pretty tight so it ferments.” Jen said the gunsmithing degree has really helped James on the farm because he has used the tools for that trade to make a lot of the pieces of the parts that they use in farm machinery on the farm. Once it rains, the Meyers planned to switch from cutting corn to hauling hay bales home. Their cow/calf pairs are out grazing, and once the corn is harvested, Jen hopes to set up electric fence and let them graze the corn aftermath. She said they will probably bring the pairs to a pasture where they can be fed this winter. They will wean the calves in November. “We have to take some pairs home before November, and the majority of the cows will stay in pasture until it snows, then we will drive them home and feed everyone here,” she said. For next spring, the Meyers plan to grow durum, soybeans and corn, and they would like to raise something that would harvest early. “We like doing durum and then we might put in pinto beans, depending on the price. I’d like to go back to an earlier-harvesting crop, so maybe canola or peas. We haven’t done peas in a long time, but I like peas,” she said. Now that Jen has been in agriculture for more than a decade, farming has gotten into her blood and she loves it. “It would be really hard for me not to be my own boss. I just enjoy farming. There are a lot of long, hard days, but then there are a lot of really easy days, too. I don’t get to do a lot of stuff with Jasmine during harvest, but then in January, February and March, I do have the time to spend with her,” she said. Jasmine decided to join the 4-H chapter in Wilton. The Meyers are going to be busy off the farm during the fall, as well. Jen is participating in the Burleigh County Farmers Union meeting and the North Dakota Cooperative meeting. Jen and James will also go to CHS annual meeting in December, as well as the North Dakota Farmer’s Union annual meeting. Jen also has a North Dakota Soybean Council meeting in December, and they will both go to the Commodity Classic. Jen thanks all the readers that followed along with their operation this summer.
