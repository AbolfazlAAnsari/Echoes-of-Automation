Far too often in movies, Indigenous stories are made that use the Indigenous characters as set dressing for a story about white people. It has happened for almost as long as film has been a medium and carries with it a history of settler colonialism, oppression, and genocide. Martin Scorsese’s latest film, Killers of The Flower Moon (KoTFM), reckons with both film history’s exploitation of Indigenous stories and one of the darkest events in twentieth-century America. KoTFM is a three-and-a-half-hour-long odyssey through the Osage County murders of the 1920s. Adapted from a true crime novel of the same name, the film is a masterwork that chronicles a conspiracy by a group of wealthy white landowners to murder members of the Native American Osage Nation for their money and stake in the oil business. The novel the film is based on is a fantastic book by David Grann that crafts an enthralling, tense, mystery while also being reverent and deeply empathetic to the Osage people. While the book does not reveal who is behind the murders until well into the story, the film opts to spend a large chunk of the film from the murderers’ perspectives. This could end up feeling gratuitous or exploitative but instead, it is handled perfectly. For as much as we follow the monsters behind the killings of over 60 people, we also are put in the perspective of the community that this atrocity affects. Scorsese himself realized partway through writing the film that he wasn’t telling the story of the Osage so he rewrote almost the entire thing to put their community, their culture, and their story at the forefront. This is mainly explored through Mollie Burkhart, an Osage woman whose family was at the center of the murders. She lost almost her entire familial line and was a living symbol of both the tragedy of what was done in this reign of terror; as well as a testament to the strength and resilience of the Osage. Lily Gladstone portrays Mollie in this film and she gives one of the most rapturous performances I have ever seen. Gladstone is not a flashy actor which is perfect because Mollie was not a flashy person. There are no monologues where she triumphantly displays her acting, this is not a conventional “important performance” that’s going to be talked about because it shows off the issues of our time. No. She is a woman. She is a mother. She goes through tremendous grief and fear and faces what seems like an impossibly bleak future. It all feels achingly human and it is a performance that will demand all of your attention simply because you can’t stop thinking about how real it all is. Gladstone left me in tears and she did so without ever feeling like she was a tokenized minority being made to play the tragic, noble negatively-viewed trope often made to portray Indigenous people. She is honest and incredible and there are really no words that do her performance justice. Mollie Burkhart is the soul of this movie and Gladstone is perfect as that soul. What is truly overwhelming about this film is not its runtime. What overwhelms me at least is that Gladstone’s performance exists in a veritable forest of career-defining performances. Leonardo DiCaprio is absolutely at peak form in this film. He plays Mollie Burkhart’s white husband Ernest with a magnetism that is awe-inspiring. As the movie goes on you wonder if he can keep getting better and he just keeps doing it. The complexity of his character reaches such a critical mass that you feel as though he has his own gravitational pull in every scene he inhabits. Meanwhile, Robert De Niro reminds everyone that he is, and always will be, one of the most stealthily adaptable actors to ever work in the business. He plays a character that I have never seen him tackle before and he does it with such masterful ease that it’s hard to think that it is even him. The late Robbie Robertson composed a score that perfectly matches the setting and tone of the film and really elevates an already immaculate movie. The very foundations of this story are bolstered on every side. Art direction and costume design emulates the end of the frontier era which gives everything a very authentic feel. The cinematography is positively gorgeous with the landscape of Oklahoma being shot with the same kind of reverence that is often given to places like France or New York. Martin Scorsese’s last film, The Irishman, was a deconstruction of his old form. It interrogated the world of mobsters and acted almost as Scorsese’s final farewell to a genre that he had iterated on more times than any other genre. With KoTFM, however, it seems that the 80-year-old filmmaker is trying to tell us that just because he’s done with mobsters doesn’t mean he isn’t done with filmmaking. To me Scorsese has never lost his touch, his last decade of work showing that if anything he has been able to continually find new ways to explore the art of film. The man is a true gift to the art form and this movie proves that as long as he is physically able to, Scorsese will just keep getting better. Go see this movie. It is a masterpiece of storytelling, it is a landmark in Indigenous representation and it truly is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The way the film immerses you in the Osage culture is fascinating. It directly refuses to be exploitative or safe or cliche because to do so would be to disrespect the group of people who are still feeling the effects of this atrocity to this day. So it is genuinely refreshing that the film refuses to sanitize the brutal and horrific actions done against Indigenous people for something as insignificant as greed. Still, one of the greatest strengths of the film is its refusal to make the Osage Nation into helpless victims. They were undoubtedly deeply disadvantaged by an unhelpful government and racist attitudes, and the film rightfully gives them the agency they both deserve and have. Through this lens of true representation, their story is told.'}]"

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Sunday, June 2, 2024 Serving the communities of Dassel, Cokato, Darwin, MN, and the surrounding area I have reached the time of life when friends from high school are starting to retire. Naturally, this kind of thing tends to make a person think. The ones who impressed me the most were the guys who knew what they wanted to do, even back at school. I never had a plan. I was an ignorant kid, and it took me years to get my head on straight. The most recent of these retirees is my old friend Ernie. We hung out quite a lot back in our school days, and he always knew he wanted to be a cop. He just retired after nearly four decades of dedicated service in law enforcement, most recently as a county sheriff. I remember Ernie as a really decent guy with a delightful sense of humor. He taught me a lot. Among the things I regret the most about those days are that I wasn’t more supportive of Ernie and others and that I never apologized for the stupid things I did. But I guess guys didn’t talk like that much back in high school, and anyway, I was too busy messing around and pretending to have no respect for anything. Some people gave the guys who knew what they wanted to do a bad time. How stupid is that? It is the refuge of the clueless to try to bring others down to their own level rather than build them up. I didn’t experience this directly since I didn’t have a plan, but from elementary school onward, I dealt with people who treated me with contempt and told me “not to use such big words.” I had a large vocabulary because I did a lot of reading, and I used the language I did, not to try to impress anyone but because it felt natural to me to use specific words rather than general ones. I’m infinitely impressed by people who had a plan and turned it into a career, especially those who served others through law enforcement or by inspiring young people through teaching. The best way I can think of to pay tribute to my friends who had a plan and stuck to it is to share their success stories with others and offer some advice to today’s students: don’t ever let anyone hold you back or distract you from your plan. Even if you change careers (and you might change multiple times), starting out with a plan puts you far ahead of anyone who doesn’t have a plan. You will reap the rewards when it really matters. And to my friends embarking on a well-earned retirement, I wish you all the best as you discover the many beautiful things life has to offer outside the workplace. Some of us had fun when we should have been studying or planning, but you are the ones who earned the last laugh. Well played, guys. Your email address will not be published.

And then, unpredictable by anyone in the Ukrainian family, his brute strength and deft coordination would make him an indelible icon for pre-modern football and wrestling. This farm boy would become the stuff of legends. It is often told that Bronko Nagurski was discovered by Minnesota Gopher coach Doc Spears while Bronko was plowing those farm fields — without a horse — and the coach asked in which direction the town was located. Bronko, as the story goes, silently aimed his plow at the distance. A lot has been written about Bronko Nagurski — including Jim Dent’s 2003 acclaimed book entitled “Monster of the Midway.” And apocryphal tales always surface in the recounting of the legend. But the accounts of Bronko’s unprecedented athletic ability, his heroic humility and his love of Borderland are just the clean and simple truth. Bronko Nagurski was born on Nov. 3, 1908, to Ukrainian immigrants Michael and Michelina in Rainy River, Ontario. He had two sisters, Stephanie and Eugenia and one brother, Marion. The patriarch worked the Rainy River railroads until he moved his family in 1912 to the farm in International Falls, where the promise of industrial expansion had been advertised by E.W. Backus. With the ethics of the old-country, there was little time for anything but work. Mike logged off his Van Lynn property and milled the lumber for his 240-acre farm as well as other construction in the area. His farm and animals provided commodities for the grocery market he opened, called Nagurski’s. The corner store was near the home at 400 Eighth Street in the Falls (which still stands) where the couple would eventually retire. These two from the Polish Ukraine could not have guessed that their shy, handsome son, who would own the farm himself until 1957, would become like Paul Bunyan — an American legend. He would make football history for “Papa” George Halas’ Chicago Bears while at the same time earn world titles in wrestling. He could have made movies, wrote books, made appearances; but instead he wed his hometown sweetheart Eileen Kane in 1936, to raise six children in the Falls. In birth order, they are: Bronko Jr. who was born on Christmas day 1937, Tony, Janice (Carlson), Ron, Eugenia (Jauma), and Kevin. Several of them spoke with The Daily Journal about Bronko the father, the man behind the legend. Son Bronko Jr. made his own claims in football as an All-Star playing nine seasons with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, as well as for Notre Dame in 1956-58. Living in the legend’s shadow was inevitable because he carried the same name, he said. The press could never get enough of his father. Although Bronko Sr. was a reticent man, he knew the art of skillful communication. Bronko Jr. remembers an instance at home after a Falls High football game in which he thought he’d played pretty well. However, his father noted a flaw. “My dad told me that I wasn’t balanced in one stance,” said Bronko, Jr. “But I was cocky and told him he was wrong.” To better make his point, the father had the son get back into position and asked if he was ready. In seconds, the sounds of the high-schooler crashing into French doors brought mother Eileen running from the other room. But it wasn’t all football at their house, according to Bronko’s middle child, Janice Carlson. Athletics was not a priority. “You better make sure your homework and your chores were done before you ran off to any games,” Janice said. While it is little known, Janice said that Bronko was actually credits shy of a degree at the University of Minnesota when pro football’s salary called him away. But playing in the depression and WWII era, before football was the lucrative sport that it became, put education back in front. “We knew from the cradle that we were going to college,” said Janice, who was endearingly called “Stupendous” by her father. Janice said the sons and daughters were treated the same in a home where discipline was strict and her father backed her mother 100 percent. “We were expected to cook, do dishes, shovel snow and share the work.” She said her father reflected an era of authority as well: “My father never argued our case. The teacher, the coach, the other child’s parent — was always right,” she said as she laughed. But he was the gentle giant, said youngest son Kevin Nagurski. “In spite of the way he played ball, I don’t think I even got spanked,” Kevin said. “That was his game face.” Kevin recognizes that family dynamics naturally changed as the athlete returned to a simpler pace, buying the hometown Pure Oil Service Station in 1960 at 217 Third Avenue. Kevin remembers pumping gas in a place where his dad was content. “My father traveled all over but he was never impressed with city life,” said Kevin. “That was work, wrestling was a job.” Though pro-wrestling in the 30s was more respectable, Bronko likely did it to supplement his salary. His father hated wrestling’s showy antics, according to Bronko Jr. “He shied away from the limelight and the notoriety that came with it,” he said. Sometimes, he was awestruck by his own fame, according to Kevin. “He was amazed to be flipping the coin at the 1984 Super Bowl,” Kevin said of Bronko’s last public appearance. “He gave a rare press conference for all the top reporters. They gave him a rare standing ovation.” But once, Bronko’s fellow football star Leo Nomellini of the San Francisco 49ers misjudged Bronko’s humility. Bronko Jr. explained that his father did a lot of traveling during his wrestling tenure but didn’t have a huge wardrobe. A box from Nomellini arrived one day with a note saying that the nice suit inside was worn a few times but would probably fit Bronko should he like to keep it. “Now, my Dad was ticked but he didn’t show it,” said Bronko Jr. Instead, he penned this reply to Nomellini: “Dear Leo: Thank you very much for the suit. But it doesn’t fit. It’s too small in the shoulders and too big in the ass.” It could have been the bonds of heritage; it could have been simplicity, but Bronko felt freedom in his hometown. Bronko would take his children and visit his aging parents every single day, according to Janice. “He would go upstairs and speak Ukrainian with his bedridden father. We would watch their television because our family’s house was one of the last to get one.” Bronko’s closest local friends were dentist Earl Milroy, Harold Kerry and Roy Manley. Hunting and fishing at a 1930s cabin on the lake and raising his family was really what he was all about, according to Kevin. The nation continued to remember Bronko in mythical proportions: the frontier football man with an untamed force on the field. Reporters came and went; some wrote that Bronko was reclusive, embarrassed about aging and preferring to be remembered as the sinewy, vigorous athlete. Shunning the cameras, he didn’t show for a Holiday Inn room dedication or a family event staged in his honor. Perhaps living up to the legend was a weary task for such a fundamental man. After his death, his life was honored by his city with the Bronko Nagurski Museum. The trophies, travels, images, artifacts and proclamations belie the soft-spoken older man who ran the gas station locally. Bronko lived out his final years at the local nursing home where he stopped signing autographs due to arthritic hands. Years of the cracking tumbles had taken their toll. He reportedly loved to sing his fraternity song. He died on Jan. 7, 1990, at the age of 81 and is buried in Forest Hill Cemetery in International Falls, the only place of all the places he’d been that he ever wanted to call “home.” Six children, 15 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren go forward connected to a name that carries phenomenal recognition. Bronko Jr. and wife Beverly hope young people will visit the museum to see the meaning of Bronko Nagurski. Janice says she generally hides from interviews. Like the father, all Bronko’s children are reluctant to boast. But there have been opportunities over the years to attend impressive events and meet extraordinary people. “We met a lot of old players,” said Bronko Jr. “I met Red Grange and I have a pair of Jack Dempsey autographed boxing gloves.” But their childhoods never really realized the extent of Bronko’s phenomenal fame. “He'}]"

The Musical” On Israel's “Right to Exist” and Other Myths Moo-ving towards a new mascot SRC to hear Mac for Palestine’s divestment proposal The first time I used artificial intelligence (AI) for something serious, I thought that all my problems were solved. I was working on my senior honors thesis, a data-heavy project that required me to go back and forth between ArcGIS Pro (a software for mapping and analyzing spatial data) and RStudio (a coding application for statistical analysis). As is typical for such projects, I frequently found myself stuck on accomplishing the next analytical steps. So I turned to ChatGPT-3.5, the popular and free AI chatbot run by startup OpenAI. For statistical research projects, I already spend plenty of time googling solutions to software challenges; why not use a Google that can talk back? For my first 10 minutes of ChatGPT usage, I was wowed. The AI knew both of my softwares well, and it not only had thorough answers to my questions, but could respond to clarifying questions and follow-up inquiries that were unique to my own project. Amazing, I figured. It should be much smoother sailing from here on out. After another five minutes, I realized that I had been led down a rabbit hole, and I was attempting to use an ArcGIS tool that did not perform how ChatGPT had promised. It had hallucinated functionalities of the tool which did not actually exist. “I apologize for any confusion earlier,” it told me when confronted. I learned a lesson: while artificial intelligence can be impressively powerful, thereis a real learning curve in figuring out its limitations and effectively using it. Though AI quickly displayed its limitations, I was far more taken aback by its potential benefits. Even if we confine ourselves to the realm of undergraduate coursework, the potential capabilities of AI seem head-spinning — more so than I think many of us realize. Take the results of an informal experiment recently run by Harvard student Maya Bodnick. For a blog post on the website Slow Boring, Bodnick had seven of her Harvard instructors, spanning across disciplines, grade typical writing assignments that Bodnick had sent to them. Bodnick told her professors that the submissions could be written by either Bodnick herself or AI, but actually used unedited output from ChatGPT-4 (the newer, paid version of the chatbot) for all seven essays. ChatGPT’s essays earned a 3.57 GPA, including three A grades. Bodnick did not edit or amend the essays, but simply passed on ChatGPT’s output. It was that easy. A couple months later, Brooklyn College professor of political science Corey Robin discussed a similar topic in The Chronicle of Higher Education. Robin described writing as an essential part of the learning process — a way of “ordering one’s world.” But when he saw the essays ChatGPT could write after a few iterative prompts and nudges, Robin came to believe that basically all of the essential value in the writing process could be replaced by AI-generated output. Robin resigned himself to assigning only in-class writing assignments instead of take-home essays. These examples only represent an extreme of AI uses, in which we directly substitute AI-generated output for our own work. There exists a far richer spectrum of beneficial, insightful or productive AI uses — again, even if we restrict ourselves only to the realm of undergraduate coursework. You could imagine many ways to make AI complement, instead of substitute, your own efforts. Take my earlier example of having ChatGPT help write code for statistical analysis on a large-scale research project: though it occasionally makes mistakes, AI will help me more smoothly pass over the countless little technical roadblocks of such projects. There are plenty of entirely different tasks — brainstorming research ideas, editing essays, summarizing a journal article — where AI could both meaningfully assist students and even expand coursework’s educational richness. At the level of policy, however, we are only in the most preliminary explorations with AI. AI is certainly going to be well-used by students, if that is not true already. Ensuring that it is used well, however, is a daunting task with no obvious pathway to implementation. At the institutional level, Macalester has remained mostly hands-off in establishing rules around AI use. Led by the DeWitt Wallace Library, a group of Macalester faculty and staff have created an extensive list of resources and guidelines for faculty.

Joe Keyport, WCMP reporter for the past five-plus years and a 2013 Pine City High School graduate, will be taking on the new role as an assignment editor for KARE 11 in the Twin Cities starting December 14. In this position, he will work with reporters and producers to gather and help assign stories, collect information, do research, and assist with logistics for the daily newscasts. “I’m excited to be working in a larger newsroom,” says Keyport. “Working as a lone reporter for the Q-Media (and later a news director for a tiny team) was a great way to learn my craft as a reporter, but I’m excited to be a part of a larger team.” He also quipped that he won’t have to attend meetings or stay at city hall until 9 p.m. But the departure for Keyport comes with mixed feelings. “Honestly, it’s a bittersweet feeling to be leaving Pine City,” says Keyport. “I didn’t have a desire to return to work here after graduating from college.

chain of resignations from the Goodhue Police Department, the Goodhue County Sheriff’s Office will be aiding with enforcement for the rest of the year. Police Chief Josh Smith resigned during the Aug. 9 City Council meeting. Following his resignation, another full-time officer and five part-time officers resigned, leaving Goodhue without a police force. According to a statement from the Goodhue County Sheriff's Office, “On Aug. 16 the city of Goodhue and the Goodhue County Sheriff’s Office met to discuss police services for the city of Goodhue. A tentative agreement, pending the city’s approval, was reached to provide police services through the end of 2023.” More discussions between the two agencies will be had for enforcement plans in 2024. “The City of Goodhue and the Goodhue County Sheriff's Office are working together to ensure no interruption of police service for the citizens of Goodhue,” the sheriff’s office stated. The issue has gained national attention with news outlets across the state and country reporting on the sudden resignations. State Rep. Pam Altendorf, a resident of Goodhue, released a statement on the issue. “Unfortunately, this is a story being blown completely out of proportion,” she said. “The real story is Minnesota’s police shortage, and that smaller towns - like Goodhue and its more limited tax base – are not able to match the large salaries and significant sign-on bonuses that bigger departments can offer.” Altendorf spoke about how this is not only an issue in Goodhue, but in many small towns across the state. “The recruitment of police is in high demand in Minnesota, and this is mainly due to the failed policies of the Walz administration and the degrading of our police officers,” she said in her statement. The Goodhue City Council held a special meeting on Aug. 14 to address the situation the city is currently facing. Mayor Ellen Anderson Buck assured the community during that meeting that there will still be a police presence in Goodhue. “I want to reiterate that we will have police coverage in the City of Goodhue, that is not an issue,” she said. During the special meeting, Ellen Anderson Buck mentioned that the city is working with the League of Minnesota Cities to address the issue. “We have to figure out what we can do now, the League of Minnesota Cities has been in contact with us. They are giving us some information on how to move this process,” she said. “They have worked with communities where this has happened before. They reassured us that we aren’t the first and we won’t be the last.” Ellen Anderson Buck spoke about the plans to potentially restructure and find ways to fill the positions. The Council brought up the fact that they plan to increase the pay for officers in the future to make them more marketable. “It can be done, but it is going to take some time and we can all anticipate that,” she said. Community members have mixed feelings about the current situation and the loss of the police force. “The current situation doesn’t scare me too much. We have a history of low crime, obviously we want to continue to have a police department, but for the meantime the sheriff’s office will be helping out,” Goodhue resident Taylor Buck (not related to Mayor Ellen Anderson Buck) said. His only worry is that, with the national attention the issue is getting, that people may come to Goodhue and take advantage of the situation. There are many suggestions on how the city can retain officers in the future and the discussion has to do with the pay the officers receive. “To help retain officers, it seems we may have to up their pay some, but as our police chief said, nobody is becoming an officer right now, which seems to be more of a societal issue than anything. And I don’t blame people for not wanting to be one, it is a tough and thankless job at times,” Taylor Buck said. “Fortunately for officers looking to come to Goodhue, they won’t have to deal with as much crime compared to other cities. Hopefully it all works out, but it doesn’t seem to be too big of a deal, I saw police in town today. The fact that this is national news is comical,” he added. Written By With all due respect, Rep.

Mounds View was runner-up behind Stillwater in the Suburban East Conference meet Thursday at Forest Lake. Mounds View placed sixth of 10 teams in the Suburban East Conference finale on Wednesday at Troy Burne in Hudson.

Mahtomedi will make a return trip to the state tournament after pulling out a 4-3 win over Mounds View in the Section 4AA finals on Tuesday.

New Ulm received nearly two inches of rain over the 24th and 25th, with temperatures in the lower 50’s. NEW ULM — New Ulm is littered with temporary ponds, as a downpour of rain and high temperatures made Christmas feel a lot like fall. National Weather Service Meteorologist Tyler Hasenstein said several independent observers marked the rain count at nearly two inches over the 24th and 25th. Near St. Cloud three inches of rain were recorded, which Hasenstein said is unheard of for this time of year. He said it was the result of a large system refusing to go away. “We had a gradual slow-moving system that parked itself just to our south and kept throwing rain in our direction,” Hasenstein said. “In previous years there would be some cold to decrease the moisture and bring some snow but this year we didn’t have that.” Not all of Minnesota missed out on a white Christmas. Hasenstein said portions of northern and western Minnesota were able to get and keep snow, with the furthest south being parts of Yellow Medicine County. For most of central and southern Minnesota, they had record-breaking temperatures instead. New Ulm made it to 52 degrees Christmas Eve, breaking the record of 45 set in 1936. The high was also 52 on Christmas but was one degree short of breaking the record of 53 set in 1922. Hasenstein said these conditions are very unusual. Temporary ponds, like this one in the River Bend Learning Center parking lot, have sprung up across New Ulm due to the rain and high temperatures received over the holidays. There is no snow in the upcoming forecast, and National Weather Service Meteorologist Tyler Hasenstein said any plans relying on it should be changed. “It isn’t entirely uncommon to see temperatures in the 50’s, but how long it has gone on is an anomaly,” he said. “Sometimes we would see this amount of precipitation, but that usually happens with a mix of rain and snow and over a longer period. This rainstorm happened all at once.” Hasenstein said the upcoming forecast shows no sign of a winter takeover. For the next week highs are expected to level off in the low 30’s with lows in the low 20’s. It is also expected to be much drier. Besides some flurries without accumulation, no snow is expected through the first week of January. This is good news for fans of no snowfall, but for those anxiously anticipating a winter wonderland, Hasenstein said it is bound to come. “At this point, you will have to be patient,” he said. “This is still Minnesota, we will get snow, we just have to wait.” Though ground temperatures are above freezing, Hasenstein said caution is still necessary while driving on the roads. He highlighted bridges and overpasses as areas to watch out for, as these road surfaces often freeze when cold air runs underneath them. For those still holding out on planned wintery excursions, Hasenstein advised coming up with alternatives.

lot of money is going into warehouses these days. At the very least, since the start of the pandemic, the industrial market has shot up while other assets have slowed. Many people have noted this trend, and among them is Colliers senior associate Peter Loehrer. Loehrer is part of the capital markets team at Colliers, working in office and industrial spaces. Loehrer said his role on the team as senior associate means he helps finish the deals that his team is facilitating and to market the deals when they are finished. This means he is trying to identify information and analyses that are useful to investors or potential buyers. Though every day is different, which Loehrer said he loves. Loehrer sat down for an interview with Finance & Commerce to discuss his work, what led him to Colliers and what advice he’d give to other younger people in the commercial real estate industry. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Q: Can you tell me where you went to school and what you majored in there? A: I went to school up in the north – at University of Minnesota-Duluth (Go Dogs!). At UMD, I chose to study economics. My reason for choosing economics was I had a really good econ teacher in my AP economics course in high school. It really set me on a good path, and they taught things in an interesting way. And so I wanted to continue my studies in economics in college. To extrapolate on that, my main goals when studying economics wasn’t to be any economist per se, more to be someone who understands the economy, money and banking, can think critically about what’s going on and apply economic concepts to their own life.

A: My two last summers in college, I had an internship with The Meritex Company, a Minneapolis-based family office investing company, primarily focused on industrial. It really helped me crystallize my interest in commercial real estate. I was with them for two years, after which I graduated and began working with the CBRE Research Department. I was with CBRE Research for just over two years. I was a support staff member on the investment sales team there, where primarily I was in charge of helping out with buyer databases — who’s the sellers, who’s the buyers? What kind of sales are going on? Cap rates, price per square foot, which buildings are going up…which ones are being torn down, those sorts of things. Q: So you joined Colliers in the pandemic or just before the pandemic started? A: It was towards the end of the serious “don’t leave your house” lockdown that I made the jump to Colliers. Q: What was it like to join to make a job change and to join a new company in the middle of the pandemic? A: It was a little uncertain — you didn’t know who the winners and losers were going to be coming out of the pandemic, so my mindset was “pick somebody with a proven track record with plenty of room for me to grow and just make a leap of faith.” I had heard of Mark Kolsrud (Colliers vice chair), I had heard of the Colliers team, and I had heard really good things about Colliers. I’d spoken to quite a few people that I respected, mentors of mine that also endorsed Colliers and endorsed the Mark Kolsrud team and brand. When it came down to it, it was really just trusting your gut. And that’s what I did. Q: Can you tell me a little bit about what your role is on the Capital Markets team? A: My role in the team is kind of two-handed. I’m responsible for sourcing and executing business. And I’m also responsible for helping create all our marketing efforts, marketing materials, and helping execute deals the rest of the team brings in as well. Q: Could you elaborate on what your day-to-day work looks like? A: First thing in the morning, get all my emails figured out. I like to work off an empty inbox. My morning goes on to … prospecting, calling investors, looking at information, finding sale comps, lease comps, and identifying who might be a good person to call on them. Who might find the information useful? Then my day might shift into what do we have in the market and who is the best buyer? Or who are the best buyers who need to know about this? The end of the day is typically more back-of-the-house work. Are we creating any offering memorandums? Is there any financial analysis that needs to be reviewed? Are there more products we’re working on, trying to get our name out there, trying to create more quarterly reports? That’s a typical day. But part of what attracted me to brokerages is that there isn’t a “day-to-day,” you kind of take each day as it comes. More often than not, I wake up and I have no idea what I’m going to do that day. Q: Are there any trends you’re hoping to maybe highlight about the industrial market? A: I would want to highlight the potential for explosive rent growth in Minneapolis next year. The limitation on our supply pipeline is hard to understate. We still have extremely low vacancies. We still have extremely low credit loss. We still have extremely high absorption. We have great leasing momentum all over the Twin Cities market. To have our supply cut in half, cut by a quarter… any impact of supply is going to go directly in direct growth. If anyone has any doubts about whether Minneapolis rent growth is going to continue in the future — it certainly will. Most investors buying property in the Twin Cities industrial market today are usually underwriting significant rent growth to justify the returns they need. Q: You’re a younger person. Do you have any advice for someone who’s on the younger side in the commercial real estate industry making their way through the industry? A: Find a spot where you’re going to be exposed to a lot of deals, a lot of transactions and actually be able to get your hands dirty. I heard on other podcasts that there’s an inverse relationship between the size of the deal and the experience you get out of it, which I think is absolutely true, especially in real estate. if you’re hunting for a shop that does $100 million deals only and you go in as a year-one analyst or a year-one associate, you’re going to get a small piece of experience from that deal, but you go into a shop that’s taken down $2 million to $10 million deals six to 10 times a year, you’re going to have a significantly better experience from the latter experience than you will at the big deal shop.

Each teacher in the school district contributed to the fund, and some participate in the Blackboard Review, a variety show fundraiser for the scholarship program. The association awarded seven scholarships in 1994. Pictured are recipients Erica Delak, Branden Stephan and Dale Plasek. Not pictured are recipients Jeannie Stumne, Nick Kirchberg, Kristy Reiser and Patrick Jarvis. Each has completed one year of college and will receive $300 toward their education. 10 Years Ago, 2009 A way of life comes to an end on Friday. The Pine City Mill, the last grain mill in Pine City, will shut down operations on Aug. 21 after running for longer than 85-year-old owner Ernie Broz can remember. He and his father Henry bought the mill together in 1948, but it had been around “way, way before that,” Broz said. The Pine City Mill has been losing money for several years, and Ernie and Randy made the decision to shut it down. “I’m going to miss coming here. I love to talk to the people,” Broz said. “You meet a lot of different kinds of people,” his son agreed. “Things could change,” he said. “If someone wants to take it over, I’ll let them have it for nothing, just to keep her going. I don’t need more money.” Lloyd Young of Pine City set the state record for 86-year-old men for the 5K at Saturday’s Mora half marathon with a time of 32.50. He came in 49th overall. 25 Years Ago, 1994 Three farms in Pine County are among the 242 recognized statewide as 1994 Minnesota Century Farms. The Edwin and Verna Nordstrom farm, Pine City, founded in 1894, the Albina Saumer farm, Pine City, founded in 1882 and the Robert and Kathleen Larson farm, Sturgeon Lake, founded in 1894, are this year’s Century Farms. To qualify, the farms must have been in continuous family ownership for at least 100 years and must be at least 50 acres in size. Soloist Gary Louden, Pine City, will represent Pine County at the Minnesota State Fair Talent Competition. Louden will sing “Tears in Heaven” to his own guitar accompaniment on Monday, Aug. 29. He is competing in the open division. A member of Our Redeemer Lutheran Church, Louden occasionally performs solos during services and has sung for some other local audiences. He works as a printer at Lee’s Pro Shop. 50 Years Ago, 1969 The Pine City Area Vocational-Technical School began its fourth year of operation with approximately 150 students enrolled. When it comes to profits, Pine City’s municipal liquor store in 1968 again compared exceptionally well with other liquor stores of similar size around the state. The liquor store had a net income of 21.6 percent of sales. 75 Years Ago, 1944 Civil Service has announced Government employment opportunities in the position of Custodial Office, $2,482 a year, including overtime, for duty with the Federal Correctional Institute, Sandstone, Minnesota. Another home has been saddened by the death of a son in service, Private First Class Vernon K. Nelson, U.S. Marine Corps, died of wounds received in action, according to a telegram which reached his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Sophus Nelson of Royalton Township last Wednesday morning from the U.S.M.C. commandant. Guy Hinshaw, living east of Pine City, entered the 15th annual Minnesota Gladiolus society show at the Northwestern National Bank, Minneapolis, and his “Vista Bonita” an orchid-shaded gladiola, topped 840 entries and was named grand champion by the judges. 100 Years Ago, 1919 The last legislature passed an act whereby the state is to pay the tuition of all returned servicemen who want to attend college. The amount of tuition that will be paid for each soldier is limited to $200. Work on the much discussed road to the Pokegama Lake Sanitarium is to be started at once, the work to be done by day labor at an estimated cost of a little over $8,000. 125 Years Ago, 1894 Quite a number of Pine City’s prominent people have been camping on the east shore of beautiful Pokegama for the past week. At a special school meeting on the 17th, it was decided to build a schoolhouse on what is known as Danielson’s Point near the Bartlette place on the bank of the lake. The contract will be let immediately and the first term of school will commence in October. Log In Keep it Clean. Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexually-oriented language.

Hunters For Hunters has scheduled public evening meetings for Dec. 6 in Carlton, Dec. 7 in Aurora, Dec. 8 in Coleraine, Dec. 29 in Detroit Lakes and Jan. 15 in Bagley to discuss predator management.

That’s not legally possible now as wolves are a federally protected species under the Endangered Species Act, placed there under court order after a judge ruled individual states were bungling the effort to manage the big canines. While no public hunting is allowed, about 200 wolves are trapped and killed by a federal agency each year in Minnesota near where pets and livestock are attacked. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources estimates about 2,691 wolves roam here, mostly in the northern half of the state, by far the most of any state outside Alaska. The agency says that’s about the same or even fewer wolves than in the early 2000s when northern Minnesota had record large deer herds and record deer harvests. Some hunters, however, say the DNR wolf population estimate is flawed, blaming predators and not deep-snow winters for the deer decline. ADVERTISEMENT Minnesota’s deer harvest during the firearms season was down 6% statewide this year from 2022. Hunters bagged more deer in the southeast and central regions of the state but shot 18% fewer deer in the northeast compared to 2022 and 57% fewer than 2017, a recent high mark. Under the support of the DNR and then-Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, Minnesota held wolf hunting and trapping seasons for three years, from 2012-2014, killing more than 900 wolves before a federal judge ordered the animal protected again. In January 2021, states again briefly regained control of wolf management, and Wisconsin held a mid-winter wolf hunt allowing tracking hounds and night-vision goggles. That hunt lasted only three days before state officials shut it down. Licensed hunters killed 216 wolves in that time, more than 80% over the intended quota of 119, and nearly 20% of the state's estimated 1,000-plus wolves. After the Wisconsin hunt, a federal judge again gave wolves in the Great Lakes region federal protections, and that court case remains unresolved. Efforts to act in Congress on the issue have not advanced. Fewer than 500,000 of Minnesota's 5.7 million residents hunt, about 9% of the population. The number of hunters in the state has declined over the past 20 years as the baby boomer generation ages out and fewer younger people take up hunting. Hunters For Hunters is seeking annual memberships of between $35 and $60. For more information on the group or the meetings, email info@hunters4hunters.org or go to hunters4.hunters.org .

One would think it would be fairly easy. But one would be wrong. First, I have to spend hours going through and listing all the major stories from each week. Next I group the items of the same topic together. Next, it is choosing which ones make the Top Ten List and then the final part is putting them in some sort of order, No. 1 down to No. 10. And every year, in this space, I tell all of you that the choice is very arbitrary, and you probably have a whole different order for them to go in. To be perfectly honest, I switch them around several times before I come to a final decision. Last year, for some reason or other, I felt we really didn’t have any standout Top Ten stories. I mean, ‘what to do about chickens and bees in the county’ was our No. 10 pick, for crying out loud. This year was a totally different story. I felt I had at least a dozen to 15 stories that qualified and maybe deserved to make the list. I cheated a little and combined two subjects into one, to pare down the list. An example of that is No. 6, about the Fossil Discovery Center leaving the library, and the Senior Citizen Center not moving. They could have been two separate stories, but they work as a combined one. Or so I think. Same goes for the new Wells city administrator and USC superintendent. An argument could certainly be made to have them as two separate picks, but I think they can work as one. Then there are the stories that did not make the list this year, and maybe they should have. Again, a very good argument can be made that they should be on the list, and I would not argue against it. So, here are some of the ‘also rans,’ stories that were maybe big enough, or important enough, to make the list, but didn’t for one reason or another. The first one is the story about a Blue Earth man being arrested and charged as part of the assault on the Nation’s Capitol Building in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021. Paul Orta Jr., of Blue Earth, was picked up by local Blue Earth Police in November, but there was a federal warrant for his arrest and he went into federal custody. To be honest, this story was on the Top Ten List for a while, but other stories were thought to be more important to the local area and county citizens. The second one that didn’t quite make it is the weather. The weather almost always makes the list, each and every year, except for last year and now this year. In fact, in 2018, the weather was our No. 1 story of the year. This year there was extreme cold last winter and lots of snow, and the summer had extreme heat (like during the County Fair) and serious drought conditions. It certainly could have been on the list, no denying it. But extreme weather conditions are almost becoming the norm. Disasters of another type also did not make the list. Last year’s 2022 Top Ten List had as No. 5 the fact that Faribault County saw an increase in tragic traffic accidents and house fires. That remained true for 2023, with the Register reporting on accidents or fires (some even deliberately set) almost every single week. Last year, our No. 1 story of 2022 had to do with a business boom in the county, with several new businesses opening up in several towns in the county. While that trend has slowed a bit, it still seems to be going on. The story did not only not get No. 1 status this year, it did not even crack the Top Ten. Neither did our No. 1 story in 2021 and 2020, and for that we should all be grateful. Because, if you remember, our top story in both 2020 and 2021 was the same – the COVID-19 Pandemic having a big impact on our county, the state and the nation. There is another story that has been on the Top Ten List many, many times in the past, including making it up as high as No. 2 in 2018. But this year it did not even crack the honorable mention list. In fact, it never even was a consideration. Can you guess what story topic that is? You are correct. The Saga of the Three Sisters buildings in Blue Earth was not even given a thought this year. However, there is always next year. We hope everyone has a great year in 2024. Maybe there will be only good news here in Faribault County, and maybe in the state of Minnesota, the whole United States and even around the entire world. We need a little break from all the bad news, that is for sure. Another thunderstorm is rumbling its way through the area as I write this column early Friday morning. It’s ...

Daily Newsletter | MinnPost\'s top stories delivered to your inbox Monday through Saturday. 2023 brought a flurry of activity in the Minnesota Legislature with a “bonkers” session as well as chaos in Washington, D.C., involving Minnesota’s own Tom Emmer, but the story this year for MinnPost readers was marijuana. From where you can and cannot use marijuana to how you can grow it at home, the legalization of marijuana ignited the interest of Minnesota as the state continues to work out how the new law will be implemented and who will become the first director of the Office of Cannabis Management after the first pick withdrew. But marijuana wasn’t the only thing readers were interested in this year. Here’s a look back on the 10 most read stories from 2023. The 2023 legislative session was called the most successful by DFL Gov. Tim Walz. It was certainly productive with the DFL trifecta checking off everything on their lengthy to-do list. Peter Callaghan and Walker Orenstein wrote an extensive breakdown of the laws passed including legalizing recreational marijuana, codifying abortion rights, paid family and sick leave, restoring voting rights for people released from jail or prison, and so much more. The session, called “transformational” by some and “bonkers” by others, caught national attention, including former President Barack Obama, who wrote, “If you need a reminder that elections have consequences, check out what’s happening in Minnesota.” Once the bill was signed into law, the big question for Minnesotans was simple: Where and when can I smoke marijuana? The law legalized recreational use across the state but left it up to local governments and municipalities to create their own ordinances regulating its use. So while public use of marijuana was made legal, a city could choose to limit where in public marijuana use was allowed. And many have. Sen. Jordan Rasmusson, R-Fergus Falls, told MinnPost public use of marijuana will likely be a focus of the 2024 session. Minnesota this month selected a new state flag but the process to do so started earlier this year when the Legislature passed a bill to replace the state flag and seal by Jan. 1, 2024. The current flag has been described as “problematic” and “a cluttered genocidal mess” due to its depiction of a Native American riding on a horseback in the distance. Peter Callaghan writes, “While the pre-statehood-designed seal and flag might be subject to interpretation, a poem written by the wife of the designer says this about the image: ‘We claim his noble heritage/And Minnesota’s land/Must pass with all its untold wealth/To the white man’s grasping hand.’ “ Fall in Washington, D.C., was chaotic as Congress struggled to pass a spending bill. Infighting among Republicans and talks of ousting Rep. Kevin McCarthy as House speaker created a looming threat of the government shutting down in October. For Minnesota, that would have meant immediate impact to Social Security and Medicare, obstacles for companies with federal contracts, and furloughed workers. In March, Lindsay Whalen was fired as head coach of the University of Minnesota women’s basketball team after the Gophers lost to Penn State in the first round of the Big Ten Tournament. Whalen’s absence from the press conference where her departure was announced drew attention to whether the decision was mutual or not. Pat Borzi took a look back on Whalen’s time with the Gophs and the emotional day. As Minnesota geared up for Aug. 1 when recreational marijuana and home grow would become legal, one question stood out: How can one obtain seeds in Minnesota when marijuana remains illegal federally? Canada and Michigan were possibilities but one local expert said people would likely turn to the “legacy market” if they didn’t want to wait for the legal market to be set up in Minnesota. “If we’re talking about the everyman, people have been waiting for cannabis to be legal for a very long time,” Bryant Jones said. “The everyperson will probably be searching their bags for seeds they have already, or with people in their immediate circle.” As lawmakers worked to legalize recreational marijuana, they had to focus on the existing hemp edible market as they were worried the new law would hurt their businesses. Initial drafts of the legislation created by lobbyists and lawmakers lacked certain terminology and clarifications and large revisions were needed to to address concerns from industry experts. A wall beneath St. Anthony Falls supporting the structure known as the “orphan hazard” is everyone and no one’s problem. During the 2023 legislative session, money was put aside for the University of Minnesota to study the state of the wall and the extent to which it poses a hazard for the Mississippi River. If something happened to the wall the possibilities could include a new path for the river, dropping water levels or disruption to the region’s water supply. But little is known about the wall built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Early in the year, Peter Callaghan took a look at the 243-page bill looking to legalize recreational marijuana introduced by Rep. Zack Stephenson. “It would make Minnesota the 22nd state to go down this path since the first ones acted a decade ago.” In May, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey gave the State of the City address. Frey addressed crime, police reform, housing and, as Kyle Stokes wrote, “invented Tuesday.” “During Mayor Jacob Frey’s State of the City address on Thursday, he acknowledged that Minneapolis’ population of downtown workers — at least one-third smaller than it was before the pandemic — will likely never fully return to its pre-2020 levels.” His solution? Encourage downtown workers to come into the office Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday while working remotely Monday and Friday.

As journalists whose work involves being immersed in news every day, we know how ""bad news"" weighs heavily. Political divisiveness, climate change, mental health crisis, drug epidemics, housing shortages — the negative list seems to have no end. That being said, avoiding news is not the solution. That appears to be the recent behavior of more of the U.S. population these days. Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism asks people about their news consumption habits. Its most recent survey reveals 38 percent of U.S. respondents say they sometimes or often avoid news. Just as telling, according to a Washington Post story about the survey results, is that the proportion of people in the U.S. who are ""extremely"" or ""very interested"" in the news keeps dropping. This group was in the minority at 49% for the first time in the survey\'s history, down from 67% when the survey began in 2015. Making choices about how much news you focus on is certainly a logical strategy to avoid a bad news overdose. Technology constantly bombards us with bits and pieces of news everywhere all of the time. And the nature of news, of course, is to report when something goes wrong. It can be overwhelming. But withdrawing completely from being informed about what\'s going on in the world and your own community will get us nowhere. ADVERTISEMENT A way to tamp down the barrage of information is to be more selective, relying on reputable, credible sources. Of course, we think newspapers are the best choice because that\'s what we do, but also because of the historical track record of newspaper reporters being trained as government watchdogs and developing sources. It\'s also up to professional news organizations to keep telling the positive stories about our communities and helping to determine solutions when doing in-depth reporting on problems. Being informed is the job of all adults. That\'s how we learn to make decisions, choose political candidates, spend money and vote. Burying our heads in the sand like ostriches won\'t stop the rest of the world from running by. It\'s best to know what\'s going on around you and be part of it.

Tim Walz, left, speaks at the Highway 14 four-lane expansion project opening on the Courtland interchange bridge Tuesday. Seated from left are U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Mn Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, 1st District Congressman Brad Finstad of New Ulm and Mn Sen. Nick Frentz of North Mankato. NEW ULM — For decades, residents of New Ulm and the surrounding area have dreamed of having a safer Highway 14 and in 2023 that dream came true. On Nov. 22, two days before Thanksgiving, the four-lane Highway 14 expansion between New Ulm and Nicollet opened to the public. This stretch of highway cost $84 million and took two nearly two years to complete. It was also the last piece needed to complete the four-lane corridor from Rochester to New Ulm. The entire Highway 14 four-lane expansion project represented multiple decades of lobbying for roadway improvements and involved dozens to communities along the roadway. Most of the early expansions were made on the eastern edge of the state near Rochester. Before the official re-opening of the New Ulm/Nicollet stretch, a special ribbon cutting ceremony was held on the Courtland interchange bridge, Nov. 22. Though it was a cold and windy day, a large crowd attended the ceremony, included dozens of politicians and stakeholders who had a hand in the roadway expansion. The event included speeches from Gov. Tim Walz, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, 1st District Congressman Brad Finstad, MN Sen. Nick Fentz of North Mankato, MN Sen. Gary Dahms of Redwood Falls, MN Rep. Paul Torkelson of Hanska; Mayors of New Ulm, Courtland and Nicollet; members of the Highway 14 Partnership and several Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) officials. MnDOT District 7 engineer Greg Ous said the completion of the roadway was reason to celebrate, but it was also a day to remember those lost on Highway 14. The Highway 14 corridor was long considered a safety hazard. Over the years, the two-lane designed led to many fatal accidents. The primary reason for expanding the roadway to four-lanes was safety purposes. Kathleen Backer became New Ulm’s first female mayor of New Ulm after taking the oath of office Jan 3, 2023. Ous said the completion of the New Ulm/Nicollet stretch was a closure for MnDOT staff and many others who dreamed of a four-lane highway from New Ulm to Rochester. Everyone who spoke during the ribbon cutting acknowledge safety was the top priority in the roadway improvements. Nearly everyone present knew someone who was lost along the roadway. It was emphasized that the project was only possible through the cooperation of all the communities along Highway 14. Highway 14 Partnership President Kevin Raney said leadership played a big part in making the project a reality. Highway 14 from New Ulm opened to traffic later that evening. It was the first time vehicles could travel Highway to Nicollet since April 2022 and for the first time on a four-lane road. 2. New Ulm’s first woman mayor The offense is set to spike the ball while the defense prepares to block. This drama played out hundreds of time during New Ulm’s first Spikin’ in the Street competition. Over 600 tons of sand were poured on Minnesota Street to allowed for a day of tournaments featuring 44 teams. In 2022, then New Ulm Mayor Terry Sveine announced he would not seek a new term, leading to five candidates filing to run for the position. Kathleen Backer was ultimately elected mayor on Nov. 8, 2022. After taking the oath of office during the first city council meeting in 2023, Backer became the first woman mayor in New Ulm history. Over the last year, Backer has enthusiastically served her role as mayor, attending city council and commission meetings and representing New Ulm at important events. Backer was on hand to welcome a delegation from Ulm and Neu Ulm, Germany during Oktoberfest; was present for the Highway 14 ribbon cutting ceremony and even participated in the Fasching tradition in which The Narren kidnap the mayor. “I was never intended to be the first woman mayor,” Backer said in an interview after becoming mayor. She never did something simply to be the first, she said. “I’ve done what I’ve done because I believed I was qualified and I had something to offer.” Backer was raised in New Ulm and graduated from high school in 1964. She would later attend Mankato State University as a non-traditional student. By the time she enrolled in a college class, she was already married with three children. Backer would eventually become curator and manager at Brown County Historical Society in 1981 and in 1984, was promoted to BCHS executive Director. From 1983 to 1989, she served on the District 88 school board. In 1989 she moved to Rockford, IL to serve as Executive Director of Midway Village Museum. She returned to New Ulm in 1998 and began working for Farm America. Later she worked as a consultant for nonprofits. In 2017, she returned to the BCHS as executive director, only stepping down after being elected New Ulm’s mayor. Backer said wanted to be mayor because of how proud she was of the community. She often says it is a privilege to be New Ulm’s Mayor. Backer is aware that in New Ulm, the mayor does not get a vote on the city council, but wanted to serve as a representative of New Ulm. 3. The National Festival of American Turners comes to New Ulm The 56th National Festival of American Turners was held in New Ulm. The event, known as Turnfest, is held every four years since 1851 by a rotating list of Turner societies. This was the first year New Ulm’s Turner Hall hosted the festival. Turnfest is a mixture of cultural and athletic events, following the original mission of the Turners. Cultural events included quilting, oil paintings, photography, essays and musical submission. Athletic events included gymnastics, pickleball, track and field, 5K run, model drill and swimming events. Since the festival was held in New Ulm, the Turners had an opportunity to held a new athletic competition: water ninja. New Ulm is one of only two cities in the United States with a water ninja obstacle course. The ninja cross is located at the New Ulm Rec. Center. Turner athletes were able hold races with obstacles both above and underwater. Turnerfest was held from July 25 to July 29. Over 25 Turner delegations from across the nation came to New Ulm for the festival. 4. Farmers Co-op of Hanksa dissolves In March, members of the Farmers Co-operative of Hanska (FCH) voted 130-1 to dissolve. As a result of the vote, FCH began the process of liquidating and selling all its assets. The decision to dissolve was unanimously recommended by the FCH board. FCH was founded in 1923 and would have celebrated its centennial this year, but mounting debt forced the coop board to take action. Board president Matt Suess said the board looked into every option to save the coop but debt made it unsustainable. FCH fell into significant debt following the June 2021 grain elevator explosion of their grain elevator. The explosion forced the coop to cancel trains and the elevator rebuilt took longer than anticipated with higher cost for materials. The explosion also caused the coop to be dropped by an insurer. No other insurer wanted to cover the coop. After the vote, Central Region COOP (CRC) and New Vision worked with the board to buy up assets. The plan was for CRC to take over FHC’s agronomy, energy and grain business. New Vision planned to purchase the feed assets in Mankato and Courtland. 5. Prince Sculpture comes to Minnesota Music Hall of Fame In March, it was announced a 15-foot-tall Prince themed guitar sculpture would be installed outside the entrance of the Minnesota Music Hall of Fame. The sculpture was created as part of the Mankato City Art Walking Sculpture Tour. The sculpture artist, Jefferson Davis, created the piece to honor the late musican Prince, who was a Minnesota native. After the sculptures term on the Art Walking Sculpture Tour, it would be relocated to the MMHF. Prince was inducted into the Minnesota Music Hall of Fame in 2007. The MMHF recently received a donation of Prince memorabilia from the Prince Legacy Foundation and this included the sculpture. MMHF hoped the sculpture would increase tourism; especially placed outside the Hall of Fame off Broadway. People traveling through town were likely to notice a 15-foot purple guitar. 6. Former Mayor Robert Beussman Former Mayor Robert “Bob” Beussman died on March 6, 2023. Beussman had served the city as Mayor for 10 years, but was also worked as a New Ulm elementary school for 33 years. He retired from teaching in 2000. During his time as Mayor, Beussman was a strong ambassador for the city. In addition to mayor, he served as President of the Highway 14 Coalition. Beussman believed the expansion of Highway 14 was important to'}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:58 pm Sara Shah City Council Member Sara Shah grew up not too far from North Oaks and loves the great outdoors. “My family was always outdoors regardless of the season,” said Shah, who grew up in White Bear Lake. “We spent a lot of our summers camping all over Minnesota. My father taught my sister, my brother and me everything to know about survival in the wilderness. But he also told us how to respect nature. And I still carry many of those values with me today. It was a great childhood.” After college Shah worked for Accenture Consulting and said she was on an airplane nearly every week. “My life was a little bit out of balance,” Shah said. “That’s when I jumped into the corporate world and worked for Target headquarters. I managed large projects that inevitably were around implementing system and business improvements that usually involved different stakeholders, different viewpoints, multimillion-dollar budgets, tight timelines and obviously lots of issues. It was actually a great experience because I still apply a lot of those tools and skill sets in my life today.” Shah met her husband Neil through Match.com in 2006. “We courted online for several weeks with various emails to each other,” Shah said. “We eventually met at a coffee shop in Minneapolis. I remember that day so vividly that we talked for nearly 3 ½ hours and at the end of that first date, I knew I was going to marry him.” She was right. The couple got married in 2010 at the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden. In 2013 they started their business Clarus Dermatology (Neil is a board-certified dermatologist). The Shahs lived in St. Paul where they bought and renovated a 1907 Victorian home. “Neil and I thought we’d live there for 30-plus years,” Shah said. “We worked very hard on it and a lot of TLC was put into it. But the neighborhood started having issues with break-ins, burglaries and then assaults were happening on Friday nights on the sidewalk two blocks down when the sun was going down. We then started to question if it was really the right place to raise a family.” In 2016, the couple decided to move and bought a home in North Oaks. “It was one of the best decisions we’ve ever made,” she said. “We immediately loved the sense of community and the abundance of nature. The city was safe and secure. We found our property in the north and it’s truly a perfect place to raise a family.” Shah loves being a mom to her four children — Audrey, Bennett, Dessa and Cora. “They bring us a lot of joy. We laugh a lot and have a lot of fun. Neil and I feel very blessed.” Shah was appointed to the North Oaks City Council in 2018. Then she served on the Planning Commission from 2019-2020. She was elected to the City Council in 2020 and is currently in her third year. “That was really a great combination for me as a council member because the Planning Commission gave me a great understanding of the city’s comprehensive plan,” Shah said. “Also it gave me an overall understanding of the development process. It really was ultimately the best building block before I got to City Council.” Shah believes local government should be transparent and responsible. “I do a lot of research before every vote and I check in with my constituents,” she said. “And if they don’t check in with me, I start calling them because this is their city and their home. I really encourage residents to stay engaged and use their voices. I truly serve the people.” Hobbies Shah describes herself as a “huge gardener.” “I always have a variety of peppers, carrots, and cucumbers and everybody knows I like to pickle so I’m well known for pickling come July and August,” Shah said. “And I love giving it away as a gift to friends or family.” During the summer the Shah family is busy swimming in their pool and has plenty of bonfires. “You can’t help but enjoy our backyard because we’re in the middle of nature,” she said. “We love biking and fishing with my extended family.” In the winter the family is busy going to Audrey’s gymnastics meets and Bennett’s hockey games. “We are an active family,” Shah said. “I’m pretty close to my siblings who live in the Twin Cities area so we often get together and I am grateful that we can do that.” Shah feels North Oaks is a “diamond” with many facets and that there is something here for everyone. “I am grateful to be a part of North Oaks and call it home,” Shah said. “I want to preserve what we have for future generations and that’s why I took an active role. It’s an opportunity to make a difference and ensure that North Oaks remains the community we all love.” Noelle Olson is the editor of the North Oaks News.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'FOX-9 Chief Meteorologist Ian Leonard resides in Eden Prairie. But his home away from home every first Sunday in June has become Buffalo. Leonard was diagnosed in 2016 with squamous cell skin cancer. After surgery that forced him to remove a portion of his lower lip, Leonard went from kicking cancer to kicking water, pedals, and asphalt as a regular member of the Buffalo Graniteman Triathlon. “This was the first triathlon I did after getting through my cancer and chemotherapy in 2017,” he said. “My best friend, who is here, we run all of our races together. He said, ‘Hey, now that you’re done with chemotherapy, let’s do something monumental – like climb a mountain. I was like, ‘dude, I don’t climb mountains.’ So, he goes, ‘let’s do a triathlon,’ and I was like ‘okay.’ So, we did Buffalo, and it was the most inspiring experience for me.” Leonard was one of 177 total triathletes to compete in Sunday’s sprint course on a hot and steamy June 4 at Sturges Park in Buffalo. The sprint course features a 0.25 mile swim in Buffalo Lake, followed by a 12.06 mile bike ride, and concluding with a 5,000-kilometer run. Leonard, who is 57 years old, placed 98th overall, 70th out of 112 males, and fifth out of eight males in age groups 55-59 in a time of 1 hour, 28 minutes, 02 seconds. Brian Storhaug, 32, from Alexandria, was the top overall finisher on the sprint course in a time of 1:00.28. Eric Engel, 35, from Minneapolis, was the winner of the Olympic course in 1:59.41. The Olympic course features a 0.9 mile swim, 24.12 mile bike ride, and 10k run. A total of 102 finished the Olympic course. Leonard’s time and places decreased a bit from last year’s 1:24.22, which landed a spot on the podium for finishing second among his age group and 76th overall. His first-ever Buffalo Triathlon in 2017 ended in 1:36.27, which placed him 277th out of 350 total participants. “I was terrible. I was slow,” said Leonard, reflecting back on his 2017 race. “Last year, I reached the podium, which was really special for me, because I never did that before. But that’s not why I do it. I call myself old and slow. I always say I might have cancer, but it doesn’t have me. There’s a lot worse off people than me. I just love this race.” Since 2017, Leonard has competed in half and full ironman triathlons across the state and country. “I’ve done five ironmans,” explained Leonard. “I’ve done half of an ironman in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and I’m doing a full ironman in August. This (Buffalo) race isn’t consequential to me anymore, but I have to come, because it’s Buffalo.” Why is Buffalo so special? Leonard explains in more ways than one. “The triathlon community is so welcoming and loving. In Buffalo, people are on the streets and cheering. There’s something special about this place,” he said. “I think they do such a good job here. I don’t even know, but I feel like Buffalo embraces events. When we’re out here, we always try and spend money, which is what keeps races alive. You come out and eat lunch here. If we can do that as local participants, it keeps the local race scene alive.” As for the course itself, Leonard says it’s got its ups and downs. “I like the Lake here,” he said. “The swim is so glorious here. It’s crystal clear and always nice and cold. To be completely honest though, I hate this run. It’s so hilly. But the bike is awesome with a couple sneaky hills.” While Leonard is building a reputation of becoming an ironman fanatic, he also realizes most know him for his regular appearances as the weatherman on KMSP FOX-9 weekday newscasts. Ironically, Leonard blames the weather himself for some of his slower times. “A couple years ago here, it was really windy and the buoys blew like crazy,” Leonard said. “I’ve done Maple Grove Triathlon in a driving rain. I’ve done Ironman Wisconsin in a sideways rain. When I was swimming, it felt like I was swimming off a shipwreck. It was unbelievable. Last year in Chattanooga at the Ironman, it was 98 degree heat index. “It was awful, but that’s why you race. The race-course throws everything at you and your job is to overcome it. It’s not to beat other people, at least for me. My job is my competition against the race-course – finish, feel good, feel elated, and tell cancer to kiss my butt.” Down but not out This year’s Buffalo Triathlon took a hit numbers wise with approximately 350 total participants, according to Race Director Heather Corcoran, of Active Central Minnesota. Last year’s totals reached nearly 450. While numbers are down, Corcoran explains that the race is still going strong. “It was attended very well, despite the high temps, and we had a nice healthy race day registration as well,” Corcoran said. “Chatter afterward was that this event continues to impress, even though the numbers have come down. And that is our goal, to not lose quality and perfection even during these lower years. I feel very happy and satisfied with the event.” Corcoran explains pre-pandemic, numbers would reach from 1,000-1,500 triathletes. The fact more triathlons are out there since those record numbers has also affected the decline in numbers, but not popularity. “There were not a lot of other races,” Corcoran said. “So naturally, the concentration of racers had a small pool of events to choose from. Trying to understand the ebbs and flows of triathlon is a bit of an anomaly. And while I don’t know that we’ll ever see the sort of participation that we saw in the early 2000s, we are proud to have outlasted many other large event companies who have had to fold.” Corcoran was assisted in leading this year’s event by Volunteer Coordinator/Race Director Heather Rothfork. To complete a successful race from a director’s standpoint, it’s essential to have quality sponsors and volunteers. Buffalo continues to get just that from its local and surrounding communities. “Groups that were there to volunteer were absolutely amazing this year,” said Rothfork. “We had Buffalo Cheer, Buffalo Girls Basketball, Becker National Honor Society, Big Lake Volleyball, Capital Area Youth Soccer Association, and Central Minnesota Cheerleading Association, located in Annandale. We really could not do this without these groups of hard working youth and their families.” buffalo MN weather forecast PO Box 159108 Central Ave.Buffalo MN 55313 www.thedrummer.com Stay informed on our latest news!

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:58 pm The Shoreview Parks and Recreation Department will host the first-ever Culture in the Commons event from 2-4:30 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 1. Bring your family and learn about the different cultures that reside in Shoreview through performers, crafts and musicians. “The idea is to celebrate various cultures that have lived here in Shoreview,” said Jennifer Verburrage, a part-time recreation program coordinator for the city. The department has reached out to several different cultures within the community. The most responsive were those individuals who are a part of the Ukrainian community. There will be crafts and musical acts that shine a light on Ukrainian culture. Two musical events will be featured at the event. YEV Music and the Ukrainian Village Band will perform Ukrainian-based music. The Ukrainian Village Band, a group of six performers, will offer music based on Ukrainian and Zabava roots. Founded in 2007, this wedding and event band offers a sound that combines both traditional and modern Ukrainian music as well as its own take on popular, international rock and pop tunes. Yev Rosso, or YEV Music, will be the second artist featured. Rosso is a singer-songwriter who has deep Ukrainian roots and is branching out to reach those in the American Midwest. His music is based around his experience as a Ukrainian immigrant in the Midwest. “We will have a couple of craft stations for families to bring their kids,” Verburrage said. The tables will highlight different Ukrainian crafts. “The event is designed to expose people to these various cultures that are celebrated here within the Shoreview area,” Verburrage added, “and to experience some of the music and art of those cultures.” Culture in the Commons is starting off small with only one event this year, but the Parks and Recreation Department has hopes that the event will continue to grow. The event will take place at the Haffman Pavilion center located at the Shoreview Community Center, 4600 Victoria St., Shoreview. Log In Keep it Clean.

All three inductees expressed that they felt honored to be inducted. Speaker for the event was Duey Ferber, sixth-grade teacher for the district. The NHS lists four cornerstone personality traits for potential members: scholarship, leadership, service and character. Ferber focused on the word “leadership.” He told those in attendance, “Being a leader is not about being the best, it is about making everyone else better.” He went on to say that the NHS members assembled on the stage were not “perfect.” “I taught them all how to drive,” joked Ferber. “I assure you, they made mistakes.” Ferber then went on to share a story of regret from his own childhood. He told of a classmate who was “an easy target” for bullies. He confessed, “I didn’t join in, but I did nothing to stop it. “I was 12 years old, and I was a coward.” He went on to suggest that anyone in the room could be a leader. “Be the kind of person who stands up for the Penny Fishers of the world,” he suggested. “Be the kind of person who looks for solutions rather than complications. “Show leadership by shoveling an elderly neighbor’s driveway,” he offered, then went on to give his own address. “Be the kind of leader who understands pressure is a privilege; it means something is expected of you. “And always,” Ferber finished, “choose kindness.” Along with the three inductees, members of the New Richland chapter of the National Honor Society are Kia Buendorf, Payton Bunn, Julia Churchill, Keira Lenort, Addison Loken, McKenzie Mueller, Madison Murray, Evelyn Nydegger, Erin Peterson, Annabelle Petsinger, George Roessler, Tayler Schmidt, Hallie Schultz, Brenna Sommer and Isabel Stadheim.

Lisa Malmo surmises if she had followed the colonoscopy screening guidelines, her cancer would have been caught before it advanced to a potentially fatal stage. She can’t change the past, but Malmo is using her story to help others avoid the same prognosis. Malmo was grieving the death of her son when she began feeling unwell. In October 2016, her son had lost his life by suicide and Malmo, who over the next year lost 15 pounds and developed anemia, assumed she had a bleeding stomach ulcer due to the stress and grief. Her symptoms grew to include irregular bowel movements, paling skin and shortness of breath so profound that she had to sit on the curb of a busy street to recover during a walk. Malmo was referred to gastroenterology at Mayo Clinic Health System, where she had begun working as a nurse practitioner in hospital medicine several months prior. At age 56, she underwent her first colonoscopy, a screening recommended to begin at age 45 and repeated every 10 years. Lisa Malmo was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer six years ago and successfully underwent treatment. A large mass was discovered on Malmo’s right colon, with extensive metastases to the liver and mesenteric lymph nodes. Says Malmo: “Had I been more proactive, I could have had a colonoscopy at 45 and then one at 55, and most likely one or both of those would have caught the cancer polyps that could have been removed, and even prevented me from having colon cancer.” In early stages, symptoms of colon cancer can be absent, but with progression patients may experience constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain or cramps, unexplained weight loss, fatigue and weakness. Among women, some of these symptoms mimic those of premenstrual syndrome and are thus ignored. For Malmo, who led a healthy lifestyle of nutritious foods and exercise and with no family history of colon cancer, her symptoms didn’t overly concern her. But by the time she sought medical evaluation, her cancer had reached stage 4. “Symptoms that seem insignificant, when you add the all up might be something quite significant,” Malmo says now. Gastroenterology nurse practitioner Lisa Malmo speaks Friday with registered nurse Julie O’Donnell at Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse. Having battled colon cancer herself, Malmo has firsthand experience of what her patients are going through with their own battles against the disease. Surgical removal of the mass, Malmo was told, would be “purely palliative” and too complex to perform at Mayo’s La Crosse location. Even at Mayo in Rochester it would be “most likely inoperable,” she said, due to the effects to the liver. Malmo was realistic about the odds of surviving her advanced disease. Colorectal cancer, which affects one in 23 men and one in 26 women, is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women, and is expected to cause more than 50,000 fatalities this year.

Cambridge Police Chief Todd Schuster In turning in his letter of retirement effective the beginning of June 2024, Cambridge Police Chief Todd Schuster’s intent was to give the city six months to find his replacement. It took the city council about six minutes to accomplish that, unanimously approving extending an offer to Deputy Chief Shawn Machin. “It is with excitement that I am announcing my retirement,” Schuster wrote to the council. “My last day with the city of Cambridge and the Cambridge Police Department will be June 3, 2024.” Schuster has an extensive employment history with the city. Hired as a patrol officer in July of 1997, Schuster worked his way up the ranks, until finally in November, 2017 he was promoted to police chief. In reflecting on his time as chief, Schuster admitted there have been some rocky roads he and his staff have had to navigate. “I am not going to lie, since I was selected as your chief of police, there have been some difficult and trying times,” he wrote. Specifically, he mentioned two incidents that completely changed how law enforcement operates: the COVID pandemic and the George Floyd and Daunte Wright deaths at the hands of police officers. “We had to change the way we police on the fly,” he wrote regarding the pandemic. “Even with the vast amount of support for law enforcement here in Cambridge and the surrounding area, those incidents again led to changes in the way that we police our citizens and required new training and procedures.” He added that all of these changes and uncertainty have made it difficult to recruit and hire officers for all police departments. FINDING HIS REPLACEMENT While acknowledging his intention of making his retirement announcement so early was to give the council plenty of time to find his replacement, Schuster also gave his recommendation to hire Machin. “The enormous upside with Shawn is that he knows the inner workings of the police department and the continuity of services would not be disrupted,” Schuster said. Machin also has an extensive history with the city. He was first hired in 2004 and worked his way up to deputy chief, being named to that position in 2021 on Schuster’s recommendation. He also applied and was interviewed for the chief position in 2017. At that time, while the council unanimously approved hiring Schuster, the entire council agreed it was an extremely tough decision between the two. City Administrator Evan Vogel echoed Schuster’s sentiment regarding Machin. “It didn’t take (me) that long to get from knowing we had this need (to find a suitable replacement) to thinking about the idea that we have the right candidate on our department today,” Vogel said. “After having hours of conversation with the chief and hours of conversation with this individual, I could not be more excited to bring the recommendation to promote Deputy Chief Shawn Machin as the next chief of police for the city of Cambridge.” Following unanimous council approval of making a conditional offer to him, Machin expressed his appreciation to the council and stated his dedication to carrying on the quality job Schuster had maintained. “In 2008, when I was promoted to Sergeant, I stood before the council and said my goal was to make you proud of this selection and to never for one second second-guess or doubt this decision,” Machin said, “and my goal continues to be that. I plan on working extremely hard. I’ve given a lot of my life to the city of Cambridge and I plan to give a lot more.” COUNCIL’S WORK NOT FINISHED Assuming Machin’s promotion goes off without a hitch, it creates what Vogel described as a “snowball effect” with there now being an opening for a deputy chief. The council authorized city staff to take a look at refining the deputy chief position before posting an opening. Once it is posted, Vogel said it is possible they would hire that position from within, which would then create a different open position, “and thus the snowball effect.” Wherever the new deputy chief comes from, eventually the city will have to find someone from outside the department to fill a position, which based on the current environment, may take the full six months. However, Vogel said his main goal is for Machin and whoever is the new deputy chief to have a full staff behind them once they officially take on their new duties on June 3. Log In Keep it Clean.

The Musical” On Israel's “Right to Exist” and Other Myths Moo-ving towards a new mascot SRC to hear Mac for Palestine’s divestment proposal On Thursday, Nov. 16, Macalester’s students and faculty gathered at the John B. Davis Lecture Hall for an EnviroThursday lecture given by Niiyokamigaabaw Deondre Smiles, assistant professor of geography at University of Victoria, titled “Paul Bunyan and Settler Colonial Green/Whitewashing of Indigenous Environments.” Smiles first introduced himself, his academic background and his field of expertise. He has spent most of his life in Minnesota, having grown up in Minneapolis or Gaakaabikaang, in the Ojibwe language. His current areas of interest include critical Indigenous geographies, political ecology and Indigenous cultural resource preservation. In his talk, Smiles focused on the history of the mythical figure Paul Bunyan and his role in settler colonialism in Minnesota. He explained that Paul Bunyan as we know him today, the magical lumberjack “so strong that he could cut down 100 trees is one swing of the ax,” was popularized by an advertising campaign of the Red River Lumber Company, a prominent logging company in the 19th century. While the story of Paul Bunyan is thought of as a “folksy tale” for children, Smiles argued that his role has been much more harmful than at first sight. Smiles connected the story of Paul Bunyan to the concept of settler colonialism, which he defined as a “foreign colonization that’s built on the settlement and enduring occupation of land by colonizing power.” He reminded the audience that the United States is a settler colony. Although many Americans believe they are entitled to call themselves native to America, as their families have lived in this country for generations, Smiles asserted it is crucial to fight this self-Indigenization. “I hate to be the bearer of bad news,” Smiles said. “We live in a settler colony here in the United States. Canada is a settler colony, Australia’s a settler colony … Palestine in the form of the state of Israel is a settler colony.” “[If] everybody can be considered Indigenous to this land, then Indigenous peoples don’t have any special distinction,” Smiles said. Smiles introduced the term ‘terra nullius’ — ‘no man’s land,’ in Latin — which is an important concept in settler colonial mythology. “[When] you hear stories about the creation of the United States, [you hear that] the land was empty,” Smiles said. “‘We built a country out of wilderness, right?’ And then people say, ‘well, there were Indigenous peoples here, there were Native peoples here that we’ve displaced.’ And then the narrative turns to, ‘well, they were so bad at using the land productively … [it] might as well have been inhabited or empty or unused.’” Smiles explained that settler colonialism not only erases cultures and histories, it also harms the environment. He gave the example of the Dakota Access Pipeline which was one of the most recent environmental scandals which involved the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. Smiles also acknowledged that academia rarely credits Indigenous knowledge. “It’s always really funny [how] every couple of months I see somebody like a white scientist [saying] ‘I have discovered this [new] technology’ or something,” Smiles said. “There was a paper that came out that was talking about fire management techniques in northern Minnesota, and other folks [said] ‘Wow, they discovered this amazing form of fire management, right?’ Well, they’re writing about Ojibwe fire management techniques that we had been practicing for, like 1,000 years. They didn’t discover anything. They just uncovered the history of what was already there.” Smiles then returned to explaining how the tale of Paul Bunyan ties into settler colonialism. He presented a theory that Minnesotans have created the myth of Paul Bunyan as a way to whitewash Minnesota’s history and erase the fact that this state was taken from Indigenous peoples and built on Indigenous genocide. “We can’t handle that in our collective psyche as Minnesotans, so we’ve come up with this idea,” Smiles said. “We’ve come up with this myth of Paul Bunyan and [we] embrace this myth as a way to kind of self-soothe ourselves. It’s a way to kind of say ‘No, no it wasn’t [us]. The trees didn’t just get cut down from an extractive lumber industry. They were cut down by Paul Bunyan, right? Yeah, Paul Bunyan created these 10,000 lakes.” Smiles extended the theory of Paul Bunyan as not only a means of whitewashing but also greenwashing Minnesota’s colonial history. This is particularly relevant in Minnesota, which advertises itself as an “environmentally friendly” and “environmentally conscious” state. In reality, however, Minnesota heavily relies on logging, copper sulfide mining and nuclear energy production, all of which severely alter and harm the environment. “I think in some respects, Minnesota might be a resource extraction corporation masquerading as a state,” Smiles said. To conclude his lecture, Smiles told the audience the forgotten myth of Paul Bunyan’s encounter with Nanabozho, a religious figure of the Ojibwe tribe, who is commemorated with a statue located in Bemidji, Minnesota, right across from the iconic statue of Paul Bunyan. According to the story, when Paul Bunyan was cutting down trees and reshaping the state of Minnesota, Nanabozho ordered him to stop, for no one has the right to alter the environment. Paul Bunyan ignored Nanabozho’s warnings. To punish him for his crimes, Nanabozho took a huge fish from one of the 10,000 lakes and punched Paul Bunyan across the face. “I think that that’s a very, very important allegory for [how we] contend with this greenwashing and white washing.” said Smiles. “I say that we need to grab a fish and slap settler colonialism [across the face].” The Student News Site of Macalester College Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

And he cited advice from designer Coco Chanel. “When you get dressed for an event and get dressed up looking nice, look at yourself in the mirror after you’re done and ready to walk out the door and then remove one accessory,” Tyler Michaletz said. “Good flag design is get your design basically there and then dial it back one step.” It hasn’t been an easy path since a field of more than 2,000 got chopped to the final three. Some commission members shared negative feedback that they’d fielded from the public and said they might have to break traditional flag design rules to get a winner. “If we continue to be so, so strict on what the vexillology people say, we’re going to find that the people in Minnesota are going to reject this over time,” said state Sen. Steve Drazkowski, R-Mazeppa, referring to the study of flags. State Sen. Mary Kunesh, DFL-New Brighton, said she’d heard from hundreds of people who were eager for the switch. “I find that folks are very interested in and very positive about this change,” Kunesh said. And Fitch, the chair, predicted the new flag would be well received or at least grow on people and might come to appreciate the symbolism of all of the elements. “A lot of people are gonna say, ‘I don’t see it,’ and they’re gonna be negative,” Fitch said. “But give them six months, give them a year. And then the younger generations are more open minded.” Members are scheduled to meet next Tuesday to make final revisions, run through their process and to draft a report about why they made the decisions they did over the last four months. The commission also unveiled the final image for a state seal design, which was tweaked this week to include the loon’s red eye and the words “Mni Sota Makoce,” the Dakota phrase about where water touches the sky and from which the name Minnesota was derived.'}]"

Technology has an answer. That was part of the message delivered by Steve Koenig, Consumer Technology Association vice president of market research, at the recent CES consumer technology show in Las Vegas. The CES show is renowned for highlighting the latest in technology from industry giants, major retailers and entrepreneurial startups. In his keynote address, Koenig noted there are bright sides, but supply chains, a topic that went from nowhere to an every day discussion, remain vulnerable. Chip inventories are rising and lead times are falling, which should also help in terms of supplies for a host of products, including vehicles. He said the downside risk in terms of chip inventories comes with oversupply, as the latest tech may be deferred until demand works its way through the supply. That remains to be seen, he said. But one thing is clear for the near future and likely well beyond — the national labor shortage. Koenig said the U.S. is short 10 million workers. ADVERTISEMENT “I think that 20 years ago, technology was the 'nice to have' when it comes to business or the commercial enterprise. Today, I think humans are the 'nice to have.' … The simple truth is we can’t hire enough workers certainly if we are talking about skilled labor and knowledge workers,” Koenig said. There have been recent tech layoffs, but across the global economy, he said, businesses are struggling to find workers. As for one of the other current challenges, raising interest rates is a blunt instrument to temper inflation, Koenig said. “The other way is boosting productivity,” Koenig said, referring to British economist Christopher Freeman, who said, “innovation accelerates and bunches up during economic downturns only to be unleashed as the economy begins to recover, ushering in powerful new ways of technological change.” This means new services and new products for consumers, Koenig said. He pointed to the experience with the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009 as consumer technology innovation brought mobile broadband. In 2010, about 30% of U.S. households had a smartphone. This time with predictions of a recession in 2023, Koenig said he believes 5G, for the fifth wireless generation, will be key with innovation based on the network providing faster mobile broadband both for consumers and the commercial industrial Internet of Things — technology that connects and exchanges data over the internet. That will unlock so much innovation across this next decade, Koenig said. He expects phases with a digital transformation — born from needs during the pandemic such as businesses pivoting to what they can do online. “Once again, because of 5G, we’re entering into a new season or a new phase of automation and virtualization,” Koenig said, noting a future of smart factories and hospitals, automated facilities and automated farms. ADVERTISEMENT Cybersecurity, cloud, artificial intelligence and robotics are all part of it and underpins the effort and the global economy, Koenig said. He included benefits of speed and increased productivity, improving worker safety and optimizing space. “The metaverse is closer than you think,” he said, noting any dialogue on the topic is also going to be met with skepticism. “Metaverse is still a speculative term but make no mistake this is a real trend just as the internet was a real trend in the early 1990s, even though a lot of us didn’t know what it was. … That's exactly the same dynamic that is manifesting around metaverse right now.” Koenig said he thinks the term metaverse conjured up images of hyper immersive and shared experiences — like those visualized in the movie “Ready Player One.” For Koenig, metaverse is really the next generation of the internet, an elevated online experience with an elevated sense of immersion. So what does that mean for the consumer? Examples include an online shopping experience where a consumer actually pushes the cart and pulls items from the familiar store shelves into their shopping cart. Koenig pointed to a service provider, Touchcast, that has a vituralized 3D retail space but also has a human. “That’s refreshing,” Koenig said. “That’s an elevated sense of immersion and certainly leveled up from online shopping today.” As an example, Koenig said shopping for a computer or new sneakers could include looking at the product in detail with cutouts of how the shoe is made all from home while also talking to a person. For the sales representative, it’s akin to being in something most people are very familiar with these days — a virtual meeting, he said. For innovation in immersion, Koenig pointed to OVR Technology with digital scent with therapeutic applications. Perhaps imagine walking in a sunny field of green plants on a mid-winter day through the power of immersion and the benefit of wearing a virtual reality headset. More electric vehicles with advancements in battery design and charging systems are predicted. And there are advancements in autonomy. Koenig pointed to self-driving systems like trucks. He noted the labor shortage isn’t just a U.S. issue, it’s global. Here at home, he said the American Trucking Association reported by the year 2030, there will be a shortage of 160,000 truck drivers. ADVERTISEMENT “How are we going to close that gap? Technology has the answer,” he said of self-driving trucks. “Humans are the nice to have. Technology is the answer.” Koenig also pointed to the changing vehicle interior. The old way to order a latte from Starbucks was to use the app, he said. The new way will be using voice control while a person is driving to place the order. Koenig also broached the idea of the vehicle becoming more subscription driven for services, even the AM/FM radio in the dash requiring a subscription in the future as companies look at capitalizing on recurring revenue. Koenig said he doesn’t know how that will play out but he expects more conversation about features as a service, perhaps a monthly fee, in the future. Virtual opportunities with telehealth exploded during the pandemic. Now, Koenig said digital therapeutics and improved remote health monitoring, even connected fitness, provide medical providers not only with conversation but actual health data. Examples included remote patient monitoring, pain management devices and SK Zero glasses that can predict an epileptic seizure. Other pieces of technology may help improve mental health. Imagine being bedridden but able to put on a virtual reality headset and experiencing walking across a beach. ACWA Robotics has a robot that swims inside water pipes to look for leaks. Koenig said globally about 30 billion cubic meters of clean water are lost due to leaks each year. ADVERTISEMENT “That’s a lot of clean water. We can do better,” Koenig said. Jackery has created a personal power windmill as an alternative source of power, although if everyone at the beach showed up with one, the visuals could be a little overwhelming. Ag tech includes farming robots, drones and soil sensors, intelligent silos, and connected farmers. John Deere had a fully autonomous tractor at the CES show and was the 2023 Best of Innovation winner in robotics. The CES show also provided data on gaming from its 2022 Future of Gaming Study.

issue, Minnesota Women’s Press asked four artists to choose another artist they know and have a conversation. We offered them a set of questions about art, work, and the creative life, and asked them to record themselves and send us the audio file. The following story is an edited transcript of an hour-long conversation. Find more stories from the “Artists on Artists” issue here. Grover Hogan (they/ them) is a visual and performance artist and an art teacher. Drew Maude-Griffin (they/them) is a visual artist, writer, and educator. They curated CURRENTS: Adaptation, Brilliance, and Joy, a group exhibition of work by disabled artists at the Minnesota Museum of American Art, on view through February 25. Grover: I show your work to my students, especially when they make work about disability, or are bringing kitschy aesthetics into their work or combining fiber arts with painting. The two pieces that I always look towards are the one of you and Mitch McConnell and the one of you and your grandma holding hands. How do you come up with these ideas? Drew Maude-Griffin. Photo Grover Hogan Drew: A lot of it comes to me when I’m lying in bed. For the Mitch McConnell piece, I was looking at Kehinde Wiley’s work and thinking about referencing “old master” paintings. I was really pissed off about health care and I wanted to portray Mitch McConnell as a demon that I could defeat. That came from feeling weak and sick, and not knowing if I was going to be able to access health care. I wanted to take power into my own hands. I think a lot of my ideas come from my physical and emotional experiences and wanting to share those. Whatever medium you end up working in, whether it’s performance, comics, or painting, I feel like you have a way of creating an emotional and visceral reaction in your audience using visual cues that are readily accessible to all viewers. How do you both use a visual language and make these pieces that are readable to somebody who doesn’t necessarily have an arts background? Grover: I love trivia and learning fun facts. I got that sensibility from my parents, who are culture chow hounds; they loved to watch every movie, every TV show, and were constantly looking, observing, and consuming. I’ve been interested in how much iconography there is in the world and how we associate certain feelings, events, or social dynamics with these different icons. I try to think about something I see every day and ask how it impacts my emotions and my experiences. I usually double check with my parents or my partner and ask, “What do you think this means?” I see if they can start analyzing — for example — what a bar sign means or what angel wings mean, and then explore how that association might have layers. Drew: Do you make art for a particular community? Grover: I always say that I make art for my mom. Her cultural knowledge is so influential on me. I usually make work that she can either relate to or understand. I also make a lot of work geared towards the Latine community, towards queer communities, trans communities. Right now I’m invested in making work that talks about queerness and its intersection with labor and how you might have to suppress or overperform your queerness to get by in the world. Drew: Sometimes I make work that is explaining my illness and disability to people who are not yet sick or disabled, or to the people I love, because it’s an internal experience I want others to understand. I think I’ve moved away from that in recent years; I’m more focused on what I want to communicate to other disabled folks, who are an ever-growing community because we’re still in a pandemic. Grover: Sometimes when I show my work to people who do not share a common identity, they try to completely ignore the identity being presented, even though my work is so focused on identity. If someone is not of Latine descent or has never been the person who doesn’t know the language, I see them shut down and actively choose not to engage with the work. That also happens with work about queerness or about Blackness or transness. If a viewer is on the oppressing side of a dynamic, they get extremely uncomfortable, they don’t want to talk about the subject matter, they want to talk about the aesthetics and the technique. I think you have to be okay with looking at identity to even approach my work. Grover Hogan. Photo Ash Nichols Drew: I’ve encountered that in my work too. When somebody is a healthy, able-bodied person, there’s a reluctance to want to consider that a work is about feeling excluded from spaces because of disability. Grover: I saw that in critiques in art school with you — people will do anything they can to not talk about the fact that there’s mobility aid or prescription medication in an image. Drew: How does money impact your creative life? Grover: There are so many ways to make visual art for no money at all. Growing up lower class, I would buy tons of those fifty-cent craft paints. That impacted the way my paintings ended up looking — super flat and inspired by comics. It also forced me to find art materials anywhere I could. So honestly, money doesn’t really impact my creative life. But it does impact my regular life. Drew: I think for me, it’s more about balancing my energy capacities for going to work and then making artwork, which may or may not earn me money. Because of my illnesses, the energy I have is a huge limiting factor. I’m constantly balancing this economy of energy spent, and most times my energy is spent at work. Grover: I feel like I haven’t been able to make much art because of how in pain and exhausted I am after work. Any instance of me making art is usually because I have to do so for work. In those cases, art is less healing and more of a survival tactic, which sucks. Do you feel supported as an artist? What do you wish were different? Drew: I feel really supported through the communities I work in right now at Fresh Eye Arts and Fresh Eye Gallery; I feel really lucky to be in community with other disabled artists there. I’m currently finishing my fellowship with Emerging Curators Institute, and I feel really lucky to be supported by that program within Minneapolis. I can’t go to a lot of openings right now because most art spaces don’t require masking anymore. A lot of the best shows are in smaller galleries where there is no ventilation, it’s crowded. And for me, getting Covid could be a really big deal. So I have to avoid a lot of these networking and community events. That sucks, but I think that might be a problem anywhere I go. How about you? Grover: When I was in Houston the art scene was a lot more cutthroat and competitive. Here there’s a lot more support. But I also feel like the spaces here are very white and focused on the more privileged people in the art world. I wish that there were more celebration of people who don’t have access to higher institutions. I’ve seen artists who do incredible work not have the same level of clout because they don’t have those college connections. Drew: How do you rest? Grover: I’ll be so real with you, I don’t think I do. I think it is actively killing me, my lack of rest. I think I’m burnt out and I don’t really know what to do. Right now, especially with everything that’s going on both in my personal life and globally, it feels like there’s so much to take on. It’s a depressing question. I feel like I should get rest from my art. Drew: Art is work. There can be a healing property to it, but it’s still a form of work. What is inspiring you lately? Grover: I think the thing about inspiration is that it’s not really inspiration until you implement it; otherwise it’s just something that brings you excitement. I want to actually try implementing the things that I find exciting, which requires research. I am trying to remember who I am and what I love, and not just make things that I think people will think look good, which is such a difficult thing to balance. My childhood self, the fanboy part of me who is super obnoxious about all of my interests, is what’s inspiring me right now — my cringiest self. Drew: That’s something I learned from you, drawing on joy. In art school there was this pushing us into more “serious work” or topics that seemed more respectable. When you get inspiration and joy'}]"

First, one must look at the content of these TV shows when considering their enjoyment.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:42 pm Despite not meeting each other until Aug. 20, Nicki LeTourneau and Kim Gustavson had much in common. Both lost a child to fentanyl poisoning in Mankato. Both Eva LeTourneau and Travis Gustavson were 21 years old when they died, Eva on Dec. 1, 2022 and Travis on Feb. 24, 2021. Both of their mothers are going through the ordeal of court proceedings related to who supplied the potent drug. Nicki and Kim’s Aug. 20 meeting came during an awareness and memorial event in Mankato, a chance to sound the alarm about the potent opioid causing a rising number of fatal and non-fatal overdoses. “I don’t want her death to be in vain,” Nicki said of Eva. “So if I can help save one other family from this nightmare we’ve had to endure these last nine months, it’s worth putting myself and her story out there.” The Gustavsons have taken the same approach, sharing Travis’ story at awareness events over the last two-plus years. They organized the Aug. 20 event to support families in their shoes, combat the stigma around addiction, and let other families know about local resources that could help avoid the worst outcomes. “We felt so alone when it happened,” Kim said. ”The more families who know they aren’t, the better.” While it’s comforting to find support from families who’ve experienced similar loss, Nicki said, it’s also disheartening to know the numbers keeps growing. Epidemic hits home Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid about 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Used medically, often after surgeries, it can ease severe or chronic pain Illegal drug manufacturers and suppliers have over time mixed the opioid into other drugs because of how potent it is and cheap to produce. Communities across the U.S. are grappling with the results. Posters lined a walking path at the Aug. 20 event depicting hundreds of fentanyl victims from Minnesota and around the U.S. The collages show the wide diversity of people impacted by fentanyl, with one of the only through lines seemingly being the general youthfulness of so many of the victims. Fentanyl’s pervasiveness makes it especially concerning, said Matt Durose, deputy director of the Mankato Department of Public Safety. “It doesn’t affect a single demographic or just big cities,” he said. “It’s everywhere.” Mankato’s overdoses sometimes come in bunches. He estimated the department of public safety is responding to about three per month. Drug epidemics aren’t necessarily new to the Mankato area and other communities. The difference with fentanyl is how lethal it can be in such small doses, Durose said. “We’ve seen overdoses and poisonings in the past with other substances ranging from alcohol to meth and things like that, but fentanyl in its smallest amount is lethal,” he said. “We haven’t seen that until now.” Minnesota River Valley Drug Task Force Cmdr. Chad Ruch said fentanyl’s lethality is matched by its addictiveness. Someone may experience euphoria at first and then need progressively larger doses to reach the same feeling. Their bodies can’t handle it after a certain point. Overdoses occur when fentanyl causes breathing to slow or stop and prevents oxygen from reaching the brain, known as hypoxia. Naloxone medication isn’t a guaranteed treatment, but it can offset some overdoses when administered right away. When it goes right, the medication blocks fentanyl from the body’s receptors. One of the troubles of fentanyl is people buying a certain drug from a supplier could be unaware it’s laced with it. The task force is detecting fentanyl in seized cocaine, meth, heroin and other drugs, Ruch said. “They’re putting it in everything now,” he said. The task force has responded to 11 fatal overdoses so far in 2023, approaching the total during all of 2022, according to data provided to The Free Press. The year-by-year overdose fatality totals leading up to 2023 in the task force’s region, which covers Blue Earth, Nicollet, Watonwan and Martin counties, is as follows: • 2020 — 9 fatalities • 2021 — 19 fatalities • 2022 — 13 fatalities For known total overdoses, which includes non-fatal outcomes, the region is at 71 so far in 2023. The previous known totals by year were: • 2020 — 86 • 2021 — 102 • 2022 — 89 The numbers reflect incidents reported to law enforcement, said Beth Bock, analyst with the Minnesota River Valley Drug Task Force. Overdoses not reported to law enforcement, like a fatality averted by use of the reversal drug Naloxone, wouldn’t show up in the numbers. The number of opioid overdose deaths in Minnesota rose from 291 to 978 from 2011 to 2021, according to Minnesota Department of Health data. From 2020 to 2021 alone the total rose by 43%. Nationally, 106,699 drug overdose deaths occurred in 2021, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. About 75% of the fatalities involved opioids. Reason for hope Jeremy Drucker was appointed by Gov. Tim Walz to be Minnesota’s first addiction and recovery director in November 2022. In the role, Drucker coordinates with eight state agencies, from education to homelessness to corrections, to respond to the rise of overdoses and substance abuse. All of them have a role in addressing the issue, said Drucker, who himself is in long-term recovery. He spoke at the Aug. 20 event and talked about how it helps shine a light on the problem and how there are groups in and around Mankato available to help. “Substance use really flourishes where there’s sorrow, where there’s trauma, where there’s anxiety and particularly isolation,” Drucker said. “So the more you have people coming together at events like today, that connection is what is going to help us address this and get people the help they need.” The event featured substance use and mental health treatment providers, drug court representatives, homelessness services and more. Mankato Mayor Najwa Massad read out a proclamation in recognition of fentanyl overdose awareness. Naloxone was available for free at the event. Outside the event, Christian Family Solutions has been providing free trainings on how to administer the medication and recognize when it’s needed. Advocacy groups are regularly meeting to talk about resources and how to use opioid response funds awarded in settlements, Durose said, and each time it seems like something new is available. The response gives him hope. Everyone is touched by addiction in some way, whether through their family or themselves, Ruch said. He credited the families impacted by fentanyl with raising awareness by speaking up about it. “It takes an army to do that some times,” he said. “These people aren’t afraid to go talk to somebody.” The Gustavsons have been out front talking about fentanyl since Travis’ death. On Aug. 20 and in previous years they teamed up with Kara Richardson, a correctional officer in Blue Earth County and forensic and recovery specialist with the county’s adult drug court, to organize the awareness events. Travis’ family has also spoken about their profound loss in court. In December 2022, Anna Marie Bailey received about a two-year prison sentence for third-degree murder related to supplying Travis with fentanyl before his death. Another person accused of supplying Travis with the fentanyl, Max Leo Miller, has a third-degree murder trial set to begin on Sept. 5. Nicki LeTourneau knew the court dates off the top of her head for the three people charged in relation to Eva’s death. Connor Lee Hoeft, Haley Marie Ross and Kueth Pamier Ruae were all charged with third-degree aiding and abetting murder afterward. Eva, who went to Mankato East, lost classmates to fentanyl overdoses. Nicki remembers talking to her about it. The shock of Eva’s death felt as strong on Aug. 20 as it did when she found out about it on Dec. 1. On Wednesday, Nov. 30 her daughter was at an apartment with friends; on Thursday, Dec. 1 she was gone. “I can’t tell you how many times per day that it hits me all over again,” Nicki said. “It’s like I forget for a second and then I remember. That isn’t daily, that’s many, many times per day.” One day, when she and her family are ready, Nicki hopes to start a nonprofit in memory of Eva. The work could be similar to what the Gustavsons are doing in Travis’ memory. Alongside Travis’ photo and others on a table at the memorial event, Eva’s family placed pictures of her. She’s smiling with the sun shining down on her in a field of lavender. The cause of Eva’s death after it happened was like an elephant in the room, Nicki said, so talking about it might just help other families. At the same'}]"

The YMCA dance always gets them going dancing wise...they were singing it Wednesday, how fun is that? The hula hoopers were amazing, they must have been practicing at home! When our announcer called for the fellows to join in hula hooping, suddenly they were all shy. With the coaxing of their families, they rallied! And although the announcer always says...watch carefully, this contest only takes seconds, he was proved wrong... a couple of those fellows had been practicing, too! The crowd went crazy with applause. Turtle race champions This week had two grand winners, (L-R) seven week old Eli Nichols of Cedar Lake, IN and six year old Eliza Montgomery from Wykoff, MN. Eli’s sister, 12 year old Baileigh Nichols took home the Grand Slowpoke title. Photo submitted. Volunteer’s anniversary When the announcer called out for any anniversaries, two beloved Longville locals stepped forward. Paul and Anita Harwig have been married for 20 years! Photo submitted. Resort race winner... Six year old Claire Hanson from Kasota, MN walked away with the big W this week representing Long Birch Lodge, pictured here with Angelia Sawyers of All Seasons Resort. Photo submitted. The turtles were in fine form... they scooted around so fast, they could hardly get the music going! Now for the old and new... First, let’s do the new. There were so many Green Ribbon winners competing for the Grand Winner that we had to run 2 Final Races. And, the winners, one at each race... were brother and sister! How does that happen? Our “new something” is the 2nd winner, 7 week old Eli Nichols. See their picture here. Sweet! Our “Something Old” is our Celebrity Announcer, Gary Knox, from Minne Teepee Resort on Woman Lake. I don’t mean age old, I mean experience old, because Gary was heavily involved in the Turtle Races for many years, and, what an announcer he is! I think partly why the crowd was so responsive was due to Gary’s coaxing them on! We get him back on August 2nd. You might want to come by and check him out. In closing, the story this week is about Kate and Naga Shanmugan, staying at Wildwood Beach Resort on Man lake. Kate’s family has been going there for 20 years. Naga is from India and loves being up here with their 2 year old son. After chatting a bit, his parting comment was “We’ll be back next year.” I love it. Got a heads up for next week...we’ll have 11 year old Leopold and his family with us, visiting Tim Plunkett and his family. Leopold is traveling from LA Havre France. How do they happen to know the Plunkett’s? It’s quite a story, you’ll enjoy it. Until then.... No calendar events have been scheduled for today.""}]"

Sanya Pirani You may call me a Grinch, but I cannot stand Christmas decorations, music or festivities until after Thanksgiving. I avoid all things Christmas until exactly the day after Thanksgiving. However, I fear that many of us avoid current events the same way I avoid Christmas festivities. Especially while family members sit together to eat Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner, it’s often custom to avoid politics or societal concerns. It would bring down the mood to talk about depressing topics, right? However, when we avoid topics like these in our own families, we make these topics appear taboo. It’s the time of year to finally remove “now’s not the time” from our phrases because we must always make time to speak out about worldly concerns. For when we finally make an effort to speak about these issues, we can inspire ourselves and others to help make a difference. With rising tension throughout the world and increased economic concerns, it is essential that we inform and educate our community so that everyone can play a part in benefiting our society. When gathered around the dinner table this holiday season, have a progressive approach. I urge you to talk about the “hard to talk about” subject matters. Talk about politics, talk about social justice issues, talk about economics, talk about climate change. Refuse to stay silent this holiday season, because these topics deserve to be heard. If you’re interested in doing your part to help our community, my nonprofit organization Sanya’s Hope For Children has lots of volunteering opportunities this time of year. This year we really need help. We are short on volunteers, funds, and sponsors. Here’s what you can do to help: Donate: Write a check to Sanya’s Hope For Children or visit our link to our online donation option. To donate online, visit www.sanyashopeforchildren.org/donate/. Volunteers: Business partners: If you are a corporate partner or a business owner, you can offer matching funds or you can keep our compassion jars in your store location to collect loose change for us.

Albert Lea is no different. While the area did not see any natural disasters this year and it was not a major election year, there was plenty in the way of other breaking news events. The Tribune editor, publisher and staff sat down at the beginning of December to look back through the big stories of the year and narrow that list to the top 10 with several honorable mentions. After reviewing the events from 2023, the following are the top 10 stories of the year as voted on by Tribune staff: 1 Change after change reported this year in local health care Each year since 2017 when Mayo Clinic Health System announced its plans to move most inpatient services to the Austin campus, health care changes have been prevalent in the Albert Lea community. The changes continued this year, not only with the health system itself, but also with other health care entities in the city. In April, Mayo announced its plans to take down the original Naeve Hospital building and the adjacent building, citing safety concerns. The Naeve Hospital building, constructed in 1911, had not been used for patient care since 2016 due to concerns with the building’s age, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, the building became unoccupied as employees started working from home. The health system has stated it plans to turn the footprint of the building into a commemorative garden in the spring with a small parking lot to the north of the garden to accommodate more handicapped accessible parking stalls. In November, after weeks of preparation on the interior, construction crews began demolition of the exterior walls of the former hospital building. The demolition continued through the middle of December and included the original building, along with the additions in 1926, 1936 and 1946. At the end of December, crews were working to clean up the debris and remove the foundation. Work is slated to begin on the garden in the spring. Many in the community lamented the demolition of the hospital and said they wished the building could have been saved for another purpose. They recalled memories they or family members had there. HealthReach is at 1705 S.E. Broadway. Sarah Stultz/Albert Lea Tribune Mayo at the end of November also announced its plan to move all of the services from its HealthReach campus to the main Albert Lea hospital campus in 2024. This includes dialysis, hospice and therapy services. The health organization likewise announced it would close its Lake Mills location permanently and transition clinical services to its location in Albert Lea. As an alternative option, it would have a mobile health clinic in Lake Mills two days per week every other week for face-to-face primary care appointments. Aside from Mayo, MercyOne North Iowa Medical Center in August announced it would close its location at the end of the year. MercyOne Albert Lea Family Medicine & Specialty Care was in the former Herberger’s location. Abigail Chalmers/Albert Lea Tribune Mercy had been in Albert Lea about two years in a portion of the former Herberger’s location after being recruited to town by the grass-roots Albert Lea Healthcare Coalition. The health system cited the global pandemic, challenges in workforce recruitment and differences in regulations crossing into Minnesota as “unsurmountable” barriers. The Albert Lea clinic was its only location in Minnesota. Though disappointed, the leaders of the Albert Lea Healthcare Coalition said they would begin reaching out to the other health groups that showed interest in coming to Albert Lea previously and talk to them about the possibility of reconsidering that option. An announcement about a new partner has not yet been made. On top of these events, Sheila Calderon, a family nurse practitioner, opened an independent clinic called Patient’s Choice Wellness Clinic in September that has a focus on wellness and preventative health. The clinic is in the same building as the Community Foot Clinic. Calderon has said her goal is to have a personal relationship with her patients, especially after hearing from patients how hard it could be to see their primary doctors. Ahziyas Dampha 2 Man charged in death of 2-year-old boy Albert Lea man Austin Navarro in July was charged with second-degree murder and child endangerment in the death of 2-year-old Ahziyas Dampha at Trailside Apartments. An autopsy revealed Ahziyas suffered from multiple bruises, abrasions, broken ribs and internal bleeding resulting from a lacerated liver and pancreas, according to the Freeborn County Attorney’s Office. Austin Navarro The court complaint stated the child was in Navarro’s care while his mother was working, along with a 3-month old baby that the woman and Navarro had in common. The mother told police she had received the first of several text messages at 10:02 a.m. July 6, stating the 2-year-old had fallen down the stairs. She exchanged text messages asking for photos of the child to evaluate his condition and it wasn’t until more than an hour and a half later that he reportedly sent a photo showing the child with blood on his lips, severe bruising and appearing unresponsive. After seeing pictures of the injuries, the mother left work, and when she attempted to walk into the house she had to force the door open because a knife had been wedged in the door. She found Navarro upstairs locked behind a bedroom door with their 3-month-old baby in his arms and her 2-year-old child laying on the bed unresponsive. When officers were dispatched to the apartments, at 504 James Ave., an officer was informed that Navarro had left the scene. The officer stopped Navarro in a vehicle about nine blocks away, and Navarro reportedly stated he had left the scene because he was scared. The 3-month-old baby was also in the vehicle. The infant was later also found to have broken ribs. Prosecutors in August filed a motion stating they will seek aggravated sentencing in the case because Navarro reportedly injured the child while in a position of trust, the victim was particularly vulnerable due to age and because he was reportedly treated with particular cruelty. Prosecutors also stated they plan to introduce evidence regarding prior domestic conduct, including bruises that reportedly appeared on Ahziyas’ arms, legs, side and face after Navarro and the child’s mother started dating. Some bruises reportedly even appeared to be shaped like handprints. In addition, prosecutors cited calls made in the jail between Navarro and his mother in which Navarro reportedly admitted to assaulting the child. Navarro’s lawyer in December motioned to suppress all confessions, admissions or statements made by his client, noting it would be a violation of his constitutional rights to use the statements as evidence. The lawyer also motioned to dismiss the case, stating there was insufficient probable cause for the arrest and insufficient probable cause to believe he committed the offense. Navarro is next slated to appear in court March 8. Candace Pesch 3 County board terminates county administrator; board ultimately promotes county assessor to administrator role, approves other leadership changes After promoting former Freeborn County Human Resources director Candace Pesch to the role of administrator in October 2022, the Freeborn County Board of Commissioners in April voted to terminate Pesch after an almost 2-1/2-hour closed session. Chairman John Forman said: “At the meeting, the majority of the board concluded that the administrator had not gained the confidence of a majority of the board members during her initial six-month probationary period and that continuation of her employment at this time was not the most appropriate course of action.” The action came on a 3-2 vote, with Brad Edwin, Dawn Kaasa and Chris Shoff voting to terminate Pesch, while Forman and 5th District Commissioner Nicole Eckstrom voted against it. With the vote came the opening of the Human Resources director position as well, which was still being handled at the time by Pesch. In May, the board approved appointing Assessor Ryan Rasmusson as interim county administrator until a new full-time administrator was hired. Rasmusson had been with the county for over 20 years. They began advertising for a new administrator again with South Central Service Cooperative of North Mankato. Ryan Rasmusson By July, they had received a pool of 12 applicants, with five candidates identified as being well qualified. However, when three of the candidates withdrew from the recruitment process due to various personal reasons, the board voted to suspend the search, and Rasmusson would continue as interim. In October, discussions started again about steps to fill the permanent position, and in November the board said they planned to go into closed session to review Rasmusson’s performance and consider how to proceed with the position in the future. After more than six months with Rasmusson as interim administrator, the board voted Nov. 28 to appoint Rasmusson to the permanent role. The board also voted to appoint Erin Hornberger as the Human Resources manager for the county. She'}]"

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:07 am Now, more than ever, the world needs trustworthy reporting—but good journalism isn’t free. Please support us by subscribing or making a contribution. We are, it seems to me, a society afflicted by a persistent, unshakable sense of foreboding and dread. Most modern commercial enterprises—the advertising everywhere, the news media we consume, the service industry and its offerings, the shape of modern medicine—seem designed (1) to stir up fear/outrage about what may be around the corner, and (2) to offer little tin gods for purchase which promise to protect and deliver. It all contributes to (and arises from) a pervasive dread of something bad on the horizon, some global or societal or personal catastrophe. Perhaps it’s fear of a terminal disease or the next pandemic. Perhaps it’s great dis-ease about losing our freedoms and rights, or about societal order as we know it crumbling to the ground. Maybe it’s fear that the land itself is crumbling apart—that is, that “nature” will be ruined. Maybe what we anxiously dread is going into bankruptcy, or maybe, for some, that our moral bankruptcy will be exposed. Perhaps our persistent foreboding has to do with mass shootings or the possibility of war. For many across the globe, it’s not fear of possible war. Living in ongoing warzones, their daily dread is literal enemy fire, stray bullets, and the fiery devastation of the next missile. They don’t know exactly when it will strike, but every day and every night, every moment for them, is flavored with foreboding that the bomb is coming. Foreboding seems to be the name of the game in the modern world. Contemporary pop culture has simplified it to a tagline: Winter is coming. And most of us, I dare say, live with persistent dread of its arrival. Surprising as it may sound, Advent and Christmastide are seasons especially devoted to giving a name to the dread that we all live with, or that we should all be well acquainted with were we to know reality aright. Maybe you thought Christmas was about trying to ignore for a little while the normally constant background noise of dread and foreboding in your life, of trying to feign a little bit of cheer in an otherwise dread-filled existence, of trying to numb the dread with parties and presents. But on the contrary, Christmas is for looking the dread in the face, for honestly naming it. For the Advent and Christmas message is summed up in this: God comes to us! The Son of God comes, and he comes for a fearful reckoning that’s at the bottom of the constant foreboding and dread of our lives. God comes to us—not some abstraction like “war” or “bankruptcy,” nor an impersonal disease or fiery bomb explosion, but the living, seeing, discerning reckoner. He is the almighty King and Judge. And he comes for judgment. As sinners, every single one of us is fully deserving of the judgment the Son of God comes to bring, which means that Christmas—i.e., the coming of God to us—is decidedly bad news. And only by first grasping and honestly acknowledging this sobering reality can we come to truly receive and rejoice in the fact that Christmas is also good news. For the God who comes to pour out judgment does so “veiled in flesh,” as the old carol puts it: he comes incarnate as a man. Why? So that, as a man, he might be able to die on the cross, suffering the infinite judgment and justice of God in the place of all who repent and believe in him. It is my prayer for you that as we near the end of Advent, you would prepare with proper fear and trembling ahead of God’s arrival—that is, that you might repent of your sin, turning from the idols you rely on for life, and turning to the only one who truly holds the good life in his hands. May you, by believing in Jesus, discover this Christmas to be the merriest of all, one filled with wonder, worship, forgiveness, and true fellowship with the God who comes to us.
