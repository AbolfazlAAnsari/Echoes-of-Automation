With voters already concerned about Biden’s age — he turns 80 in November — his aides emphasized that he was working despite his illness.They released photos of him talking on the phone, and Biden participated in virtual meetings with advisers. His voice was hoarse and he coughed through a conversation on Friday, but he had significantly improved after the weekend.“I’m not keeping the same hours, but I’m meeting all my requirements that have come before me,” Biden said Monday.Although presidents benefit from household attendants, Biden’s infection brought a few unglamorous glimpses of life with COVID-19.Shortly before 7 a.m. on Monday, he said, he felt “the nuzzle of my dog’s nose against my chest.”“My wife’s not here, she usually takes him out,” he said.Then, during another meeting on Tuesday, the dog interrupted the conversation by barking in the background.Associated Press writer Carla K.

Trefz. Well, that is about to change. In addition to the name, the public will also know the man - Christian J. Trefz - when his memoir, “The Right Side of the Hamburger,” is released at a book launch event in – YES! – the Trefz Forum on Saturday, July 9. In association with The Legacy Project USA, a Westport-based company specializing in documenting and writing life stories for people who want to preserve and tell their history, Trefz spent over a year collaborating and working on writing his memoir. As he says, “There’s a lot to do in life and if we are happy with our accomplishments, we should put it in writing. They’re going to know who I am!” “The Right Side of the Hamburger” will indeed tell the story of who Christian J. Trefz is and how he and his brother became so successful. The son of German immigrants, Chris and his brother Ernie grew up in the New Haven area of Connecticut learning life’s best and most reliable lessons of family closeness, hard work, and determination. Chris and Ernie purchased their first McDonald’s franchise in 1964. That was the beginning of an empire that grew to over 50 McDonald’s restaurants throughout Connecticut and New York. There is probably a large possibility that everyone in the State of Connecticut has eaten at one of the Trefz McDonald’s restaurants. “The Right Side of the Hamburger” is available for purchase at the Westport Library and on Amazon.

The cross, the Host and the Virgin Mary. These are the three pillars on which you have to build a Christian life.” The cardinal said being prefect of the Vatican’s divine worship office really drove home for him the importance of the liturgy being a great and unique moment “to encounter God face-to-face and to be transformed by him as a child of God and as a true worshipper of God.” “Liturgy,” he added, “must be beautiful, it must be sacred, and it must be silent.” He warned against turning the Mass into a “spectacle” or just a gathering of friends, taking the focus off of worship of God. “I will encourage that the liturgy becomes more and more sacred, more and more holy, more and more silent, because God is silent, and we encounter God in silence, in adoration,” he said. “I think that the formation of the people of God to the liturgy is very important. We can show people the beauty, to be reverent, and to keep silent in the liturgy, in which our encounter with Christ is deepened.” Cardinal Sarah also praised silent Eucharistic adoration as a chance to encounter Christ in a way that can “really change our lives.” Cardinal Robert Sarah | Daniel Ibanez/CNA Commenting on modern society, the cardinal said: “God has been forgotten.” “We all live as if God doesn’t exist. Confusion reigns everywhere. Too many would reduce our lives, the very meaning of our lives, to absolute individualism and the pursuit of fleeting pleasure.” Christians, he said, should respond by returning to the basics of the faith. “We require a retreat from the world, withdrawal into the desert, where we can relearn the fundamentals, the basics: monotheism, the revelation of Jesus Christ, us and God, his word, our sin, our dependence and need of his mercy,” he said. Cardinal Sarah said God, through his Church and the sacraments, “guides us into an ever-deeper relationship with him. And we all have a need to reacquaint ourselves with his profound gift, which is his love.” Faith in the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist, he said, is one of the Church’s fundamental beliefs, without which, “she loses the meaning of her existence.” “The Church is not a social organization to meet the problems of migration or poverty,” he continued. “The Church has a divine purpose: to save the world.” “If Christ does not dwell within the Church, tangibly, visibly, sacramentally, then what good news do we have to offer to the world? What is the meaning of evangelization?” he said. “When Christians forget why they are Christian, the community must fall into decline. They forget the Gospel and lose sight of their purpose.” Cardinal Sarah said spiritual warfare is much the same as it has ever been, even if many bishops and priests have ceased to remind Catholics of its reality. Our weapon in this war, he explained, is the word of God. There is a need “to turn to God every day, not just for consolation amid worldly adversities, but because we depend upon him entirely in the cosmic struggle. We are all at war, whether we recognize it or not. It is good that all of us should become aware of that fact and make sure every day that we fight on the side of God,” he said. Cardinal Robert Sarah | Daniel Ibanez/CNA His latest book, Catechism of the Spiritual Life, Cardinal Sarah said, is meant to be a response to the “confusion of this day, outside and even inside the Church.” “I saw a need for a representation of some reflections on our spiritual progress in our spiritual life: progress in our personal and intimate relationship with Jesus Christ.” He added that he hopes his book answers “a profound need of our time.” “Every one of us must strive, continuously, to draw closer to Jesus Christ, to return to his word, and to the simplicity of the faith in his self-revelation. It is the simplicity of the desert, of recognition of our dependence upon God, and encountering him and the gift of his love and his grace, by which he configured us to himself,” he said. “That is why I decided to write Catechism of the Spiritual Life.” ‘If we are not one, if we are divided, then our witness to Christ is divided and the world will not believe in the Gospel,’ Cardinal Robert Sarah said Feb. 22. Cardinal Robert Sarah shared his reflection, which says that the Church should respond to same-sex couples with the mercy of truth, with an Italian blog.

A Dutch semiconductor manufacturer’s expansion of its Wilton facility broke ground on Monday, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by state politicians. The company, ASML, is expanding the footprint of its design, engineering and production center. ASML employs more than 2,000 people in the Fairfield County town. The addition will allow ASML to add 1,000 new jobs at the site over the next two years, according to Gov. Ned Lamont. The site is ASML’s largest research/development and manufacturing center in the United States. The company announced the $200 million expansion at its headquarters in Veldhoven, Netherlands on May 31.
