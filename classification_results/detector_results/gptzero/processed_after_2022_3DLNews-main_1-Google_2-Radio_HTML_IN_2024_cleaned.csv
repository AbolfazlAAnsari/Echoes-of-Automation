The flight attendants are increasingly frustrated that pilots won huge pay raises last year while they continue to work for wages that, in some cases, have not increased in several years. They argue that they have not been rewarded for working through the pandemic and being responsible for the safety of passengers. The unions are calling Tuesdayâs protests a national day of action. It is not a strike â federal law makes it difficult for airline unions to conduct legal strikes. The unions planned to picket at some of the nationâs busiest airports in New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and elsewhere. âWe havenât had a raise in five years. Our flight attendants have seen the very rich contracts that the pilots did get, and they expect American Airlines to come to the table,â said Julie Hedrick, president of the union at American. Pilots had tremendous leverage in winning big raises because of a shortage. It takes years of flying for pilots to meet requirements to work for an airline. That is not the case for flight attendants. Airlines have bragged in the past about how many people applied when they advertised openings for flight attendants. Tuesdayâs protests were organized by Hedrick's union, the Association of Professional Flight Attendants; and the Association of Flight Attendants, which represents crews at United Airlines, Alaska Airlines and several other carriers; and the Transport Workers Union, which represents crews at Southwest. The unions have conducted strike votes to put pressure on company negotiators, but of course management knows that airline strikes can be delayed or blocked by federal mediators, the president and Congress. Mediators have already turned down one request by flight attendants at American Airlines to begin a countdown to a strike.

COUNTRY We have some extremely cold temperatures, below freezing, coming through our area over the next few days. Now is the time to plan ahead. We here in Southern Indiana especially have had a pretty mild winter thus far. That being said, the snow and dangerously cold temperatures are on the way. According to Eyewitness News Meteorologist Joe Bird, beginning this weekend, we will see some possible snow and temperatures well below freezing (32 degrees), and the temperature will continue to drop into the single digits by early next week. I know that I am not the only person who is not ready for the colder weather, but ready or not, it's coming. One thing that you might not think of doing is checking your vehicle to see if you have anything in there that you shouldn't have when it's below freezing outside. USA Today listed six items that you should remove from your vehicle when the temperature is below freezing. Of course, some of these might be common sense to you, but you might not have thought of a few of these before. If it gets too cold it can cause the device to shut off or, worse, mess up the battery. Not only that, but it could cause the screen to crack...which reminds me, I need to get my iPod and GPS out of my truck! If you don't want a mess in your vehicle, take them out! When it freezes, the container expands and can explode. This results in all of that getting all over your car! Make sure you check to make sure you got everything out of your car after going to the grocery. These have the same effect as beverages...the water can freeze and expand, which could break the can's seal and cause the food to spoil. The wood can crack if it's too cold. And even if that doesn't happen, they'll definitely drift out of tune...and nobody wants to listen to an out-of-tune instrument...let alone pay for the repairs! Certain drugs can lose their effectiveness if they get too cold. This is important! Keeping your tank more than half full helps prevent fuel lines from freezing. It's also a good idea to check other fluids such as antifreeze. And the cold can affect tire pressure, so keep an eye on that too.

Also this weekend, Carrie Underwood reached out to share a story about him. The two of them connected on numerous levels and she says one of the things she respected most about Tobyâ¦ was his love for their home state of Oklahoma: âThere are so many things that can be said about Mr. Toby Keith. I mean, obviously, he has had such a monumental career. He has some of the biggest songs that ever, ever were or probably ever will be in country music, and obviously, has built up that legacy for himself that will live on,â says Carrie. âBut I think one of the best things about Toby is his love for Oklahoma.

No matter how big and famous he got, he was gonna stay in Oklahoma, and he was always the first one there when disaster would strike â tornado or whatever it was. He was the first one like trying to rally the troops or raise money or help out in any way he could. I feel like thatâs one of the things that I respect the most about him, he never forgot where he came from and has been such a stellar example to the rest of us to do the same. He, of course, will be missed, but I know full, full well where he is right now. Heâs with Jesus, and I for one look forward to hearing him sing again someday. So, prayers and comfort to his family. Weâre gonna miss ya, buddy, but weâll see ya on the other side.â : 1:33 This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.""}]"
