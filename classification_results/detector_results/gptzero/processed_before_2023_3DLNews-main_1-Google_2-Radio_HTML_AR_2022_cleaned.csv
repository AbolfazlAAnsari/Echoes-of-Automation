Milwaukee Public Market, Matthew Grover has one thing on his mind: getting voters to turn out. ""It\'s extremely important,"" he tells two health care workers. ""If we get the right people in positions of power, we can do all of these things simultaneously."" Grover is a regional field organizer for NextGen America, a youth voting group. And on a recent Saturday morning he was asking young people whether they are planning to vote during the midterms. That\'s because even though young voters turned out in increasing numbers in the last two election cycles, the most recent NPR/Marist national poll found that this year, young voters were among the least likely to vote this fall. Tom Bonier, CEO of TargetSmart, a Democratic-leaning data firm, says there are some preconceived notions about young voters — that they are not a factor in midterm elections. ""And so campaigns tended not to spend resources on talking to younger voters and engaging with them,"" he said. And Bonier says that in the end, voter turnout between the 2014 and 2018 election increased. He says there could be a big turnout this year, too. In Wisconsin alone, more than 300,000 people have already voted by mail or in person. ""We are seeing at this point greater engagement from women and younger voters and from voters of color than we saw in 2020 or 2018,"" Bonier said. So we went to Wisconsin — where there are hotly contested races for the U.S. Senate and governor — to see if recent events, such as the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in the Dobbs decision, have enticed more voters to register. And they have. ""Specifically, since Dobbs, there\'s been an increase in voter registrations among women and younger voters,"" Bonier said. ""We\'re seeing the highest intensity surges among women under the age of 25. And it\'s definitely true in Wisconsin, but that\'s something that\'s been almost universally true around the country."" And for new voters like 19-year-old Kai Rowlands, making sure those in office pay attention to the youth vote is important, too. Rowlands, a student at Marquette University, says those in office need to make sure ""the younger generations\' views are being taken into consideration and need to be represented."" Young voters are known as reliable pillars of the Democratic base. And at a time when the Democratic Party is seeing low favorability, we asked Rowlands and two other left-leaning voters in Milwaukee about the issues they see as most important. Those issues ranged from abortion to the economy to climate change. Looming over the midterms is the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade — which meant states can enact their own abortion laws. In Wisconsin, an 1849 law banning abortion took effect after the Supreme Court decision. And it\'s weighing heavily on people\'s minds. Kara Walla, a 29-year-old software engineer, is starting to think about having children, but worries what choices she will be left with if something goes wrong. ""Now I\'m having to think about being in that position — of having something go wrong in a pregnancy and then not being able to access health care until the point where my own health is threatened, as well,"" Walla said. ""And it\'s really scary."" It\'s also really scary for Rowlands, who thinks about what that means for his younger sister. The Supreme Court, ""they\'re all kind of opinionated in their own ways and support what they want, not what the country wants,"" he said. In a recent Marquette University Law School poll, inflation was one of the top concerns among respondents. And it\'s true for Gen Z voters, like 20-year-old Melanie Medina. Medina, a dental receptionist, worries about how expensive her bills have gotten — from groceries to rent. ""I moved out from home right when I was 18. It was semi cheap then,"" she said. Now, she lives with her boyfriend, a roommate, and their cats. And rent has only gotten more expensive. The economy is also top of mind for Walla. ""My husband and I just bought a house last year,"" she said. ""And between the mortgage payments and then car payments, we\'re starting to think is it even doable to have kids in this economy?"" President Biden\'s approval rating among young voters has improved over the past few months, according to recent NPR polling. But that doesn\'t mean he should run again in 2024, Rowlands says. ""My grandparents are similar ages to him and there\'s no way I\'d want one of my grandparents running the country. And that\'s no offense to them,"" he said. ""I don\'t think that that level of uncertainty is necessarily something we should look for in a leader."" Walla, the only millennial we spoke to, is eager to see more young people in office. ""And at this point, it\'s like by younger you could be a younger person in politics in your 60s,"" she said. For Medina, climate change has caused her a lot of anxiety.

Wade has been reversed, and with it, the entire liberal agenda is in trouble. As Justice Clarence Thomas observed in his concurrence in the Dobbs case: “[I]n future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell.” Griswold found a constitutional right to contraception – and prevented states from regulating its use. Lawrence invented a constitutional right to sodomy – and prevented states from prohibiting unnatural acts. Obergefell created a constitutional right to same-sex marriage – and nullified the ability of states to define marriage according to the historical and natural definition of one man/one woman. In order to protect the newly created right to same-sex marriage, however, the U.S. House has passed “The Respect for Marriage Act” (H.R. 8404). The bill is a threat to real constitutional rights – the rights to free speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of assembly. The legislation could also be used by the IRS to revoke the tax status of Christian schools, universities and nonprofits. This was a leadership decision. The Respect for Marriage Act was introduced on July 18, 2022. It passed the House three days later. The vote in the House wasn’t even close! H.R. 8404 passed 267 to 157. This means 47 Republicans voted for it. For Nancy Pelosi, this is a legacy item. The legislation has been fast-tracked in the U.S. Senate. There will be no committee hearings, and the bill could come to the floor at any time. In other words, it is a priority, and the Democrats will be willing to trade almost anything to get moderate Republicans on board. They need 60 votes to avoid a filibuster, which means they need 10 Republicans to support their radical agenda. We have to stop them. If we don’t, the nonprofit status of Christian schools, universities and nonprofits like AFA will come under the intense scrutiny of the IRS. Contact your U.S. Senators today! We need your help to tell Senators to stand strong against H.R. 8404. The so-called Respect for Marriage Act (H.R. 8404) would essentially give federal protection to same-sex marriage. But that’s not all. In doing so, the law would create a “private right of action” that activists will use to sue anyone who gets in their way. The bill also authorizes the Department of Justice to go after violators. This will include a wide array of Christian nonprofits, starting with adoption agencies and foster-care providers and other groups that work with federal and state governments. The ultimate aim of the bill is to eliminate any chance of there being a legal challenge to Obergefell. State legislatures will be intimidated into doing nothing, as the supporters of traditional marriage are silenced and canceled. Worse still, the Respect for Marriage Act could be used by the IRS to try to force K-12 religious schools to hire same-sex married teachers. It could be used to try to require Christian universities to enroll same-sex married students. It could even be used to destroy the nonprofit status of pro-family groups like AFA. We need your help to tell Senators to vote NO on the Respect for Marriage Act. This vote will be one of the most important votes the Senate takes this year. They need to hear from you today.
