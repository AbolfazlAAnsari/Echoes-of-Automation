Court begins weighing Julian Assange's fate today. A MARTÍNEZ, HOST: A two-day hearing will determine whether the WikiLeaks founder will be extradited to the U.S. to face spying charges. This case goes back to the 2010 publication of hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. government documents related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. FADEL: NPR's Lauren Frayer is at our bureau in London and joins us now. Good morning, Lauren. LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila. FADEL: So bring us up to speed on Julian Assange. I mean, I have this image of him on a balcony of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he was taking refuge for years. Where is he now? FRAYER: He was there. Now he's in a high-security prison here in London, Belmarsh prison. And he's been there for the past five years. Before that, he was - your memory serves you correctly - in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. Here's a recap. In 2010, Assange was arrested here in London at the behest of Sweden, where two women had accused him of rape and sexual assault. He jumped bail in that case, took refuge in that Ecuadorian Embassy. After seven years, the Ecuadorians evicted him, and he was arrested by the U.K. for breaching that bail. Now, the Swedish charges have since been dropped, but in the meantime, the U.S. has charged him with 17 counts of espionage and one count of computer misuse. FADEL: Ooh, lots of twists and turns there. FRAYER: Yeah. FADEL: I mean, OK, so this goes back to Chelsea Manning and her leak of U.S. military files during the Iraq War, right? FRAYER: Exactly. So Chelsea Manning was a U.S. Army intelligence analyst in Baghdad. In early 2010, she leaked hundreds of thousands of secret files to WikiLeaks, which shared them with media organizations and published them. And this was one of the biggest security breaches in the U.S. military ever. It included this now-infamous, then-classified video of a 2007 U.S. helicopter attack that killed about a dozen people in Baghdad, including two Reuters journalists. FADEL: Yeah, of course I remember that video really well. It became an important story for the public to know. You and I were both based in Baghdad at the time. FRAYER: Yeah. FADEL: Chelsea Manning went to prison, and her sentence was commuted by then-President Obama. But the case against Assange still remains. FRAYER: It does. And it actually could have implications for media like you and me. Assange's lawyers say he is a publisher. Reporters Without Borders and other press freedom groups say this case sets a dangerous precedent for journalists to be charged with espionage for work that they do that's in the public interest. Now, Assange's lawyers also say they're concerned about his health. Last week, I interviewed Assange's wife, Stella Assange. She is a lawyer whom he married in 2022 while in prison, and they have two children together. Here's what she had to say. STELLA ASSANGE: Well, it's impossible to describe what we've been through, and Julian's life is at stake in a bogus case that criminalizes journalism. FRAYER: She says her husband is at risk of suicide, and he is obsessed with this idea that the CIA wants to kill him, so he doesn't want to be transferred to the U.S. FADEL: So let's talk about exactly what the U.K. court will decide today or in the next couple days. FRAYER: Yeah, there are two U.K. judges who are deciding whether Assange can appeal an extradition order that is already been signed by the U.K. government. So the U.K. is not weighing whether Assange is a journalist. They're only weighing whether he can be extradited safely. The question of guilt or the validity of his defense will be decided at a U.S. trial if that happens. So after two days of arguments, today and tomorrow, the judges could announce their decision tomorrow night. It could take a couple of weeks. Assange's wife told me, though, that she's not optimistic, and she thinks he could actually be on a plane to the U.S. within days. FADEL: NPR's Lauren Frayer in London. Thank you, Lauren. FRAYER: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: More than half of Gaza's population has sought shelter in the southern region of Rafah, across the border from Egypt. FRAYER: Israel is warning of an impending ground invasion in that area if hostages aren't freed by Hamas, and the Biden administration is warning Israel not to advance without first ensuring the more than 1 million people sheltering there have an opportunity to seek safety somewhere else. FADEL: NPR's Aya Batrawy is following all of this and joins us now from Dubai. Good morning, Aya. AYA BATRAWY, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila. FADEL: So let's start with Rafah. What's the situation there for people? BATRAWY: Well, as you note, at least a million people have fled their homes and have sought shelter in Rafah, many of them living in makeshift tents after being pushed from their homes by Israeli ground operations in other areas like the north. And there was hope that Rafah would be a safe zone, but it's not. There is no safe place in Gaza for civilians, and people are growing desperate. The number of aid trucks entering Gaza has fluctuated dramatically in recent days from one day to the next. Some days a hundred trucks go in. On other days, just a fraction of that. And now there's growing concern about hunger, disease and hospitals collapsing. You know, already more than 29,000 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, have been killed by direct violence in this war, according to the health ministry there, a war that began October 7 when Hamas attacked Israel. And in that attack they took 240 hostages and 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli officials. FADEL: Yeah. And some of those hostages have been released, and some still remain. Israel has carried out airstrikes on Rafah. What do we know about their impact? BATRAWY: Israel says Hamas battalions are active in Rafah. But civilians have also suffered there. I mean, there are so many stories of loss and trauma. And here's one from Sunday. Around two dozen people were sheltering in a home in Rafah when an airstrike hit the house. Just five people survived. Now, among those killed, Leila, in that airstrike were a newlywed couple. They'd been engaged for about a year and decided to go ahead and tie the knot on Thursday. NPR's producer in Gaza, Anas Baba, spoke to the bride's father, Abdulsalam Deeb, about his daughter, Mariam Deeb. And here's what he said. ABDULSALAM DEEB: (Non-English language spoken). BATRAWY: He says his daughter had only been married for two days when she and her husband were killed and that they didn't even get a chance to experience life and see the world. He says, I wish I could say goodbye to her, kiss her and hug her. Her body is still under the rubble. FADEL: Wow. It's really hard to hear the helplessness of all these families and stories like this. Now, of course, the Biden administration continues to back Israel's war in Gaza against Hamas, providing weapons and aid to Israel's military. But the president has also cautioned Israel against rushing into a ground invasion of Rafah. What do we know, though, about Israel's plans? BATRAWY: Well, Israel's war Cabinet has been vague about Rafah, just as they've been unclear about where this war is headed and what the future of Gaza is going to look like. Now, there has been a push by mediators to get a truce in place, preferably before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins in about three weeks. But over the weekend, a member of Israel's war Cabinet said that if hostages aren't freed by Ramadan, fighting would continue everywhere in Gaza, including in Rafah. FADEL: Egypt has expressed real concern about the possibility that a ground invasion of Rafah would push Palestinians across the border into its territory. How's that affecting relations between Egypt and Israel? BATRAWY: Relations are really tense. I mean, there haven't been any direct calls between Egypt's president and Israel's prime minister, but Egypt is still trying to get Hamas and Israel to agree to a cease-fire of some kind. Now, as a precaution, Egyptian security officials tell NPR Egypt is constructing a walled-off security zone that could take up to 150,000 Palestinians on its side of the border in case people do break through and breach Egypt's border. Egypt is very concerned that any displacement of Palestinians into Egypt would be permanent and that it would drag Egypt into the war. FADEL: NPR's Aya Batrawy in Dubai. Thank you, Aya. BATRAWY: Thank you, Leila. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: As in many states, people in Louisiana are worried about rising crime. MARTÍNEZ: Yeah, and the state Legislature opened a""}]"

Democratic lawmakers in the House of Representatives are seeking a new path to foreign aid for U.S. allies after Republicans halted the passing of a foreign aid package last week. On Friday,eight centrist Republican and Democratic lawmakers introduced a new funding bill that includes both aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, in addition to a new border security policy. ""The objective is to advance legislation that will not only defend our borders in the United States, but defend democracies around the globe,"" Representative Mike Lawler (R-NY) told NPR\'s A Martinez during an interview with Morning Edition. Lawler told Morning Edition that House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La) has not yet commented on the bill, but he hopes that the Speaker will bring the bill to the floor. Democrats in the House have already balked at the measure, which gives less foreign aid to countries than the bill the Senate passed last week. ""In a divided government, we all have to find compromise,"" Lawler said. The House is now in recess for the next two weeks, and it\'s unclear where the the $66.3 billion bipartisan package, titled the ""Defending Borders, Defending Democracies Act "" will stand once they are back. The House left the Capitol on Friday without taking up a Senate-approved bill that would provide $60 billion to Ukraine or commenting on this new bill. This new bill does not include humanitarian aid for Gaza, Ukraine and other global hotspots, and reinstates the ""remain in Mexico"" provision known as H.R.2. This provision would require cooperation from Mexico, which the country has rejected. The policy would require some migrants, including asylum seekers, to wait in Mexico while their claims are adjudicated. The Supreme Court upheld President Biden\'s decision to end the policy when he took office. The bill\'s backers did not provide a solution for making Mexico comply. ""That\'s something we\'ll have to work out,"" Representative Don Bacon (R-NE) told reporters on Friday. ""I\'m not an ambassador, so I have no idea how they\'re going to respond. Our guys want something that makes a difference on the border."" But without serious support from Democrats in the House, this bill is unlikely to pass if Johnson agrees to bring it to the floor in two weeks. The Senate bill did not include provisions to secure the U.S.- Mexico border, but did clear the chamber with 70 Democrats and Republican senators voting yes on the bill. Johnson, however, said the bill did not ""meet the moment"" with the legislation, pointing out the exclusion of border security policies. Before the bill was even introduced, senior Democrats urged Johnson to hold a vote on the bipartisan legislation that has already passed the Senate. ""This is clear. Mike Johnson simply needs to put the bipartisan national security bill on the House floor for an up-or-down vote, and it will pass. That\'s it,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said last Wednesday. President Biden criticized GOP leadership on Monday for taking a recess so close to the two year anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine war. It was the third time in four days that Biden took aim at Republicans in the House for the two week recess. ""They\'re walking away from the threat of Russia, they\'re walking away from NATO. They\'re walking away from meeting our obligations,"" Biden told reporters on Monday. When the House reconvenes on February 28th, the main focus will probably be averting a government shutdown – they have just three days to approve spending measures to avoid a partial shutdown. The remaining agencies will need to be funded by March 8th. The audio version of this story was produced by Ben Abrams and edited by Mohamad ElBardicy Copyright 2024 NPR.
