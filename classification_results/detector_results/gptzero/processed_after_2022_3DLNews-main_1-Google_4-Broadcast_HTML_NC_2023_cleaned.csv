a public education free from discrimination, but a WCNC Charlotte investigation found schools in North Carolina report suspending and expelling students with disabilities, per capita, more than any other state in the country. North Carolina\'s reliance on this form of punishment forces vulnerable kids, many of them in elementary school, to miss weeks of classroom learning. Advocates say the research shows exclusionary discipline doesn\'t correct the behavior and only creates more problems for students and society. Oftentimes, they say the punishment is discriminatory. On a Monday afternoon in late July, school is the last thing on 9-year-old Cohen\'s mind. Instead, the rising fourth grader is carefree on a playground in Kannapolis enjoying summer break. ""He\'s amazing,"" his mother Julia Waitt said smiling. ""He\'s autistic, but it\'s not really a disability for him. It\'s more like an ability. He\'s extremely smart."" Diagnosed with autism, anxiety and ADHD, Cohen can be challenging. That\'s why Waitt has spent years adapting her behavior to meet her son\'s needs. She said his former school failed to do the same. ""It was awful,"" Waitt told WCNC Charlotte of his experience. ""I honestly don\'t know how he passed the second grade. I feel like they just pushed him out."" Cohen is now more than a year removed from his time at Landis Elementary School. During second grade there, records show his ""inappropriate,"" ""aggressive"" and ""disruptive"" behavior prompted Rowan-Salisbury Schools to suspend him for a combined 17 days. ""He would get suspended and then come back and then get suspended for the same thing again,"" his mom said. ""He was disruptive because his needs were not being met."" She said the cycle of suspensions fostered Cohen\'s unhealthy relationship with school. ""It makes me ill,"" she added. ""He was like, \'I hate it there.\'"" IF YOU HAVE A CHILD WITH A DISABILITY WHO EXPERIENCED THIS KIND OF DISCIPLINE, SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCE HERE A school is not supposed to suspend or expel a student if their behavior stems from their disability. Education attorneys consider that to be disability discrimination. ""I do feel like he was discriminated against, because they automatically tried to tag him as a bad child,"" Waitt said. ""He was not a bad child. He was struggling."" Required district reviews of Cohen\'s education and clinical history ultimately found his conduct had ""a direct or substantial relationship"" to his disability, records show. Those hearings determined the violations of the student code of conduct were in fact a manifestation of his disability. North Carolina\'s constitution lists education as a fundamental right. Beyond that, the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) ensures ""a free appropriate public education to eligible children with disabilities."" More than 210,000 students across North Carolina or 14% of all students are served under IDEA, according to state records. The latest federal data from the 2019-2020 school year, shared with Congress in April, shows North Carolina\'s public schools, per capita, reported this kind of discipline (greater than 10 days combined) more than any other state in the nation.

Rae LeGrone said North Carolina\'s problem is exacerbated by the state\'s lack of education funding. ""It\'s extremely unfair that students are left without the resources they need and that families are suffering,"" the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Association of Educators vice president said. ""Our state is shirking its responsibilities to the students in all of our buildings by underfunding."" ⏯ Subscribe to WCNC Charlotte on YouTube to be notified of new videos LeGrone is a high school art teacher. She said post-pandemic, there are even more students in need of individual attention and fewer teachers and support staff to help. LeGrone said state lawmakers could help overwhelmed and outmatched educators by properly funding education as ordered by the courts in the decades-old Leandro case. ""Teachers and support staff don\'t have the tools available to them in the classroom to differentiate and give every student a sound education,"" she said. ""I can\'t help but think that if every (elementary) classroom had a teacher\'s assistant like we used to, then a lot of these suspensions would not be taking place, because students\' needs would be met. Things that would be easily solved with having two adults in a classroom are now taking up a whole classroom\'s time, because there\'s one teacher who has to focus solely on one or two students, so it\'s really lessening the education of everybody in the school building."" DPI data show while the number of students has remained relatively stable over time, funding for teachers\' assistants has decreased by nearly 25% since 2005. In a statement, Gov. Roy Cooper\'s Office noted his budget fully funds the Leandro plan and would increase funding for students with disabilities by dedicating more resources to create smaller classrooms and add more support staff. Lawmakers have yet to finalize and approve a state budget. ""Every child in North Carolina has the right to a high-quality education and this report is concerning,"" Deputy Communications Director Jordan Monaghan said of WCNC Charlotte\'s reporting. ""While I would direct you to the Department of Public Instruction for specific questions on these policies, we know that many students have specific needs and our school policies must aim to meet those needs instead of simply removing those students from the classroom."" After Cohen\'s initial suspensions, emails show Rowan-Salisbury Schools and his teacher committed to a partnership that would help the second grader ""reach his greatest potential,"" all as his mother asked them to find ""ways to keep him in school."" By the time he hit 10 days of out-of-school suspensions, the district pledged to explore additional options to help him ""be'}]"

The main topics of the 15-minute speech were the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, and the war in Ukraine. The Middle East has entered a horrific new phase since Hamas killed about 1,400 Israelis in a surprise attack on Oct. 7. Israeli reprisals have killed around 3,800 Palestinians. A ground invasion of Gaza by Israel could come at any moment. On Ukraine, polls show American public commitment to the war wavering as the price tag for aid keeps rising. Biden’s speech was also delivered against a backdrop of dysfunction on Capitol Hill, where the House has been without a Speaker since Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) was ousted on Oct. 3. Here are the main takeaways from Biden’s speech. The central point of the speech was to make the case for new tranches of aid to Ukraine and to Israel. Biden said he would deliver a request to Congress on Friday. The total request, which also includes other issues like aid for Taiwan, is expected to be for about $100 billion. Rhetorically, Biden sought to draw parallels between the two conflicts, weaving them together into a narrative about the vital struggle against America’s foes. Hamas and Russian President Vladimir Putin both want to “completely annihilate a neighboring democracy,” Biden said. He further contended that Iran “is supporting Russia in Ukraine, and it is supporting Hamas and other terrorist groups in the region.” The bedrock of Biden’s argument was that resolute support of U.S. allies is essential for preserving American primacy in the world. American leadership, he contended, “is what holds the world together.” It would “put all that at risk if we walk away from Ukraine, turn our backs on Israel. It’s just not worth it.” It was a strong case. But Biden is also battling headwinds. There are tensions with progressives in his own party over the rights and wrongs of backing Israel so fervently. Republicans have long sought to characterize Biden’s leadership, at home and abroad, as weak and directionless. Moments before the president spoke, former President Trump’s campaign issued a statement in which it held Biden culpable for “the horrific catastrophes taking place in Israel” and accused him of displaying “incompetence, radicalism, and weakness.” The conflict in Israel and Gaza has resonated in the United States in grim ways. A six-year-old Muslim boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume, died Saturday after being stabbed in an alleged hate crime about 40 miles from Chicago. His mother was also stabbed and seriously injured. Jewish Americans have spoken of a growing sense of dread amid increasing instances of antisemitism. The most emotional passages of Biden’s speech addressed these problems. He demanded that both Islamophobia and antisemitism should be “without equivocation” renounced. Biden mentioned Wadea by name. He also drew a vivid picture of Jewish families worried about their children being targeted in school or being attacked themselves while “going out about their daily lives.” In times of discord and conflict, Biden insisted, “we have to work harder than ever to hold on to the values that make us who we are.” “We reject all forms — all forms — of hate, whether against Muslims, Jews or anyone,” he added. The conflict between Israel and the Palestinians has been in danger of widening since a Tuesday explosion at the al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City. The death toll, though disputed, appears to be in the triple figures. Palestinians blamed an Israeli airstrike. The Israelis said an errant rocket from Palestinian Islamic Jihad was responsible. Biden and his administration were clearly leaning toward the Israeli version of events when the president visited Israel on Wednesday. But in his remarks while overseas, Biden did caveat those remarks to some degree. Meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he said that “based on what I’ve seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you.” At a later appearance, he said it appeared a “terrorist group in Gaza” was responsible “based on the information we’ve seen to date.” That trace of equivocation was gone by Thursday. Biden said that he was “heartbroken by the tragic loss of Palestinian life, including the explosion at the hospital in Gaza — which was not done by the Israelis.” Biden had taken a shot at congressional Republicans while on Air Force One on his way back from Israel. Asked about the struggles of House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) to win the Speakership, Biden told reporters with obvious sarcasm “I ache for him.” Jordan, a fervent Trump loyalist, is one of the most aggressive Republicans in Congress and has been especially avid in pursuing the president’s son, Hunter Biden. However, the president avoided frontal attacks on the GOP during his Oval Office address, presumably judging that such remarks would seem discordant or petty in the somber setting.

Save Advertisers are fleeing social media platform X over concerns about their ads showing up next to pro-Nazi content and hate speech on the site in general, with billionaire owner Elon Musk inflaming tensions with his own posts endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory. IBM, NBCUniversal and its parent company Comcast said this week that they stopped advertising on X after a report said their ads were appearing alongside material praising Nazis â\x80\x94 a fresh setback as the platform formerly known as Twitter tries to win back big brands and their ad dollars, X\'s main source of revenue. The liberal advocacy group Media Matters said in a report Thursday that ads from Apple and Oracle also were placed next to antisemitic material on X. On Friday it said it also found ads from Amazon, NBA Mexico, NBCUniversal and others next to white nationalist hashtags. â\x80\x9cIBM has zero tolerance for hate speech and discrimination and we have immediately suspended all advertising on X while we investigate this entirely unacceptable situation,"" the company said in a statement. Spokespeople for Comcast and NBCUniversal confirmed on Saturday that the companies had â\x80\x9cpausedâ\x80\x9d their advertising on X but did not provide additional details on the decision. Media Matters said it found ads for NBCUniversal\'s Bravo network and its brand agency Catalyst next to antisemitic or white nationalist content. Apple, Oracle and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment. The European Union\'s executive branch said separately Friday it was pausing advertising on X and other social media platforms, in part because of a surge in hate speech. Later in the day, Disney, Lionsgate and Paramount Global also said they were suspending or pausing advertising on X. Musk sparked outcry this week with his own tweets responding to a user who accused Jews of hating white people and professing indifference to antisemitism. â\x80\x9cYou have said the actual truth,â\x80\x9d Musk tweeted in a reply Wednesday. Musk has faced accusations of tolerating antisemitic messages on the platform since purchasing it last year, and the content on X has gained increased scrutiny since the war between Israel and Hamas began. â\x80\x9cWe condemn this abhorrent promotion of Antisemitic and racist hate in the strongest terms, which runs against our core values as Americans,â\x80\x9d White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said Friday in response to Musk\'s tweet. X CEO Linda Yaccarino said X\'s â\x80\x9cpoint of view has always been very clear that discrimination by everyone should STOP across the board."" ""I think thatâ\x80\x99s something we can and should all agree on,â\x80\x9d she tweeted Thursday. Yaccarino, a former NBCUniversal executive, was hired by Musk to rebuild ties with advertisers who fled after he took over, concerned that his easing of content restrictions was allowing hateful and toxic speech to flourish and that would harm their brands. â\x80\x9cWhen it comes to this platform â\x80\x94 X has also been extremely clear about our efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination. Thereâ\x80\x99s no place for it anywhere in the world â\x80\x94 itâ\x80\x99s ugly and wrong. Full stop,"" Yaccarino said. The accounts that Media Matters found posting antisemitic material will no longer be monetizable and the specific posts will be labeled â\x80\x9csensitive media,"" according to a statement from X. Still, Musk decried Media Matters as â\x80\x9can evil organization.â\x80\x9d The head of the Anti-Defamation League also hit back at Musk\'s tweets this week, in the latest clash between the prominent Jewish civil-rights organization and the billionaire businessman. â\x80\x9cAt a time when antisemitism is exploding in America and surging around the world, it is indisputably dangerous to use oneâ\x80\x99s influence to validate and promote antisemitic theories,"" ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said on X.

The European Commission, meanwhile, said itâ\x80\x99s putting all of its social media ad efforts on hold because of an â\x80\x9calarming increase in disinformation and hate speechâ\x80\x9d on platforms in recent weeks. The commission, the 27-nation EU\'s executive arm, said it is advising its services to â\x80\x9crefrain from advertising at this stage on social media platforms where such content is present,"" adding that the freeze doesn\'t affect its official accounts on X. The EU has taken a tough stance with new rules to clean up social media platforms, and last month it made a formal request to X for information about its handling of hate speech, misinformation and violent terrorist content related to the Israel-Hamas war. X isn\'t alone in dealing with problematic content since the conflict. On Thursday, TikTok removed the hashtag #lettertoamerica after users on the app posted sympathetic videos about Osama bin Ladenâ\x80\x99s 2002 letter justifying the terrorist attacks against Americans on 9/11 and criticizing U.S. support for Israel. The Guardian news outlet, which published the transcript of the letter that was being shared, took it down and replaced it with a statement that directed readers to a news article from 2002 that it said provided more context. The videos garnered widespread attention among X users critical of TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance. TikTok said the letter was not a trend on its platform and blamed an X post by journalist Yashar Ali and media coverage for drawing more engagement to the hashtag. The short-form video app has faced criticism from Republicans and others who say the platform has been failing to protect Jewish users from harassment and pushing pro-Palestinian content to viewers. TikTok has aggressively pushed back, saying itâ\x80\x99s been taking down antisemitic content and doesnâ\x80\x99t manipulate its algorithm to take sides.'}]"

approval by the Henderson County Board of Public Education in May, Henderson County Public Schools announces the following administrative changes for the 2024-25 school year: Kimberly Henderson has been appointed the Director of Testing, Research, and Accountability, succeeding Susan Sluder, who is retiring after 36 years with HCPS. Henderson began her career with the school district in 1992 as a math and science teacher at Flat Rock Middle School, following her graduation from Gardner-Webb University with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. She has 11 years of administrative experience within HCPS, having worked at Flat Rock Middle, Dana Elementary, and Hendersonville Elementary. Additionally, she has served as an instructional coach, teacher, and athletic coach. In 2020, Henderson was named Principal at Hendersonville Elementary and has served in that role ever since. ""My four years at Hendersonville Elementary have been incredibly rewarding. I am grateful to all the Cubcat students, staff, and families,"" said Henderson. ""In my new role, I look forward to collaborating with all of our schools to uphold the district\'s strong reputation."" “Ms. Henderson brings her wealth of experiences from elementary, middle, and high school to her new position. Success has followed her at every stop along the way, and we know that the same will be true as she works to provide our schools and teachers the data they need to improve student outcomes,” said Superintendent Mark R. Garrett. Amy Cleveland, currently the Assistant Principal at Fletcher Elementary School, has been appointed the new Principal of Dana Elementary. Cleveland joined HCPS in 2014 as a second-grade teacher at Etowah Elementary School, where she taught for five years before moving into an administrative role. In 2019, she joined the Clear Creek Elementary Cubs as Assistant Principal, and in 2023, she began serving at Fletcher Elementary. Before her time with HCPS, Cleveland taught at Seminole County Public Schools in Florida from 1993 to 2013. Cleveland shared; ""I am thrilled to join the Wildcat Family. After meeting many of the staff members, it\'s clear that their passion for the students, Dana\'s traditions, and the community has made Dana Elementary a fantastic place to learn and grow. I know this is where I belong!” “Ms. Cleveland’s vast experience as an elementary classroom teacher and assistant principal in Henderson County Public Schools gives her the tools needed to successfully lead Dana Elementary School to even greater heights. She is student centered with a team approach and love for community, so I am confident great days are ahead for the Wildcats,” said Superintendent Mark R. Garrett. Kimberly Henderson holds a Master of Arts in Administration and Leadership from Gardner Webb University. Amy Cleveland holds a Master of School Administration Degree from Western Carolina University. The Henderson County sheriff is responding to an assault claim against one of his deputies in connection with a training program at Blue Ridge Community College. A report of simple assault was filed by a cadet enrolled in the BRCC Basic Law Enforcement Training program. That program has been placed on hold by the North Carolina Criminal Justice Education and Training Standards Commission as it investigates allegations of assault within the program. In a three-minute video released Wednesday evening, May 29, and posted to Vimeo and the sheriff\'s office\'s Facebook page, Henderson County Sheriff Lowell Griffin said local authorities have cleared his deputy of assault claims -- and that he wanted to make that clear after, he said, a local media outlet reported that a Henderson County Sheriff\'s deputy ""had his charges dropped."" In the video, Griffin said that information was not factual. ""The facts are that (the deputy) was not charged, so there were no charges to be dropped,"" Griffin said. He went on to explain that his deputy was a participant in a training exercise that took place within Hendersonville city limits last fall. District Attorney Andrew Murray\'s office also reviewed and agreed with the findings that there was no criminal intent. ""The district attorney also agreed that there was no malicious intent that took place during this training exercise,"" Griffin continued. The BRCC BLET program remains suspended as the state continues its investigation. STORY & PHOTO COURTESY OF ABC 13 WLOSSheriff sets record straight on assault claim against deputy amid halted training program (wlos.com) Cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, are on the rise in Buncombe County, according to county health officials, and there are now more than 100 cases in Henderson County. The Buncombe County Public Health Department says as of May 29 it\'s confirmed five cases of whooping cough since late April, and health department officials said all affected individuals have been children. Officials also say there is no direct connection to any of the outbreaks occurring elsewhere in Western North Carolina and is likely related to community spread occurring in the region. Andrew Mundhenk, a spokesperson with the Henderson County Department of Public Health, said as of May 29, the county is up to 117 cases but that there have been no hospitalizations. ""We hope the end of the school year and kids spending more time outside will have a positive impact,"" Mundhenk said. ""At the same time, we can’t stop being vigilant about contact tracing and ensuring those in close contact with known cases receive preventative care and treatment."" Like Henderson County, when a case of pertussis is identified, Buncombe County Health and Human Services (BCHHS) Public Health staff work to identify and notify those who may have been exposed to the infection. Parents, guardians and close contacts of the individuals are notified by letter and/or phone call, according to a news release. ""With the community spread of whooping cough in the region and multiple confirmed cases now in Buncombe County, we urge individuals and families to protect themselves and others. Vaccination remains the best defense and can also reduce the severity of the illness,"" Buncombe County Public Health Director Dr. Ellis Matheson said in the release. BCHHS Public Health staff members are also urging residents and medical providers to take pertussis seriously, as it can spread quickly in schools, workplaces and healthcare settings. Pertussis is an infection that affects the upper airways and spreads easily through coughing or sneezing. It can affect anyone but is especially dangerous for babies, health officials say. Nearly half of infants under 1-year-old who get pertussis end up in the hospital. Most deaths from whooping cough are among infants too young to be fully vaccinated. At first, symptoms resemble those of a common cold: runny nose, low-grade fever and an occasional mild cough. Infants may also experience brief pauses in breathing (apnea). After one to two weeks, symptoms can worsen with severe coughing fits, often with a ""whooping"" sound on breathing in. There can also be vomiting after coughing fits, especially in young children. In teens and adults, symptoms can be milder, and the ""whooping"" sound may be absent, especially if for those who have been vaccinated. Step 1: Get immunized The best defense against pertussis is vaccination, health officials say. Infants and children should receive the DTaP vaccine starting at two months old. Since young children need at least three doses for full protection, it\'s crucial for family members, caregivers and the community to get vaccinated too. Preteens, teens and adults should receive a Tdap booster shot, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pregnant people should get a Tdap booster during their third trimester of each pregnancy, even if they\'ve been vaccinated before. Staying updated on vaccinations not only protects individuals and their families but also safeguards vulnerable populations like infants, those with health conditions and the elderly from preventable diseases like pertussis. Immunizations are available by contacting healthcare providers or by visiting the Buncombe County Immunization Clinic at 40 Coxe Ave., or calling the clinic at 828-250-5096. Visit www.buncombecounty.org/immunize for more information. Step 2: Practice good health habits Staying home when sick, frequent handwashing, using hand sanitizers and covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing can help prevent the spread of pertussis and other illnesses. Step 3: Seek medical attention for pertussis symptoms Health officials say early diagnosis and treatment are vital to prevent pertussis from spreading. Anyone with symptoms should stay home from school, work, or group activities and consult a healthcare provider.

Right now we’re going to add one more, a look back at the biggest business news in Charlotte this year. And to do it, I’m joined now by Tony Mecia of the Charlotte Ledger Business Newsletter for our segment BizWorthy. Marshall Terry: All right, Tony. Let's start with your pick for biggest story of the year. What will you remember most about 2023? Tony Mecia: The disappearance of new office buildings. We've seen this year very few get built, very few have gotten started. This really kind of started toward the end of 2022. But it's happening as we're continuing to be in this space of hybrid work, remote work. Developers are just not building office buildings like they were before. And for a city that's known for banking and its uptown skyline, I think that's really a big transformation. Now, it's not just a Charlotte story, it's a national story. But a lot of times in Charlotte, you know, we like to think that we're insulated from these national trends because we're a growing city and a city on the move. And it's just not the case. Terry: What were some — you could call them, I guess — good news or positive stories from Charlotte or for local business this year? Mecia: Yeah, there have been a number of them. You know, you might recall in November, Carowinds’ parent company Cedar Fair announced it was merging with Six Flags, and they're going to move the headquarters of that new amusement park company here. That deal is supposed to close in the first half of 2024. We had the sale of the Charlotte Hornets. Michael Jordan, certainly well-known for his prowess on the court, sold the team. His reign as the owner of the Charlotte Hornets probably considered much less successful than his on-court performance. But the team was bought by financiers Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall. And then also the other one didn't get a whole lot of attention, but I think it's noteworthy, is the sale of Payzer, which is the homegrown tech company that was started above a garage in the Union County town of Marvin in 2012. It sold for $250 million this year to a company based in Maine. So a number of different things going on. Terry: And there were also plenty of challenges, and even some big setbacks. You already talked a little bit about office real estate. Anything else come to mind? Mecia: Charlotte had its hopes dashed, landing this pro tennis tournament from Cincinnati — the Western & Southern Open. The city of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County tried to offer some incentives for it, but in the end, the tournament decided to stay in Cincinnati. So, kind of a swing and a miss there on that one. It would have been in the River District in west Charlotte. Terry: One broader story that seemed to come up a lot in our conversations again this year was Charlotte’s housing market. Mecia: Yeah. You know, for years, Charlotte’s housing market has been going like gangbusters. That really cooled down a lot this year with interest rates, mortgage rates moving a little bit higher. The number of closings this year of residential properties is way down, and prices are actually pretty stable. They're going up like they used to. They're pretty flat. Realtors tend to be an optimistic bunch and are hoping that recent moves by the Fed's signaling cuts and interest rates are going to reignite the housing market locally. And I think they're hoping for a better 2024. Terry: And what else stood out to you this year? Mecia: The other story that you see, in sort of bits and pieces, around Charlotte and around the country is the adoption of artificial intelligence. The Ledger did a series this year looking at how businesses are using it, and there are all kinds of different applications. And one of the ones people might notice: Bojangles testing out artificial intelligence, a chatbot at the drive-thru that it's calling Bo-Linda. So, keep an eye on that. I think there's more to come — artificial intelligence not just at Bojangles, at other places, too. Terry: So, what will you mostly be looking out for in 2024? Mecia: A lot is going to be focused on the economy. Economists have been saying for a year or two now that they expect a recession to hit. It hasn't materialized. And there's hope that it won't materialize, that the economy is going to have what they're calling a soft landing. And then, of course, you know, what's the effect on the housing market and the real estate market? Those are, as we've talked about, two pretty big areas in Charlotte. And, sort of, where they are headed? What direction are they headed? Those are some of the things I think that we can be looking at in 2024.
