(Photo by Bennett Silvyn/Cronkite News) SCOTTSDALE – As the galleries fill up this weekend for the Waste Management Phoenix Open, fans and players will be watching the Weather Channel as closely as the Golf Channel throughout the week. The “People’s Open” follows the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am on the PGA Tour schedule, and the AT&T was cut short Sunday after 54 holes due to dangerous weather conditions. There is a chance that the TPC Scottsdale might be in for similar weather challenges with a so-called “atmospheric river” headed toward the desert southwest. “Certainly we weren’t able to play any golf and it got pretty dangerous there to be honest with you. There were powerlines and trees down,” said Jim “Bones” Mackay, the caddie of Justin Thomas. “Expect the worst and if something other than that happens, then it’s nice and just cruise through. “But that’s going to be part of what happens this week.” Pebble Beach was the first PGA Tour event to be called after 54 holes since the 2016 Zurich Classic in New Orleans. There is a small chance that the “Greatest Show on Grass” makes it two in a row. The path from Monterey to Scottsdale perfectly follows the pattern of an atmospheric river currently hitting California. There are concerns over the players’ travel plans to Arizona with Sunday’s weather at Pebble Beach consisting of two inches of rain and possible 60 mph winds. Hundreds of flights in the Bay Area were canceled due to the storm that is now heading east toward Arizona. Even with the hectic weather watch ongoing, many golfers are looking forward to the week of competition. Despite talk of rain, Brandon Reese, the director of golf course operations for the PGA TOUR, said, “We already have a plan in place for these type of weather situations … and we’re prepared for anything.” (Photo by Bennett Silvyn/Cronkite News) “This is just a very, very relaxing week. I mean obviously it’s not relaxing on that 16th tee,” Mackay said, referring to TPC Scottsdale’s “coliseum” par-3. “But again, you come here, you know where you’re going to stay. You’ve been coming for years. You know what to eat, what to do. So guys just want to get in front and carry the momentum they’ve had in previous weeks to hopefully a good finish here.” Monday might be the only day that lives up to Arizona’s reputation of year-round sunshine. The Weather Channel forecasts showers from Tuesday through Saturday. If there is a stoppage in play, once it resumes, the tournament can allow golfers to play 36 holes in one day to catch up if needed, according to the PGA procedures. If 72 holes can not be finished through Sunday, it can continue into Monday or Tuesday. “We already have a plan in place for these type of weather situations,” said Brandon Reese, the director of golf course operations at the PGA Tour. “The good news is the course is in fantastic condition and we’re prepared for anything.” The PGA inclement weather policy is set in five different stages. It ranges from all clear, requiring no actions to be taken, all the way to a complete closure of the course requiring all players, fans and sponsors to immediately exit the premises. It does not specify what kind of weather is required for a suspension of play. The only indication is a visual depicting high winds, lightning and a tornado. “I think that it will keep some people away, but I think a lot of people will still show up just because of the event. Especially on the 16th hole,” said golf fan Tom Tkach, an Arizona resident who took in Monday’s practice round. Even though it was mostly amateurs playing in pro-am Monday, fans at 16 still enjoyed heckling the competitors. (Photo by Bennett Silvyn/Cronkite News) The tournament typically has enjoyed perfect weather through the years, but in 2011 frost and even frozen greens caused several delays and the final round wasn’t completed until Monday. And in 1979, heavy rains and flooding caused the event to be cut to 54 holes when it was played at Phoenix Country Club near downtown Phoenix. Along with the gloomy weather ahead, fans will be disappointed to hear that two of the top golfers in this year’s field have withdrawn after playing at Pebble Beach. Viktor Hovland and Xander Schauffele have both withdrawn after disappointing performances at the pro-am. No reason was given for either’s decision, but it could be partly because the Phoenix Open is sandwiched between two signature events with Pebble Beach and The Genesis Invitational. As a non-signature event, the Phoenix Open dropped its purse from $20 million to $8.8 million. Even with the withdrawals, this year’s tournament still boasts a loaded field with nine of the top 20 players in the Official World Golf Ranking making the trip. On top of that, five more players in the top 20 of the FedExCup standings are also playing. Scottie Scheffler is looking to win the open for the third straight year, becoming the first player to win three straight events on tour since 2011. The tour’s most recent winner Wyndham Clark will play as well, in efforts to reach the top spot in the FedExCup. Mackay is confident that the tournament’s reputation and field will hold up for the fans, regardless of the forecast. “Come on out anyway. It’s the best show on grass,” he said. “It’s the best people-watching anywhere I’ve ever been in my life. For that alone, come out, watch the golf, watch the people. Have an adult beverage, have a water. Whatever you want to do, but it’s the place to be.” Stephen Buxton expects to graduate May 2024 with a bachelor’s degree in sports journalism.

in the fuselage plug area of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282. (CNN) — Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday said evidence shows four bolts that hold the door plug in place on the Boeing 737 Max 9 were missing at the time of last month’s blowout on Alaska Airlines flight 1282. The bombshell new finding from federal investigators comes one month and a day after the January 5 incident that triggered a 19-day emergency grounding of all Max 9s, and re-ignited scrutiny of Boeing following the fatal Max 8 crashes of 2018 and 2019. Boeing acknowledged its responsibility for the blowout in a statement issued after the NTSB report and said it is working to make sure incidents like this do not reoccur. “Whatever final conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened,” said Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun in a statement. “An event like this must not happen on an airplane that leaves our factory. We simply must do better for our customers and their passengers.” Boeing said it was taking new actions to improve the way it makes the 737 Max 9 planes. That includes more inspections, giving the 737 teams more time “to focus on and implement quality improvements,” and bringing in outside safety experts to assess its operations. In their 19-page preliminary report released Tuesday, NTSB investigators included observations from a laboratory disassembly of Alaska 1282’s door plug, which fell 16,000 feet into an Oregon backyard. It said the lack of damage to the plug where the bolts were supposed to attach it to the fuselage of the plane pointed to the conclusion that the bolts were missing at the time of the flight. “Overall, the observed damage patterns and absence of contact damage or deformation around holes associated with the vertical movement arrestor bolts and upper guide track bolts in the upper guide fittings, hinge fittings, and recovered aft lower hinge guide fitting indicate that the four bolts that prevent upward movement of the MED plug were missing before the MED [mid exit door] plug moved upward off the stop pads,” the report said referring to the mid exit door. The report included a photo taken in September, more than a month before the plane was delivered to Alaska Air, that show the bolts missing during work on the aircraft, taken from a text message between two Boeing employees obtained by NTSB investigators. It means that the plane flew for a couple of months before the January 5 blowout with the bolts missing. The report was only the preliminary finding and did not assess blame or cause of the incident. That could come in a final report that could be more than a year away. In a statement, the Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday: “This incident should have never happened and it cannot happen again. The FAA is continuing to support the National Transportation Safety Board’s investigation into the Jan. 5 door plug incident.” The NTSB is in charge of the investigation and will provide any updates. The fact that no one was sitting in the seat next to the gaping hole that appeared in the side of the plane is a key reason there was not a fatality on the flight. Six crew and 171 passengers were on board the flight, which returned safely to Portland International Airport. Nobody was seriously hurt in the incident. The missing bolts are apparently not the only problem. Both Alaska Airlines and United Airlines said last month that inspections of their fleets that took place after the January 5 incident revealed loose bolts. “This is a somewhat complex issue with a lot of parts,” NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy told CNN in the week leading up to the release of the preliminary report. Even still, Homendy stressed that she “would have no problem getting on a Max 9 tomorrow and flying.” The release of the report comes as Boeing’s quality control is under intense scrutiny. During a House subcommittee hearing Tuesday, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said there are now two dozen FAA inspectors on location at Boeing’s Renton, Washington plant as part of an agency audit. Late Sunday, Boeing disclosed that it would need to “rework” improperly drilled holes discovered on 50 incomplete 737 Max planes still on the production line, causing a slowdown in deliveries. Later, Boeing fuselage contractor Spirit AeroSystems said it had caused that more recent problem. A Spirit spokesman said the company is working on “continuous improvement.” “As we review the NTSB’s preliminary report, we remain focused on working closely with Boeing and our regulators on continuous improvement in our processes and meeting the highest standards of safety, quality and reliability,” spokesman Joe Buccino said in a statement. The report also details the shock of the blowout, which caught passengers and crew by surprise. “The captain said that, while climbing through about 16,000 ft, there was a loud bang,” the report said. “The flight crew said their ears popped, and the captain said his head was pushed into the heads-up display (HUD) and his headset was pushed up, nearly falling off his head. The FO [first officer] said her headset was completely removed due to the rapid outflow of air from the flight deck.” CNN has reported that NTSB investigators have been closely scrutinizing the door plug and whether crucial bolts that hold it in place were properly installed when the incident occurred. Meanwhile, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration told House lawmakers Tuesday that his agency is “closely scrutinizing” Boeing after last month’s door plug blowout. “Going forward, we will have more boots on the ground closely scrutinizing and monitoring production and manufacturing activities,” FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in prepared remarks. The Federal Aviation Administration failed to properly scrutinize Boeing after two fatal crashes of 737 Max aircraft killed 346 people more than four years ago, the agency’s new chief said. “I wasn’t there at the time as you noted.

The jury in Muskogee County awarded Scott Sapulpa $5 million in actual damages and another $20 million in punitive damages. “We’re just so happy for Scott. Hopefully this will vindicate his name,” said Michael Barkett, Sapulpa’s attorney. Sapulpa alleged defamation and the intentional infliction of emotional distress, and the jury found the newspaper acted with actual malice, which permitted them to consider punitive damages, Barkett said. Lark-Marie Anton, a spokesperson for the newspaper’s owner, Gannett, said in a statement the company was disappointed with the verdict and planned to appeal. “There was no evidence presented to the jury that The Oklahoman acted with any awareness that what was reported was false or with any intention to harm the plaintiff in this case,” Anton said. The incident occurred in 2021 before the Norman-Midwest City girls high school basketball game when an announcer for a livestream cursed and called one team by a racial epithet as the players kneeled during the national anthem. The broadcasters told their listeners on the livestream that they would return after a break. Then one, apparently not realizing the audio was still live, said: “They’re kneeling? (Expletive) them,” one of the men said. “I hope Norman gets their ass kicked … (Expletive) (epithet).” Sapulpa, one of two announcers, was initially identified by the newspaper as the person who made the racist comment. Matt Rowan, the owner and operator of the streaming service, later told The Oklahoman he was the person who made the remarks. Rowan apologized and blamed his use of racist language on his blood-sugar levels.

murderous action of her son. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: On count one of involuntary manslaughter, as to Madisyn Baldwin, we find the defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter. PFEIFFER: The jury found that Jennifer Crumbley was criminally responsible for her son killing four students and wounding seven other people at Oxford High School in November 2021. Crumbley and her husband, James, were each charged with involuntary manslaughter and are being tried separately. Quinn Klinefelter with member station WDET is following the case and is with us. Hi, Quinn. QUINN KLINEFELTER, BYLINE: Hello. PFEIFFER: Quinn, as you know, there are experts saying this case sets a precedent that holds a parent legally responsible for the criminal actions of their child. Given that, what was it like in the courtroom? And what was the reaction of Jennifer Crumbley when the verdict was announced? KLINEFELTER: It was a pretty packed courtroom. Family members of the victims were there. There didn't seem to be anybody on hand for Jennifer Crumbley, just as there has not been throughout the trial. When she came in, she didn't show much emotion, although she and her attorney did seem a bit tense. They kept putting on ChapStick. She kept her head down. It was different for the family members. They shook hands and hugged the prosecutors when the verdict came. PFEIFFER: This was a shooting that occurred when Crumbley's son Ethan was 15. He's since been sentenced to life in prison. Prosecutors had argued that Jennifer Crumbley ignored her son's mental health. What evidence did they present for that? KLINEFELTER: Well, prosecutors used texts, Facebook messages and journal entries that said Crumbley's son was hallucinating, seeing things flying in their home, and that his parents were ignoring any pleas to see a doctor. The defense claimed that Jennifer Crumbley never saw those messages. But throughout the trial, the prosecution painted Crumbley as somebody who was more interested in her horses or her own affairs then how her son was doing. And prosecutor Karen McDonald said Crumbley's own testimony underlined her point when she said her son's actions had ruined so many lives, including her own. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAREN MCDONALD: And she was asked the question, you lost everything. And she said, yes. She hasn't lost everything, ladies and gentlemen. Her son is still alive. PFEIFFER: Quinn, prosecutors presented several witnesses, but the defense presented just one, Jennifer Crumbley, who testified on her own behalf. Was that a surprise that she was the only defense witness? And what did she have to say? KLINEFELTER: It was a little bit of a surprise. She said she had no idea that her son was as troubled as he was, that she did not take him home from school the day of the shooting because counselors there assured her that he was not an immediate threat to anyone. And her attorney, Shannon Smith, argued the prosecution was wrong when it claimed Crumbley did not keep a gun securely locked away from her son, a gun the parents had bought him just days before the shooting as an early Christmas present. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SHANNON SMITH: No parent would purchase a weapon if they believed their child had mental illnesses. PFEIFFER: Why are the parents being tried separately? KLINEFELTER: Because they requested it. Their attorneys said some new evidence had come up that could pit the parents against each other, evidence that apparently involves who was responsible for keeping the gun secure and away from their son. In fact, this verdict could have big implications for the husband, James Crumbley's, trial. His trial is set for next month. He faces identical charges. PFEIFFER: Jennifer Crumbley's sentencing is set for April 9. What kind of sentence could she get? KLINEFELTER: Involuntary manslaughter carries a penalty of as much as 15 years in prison. PFEIFFER: That is WDET'S Quinn Klinefelter. Thank you. KLINEFELTER: You're welcome. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. NPR transcripts are created on a rush deadline by an NPR contractor.

(Photo by Matt Dirksen/Getty Images) PHOENIX – As the crisp 50-degree Arizona winters wear off and the freshly cut grass grows greener, baseball looms in the Grand Canyon State. Most pitchers and catchers report in the next two weeks, with the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres even sooner since they open the regular season March 20 and 21 in Seoul, South Korea. Players, coaches and trainers from 15 Cactus League teams will assemble, working to solidify a competitive roster ahead of the 2024 campaign. Yet, a plethora of notable names are still available in the Major League Baseball free agency market. Four of the top eight free agents, Blake Snell, Cody Bellinger, Jordan Montgomery and Matt Chapman, are still on the board. Notably, they’re all represented by Scott Boras, one of the most powerful agents in all of baseball. As demonstrated by the Los Angeles Dodgers’ free agency spending spree of over $1 billion on Japanese sensations Shohei Ohtani (10 years, $700 million) and Yoshinobu Yamamoto (12 years, $325 million), the market has been outrageously demanding. It’s primarily due to the influx of teams signing young players to long-term deals. “I think that teams see the value of young players. Look at Corbin Carroll, for example, with Arizona and how Arizona got to the World Series,” MLB insider Jon Morosi said. “It’s that two-part process. Draft and develop well, and then when it’s time to spend, you spend on the right big time superstars.” Among the 100 or so free agent signings across the league, 34 players signed contracts for $10 million or more. While it’s unlikely that Snell, Bellinger, Montgomery and Chapman will sign a lengthy 10-to-12-year contract like Ohtani or Yamamoto, teams will still pay a hefty amount for that kind of talent. Bryce Harper’s late-February signing with the Philadelphia Phillies in 2019 corroborates Boras’ tendency to hold out until a general manager meets his price, ensuring his clients will get the best possible offer. However, there are times when the market won’t necessarily materialize for players who are aging, maybe even coming off a down year. “There are other instances where occasionally the market for a player doesn’t materialize and you have to accept a one year deal and then go back after the season is over,” Morosi said. “I think even sometimes when it looks like the market is not favorable in the end, maybe you take that one year deal and then go back out in the market and find a greater deal the next year. “I think we’re seeing that play out with Bellinger. He’ll certainly do better than he was going to do a year ago at this time when he signed with the Cubs, and then opted out because of how well he performed.” Outside of the “Boras Four,” the market for nearly every position has been quiet. Slugging designated-hitters J.D. Martinez and Jorge Soler remain teamless despite their power numbers in 2023, where they combined for 69 home runs. Diamondbacks open Chase Field with early optimism to start 2023 season: ‘Good things are on the way’ Martinez and Soler both were in talks with the Arizona Diamondbacks, but failed to come to an agreement as the Diamondbacks opted for a cheaper, left-handed bat in Joc Pederson for one year, $9.5 million. “A lot of managers like having flexibility, and if you have an everyday DH who doesn’t necessarily play a ton in the field, it restricts what you’re able to do with the rest of your lineup and might actually reduce the ability to get the most out of the rest of your guys,” Morosi said. “And I’m sure when you look at other options, if the price (or years) comes down low enough, you can see a team involved that you didn’t expect. I think that’s where we can sometimes get surprises when we’re talking this late in the offseason.” It’s the fourth straight one-year contract for Pederson, who mentioned a desire to restore his value during contract discussion with the Diamondbacks before hitting the free agent market next offseason. However, with outfielders Carroll, Alek Thomas, Lourdes Gurriel Jr. and Jake McCarthy, Pederson is likely to primarily don the DH role throughout the season. “I kinda enjoy the flexibility,” Pederson told reporters on Wednesday. “I think you only get to play this game so long — it would suck to sign a long-term deal in a place that you don’t want to be, and you’re giving away years of such a small window that you either get frustrated or in a spot (where you’re) unhappy.” Once upon a time, veterans Clayton Kershaw (Dodgers), Joey Votto (Cincinnati Reds) and Brandon Crawford (San Francisco Giants) were the face of their respective franchises. Now, they’re all past their primes and are on the search for a new home. Votto and Crawford, who recorded a combined -1.4 WAR in 2023, were already told by the Cincinnati Reds and San Francisco Giants that a reunion is out of the question. Kershaw, despite pondering retirement over the past few seasons, has expressed mutual interest in a reunion with the Dodgers. Kershaw went 13-5 with a 2.46 ERA in 131.2 innings in 2023. “We all hope to have Kershaw back, he is in a little different scenario this offseason. I don’t think he is quite in a rush to make his decision. I think he is enjoying his offseason,” Dodgers utilityman Chris Taylor told Dodgers Nation on Tuesday. “I wouldn’t be surprised if he made his decision even as the season was going on. Of course, I think everybody wants him in Dodger blue come October.” In 2023, the Dodgers proved their need for pitching all season. Injuries to pitchers Walker Buehler, Dustin May and Tony Gonsolin along with the departure of Julio Urias amid a plethora of legal allegations in September ultimately cost the Dodgers in the 2023 postseason. “I think that the Dodgers proved even last year that when you’ve got a great team, you still often need pitching help,” Morosi said. “Look at how many different starting pitchers the Dodgers needed last year. That’s pretty good evidence of the fact that they’ll probably need Clayton Kershaw again.” Kershaw underwent surgery in November to repair the glenohumeral ligaments and capsule in his left shoulder, stating that he is “hopeful to return to play at some point in the summer.” In addition to Los Angeles, Kershaw’s hometown Texas Rangers have shown interest. Nonetheless, while the idea of retirement surrounds all three veterans if contracts don’t come to fruition, teams could view them as veteran presences in the clubhouses. “It probably comes down to how badly they want to continue their careers, and do they need to get a guaranteed major league job on a 40 man roster,” Morosi said. “I’m not sure if that’s out there for Crawford or Votto, but certainly the reputation for both players is so good in the game that they’ll be able to play if they want to.” It’s entirely possible that many of the free agents don’t sign until the start of spring training or closer to the start of the regular season. Baseball fans can only hope their favorite team has the money to sign the players they desire. In the current state of baseball’s market, they won’t come cheap.
