Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 12:11 pm At the Fall Colors of the Stone show, attendees can shop for beads, gems, minerals, clothing, accessories and jewelry. (Garan Beadagio LLC/Submitted) Tucson has become a destination for gems, fossils and minerals because of its annual Tucson Gem, Mineral and Fossil Showcase. Leading up to the winter shows, companies hold events in the fall for designers, gallery owners, hobbyists and consumers who want to shop early for beads, gems, stones, minerals and artisan items. This year, the Fall Colors of the Stone show is Thursday, August 31, to Sunday, September 3, at Casino del Sol. Garan-Beadagio LLC hosts juried shows in Tucson in the fall and winter, the latter of which is part of the larger showcase. The company was founded in 2004 by Anna Johnson, a beadmaker, jewelry and traveling merchant, and her jewelry-maker daughter, Casey Kennerson. They also host artisan trade shows in California. Kennerson acts as show manager. Kennerson said in the artisan show industry, it is important to visit Tucson, especially during the winter showcase. “If you are a show promoter or an exhibitor, you want a presence at the Tucson gem show,” Kennerson says. The event will have over 300 artisans, beadmakers, jewelry makers, ceramic artists, gold smiths, wholesalers, lapidaries and tradespeople. Attendees can interact one-on-one with artisans who have been working in their crafts for decades and tradespeople who travel to find gems, minerals, beads and antiquities. Some of the artisans will offer demonstrations. Kennerson says it allows them a chance to educate others about their work. The selection will include items such as lampwork and antique beads, minerals, hand-cut gemstones, crystals, Hill tribe silver, raku ceramics, one-of-a-kind artwork, cameos from the 1800s, Ethiopian jewelry, tribal textiles and beads from Africa, apparel and accessories. Kennerson says these items are often discovered in interesting places, such as an old warehouse in Germany or the home of a longtime collector. “Especially with the antique or vintage, that is something you have to really search for. You have to get lucky to find that treasure trove,” Kennerson says. The event offers a chance to look for materials early for selling or crafting. “If you are a designer or store owner, it’s a great time to come and shop for everything before the holiday rush and stock up,” Kennerson says. “It’s a little more laidback and not as crazy as the winter show. You can spend more one-on-one time with your suppliers.” Kennerson says the show was designed for attendees with different interests, including those who want to decorate their homes or find something interesting to wear. “We have a whole section of clothing, accessories and jewelry,” Kennerson says. “You can come and shop for yourself for all of those things. We have crystals and minerals you can decorate your home with. Even if you’re not into making jewelry or into gemstones in that way, we have all the other things, too.” Kennerson sees antique beads and cameos being used in repurposed jewelry. Clothing styles from the ’70s and ’80s and big-bead necklaces are also becoming trendy again. “It’s always going to come back in. You just have to wait long enough,” Kennerson says. Throughout the four-day event, guests can take part in artisan workshops in areas such as beadwork, jewelry design and silversmithing. They are taught by experienced craftspeople and designers. “We keep all of them as nice, smaller classes so that everyone gets one-on-one attention,” Kennerson says. Guests are encouraged to sign up for workshops early. There are additional costs to take these classes. Kennerson says many attendees return for multiple workshops, which allows them to develop their skills. “Sometimes, it takes a few different workshops to learn everything,” Kennerson says. Her mother participated in the gem showcase in the ’90s, taking part in shows throughout the years. She and Kennerson started hosting their own in Tucson in 2004. They started out with around seven exhibitors and grew very quickly to 50 the next year and soon 100 vendors. They’ve held them Downtown near Reid Park, but the casino was a better fit for their size and scope. “We moved out to the casino because we needed the space, and they had unlimited free parking, which is so hard to find now,” Kennerson says. “That was one of the biggest pluses, and lots of food and new hotel rooms.” Kennerson says their shows have a strong reputation in Tucson and built a returning customer base over the years. “We’ve been doing it for so long that we have a loyal following,” Kennerson says. “All of our customers know that we bring in the truly unique and artisan-made, and we have the workshops.

Artush Arturi Grigoryan and Nova Vahihayrik Markos were indicted by a Cochise County grand jury in April on six felonies each for their involvement in the heist from Suarez Brokerage Co. Public records show the defendants are Armenian citizens who live in California. Artush Arturi Grigoryan Nova Vahihayrik Markos The charges against Grigoryan and Markos date back to Feb. 9 when two men who identified themselves as being with an established trucking firm showed up at Suarez Brokerage’s office in Douglas to get a load of copper wire that needed to be delivered out of state for one of the brokerage company’s clients. Suarez Brokerage, which has been in business since 1979, helps clients such as mining businesses expedite customs clearances. The Herald/Review has learned Suarez employees loaded the copper onto the men’s truck-trailer after being provided legitimate-looking insurance papers, identification, and other documents related to interstate trucking. But a short time later, Suarez Brokerage employees became concerned about the progress of the delivery. At one point, the soon-to-be-discovered fake truckers provided a photo which purported to show the truck was having mechanical problems. The only problem, according to public records, is that the photograph had been pulled from the internet. To date, neither Suarez Brokerage nor law enforcement agencies have been able to locate the copper. The logistics involved in the fraudulent scheme indicates the theft was part of a criminal enterprise — likely the Russian mafia — and not an amateur operation, several law enforcement sources say. Grigoryan, 31, is a commercial truck driver currently in the U.S. as a legal resident. He pleaded not guilty to all charges and posted a $10,000 bond in August to secure his pretrial release with permission from Cochise County Superior Court Judge Jason Lindstrom to return to California. On Tuesday, Lindstrom conducted a pretrial conference in Grigoryan’s case. The defendant, who used the services of a Russian interpreter, took part in the hearing via Zoom from California. His attorney, Phoenix-based lawyer Joshua Blumenreich, participated via Zoom from Arizona. Blumenreich advised the judge that Deputy County Attorney Michael Powell offered Grigoryan a plea deal in September. However, his client was not prepared Tuesday to accept the deal, the defense attorney said. “It’s not soup yet,” Blumenreich told Lindstrom. Instead, the attorney asked for an order allowing a formal settlement conference with a different judge in hopes of working out a deal acceptable to all parties. The problem is that Powell included a Nov. 21 deadline with the September offer. “I wouldn’t anticipate that the same offer will be on the table” in the future, Deputy County Attorney Lisa McNair told Lindstrom and Blumenreich on Powell’s behalf. McNair asked the judge to conduct a Donald Hearing, which puts the plea deal details on the official record. It also puts on the record the worst-case scenario Grigoryan faces if convicted at trial of all six counts. Lindstrom declined to conduct the Donald Hearing on Tuesday, noting the defendant and his attorney would not be able to engage via Zoom in confidential discussions about how to proceed. Instead, the judge ordered the parties to schedule a confidential settlement conference with Senior Commissioner Charles Irwin, a retired Cochise County judge. Irwin will have to conduct the Donald Hearing as part of the conference, Lindstrom said. The judge also set a new pretrial conference for Feb. 2 if a change of plea is not conducted first. Meanwhile, court records show Markos, Grigoryan’s co-defendant, obtained court permission in July to return to California pending trial, although he was required to post a $150,000 bond. Markos, 25, is slated to be back in Lindstrom’s court Jan. 19 for a pretrial conference. His attorney, Cochise County Public Defender Charles Kendall Jr., recently advised the judge that an unidentified attorney intends to apply with the State Bar of Arizona for pro hac vice status. Such status is required when an attorney who is not licensed in Arizona wishes to represent a party in a legal proceeding in state court. Log In Keep it Clean.

Shortly after moving, Marsh participated in the Maricopa Citizen Leadership Academy. He later served on several local boards and committees, including the Maricopa Board of Adjustment and the Planning and Zoning Commission. In 2020, Marsh was elected to the council and sworn into office the following year. It’s been a heck of a ride, he said. “I’m helping to pull a new city out of the ground and I’m good at it,” he said. “I’m having a fun time doing it and I want to do more, so I want to get re-elected.” Other seats up for re-election next year include Mayor Nancy Smith and Councilmembers Eric Goettl and Amber Liermann.

High 104F. Winds S at 10 to 15 mph.. Clear skies. Low around 80F. Winds SE at 10 to 15 mph. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 12:14 pm A historic structure in Bouse may soon need to be demolished. The building that housed the A & C Mercantile store on State Route 72 had its south wall collapse during the storms of Aug. 19 and 20. The roof was also substantially damaged. The store had been closed for some years, and the building had fallen into disrepair. Bouse resident Julian Barbara brought the structure to the attention of the County Board of Supervisors during call to the public at their Jan. 21 meeting. “The A & C Mercantile is more than an eyesore,” Barbara said. “It’s a hazard. It needs to be demolished.” Barbara said a residential structure on the property was in almost as bad shape as the store and also needed to be demolished. La Paz County Code Officer Tiffany Wyckoff told the Pioneer they have an active code violation case with the A & C Mercantile. She said the Community Development Department had been working with the Bouse Fire Department and the building’s owners to have the building repaired. Wyckoff said they didn’t have an update on the case since the storms of Aug. 19-20, but a status hearing was set for Sept. 21. When the A & C closed some years ago, it was the oldest business in Bouse that was still in operation. It dates back to the early 20th Century. It housed Bouse’s Post Office for a time, and was the Post Exchange, or PX, for Camp Bouse during World War II. Renee Townsend covered the A & C in her book, “Bouse, Arizona Then and Now.” She said part of the structure dated back to 1904 and was built by a “Mr. Dobson.” She said there’s a sign over the door that reads “Store No. 1.” Townsend wasn’t sure what the significance of this was, but suggested there were plans to build more stores along the Arizona & California Railroad, which was then part of the Santa Fe. During World War II, many American armored units trained at nearby Camp Bouse. The site was selected by Gen. George S. Patton because it was remote and accessible by rail. He also knew the harsh weather of the summer would make a good training ground for what the troops could expect in combat. Camp Bouse was in operation from 1943 to 1944. The A & C served as the Post Exchange, or PX, for the camp. Townsend said that, on one occasion, some of the soldiers became rowdy in the store and the Military Police had to be called to restore order. One of the MPs fired a round into the ceiling. She said that bullet hole was still there at the time of her writing. Starting in the 1990s, the Camp Bouse Monument was created and plaques have been erected honoring the various units that trained there before being sent off to face the Axis powers of Germany and Japan. As the PX for the camp, the A & C received its own plaque on Feb. 6, 2000. While the other plaques are located across State Route 72 from the A & C, the plaque for the store is located by the store itself. The Bouse Post Office was located for many years in the back of the A & C building. Townsend described an incident on Nov. 3, 1961, when thieves attempted to steal the big safe from the post office. They got it to the front door, but they couldn’t get it out of the building. The Pioneer asked on social media for comments from Bouse residents, and asked what they thought should go in the A & C’s place. Some of them said they remembered when the store was open, and that it was a fascinating old building. Many expressed sadness that the place had fallen into such a state of disrepair.

Please give us a call at 520-458-9440 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy Congressman Juan Ciscomani, R-Ariz., greets Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., after nominating him in the House chamber in Washington in January. TUCSON — Juan Ciscomani and his 434 fellow members of the U.S. House of Representatives were supposed to spend the bulk of October in their home districts, speaking with constituents and listening to their needs. Instead, they spent that time stuck in Washington, trying to elect a new House Speaker after Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) was ousted on Oct. 3 by the far right members of his own party. After votes on multiple replacements failed to achieve the necessary 218 to elect a new speaker, Republicans finally rallied behind Louisiana conservative Mike Johnson on Wednesday making him the new speaker and allowing lawmakers to finally return home. Ciscomani arrived back in his District 6, which includes much of Cochise County, and spent his first weekend catching up with his constituents, family and the flag football team he coaches. He also found time to speak with the Herald/Review and expressed annoyance at the tumult of the last three weeks, but supremely relieved that it’s finally over. “I disagreed on vacating the chair, ousting McCarthy,” Ciscomani said. “That was a mistake and it spun us into chaos for two weeks without a speaker, right at the time the Israel situation, so that was just bad timing.” Ciscomani voted ‘yes’ on every candidate brought to the floor, which drew some criticism, especially his vote for Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan, who voted against ratifying the 2020 Presidential Election results and has been accused of encouraging the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the Capitol. “My stance from the beginning was whoever becomes the Republican designee — if the conference voted for them, whether I voted for them in conference or not — if they are selected by that group it’s our responsibility to go back to work,” Ciscomani said. “So I supported them throughout the votes.” McCarthy, a mentor of sorts to the rookie Congressman, was ousted after he supported a measure that would release funds to avoid a government shutdown — at least through Nov. 17. Johnson’s first task when he gets back to D.C. will be to address that looming snooze alarm. “I’ve said it before, I will do everything I can to avoid a government shutdown,” Ciscomani said. “Apparently, some people are OK with the shutdown, thinking it’s not that big of a deal. But I don’t believe any of that. Our border agents need to get paid, our troops need to get paid, veterans need to get their benefits — so we need to do everything we can to avoid a shutdown.” But how is Johnson supposed to canvass votes to keep the government open when his predecessor was ousted for that very same thing? “I think (House Republicans) have a much better relationship with Johnson than McCarthy,” Ciscomani said. “You can look at the interviews, their issues with McCarthy were pretty personal, so I wouldn’t be surprised if some of the same ideas McCarthy couldn’t get through, Johnson can.” Ciscomani is optimistic passing a bill to keep the government open will be the first of those things, though, he noted, there may not be time for the Senate to respond in kind, so another temporary funding solution may be in order if only to buy more time. Ciscomani is also optimistic that this divide within the Republican Party won’t cause it to fracture. “Washington is broken, it’s dysfunctional, there’s a lot of history where someone did something to someone 25 years ago (and still holds a grudge), but I’m not part of any of that — I just want to go back to work,” he said. “Even within the whole chaos, I introduced one bill every week for seven weeks straight and kept my mobile office hours in the district.” One of those bills is the Border Enforcement, Security and Trade (BEST) Facilitation Act, which would add a position at each border crossing committed to scanning and assessing cars and cargo coming into the U.S. That worker would be able to determine if more screening is necessary, thereby speeding up crossing times at the border. “It takes a lot of attention to detail that you wouldn’t be able to see with the naked eye,” Ciscomani said, noting he got the notion for the bill when visiting a checkpoint in his district. “You have to look at air pressure in tires, the way certain parts of the engine (are balanced). The cartels are very creative in hiding (contraband) so agents have to stay one step ahead.” Ciscomani said the additional staffing would not only help with border crossing speed, but catch more of the fentanyl that pours across legal crossing spots. Ciscomani co-sponsored the bill with Texas Democrat Vicente Gonzalez and is a companion piece of legislation drafted in the Senate by Oklahoma Republican James Lankford and Arizona Democrat Mark Kelly. “Customs and Border Protection need the necessary resources to do the difficult job of keeping illegal drugs, like fentanyl, and other dangerous substances from entering our country,”Kelly said in a press release. “As we continue the work to upgrade and expand our ports of entry, the BEST Facilitation Act will help CBP more quickly reach the goal of 100% scanning while increasing trade, decreasing wait times, and enhancing the ability to stop illegal drugs and cargo. As we know in Arizona, ports are a major economic benefit to our communities, and this bill provides for additional port personnel to ensure our ports are secure and efficient.” Ciscomani said the funding for the expansion would come from the annual Homeland Security appropriation and the bipartisan support of the bills’ sponsor means it “has real legs” and also goes to show that the legislative branch is aware of and sensitive to the issues along the border with Mexico. “I keep talking about the Tucson sector. Honestly, Texas gets a lot of attention because of the size of their ports and the number of members of their delegation, but the Tucson sector is leading the country in fentanyl interception and apprehensions overall,” Ciscomani said. “There is a sense of urgency on the Republican side, but I don’t feel any sense of urgency from the (Biden) Administration.” Ciscomani said he recently spoke with leaders from the Border County Coalition, which, too, revealed cooperation across the political aisle. “Whether they’re Republican or Democrat, they all say it’s unaffordable — we can’t sustain this,” he said. “It’s not a partisan issue. Our cities are being plagued with fentanyl and we can’t afford it. I get it and I’ve given several remarks about it.” Log In Keep it Clean.

Please give us a call at 520-458-9440 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy Coronado Dairy Cows SUNIZONA — In January 2021, Vance Williams returned to his home in Sunizona after some time away to find that his well had gone dry. A drilling company quoted him $43,000 to deepen his well to 800 feet, a depth he believed would provide the property with water for the rest of his life. This price was far beyond what he could afford to spend living off his disability pension from the VA. For a year, he lived off of five-gallon jugs of water purchased at the local grocery store before investing most of his savings into an above-ground storage tank to provide water to his property. But again, there was a catch. Williams is one of many residents in the Willcox basin who had to find a new water source for their property. There was a waitlist for anyone wishing to haul water to their property from Sunsites. A sign off Dragoon Road warns of earth fissures that have opened up in the eastern part of the county due to depletion in the aquifer. After months of waiting and searching while living off five-gallon water jugs, Williams found water he could begin hauling to his property. But it was far more expensive than the water he used to get from his well. “You’re living like you are camping because of the small amount of water I could afford to get,” he said. In May, Williams told Inside Climate News that his well had gone dry around the same time Riverview LLP had opened its second large-scale dairy farm in the Willcox basin — Turkey Creek Dairy. His home in Sunizona is about five miles north of the dairy. He blamed Riverview for depleting resident’s wells. Williams said he got a wall from Gary Fehr, Riverview’s board president, almost immediately after the interview was published, offering to pay to deepen his well. Riverview did pay to have Williams’ well drilled down to 720 feet, but the pump they installed only went to 460 feet, Williams said. Williams now worries that in another 10 to 15 years, he’ll be out of water again because the aquifer under his property is declining by at least 6 feet per year. “I’m not crying too bad because I have water at the moment,” he said. “But I know somewhere down the road here, a lot sooner than I think most people think, it’s going to be drying out. And I’m going to be right back in the position I was in trying to figure out where to get water from.” Williams wanted to pass his house down to his daughter, but now he’s worried that his property will have no value as the aquifer continues to decline. Heifers line the fences at the Coronado Dairy. “All of the sudden, everything I’ve worked for that I thought I could pass on and was of a substantial nature doesn’t exist anymore because we’re going to be out of water again,” he said. “You don’t have anything to pass forward, and it’s going to end up being a ghost town out here.” Williams is one of many residents in the Willcox basin whose well has gone dry in recent years. Throughout the basin, water levels in the aquifer have been declining at an estimated six to eight feet per year. The Arizona Department of Water Resources does not keep track of residential wells that have gone dry around the state. While there is no official record of how many wells have gone dry in the area, local leaders say they are hearing of more and more wells going dry. Caleb Blaschke, the city manager of Willcox, said that he’s heard of Riverview drilling deeper wells for multiple residents who have complained of wells going dry near their two large dairy operations. The city has seen a steady growth in the demand for water-hauling services from rural residents whose wells have gone dry in recent years. Blaschke said people drive into the city daily to haul water now. Coronado Dairy Heifers Blaschke said that two of his employees’ wells had recently gone dry, and he’d had to spend $15,000 deepening the well on a rental property he purchased last year. In 2013, neighbors Steve Kisiel and Mark Spencer found themselves in the same situation as many other residents throughout the basin who had woken up to find that their taps had gone dry. Kisiel said theirs was the first to go dry in the neighborhood, but many of their neighbors have had to either deepen their wells or begin hauling water in the years since then. “It’s a traumatic feeling when you turn on your faucet and nothing happens,” said Kisiel. Kisiel and Spencer deepened their well by 200 feet down to 600 feet for $15,000. During the process, they learned that the water level in their well had been decreasing by an average of six feet per year. Kisiel was shocked. Today, $15,000 is a small price to pay for a deeper well in the Willcox basin. Local drilling companies say deepening a residential well costs an average of between $40,000 and $50,000. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that the average income for the county is $27,362, about half of what it costs residents to drill deeper into the aquifer. Sinking groundwater In 2015, the Arizona Department of Water Resources initiated the development of a groundwater flow model for the Willcox basin due to continuing observations of groundwater level declines. ADWR is currently in the process of updating the model to reflect current groundwater trends. Keith Nelson, a contributing researcher on the model, said that the water levels reflect a higher rate of pumping since 2015 and a “significant long-term imbalance.” The model shows that the natural recharge rate for the basin is 40,000 acre-feet per year. Roughly 200,000 acre-feet of water are pumped out of the basin annually. “There’s very little in the equation I currently see to balance the equation,” said Nelson. “To me, the question is, is the imbalance currently four to one? Or is it five to one? It’s not a question of whether the system is in equilibrium.” A drone shot reveals the expanse of Riverview's Coronado Dairy operation in the Kansas Settlement. The Willcox basin is a closed basin. Mountains and impermeable rock formations beneath the earth surround it. It can only be refilled by rain or specific recharge projects. There is no other source of water connecting to it underground. “Here in Willcox, that’s it. We’re here; we’re shut into this bathtub,” said Homer Hansen, an environmental consultant and lifelong Willcox resident. “If we start talking about our issues here, it’s different in some ways because we’re not continuous with any aquifer. We’re all here, and this is it. We’ve got one shot at it, so to speak.” Nelson explained that as the groundwater levels decline, the aquifer shrinks with it. The Willcox basin is composed of many fine grained materials like silt and clay. When the water recedes, these materials compress together and don’t want to take the water back. In recent years, earth fissures have opened up all around the basin due to this subsidence in the aquifer. The basin’s decline has not improved since ADWR completed the 2015 groundwater flow model. Nelson said that observational data gathered by ADWR shows that the depletion rate has increased since 2015. “It is a concern that the farming industry is going vertical here,” said County Suprevisor Peggy Judd. Over the last 20 years, multiple large agricultural corporations have moved into the basin. Riverview LLP, a dairy and beef conglomerate headquartered in Minnesota, has been the largest. In 2014, Riverview began buying land in the Willcox basin. Since then, the company has spent over $180 million on nearly 51,000 acres in the Willcox and Douglas basins. A drone image shows the tens of thousands of heifers being raised at the Coronado Dairy. The Coronado Dairy in the Kansas Settlement raises more than 65,000 heifers and milks 7,000 cows daily. If you drive down Kansas Settlement Road past the dairy’s main entrance, you’ll see miles of cows surrounded by the lush crop circles that grow feed for them. In 2019, Riverview began expanding its dairy operations in the Willcox basin by constructing Turkey Creek Dairy near Sunizona. It’s even larger and, at full capacity, is designed to hold 9,000 dairy cows and 120,000 heifers. According Judd, Riverview’s dairy operations in the Willcox area are primarily focused on raising heifers to be sent back to Minnesota for milk production. The two facilities combined can milk 13,000 dairy cows daily, while over 100,000 heifers are raised between the two locations each year. Judd has worked closely with Riverview since they moved into the county in 2014, touring their facilities in Arizona and Minnesota. Mature dairy cows require 18""}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 12:22 pm Two East Valley moms said there was a key moment when they had to look at their son and let him know that no matter what, they had his back. That was the moment they stopped being victims of sextortion, and went on the offensive. Sextortion is a growing problem nationally and across the Valley. Online predators, many believed to be overseas, seek out children on social media platforms, pretending to be someone near the same age and of the opposite sex. They encourage an exchange of explicit photos, and once that happens, the real predator emerges and threatens to distribute the photo to everyone the child knows unless they pay up. Homeland Security Investigations says there have been more than 7,000 reports involving 3,000 victims in the past year. Those are just the ones they know about. The FBI’s Internet Criminal Complaint Center logged 18,000 reports of sextortion-related crimes in 2021, saying they’ve cost Americans $13.6 million. Many victims pay to avoid embarrassment and many others don’t even report the crime for pretty much the same reason. Two East Valley families described their experiences with sextortion. They spoke on condition their names would not be published, given that the victims are juveniles. Call them John Doe and Joe Smith. John Doe’s mom found out her son had a problem when she received a notification from their bank that he was trying to withdraw a large amount of money. “I said, ‘what on earth is my son spending $200 on?’” John’s mother said. She was visiting a neighbor when she got the notification and immediately called her 14-year-old son. “He goes, ‘Mom, can you just come home?’ And I go, well, I’m visiting, I’ll be home in a minute. He was, ‘Could you just come home right now?’” She raced home and opened the front door to see her son crying. “‘Mom, I messed up. I messed up so bad,’” she recalled him saying. “He was beside himself, he was hysterical. In that moment, I just looked him in the eye and just told him, I said, ‘Listen, I don’t know what’s going on, and I’m not sure what happened. “’But there is nothing that we cannot work through. We’re going to fix this. I’m not saying it’s not going to be painful, but we’re going to fix this, and we’ll figure this out together. I’m with you.’” Joe Smith’s mother said pretty much the same thing to her son, who had just turned 13 when he was victimized. She found out when her son kept trying to get a look at her phone early one morning. “He comes into my room to look at my phone, and I say, ‘Hey bud, what do you need?’ He says, ‘I have a migraine,’ and I said, ‘OK do you want me to get you some Tylenol or Advil or whatever?’ “I go downstairs and he’s trying to get into my phone when I come upstairs.” He asked her if he could see the footage she shot at a game he played the previous week. So, she unlocked the phone and showed it to him. She learned later that the boy was told the predators were going to post the photo they had of him to all his family and friends. He wanted to look at the phone to see if they carried out that threat. “I go about my business and I see him pacing in the hallway, and again we’re talking like 5 a.m., 5:30 a.m., and he doesn’t get up until about 7:30.” Finally, her son came clean. “He says, ‘Mom, I think I need some help. This person wants money from me.’ “As soon as he said that, I instantly knew. I said, ‘Buddy, I know exactly what this is, don’t you worry about it. They are trying to scare you. Just show me what you did, show me what I need to know.” Then she told him, “‘This person cannot harm you, we are going to shut it down. I am so grateful that you had the ability, the bravery to come to me.’” In both cases the predators on the other side of the conversation did not get what they wanted – and did not post any photos to the children’s friends. John Doe’s mother called the police and immediately suspended her child’s social media accounts to prevent any postings to or from them. The next time the predator tried to contact her son, she answered. Telling him who she was and that police have been called. The predator quit the conversation and never returned. Joe Smith’s mother had a little more difficulty suspending her son’s social media accounts because he had forgotten his passwords. But eventually they figured that out and suspended them. John Doe’s mother said she didn’t care what they had to do, even if that meant moving to a different state to start over. She said she told her son there are consequences, and sometimes they are painful, but they would get through it. Both moms had the same advice for other parents: Talk to your children now, make sure they’re aware of the danger. “Talk now to sons and your daughters, talk every single day,” said Joe Smith’s mother. “Too young doesn’t exist in my mind. He was 12, well he just turned 13. If your kid has a phone, if your kid has a friend, they could have a social media account through the friend that they access on their phone. “So talk to your kid. Remind them they have a safe place to talk to you and use my story as an example.” “It’s uncomfortable to bring it up with your children, you know, sex, when they’re 10, 12, 11, 13, 14, 15 even 16,” John Doe’s mom said. “Let them know, there’s people who don’t think like we do. “You’re just not conditioned to recognize (someone trying to manipulate you). Even though it’s uncomfortable, talk to you kids. Let them know it’s out there.” Both boys are popular at their schools and are athletes. That makes them pretty much the ideal victim, Joe Smith’s mother said. “He is the perfect demographic, the perfect target,” she said of her son. Being popular means he has something to lose and a lot to fear. Stacey Sutherland is with the Arizona Anti-Trafficking Network, which is a non-government organization that works with many East Valley police departments on sextortion and similar crimes. “It’s a great tool, but for kids, it can be really, really dangerous,” Sutherland said of smart phones. “It can be a doorway to invite people who do not have good intentions right into the house, essentially.” She said a teen mind trying to deal with someone demanding money with the threat of circulating embarrassing photos can seem like the end of the world. “Sometimes it’s an empty threat, but sometimes it’s not an empty threat.” And the danger goes beyond embarrassment. “There was a case in California last year, where the time between a boy being sextorted and killing himself was less than a couple of hours,” she said. That boy was Ryan Last, a 17-year-old, straight-A student and Boy Scout who lived in San Jose, according to news reports. In his suicide note he said how embarrassed he was for himself and his family. He died in February. The naked photos don’t even have to be real. John Doe’s mother said her son sent a partial photo that did not show everything. “As well as the picture that my son had sent, they imposed somebody’s else’s body on his likeness,” John Doe’s mother said. Using AI to create nude photos also happens. Sutherland pointed to a case in Spain this September. AI-generated nude photos of at least 30 girls at a school in Almendralejo – a town of about 30,000 residents – made international news this fall. The girls were between 12 and 14. One girl told her mother that a boy had demanded money or he would circulate the photo. Police said the perpetrators used photos from social media profiles and uploaded them to an app that converted them to realistic nude photos. “Social media changes everything,” Sutherland said. “It’s the place where our kids get validation, it’s where they connect to their peers, where they feel an inclusive community. “Parents need to be on the app, they need to make sure their children’s profiles are private, and they need to be having conversations that not everybody on the Internet is a good person, and that you should never be sharing images of yourself.” Never miss an issue.

At its Aug. 6 show at Walter Studios in Downtown Phoenix, students will play an array of tunes from rock and pop’s most prominent names like Billy Joel, Elton John, Taylor Swift, John Mayer and The Beatles at its annual “Rockin for a Reason” show, which will benefit Phoenix nonprofit Elder TLC. Elder TLC works to “distribute meaningful gifts to low-income residents in neighboring senior care facilities.” “We had been talking about the different communities that we’ve already been able to help and affect and I think one of the communities we feel has been neglected has been the elderly community,” said School of Rock Scottsdale General Manager Michelle Worley. Worley said it took months to select Elder TLC as the show’s beneficiary. She recalled that her school played a special Mother’s Day concert earlier this year where students gave their mothers flowers. The school ended up with leftover flowers and donated them to the senior living community Friendship Village Tempe. Worley says this spurred a desire to use the school’s platform to aid elder care facilities and organizations further. “There are a lot of people that are elderly that are in need … sometimes something as simple as a new blanket or a pair of gripper socks or, you know, a little plushie might be a beneficial item for the elderly,” Worley explained. Because of this, the School of Rock is asking for donations of new clothing like lounge pants, long sleeve T-shirts, pajamas and robes. Worley explained the items should be new with the sales tags on them because Elder TLC places puts them in a store at its facility so seniors can “shop” and regain the joy they once had purchasing new clothes. In addition to taking donations of clothing, the School of Rock is collecting unique items like realistic-looking baby dolls and plush animals. “(Elder TLC) is finding that realistic baby dolls are their most needed items,” she explained. “A lot of these folks might have dementia, or Alzheimer’s and sometimes the comfort of holding a baby for an elderly member might bring back old memories and be a very soothing thing for people who have memory issues.” Worley is requesting that these items be dropped off the day of the show at the theater, where there will be a special collection bin, or at School of Rock’s locations: 13610 N. Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale; 885 E. Warner Road, Gilbert; or 2805 E. Indian School Road, Arcadia. Worley said the students worked for over a month to learn some of rock and pop’s most iconic songs note for note. But she sees this gig as the perfect opportunity for the young performers to mix entertaining with giving. “It’s showing them that they have responsibilities in our community,” Worley said. “If we can show them at a young age what that looks like, how we give back to our community and why we picked the way we did it, I think the kids need to see that. “It ultimately comes down to the name of the concert, it’s rocking for a reason. We always have that opportunity to play music, but if we do it for a purpose sometimes it can hold a little bit more meaning in our lives.” School of Rock Rockin’ for a Reason When: 10 a.m. Sunday, Aug. 6 Where: Walter Studios, 747 W Roosevelt Street, Phoenix Cost: $15 at the door.

Students in kindergarten through sixth grades at Estes Elementary School in Marana know. That’s how many of the copper coins they raised to beat out 117 other schools statewide to win the Arizona CENTennial Penny Drive. Nearly 70,000 students participated in the competition, during which they collected pennies to finance the cleaning, resealing and brightening of the Arizona State Capitol Copper Dome. Estes students raised $1,309.70. Statewide, $23,757.45 in pennies have been reported as collected, with some school yet to weigh in. To celebrate, Estes Elementary, 11279 W. Grier Road, held a schoolwide pep rally on May 20. On hand were Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction John Huppenthal, representatives of Arizona Centennial sponsor Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, and penny drive partner Bashas’ Family of Stores. Students also met the Arizona Centennial’s official mascot, the Copper Chopper, and were presented with a commemorative copper coin with the Arizona flag from Freeport-McMoRan. “In the excitement of receiving the collections from schools across the state, we had great anticipation of who the top-collecting school would be,” said Karen Churchard, director of the Arizona Centennial Commission and 2012 Foundation. “It was a close race between a few schools, and we were pleased to finally announce that Estes Elementary School had collected the most pennies. It’s heartwarming to see the enthusiasm of these students, and their teachers, too, who embraced this once-in-a-lifetime project that is creating a legacy for all Arizona students.” Estes Elementary School Principal Nancy Paddock, said: “From the beginning, our teachers and students alike were enthusiastic participants in the Arizona CENTennial Penny Drive. We recognized immediately the historical significance of this opportunity, and took it as an opportunity to discover new facets of Arizona’s history, plus act to collect the pennies. We are just delighted that the enthusiasm carried through to energize our students to gather more pennies than any other school in the state. It’s an honor and we are proud to be a part of this ‘legacy.’” The school’s initial interest in the program came from students in fourth-grade teacher Rosa Islas’ class, said Paddock. History is included in the fourth-grade’s learning standards, and as a part of their curriculum, the kids had traveled to Phoenix to see the State Capitol. Each week, Mrs. Islas’ students collected pennies in manila envelopes from their classmates and tallied the amount. The class then coordinated announcements over the school’s public address system to let students know which classrooms were in the lead. The Arizona CENTennial Penny Drive was a program developed by teachers for teachers and coordinated by a statewide committee of educators and supporters. The Penny Drive occurred over 48 school days, beginning Feb. 9, with penny collection ending April 15. The 48 school-day campaign reflected Arizona’s place as the 48th state admitted into the union.

Now two years after he was formally censured for a video that appeared to espouse violence against lawmakers, Gosar has again grabbed headlines by saying the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff would be hanged in a “better society.” (File photo by Jasmine Kabiri/Cronkite News) Adrienne Washington Cronkite News//September 26, 2023// Two years after he was formally censured for a video that appeared to espouse violence against lawmakers, Arizona U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar has again grabbed headlines by saying the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff would be hanged in a “better society.” The Bullhead City Republican made the comment Sunday in his weekly newsletter, in which he blamed Gen. Mark Milley for delays in deploying troops to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 – citing a hearing last week that made no mention of Milley. Analysts said that even for a “rhetorical bomb-thrower” like Gosar, the comments were surprising, but that he is unlikely to suffer any political damage from the comments from voters in his conservative district. “There are a lot of rhetorical bomb throwers in Washington, and I don’t know if anyone surpasses Gosar in that group,” said Kyle Kondik, the editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. “Gosar may be the leading one.” Neither Milley’s nor Gosar’s offices responded Monday to requests for comment on the newsletter. But one analyst said some lines should not be crossed in politics, adding that Gosar’s latest remarks crossed it. “That type of rhetoric does not do the country any good,” said Mike Noble, CEO of Phoenix-based Noble Predictive Insights. “When you’re getting to the level of basically making threats, death threats, and especially in this day and age, it’s incredibly irresponsible and frankly, the congressman should be ashamed of himself,” Noble said. Noble was referring to the newsletter “This Week with Gosar,” which included a section on a House committee hearing last week into security failures during the response to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Former U.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund testified at that hearing that he requested National Guard assistance on Jan. 3, but was turned down by Congress’ two sergeants-at-arms over concerns about the “politics and optics” of troops at the Capitol. Sund said he asked for National Guard help again during the attack on Jan. 6, but it took more than an hour to get an OK from the sergeant-at-arms and almost five more hours in which he “had to beg” the Pentagon before Guard troops showed up. Gosar, in a homophobic-laced attack in his newsletter, laid the blame for the delay squarely on Milley, whose term as Joint Chiefs chairman is over at the end of this month. “Even after approval was given, General Milley, the homosexual-promoting-BLM-activist Chairman of the military joint chiefs, delayed,” Gosar wrote, citing Sund’s testimony, even though Sund made no mention of Milley and said he dealt directly with a different lieutenant general. That did not stop Gosar, who branded Milley a “traitor” for a variety of perceived infractions when Milley was Joint Chiefs chairman during the Trump administration. “In a better society, quislings like the strange sodomy-promoting General Milley would be hung,” Gosar wrote. It’s not the first time Gosar has been criticized for extreme jabs in official publications. In 2022, Gosar took to his congressional account to tweet an anime cartoon that depicted the beheading of two characters – but with the faces of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and President Joe Biden pasted on the targets and Gosar’s face on the character wielding the sword. Gosar was formally censured by the House, then controlled by Democrats, for that tweet, and was stripped of his committee assignments as a result. With the House now in Republican hands, it is unlikely that Gosar will be censured for his latest comments. And Noble doubts they will hurt him politically, either, in a conservative western Arizona district where Gosar faced no challengers in the 2022 election. “There’s really no consequence for doing it, at least electorally,” Noble said. “He’s got a ton of MAGA-type supporters and this type of rhetoric has kind of been accepted already.” But Kondik notes that the state is not as solidly Republican as it once was, and that the GOP would benefit by softening its message. “It’s a state that’s been getting more competitive. And Republicans used to have hammerlock on that state and now they don’t,” Kondik said. “I think Republicans in (Arizona) would be wise to try to present a kind of less hard-edged message to voters,” Kondik said. “It’s kind of emblematic of some of the problems that Republicans have had in that state.” Tags: Congress, jan. 6, gosar, U.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, u.s. capitol, Gen.

González estará en residencia hasta fines de abril de 2023. Como una niña chicana creciendo en el Este de Los Ángeles, era difícil para Estella González imaginarse convertida en autora. Aunque creció devorando libros de la biblioteca pública y siempre le fue bien escribiendo, la falta de representación hacía que su sueño se viera solo como eso, un sueño. Nunca pensó en ser escritora como una forma realista de ganarse la vida, pero escribir siempre fue algo que estaba en su cabeza. “Creo que tuve suerte de crecer en East Los Ángeles, porque en la biblioteca pública había un Centro de Recursos Chicanos y tenían libros de escritores chicanos”, dice González. “Eran principalmente escritos por hombres, eso es cierto, pero al menos podría decirme a mí misma: ‘Tal vez uno de mis libros estará en esos estantes algún día’”. Tomó esta porción de representación junto con la que encontró en la escuela cuando se le asignó leer un libro de Jane Austen, la única autora explorada en su clase de inglés en un mar de “hombres blancos muertos”, como ella los llama. Entonces, juntando sus dos pedacitos de representación, no podría ser un sueño tan lejano para una niña chicana tener éxito como escritora. Pero había un obstáculo más, aún más grande que la falta de representación, y era tener padres inmigrantes. Su mamá de Chihuahua y su papá de Jalisco, México. Es difícil justificar la decisión de convertirse en autor ante alguien que dio mucho para que pudieras convertirte, no sé, en médico, enfermera o químico. Padres que trabajaron duro para estar en Estados Unidos para poder darles a sus hijos una mejor oportunidad en la vida que la que obtuvieron. “Me preguntaban, ‘¿cómo vas a ganar dinero con eso? Escritora’”, dice González. “Y yo les dije: ‘No lo sé. Lo resolveré’”. Y lo hizo. Obtuvo su licenciatura en inglés de la Universidad Northwestern, en Illinois, y después de eso tomó algunos trabajos donde podía ser “escritora adyacente”, como ella lo llama. Trabajó en marketing y en los años 90´s como reportera en Los Ángeles para The Wave, pero no fue hasta que se mudo a Tucsón en 1997 que decidió darle una verdadera oportunidad a la escritura creativa. Comenzó tomando algunas clases de escritura de ficción en Pima Community College y enviando trabajos a revistas literarias, hasta que salió de Arizona para obtener su maestría en Bellas Artes en Ficción de la Universidad de Cornell en Nueva York. Por supuesto, todavía hay muchos obstáculos como mujer chicana para convertirse en escritora, pero en los años 90´s era mucho más difícil. Durante los talleres, los otros estudiantes de sus clases le decían que no podían entender o relacionarse con su trabajo, porque se centraba principalmente en su existencia chicana y, a veces, usaba palabras en español. “Creo que, como lector y escritor, debes estar abierto a todas las culturas diferentes, pero hay resistencia”, dice González. “Siempre ha habido esa resistencia de algunos lectores de inglés que dicen: ‘bueno, no puedo relacionarme’. Bueno, yo me relacioné con Shakespeare. Me encanta su poesía y sus obras son increíbles. También amo especialmente a Jane Austen. ¿Qué tengo que ver con una mujer que vivió en el periodo de Regencia en Gran Bretaña? Nada, pero ella es una mujer y estaba pasando por dificultades con su familia, y puedo relacionarme con eso. Todos tenemos familias. Todos somos humanos”. Siempre ha habido una punzada de desafío en González. Desde romper el molde y perseguir la escritura, hasta perseguirla de la “manera incorrecta” pero apegada a sus armas, definitivamente ha valido la pena. Sus historias han recibido múltiples distinciones y premios. Recientemente, en los International Latino Book Awards anuales recibió el premio Rising Star por Chola Salvation, publicado en 2021, que ganó medallas de oro al Mejor Primer Libro y Mejor Colección de Cuentos. Chola Salvation El libro se compone de historias interrelacionadas, la mayoría tomando lugar en el Este de Los Ángeles, que juntas muestran las complicadas vidas de una comunidad chicana en conflicto, como en la que González creció. Dos años después, González ahora es la escritora residente de la Biblioteca Pública del Condado Pima (PCPL), donde llevará a cabo consultas de sesiones individuales para escritores y talleres de escritura para la comunidad hasta fines de abril 2023. El programa de residencia comenzó en 2016 como una subvención de la Biblioteca Estatal de Arizona. Hay dos residencias durante el año, la que Estella esta tomando ahora, y otra de mayo a julio donde habrá otro escritor. “Creo que va a ser realmente genial”, dice Margie Farmer, bibliotecaria de artes literarias de PCPL. “Ella tiene experiencia en la enseñanza en Pima College y una amplia experiencia en educación y su nuevo libro es uno con el que estamos familiarizados”. Farmer trabaja en la bibliotecas del Condado Pima para supervisar la publicación anual del Libro del Año del Suroeste, es la líder de la carpa de Nuestras Raíces en el Festival de Libros de Tucsón que se realizó los días 4 y 5 de marzo y supervisa el programa de Escritor en Residencia de la biblioteca. Conoció a González en el Festival de Libros de Tucsón de 2022 y cuando llegó el momento de elegir un nuevo escritor en residencia, invitó a González a presentar su interés y de ahí se dio para que ocupe el rol hasta abril. Libros en español en la Biblioteca Quincie Douglas en 1585 E 36th St, en Tucsón, Ariz. Las consultas y talleres son para escritores de todas las edades, todos los géneros de escritura y todos los niveles de experiencia. González tendrá ocho sesiones de 30 minutos por semana, los martes estarán en la Biblioteca Quincie Douglas y los miércoles en la Biblioteca Flowing Wells. Las sesiones comienzan a la 1 p.m. y se ejecutan cada media hora, y la última sesión comienza a las 2:30 pm. Aunque dice que su español “no es perfecto”, está dispuesta y ansiosa por ayudar también a los escritores en español (le cambié a en español, porque españoles es el gentilicio para los de España) a pulir sus habilidades, incluso si tiene que sacar el traductor de Google algunas veces. “Espero que los escritores encuentren apoyo para sus sueños, especialmente los escritores aspirantes que buscan el coraje para hacer esto para ganarse la vida”, dice González. “También quiero que los escritores se den cuenta de que la biblioteca, especialmente las bibliotecas públicas, y los bibliotecarios, son un recurso para ayudar a empujarte o nutrir esas aspiraciones de escritura, porque miro hacia atrás y pienso: ‘wow, si no tuviéramos esa biblioteca cuando niña, no sé qué habría sido’”. Llama al (520) 594-5335 o pasa por la Biblioteca Quincie Douglas para registrarte para consultas ahí y llama al (520) 594-5228 o visita la Biblioteca Flowing Wells para registrarte en esas sesiones. Hay un límite de una sesión por semana por persona. Los tres talleres durante su residencia son: Mapeo de la memoria: uso de los cinco sentidos para crear carácter, conflicto y entorno.

Please give us a call at 520-458-9440 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy Helene Jackson SIERRA VISTA — The husband and adult children of a Sierra Vista woman mauled to death by at least one pit bull as she took an evening stroll in June have served a $7.5 million notice of claim on city officials stemming in part from how a dog attack against another resident was handled by the city’s Animal Control unit in February. Helene Jackson, 84, and her mini poodle, Lily, were savagely killed June 23 when one or two American Staffordshire Terriers, commonly known as pit bulls, belonging to Shimira Marie Sanches and Ashlee Sanches jumped a residential block wall. The Sancheses have been indicted on felony charges including manslaughter related to the attack. They will be back in Cochise County Superior Court on Feb. 16 unless their cases are resolved before then through a plea agreement. While the criminal prosecutions could be resolved soon, the likelihood that civil litigation will be initiated took a step forward earlier this month with the filing of the $7.5 million notice of claim by Jackson’s survivors. A notice of claim is required under Arizona law to be served upon a public body, public official, or public employee within 180 days of an incident to give the public entity an opportunity to settle a claim without litigation. The claimants, who are demanding $2.5 million, are Helene Jackson’s husband, Michael, as well as her son and daughter. The notice of claim, which was served on city officials Dec. 19, describes how Helene Jackson gathered up her very small dog, Lily, in her arms in an unsuccessful effort to protect Lily from the attack by Thor, one of the pit bulls. “Thor was able to wrest Lily from Helene’s arms,” the claim states. “Thor killed Lily, and then attacked, mauled, and killed Helene.” Whether a second pit bull, named Panda, belonging to the Sancheses also attacked is not confirmed. But the thrust of the notice of claim against the city stems from the fact Panda and Thor escaped their yard in February and attacked another resident and his dog in what is described as a similar unprovoked act of aggression and violence. According to the notice of claim, the victim of that Feb. 11 attack was injured but avoided more serious injuries through “the timely assistance of a nearby resident, who used a shovel to break the hold of Thor and Panda on their victims and to stop the attack.” Public records show Shimira Sanches arranged the same day to take both dogs to the city’s Nancy J. Brua Animal Care Center for a “bite quarantine” as governed by City Animal Control Ordinance 90.20. The dogs were quarantined for 10 days during which staff checked for any signs of rabies. They were released without being current on their rabies shots. However, the notice of claim contends an even bigger act of negligence occurred when the staff failed to impound the dogs for being dangerous or vicious as addressed by Ordinance 90.05(B) even though city staff had knowledge Thor and Panda were “vicious animals” as defined in the city’s Animal Control Ordinance 90.01 and as an “aggressive dog” as defined in Arizona Revised Statute 11-1014.0l(D)(l). “The City had the ability and authority to ensure that the impounded dogs would not harm anyone else, but nonetheless returned them to their owner(s) without taking meaningful action,” the notice of claim states, noting the dogs would have been euthanized or other “appropriate safeguards” would have put in place prior to their release if animal control staff followed Ordinance 90.05(B). Such safeguards, according to the notice of claim, could have included a requirement that the Sancheses build a more secure wall or fence to keep the dogs “from escaping again and attacking another unsuspecting victim” or require the dogs be restrained by a leash or chain when outside. Just four months later, Thor and possibly Panda escaped from the yard again as Jackson walked by with her small dog. “At no time did Helene provoke either Thor or Panda, or do anything to invite the canine attack upon her and Lily by Thor and/or Panda,” the notice of claim states. “She was not at fault in any degree or to any extent whatsoever. At all relevant times, Helene and Lily were in a place they had the legal right to be.” The notice of claim names the city and several officials, including City Manager Charles Potucek, Mayor Clea McCaa, and each council member. Also named in the notice are the current and former police chiefs as well as two employees of the city’s animal control department. The dogs’ previous act of aggression, of which Shimira Marie Sanches and Ashlee Sanches were aware, is expected to be an issue during plea negotiations or at trial. There is also expected to be arguments by the women’s defense attorneys that the actions by city staffers after the February attack in some respect mitigates the women’s criminal culpability. As previously reported by the Herald/Review, Sam Sanches Jr. lived with the women and was home June 23 with a young boy and the two pit bulls. He wound up having his left arm amputated and required more than 100 stitches along with skin grafts on his extremities from being brutally attacked as he tried to prevent one of the dogs from jumping a 5-foot fence as Jackson walked by. The other dog also joined in the attack on Sam Sanches, 53, who is the uncle of Shimira Sanches. The dogs were fatally shot on scene by officers with the Sierra Vista Police Department.

Times contributors wrote an open letter expressing concern of editorial bias in the paper’s recent coverage of transgender and gender-diverse people. Citing numerous examples of homophobic and transphobic reporting in the paper’s recent history, the letter expressed disappointment with the Times for “(following) the lead of far-right hate groups in presenting gender diversity as a new controversy warranting new, punitive legislation.” Since then, the letter has been signed by over 30,000 media workers, subscribers and readers of the New York Times. On the same day, GLAAD, the largest LGBTQ+ media advocacy organization, published a similar letter, signed by over 100 organizations and individuals. The GLAAD letter called the Times’ coverage of trans and gender-diverse people in the past year “irresponsible” and “biased” and said the Times “has repeatedly platformed cisgender (non-transgender) people spreading inaccurate and harmful misinformation about transgender people and issues.” Notably, the letters called attention to the use of the New York Times’ journalism by state lawmakers and attorneys across the nation, citing instances in Texas, Arkansas and Nebraska in which state lawmakers cited various Times articles in their legal justifications behind anti-trans healthcare legislation. In the context of other social movements and addressing attacks on marginalized communities, we believe divestment strategies are an effective and impactful method of applying public pressure to organizations that are perpetuating harm. We believe now is an appropriate time for ASU — and other universities — to divest from the New York Times and encourage the paper to correct its editorial bias in regards to coverage of trans and gender-diverse individuals. There are members of this publication who are queer and navigate a political reality that is, in part, shaped by the rhetoric disseminated in the Times, which can seep into local journalism as well. We have family, friends and fellow State Press Magazine staff members who are trans and gender-diverse. We are highly concerned with the New York Times' coverage of LGBTQ+ people, sources and issues at a time of escalating homophobic and transphobic legislation and violence in the U.S. As student journalists, we take the editorial standard of minimizing harm — enshrined in the Society of Professional Journalists’ code of ethics — extremely seriously. When the New York Times’ coverage of trans individuals is used to justify discriminatory anti-LGBTQ+ legislation being enacted across the country, it is clear that the paper has failed to uphold this core ethical principle. In Arizona, the American Civil Liberties Union is currently tracking 11 anti-LGBTQ+ bills advancing in the state Legislature, including SB 1001, which would ban public school teachers from using students' preferred name and pronouns without parental permission and would allow teachers to cite “religious or moral convictions” as legal justification for deliberately misgendering students. Last year, Arizona’s then-governor signed SB 1138, which criminalizes gender-affirming surgeries for minors, and SB 1165, which discriminates against transgender student athletes, into law. The civil rights of trans and gender-diverse people in Arizona — particularly children — are in crisis. ASU’s charter asserts the University is “measured not by whom it excludes, but by whom it includes” and assumes “fundamental responsibility for the economic, social, cultural and overall health of the communities it serves.” In continuing its institutional subscription to the New York Times, we believe ASU fails to live up to its charter by financially legitimizing the paper’s repeatedly and demonstrably biased and harmful coverage of LGBTQ+ people. Instead of holding an institutional subscription to the New York Times, ASU could invest in subscriptions to local news outlets covering the Valley and broader Arizona, publications focused on LGBTQ+ issues and advocacy and outlets that work to dismantle internal biases similar to those of the Times. We encourage other student media organizations across the U.S. to call for their respective universities to do the same.

It has a lock on it, so basically ripped the whole door in half — and I don’t know how the hell these guys did that — and then completely trashed our office. We had a deposit, and they took about $6,938. They took all the cash and change and all the stuff we had.” Sareen said that the protocol for the alarm system is that ADP will call the restaurant; if there is no answer, they contact him, and if he doesn’t pick up, the Oro Valley police are dispatched. “It takes cops 3 minutes to get there,” Sareen said. “The whole process was about 5 minutes. They did call. Obviously, I was sleeping. I didn\'t pick up the phone. “These guys were in and out in 3 minutes. They were pretty quick."" Sareen said the burglars realized they were being recorded on a camera and broke the camera, but he was able to come up with some pictures that showed the perps’ faces, and those were given to the police. No suspects have been found, but Sareen said that he could only make out that they were not Caucasian. “So far, the police response has been pretty good,” he said. “They have been in touch with me — the officer calls me and sees how I’m doing and if there is anything I need. They got the whole forensic team over there. They were there for a long time.” Sareen said the dining area was trashed, putting a hole in the wall, and some of the damage almost appeared as if “they had something against us or something.” “The office was totally trashed; everything was just everywhere. We couldn\'t open that morning. All the back of the restaurant took a day and a half to get back.” The restaurant opened the following day, but only to dine in, as the computers were trashed and the ability to take delivery and online orders was rendered void. Saffron was fully operational on Wednesday. “I couldn’t lock the door all (Saturday) night, so me and one of my staff members had to spend the night in the restaurant that night, because the doors were under construction,” Sareen said. “They showed up at 3 a.m. and then they put a temporary board, so it was just a ply board over there.” The restaurant is still under construction, but there was no slowing down Sareen and his team. “These things don\'t let me down,” he said. “My employees who were working, we paid them even if they didn\'t have any work. I’m more of a people person. These things happen. It’s sad to happen to us. I don\'t know why, because we are always nice, and we’ve been a part of the community. I always try to help out. “I’m glad it happened not during the hours it was and nobody was hurt.” Plenty of Saffron’s workers came, even if they weren’t on the clock, and worked to clean the mess left behind once the crime scene was secure and all evidence was collected. General manager for almost a decade, Samuel Nalli was on the scene after Sareen. “It was a mess; I came pretty early to get the restaurant ready for the day,” Nalli said. “We were running around trying to get security guys and contractors here to open the restaurant. It was pretty sad, because we employ a lot of people and want to give good food to the community. It’s hard to see, because it puts everyone a step back. “It’s hard to see someone just try to come in for a quick five minutes and take everything from us. We’ve had ups and downs, and we always find a way through. We have a supportive staff and a great community, and everyone has been pouring their support. We’re going to be OK.” Sareen stood firm on his business getting off the deck and getting right back to it. “That’s the way to do it,” he said. “You can’t let these things bring you down.” Never miss an issue.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 12:11 pm In recent months, the cases of two former police officers came before the Arizona Peace Officers Standards and Training Board, commonly known as AZPOST. While one will remain as a mere footnote on the city payroll, another could cost Scottsdale dearly. In September, Michael Lanouar entered a guilty plea and admitted to being intoxicated when he rammed his Scottsdale police vehicle into a car stopped at a red light. Paramedics took a couple that was visiting from Florida to a nearby hospital, where the man who was driving was treated for a broken ankle. According to the arrest report, Lanouar originally accused the other driver of causing the wreck by slamming on his brakes. The officer who arrested Lanouar noted he was stumbling and smelled of alcohol. A test showed Lanouar's blood alcohol concentration was 0.198% – over twice the legal limit of 0.08%. After being demoted to detention officer while Scottsdale Police investigated the case, Lanouar resigned in March. He accepted a probation deal to have charges reduced from aggravated assault to endangerment. He told the court he is “self-employed as a security and weapons trainer for security officers and can meet his financial obligations.” Lanouar was deemed “a medium-low risk to re-offend” and sentenced to three years’ probation and 10 days in jail – although “jail may be deleted or deferred upon (Lanouar) completing court-ordered alcohol or drug screening, counseling, education, and/or treatment program.” The former cop was also ordered not to drink alcohol for three years. His fines total nearly $2,000. Though his criminal case is over, Lanouar’s court trouble is far from over. In October, Danny and Jessica Stites sued Lanouar and the city. According to the complaint, on Nov. 4, 2022, “Michael Lanouar was driving eastbound through the intersection of north Pima and east Indian School Road, while under the influence of alcohol, when he rear-ended Mr. and Mrs. Stites while they were stopped for a red light.” “Mr. and Mrs. Stites were severely injured in the aforementioned accident, and were taken by ambulance to Scottsdale Osborn HonorHealth Medical Center while Mr. Lanouar was arrested under numerous felonies and misdemeanors,” the suit adds. The complaint insists the “City of Scottsdale is liable for the acts and omissions committed by … Lanouar while in the course and scope of his employment with” the city. The suit claims the city failed in its “duty to hire, train, and properly supervise their employees so as to provide proper education as to the laws and statutes governing driving while under the influence of any intoxicating or inebriating substance for the safety of the public.” The suit does not disclose the dollar amount the couple is seeking. Rather, the Stites’ complaint asks Maricopa County Superior Court for “general damages in excess of the jurisdictional minimum of this court” and “special damages as will be proven at the time of trial.” On Nov. 14, Scottsdale’s lawyers responded to Maricopa County Superior Court, saying the city “denies each and every, all and singular, of the allegations” in the Stites complaint. The city states, “Lanouar was not acting within the course and scope of his employment at the time of the alleged car accident” and asks the court to dismiss the charges against Scottsdale. Lanouar has not responded to the complaint, as of this newspaper’s deadline. Also in October, the AZPOST board unanimously voted to revoke Lanouar’s peace officer certification. During the September AZPOST meeting, Michael W. Arrata voluntarily relinquished his peace officer certification. He was inducted as part of a group of “new Scottsdale Police officers” in April. According to Aaron Bolin, a Scottsdale Police spokesman, Arrata after his induction was sent to a police academy. During his training, Arrata “admitted to cheating on a test which is an integrity violation. He was also not completely truthful with the academy staff when he self-reported the cheating incident, which is a violation of academy rules.” Though the incident might sound like a trifle, Bolin stressed the severity of Arrata’s actions. “Integrity amongst law enforcement professionals is extremely important to maintain the trust of the communities they serve,” Bolin said. “Integrity violations are taken very seriously from the time recruits start the academy through the rest of their career. People can make mistakes in an often fast-paced and stressful job such as law enforcement. “However willful and purposeful violations related to integrity cannot be tolerated.” Never miss an issue.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 12:15 pm A new parking garage, that is using prefabbed garage panels headed to the landfill, is opening in GSQ near 150th Drive and McDowell Road. Downtown Goodyear is quickly taking shape. The master-planned walkable urban center will be a destination for dining, entertainment and shopping, and several businesses have announced their arrivals to GSQ with many already under construction, including the city’s second parking garage in Goodyear Civic Square near 150th Drive and McDowell Road. The south parking garage, which started construction earlier than expected, will have 525 spaces and will open in May. The developer and landowner, Globe Corp., transformed what could have been garbage into what is being called the “greenest parking garage in the nation.” “We saved a $3 million set of garage panels that were prefabbed from going to the landfill,” said Michael Olsen, chief financial officer for Globe Corp. “The project they were going to be used for didn’t happen, and we realized they’d be a perfect fit at GSQ. Having shaded, quality parking is essential for a successful downtown.” Olsen got word of the prefabricated garage panels from Stephanie Fogelson with First American Title who had contacts at Venn Construction and Wentworth who were involved in the project that no longer needed them. With concrete lead-times, the prior developer preordered and prepaid for the concrete garage components and scheduled to have them shipped to a landfill. “The moment I got word of the potential to rescue the garage panels, I obtained the necessary files from Venn Construction and called Rich Montague from Ryan Co and Rick Butler from BDG,” Olsen said. “Everyone went to work analyzing how the panels would best fit the GSQ site slated for a second garage.” The city of Goodyear was also able to make it possible for the parking garage construction to start sooner than planned. “Chris Baker, the city’s development services director, and the entire planning and zoning team worked quickly to map out a timeline that allowed the garage panels to be saved,” Olsen said. “It was an amazing effort from a lot of people that made this project come together.” “Corslab was also able to hold the panels a few months longer than they wanted to, accommodating our construction schedule, and we appreciate that,” Globe Corp. Co-CEO George Getz added. “Using the prefabricated panels not only saved all that concrete from the landfill, it also saved 18 to 24 months off the original construction schedule.” Shaded parking will complement the design, look and feel of Downtown Goodyear and provide adequate space for visitors. The first parking garage in the city opened in August 2022 at GSQ, along with the new city hall, library, park and upscale office space. Recently announced businesses at GSQ include Bacchus Wine Bar, High Tide, The Stillery, gastropub concept Copper & Sage, The Yard Milkshake Bar and Shake Shack. “I am pleased that Globe is getting ahead of the expected development and putting in the needed infrastructure for our new downtown,” Goodyear Mayor Joe Pizzillo said. “We know that good parking is a key factor to any successful destination space, so I’m glad that element of our growing restaurant, entertainment and retail district is going to be in place to meet that critical need. “I think it is brilliant that Globe has an eye toward sustainability in using the parking garage that was already fabricated and would have otherwise been sent to a landfill.” To learn more about Downtown Goodyear, visit www.goodyearaz.gov/downtown.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 12:14 pm Supporters of President Donald Trump, including Jacob Chansley, right with fur hat, are confronted by U.S. Capitol Police officers outside the Senate Chamber inside the U.S. Capitol, Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington. Chansley, the spear-carrying rioter whose horned fur hat, bare chest and face paint made him one of the more recognizable figures in the assault on the Capitol, apparently aspires to be a member of Congress. Online paperwork shows that Chansley filed a candidate statement of interest, Thursday indicating he wants to run as a Libertarian in the 2024 election for Arizona’s 8th Congressional District seat PHOENIX — Jacob Chansley, the spear-carrying rioter whose horned fur hat, bare chest and face paint made him one of the more recognizable figures in the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, apparently aspires to be a member of Congress. Online paperwork shows the 35-year-old Chansley filed a candidate statement of interest Thursday, indicating he wants to run as a Libertarian in next year’s election for Arizona’s 8th Congressional District seat. U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko, a 64-year-old Republican representing the district since 2018, announced last month that she won’t seek re-election. Her term officially ends in January 2025. Chansley pleaded guilty to a felony charge of obstructing an official proceeding in connection with the Capitol insurrection. He was sentenced to 41 months in prison in November 2021 and served about 27 months before being transferred to a Phoenix halfway house in March 2023. Chansely grew up in the greater Phoenix area. Chansley is among the more than 700 people who have been sentenced in relation to Capitol riot-related federal crimes. Authorities said Chansley was among the first rioters to enter the Capitol building and he acknowledged using a bullhorn to rouse the mob. Although he previously called himself the “QAnon Shaman,” Chansley has since disavowed the QAnon movement. He identified himself as Jacob Angeli-Chansley in the candidate statement of interest paperwork filed with the Arizona Secretary of State’s office. The U.S. Constitution doesn’t prohibit felons from holding federal office. But Arizona law prohibits felons from voting until they have completed their sentence and had their civil rights restored. Emails sent to Chansley and his attorney seeking comment on his political intentions weren’t immediately returned Sunday. Log In Keep it Clean.

Wildlife World Zoo, Aquarium & Safari Park is celebrating the first rhino birth in decades in the state of Arizona. The female white rhino calf was born Nov. 7 to her parents Zuri and Maoto and, according to Wildlife World, is in excellent health. The zoo’s animal care team calls her Siki, short for Masiki, meaning ears. “She was tough to monitor through ultrasound because her ears kept getting in the way and after she was born, her ears were one of the first things to move after birth,” Wildlife World rhino specialist Emily Kading said.

As part of Wildlife World’s dedication to rhino conservation, the zoo works alongside the American Institute of Rhinoceros Science (AIRS) collaborating on new initiatives, taking rhino science to a higher level to improve genetic diversity and fight against the extinction of the rhinos. Siki’s arrival has been nearly a decade in the making, starting with the zoo’s highly anticipated rhino conservation breeding plan. The project brought in three unrelated female rhinos who were orphaned in South Africa and have three completely new bloodlines for breeding. Wildlife World also acquired a once imported male rhino from the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. “This is the most significant birth we’ve had in the history of our zoo,” Wildlife World President Kristy Hayden said. “This baby opens up a whole new bloodline that will play a key role in rhino conservation for decades to come. “I’m grateful Wildlife World had the resources and capabilities to import her mother Zuri from Africa, where she is no longer at risk of being killed by poachers, and to provide her and Maoto a natural environment to procreate.” To view a video of Masiki and her mother, Zuri, exploring the yard for the first time, visit www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sY3FMdD6AA.

Schools across the country, having seen test scores plummet and student discipline spiral out of control, have begun to ban the use (and, in some cases, the actual possession) of cellphones by students during school time. One local teacher told me of a male student who would constantly look at his cellphone during class. The teacher had to tell him to put it away. “One time,” as the teacher tells it, “I told him to put his phone away, and (the student) said, ‘I’m not on my phone.’ He absolutely had been on his phone.

So obsessive is the behavior of some kids that there are reports of students under the age of 10 bringing burner phones to put in the pouch so that they can keep their real phone available. Surprisingly (or, if you think about it, in this day and age not surprisingly at all), the biggest opposition to banning cellphones in schools is coming from parents. Many cite banal reasons for wanting to constantly be in touch with their kids — e.g., schedule changes, time and place for pickup after school. But many play the emotionally charged school shooting card. The fact that a school shooting happened even once is a black mark on our nation. The fact that they continue to happen should shame us all into action. However, the odds of any one school being hit with such violence is infinitesimally small, and to use the possibility of it someday happening is an irrational excuse for allowing students to have unfettered access to their cellphones during school. Districts back East have been successful in the banning (or, at the very least, the sharp curtailing the usage of) cellphones on school grounds by presenting the out-of-control current situation as a mental health issue. For many young people, the attachment to their phone certainly meets the definition of an addiction. Thus far, the courts have been siding with the schools. One of the determining factors as to how this mission to save a generation of our young people proceeds will involve conflicting hatreds on the part of Republican politicians. To wit: Which do they hate more — big tech or public education? If it’s big tech and its trillion-dollar cellphone industry, they’ll probably first try to do something stupid and unconstitutional, like the pols did in Montana when they tried to ban TikTok. But when that fails, they may try to limit cellphone use, which would make them temporary strange bedfellows with people who actually give a crap about kids. However, they’re probably more likely to embrace their go-to hatred of Public Education, that which allows them to demonize unions, criticize the teaching of the fact that slavery once existed in the United States, and have a fake bogeyman that they can use to argue in favor of their socialist voucher program. If they let the phones stay in schools, that will help keep post-pandemic test scores down and allow the further maligning of public schools. The pandemic severely damaged the learning curve of an entire generation of young people. Those young people are now using their own phones to hammer the final nails into their educational coffins.

From the Trafalgar Square Books media release: Jolyn Young grew up in the “real” northern California—the forgotten area at the tip-top of the state, with small towns, extreme poverty, and about 40 miles to the Oregonian mountains. In a childhood defined by a subdivision, she decided she wanted to be a cowboy, and two years out of college, she saw that dream through, taking a job at a Nevada ranch in the search for a lifestyle consisting of horses, cattle, and the wide open range. Falling in love was never part of the plan—but before she knew it, Jolyn found her cowboyin’ dreams overtaken by a new and intoxicating cowboy reality. When a baby-to-be suddenly spun her wild romance into a very practical marriage, moving from one decrepit ranch trailer to the next, Jolyn found her young family desperately seeking stability in what is by definition a transient lifestyle that moves with the seasons. Often hours from the nearest grocery store and half a day from the closest hospital, pregnancy, childbirth, and illness required a do-it-yourself mentality. With days, sometimes weeks on her own as her husband Jim worked the farthest reaches of whatever ranchlands they currently called home—first with one child to care for, and then eventually three—Jolyn fought profound loneliness, and found comfort in writing and company in her camera. With a memoir that is brave, honest, and heartbreakingly funny, Jolyn Young has written the story of every young adventure-seeker, every new mother, and every partner who has loved an alcoholic in a whole new light—that of a campfire, on the edge of the desert night, on the brink of civilization. Young writes about the comical side of living on a rural cattle ranch in the great American West on her blog and for Western Horseman magazine. Her story, and that of her family, was featured in the documentary film Cowboys: A Documentary Portrait. Never Burn Your Moving Boxes is her first book.

three-day visit to Israel and the West Bank in February 2023, visited the workshops ofMaking Peace, where Israelis and Palestinians create affordable solutions for the elderly and disabled. (JTA) — In January 2001, I was working at the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies, located on Kibbutz Ketura along the Israeli-Jordanian border. Since 1996, the institute has included Israeli, Palestinian, Jordanian, Moroccan, American and other college-age students from around the world. It also has several transboundary research centers, including our recently established Center for Climate Change Policy and Research, and our Center for Applied Environmental Diplomacy. From Jan. 21-27, 2001, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators at Taba, Egypt, came as close as they ever have to reaching an agreement. I thought the work of the Arava Institute would make a perfect story — with the Institute modeling what the negotiators were trying to achieve some 45 miles south of us, just across the Egyptian border. I gathered materials in Arabic, Hebrew and English about the institute and headed there. The Israelis were very suspicious but let me through, while the Egyptians took my materials and put me in a room with a soldier and his machine gun outside the door. Eventually, a military official made a call to Cairo, and I was given permission to proceed. In Taba, I found a group of reporters sitting at a round table. I made my pitch, inviting them to see the institute as an actualization of what the negotiators were working to achieve. Their response? I was told there is hard news, always to be covered, and soft news, if time permits and if it hasn’t been touched upon recently. My story was neither. This past spring, I would once again be made aware of that lesson — I call it the “Asymmetry of the Sensational.” In December 2020, Congress passed the Nita M. Lowey Middle East Partnership for Peace Act (MEPPA). Created through strong bipartisan effort, this is one of the most significant and innovative pieces of congressional legislation addressing the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. MEPPA authorizes up to $250 million over five years to promote economic cooperation and people-to-people programs; advance shared community building; and engender dialogue and reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians. Within the legislation, Congress appointed a Partnership for Peace Fund Advisory Board. Senator Patrick Leahy named me to the board, based on my decades’ involvement with the Arava Institute. In February, over three days in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Nablus, the board experienced a universe of Palestinian-Israeli collaboration, described by a young Israeli woman at TechSeeds for Peace as “statements of defiance, and friendships as radical action.” Another program we visited was at the Wolfson Medical Center in Holon, which runs an Advanced Trauma Life Support curriculum for Israeli and Palestinian trauma surgeons. These activities optimize trauma care for local communities, creates shared experiences and builds deeper respect and lasting partnerships. Reflecting on such teamwork, Dr. Adam Goldstein told an interviewer, “In the coming days, years and decades, I hope the selflessness, the lack of ego, the teamwork and diversity and mutual respect — can be a model for our entire region.” The goal is to bring these societies to a tipping point so they can see one another in a different light. These projects produce effective, measurable results that shape strong, respectful relationships between Israelis and Palestinians. The unending violence between Israelis and Palestinians signals they are stuck — they need an off-ramp. Greater knowledge of these programs is one way to that off-ramp. With such positive results, why don’t more Palestinians and Israelis know about these programs and initiatives? Blame the Asymmetry of the Sensational. In his poem “The Diameter of the Bomb,” the Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai explores how an individual act of violence expands from its “thirty centimeters” to “distant shores.” The multiplier effect of violence and extremist language far outweighs the affirmative consequences of MEPPA programs, as well as the work of more than 170 Israeli and Palestinian institutions in the Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP). On our MEPPA visit this past spring, it was so clear that, with all the positive results from these programs, fanatics need to do far less to have greater impact. Why is the Asymmetry of the Sensational so effective? A part of our brain responds to trauma with fear, fight and flight responses. Violence and extremist voices play into and feed off that fear, creating a deadly spiral. That fear is real and leads to negative perceptions between people; the weekly headlines steer us in that direction. It is easy to see why there is so much distrust between Palestinians and Israelis. The U.S. government over the years has invested millions of dollars, beyond MEPPA, in Palestinian-Israeli civil society. As large as $250 million is, it’s not enough. The International Fund for Ireland spent $40 per person in Northern Ireland on MEPPA-type projects. This relatively large expenditure was critical in paving the way for the Good Friday Agreement, which ended three decades of violence between Protestants and Catholics. At present, only $2 per person is spent on Palestinian-Israeli enterprises. The international community needs to come together and coordinate vast increases in the support of these programs. That investment needs to be augmented by appointing someone whose sole task is to wake up every morning and focus on advancing peaceful co-existence between Israelis and Palestinians. Appointing a Liaison to Israeli-Palestinian Civil Society at the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem would signal a greater integration of MEPPA, related U.S. funding and current policy. In addition, Israelis and Palestinians need to grasp that peace is not the final destination. It is a means and not an end. Peace does not erase all disagreements. The Good Friday Agreement did not end tensions between the two communities in Northern Ireland, but it did take violence, death and extremism out of the equation so that a healthier reality could emerge. MEPPA and ALLMEP create an essential step in that direction, with Palestinians and Israelis building mutual trust through their engagements with one another. Tareq Abu Hamed, the executive director of the Arava Institute, makes that point. “Water is not the scarcest resource in the Middle East, trust is,” he says. “We build trust between students and between researchers.” Differences may remain, but trust creates the will to work together to overcome those gaps. Trust is fundamental to generating the conditions for Israelis and Palestinians to have the better future they deserve. In the Asymmetry of the Sensational, one violent act or extremist statement quickly travels far and wide. We need to reverse that asymmetry and amplify quieter, transformative, positive actions between Palestinians and Israelis.

Please give us a call at 520-458-9440 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy The doors to the lobby of the Gadsden Hotel in Douglas are open with a sign indicating that the restaurant and tavern are temporarily closed. DOUGLAS — Officials with the historic Gadsden Hotel in downtown Douglas have announced they have temporarily closed the Cafe 333 and its restaurant as well as the Saddle & Spur Tavern. A majority of the hotel staff was also laid off, including Tanya Duarte, who had managed the hotel since Balwant Aulck, Rashpal Thind and Sukhchain “Ken” Sandu of Bright Brain Hospitality in Seattle took over ownership of the Gadsden in November 2022. Duarte confirmed through text Wednesday that she had been laid off along with 95% of the staff. The Gadsden Hotel’s website reads “The Restaurant & Bar will be closed starting 12/23 for maintenance until further notice.” Duarte said that on Dec. 27 employees of the Gadsden Hotel and Cafe 333 were notified of immediate closures and layoffs of all restaurant/ bar employees and all management for the hotel and restaurant. The hotel will be run as owner-managed now. “This move was unexpected and had a great negative impact on the employees who fully expected to have their jobs in place after a short maintenance and cleaning closure during the holidays,” she said. “Owners state that they are restructuring their organization and seeking funding to begin demolition on the hotel side. All employees who were laid off received letters stating that they would be notified if the restaurant reopens and they are eligible for rehire. Although there is no time frame or specific plan mentioned. “The affected staff have been long- and short-time employees of the Gadsden and showed great dedication during all of the changes under the current ownership. It was my honor and privilege to have worked alongside them. We worked hard and did everything we could to save the restaurant and hotel after the previous owners had effectively dismantled it. Thanks to these hardworking employees. It was again a place to be proud of. ""I\'m saddened that the owners chose the path that they did. On a business side, I understand the financial hardship. However, it could have been handled with much more respect and honesty to the many people who had dedicated themselves to the business and to the owners. I wish the owners the best of luck as the Gadsden Hotel is so important to the people and the community. ""Please support the staff as they seek other jobs during this trying time of year. They are all incredibly worthy and fantastic workers. They gave their all. They deserved better in return.” On Thursday, Dec. 28, the owners of the Gadsden Hotel issued a statement regarding the temporary closures and layoffs. “We appreciate our employees and residents of Douglas for all the love and respect they have given us,” the statement reads. “It has been a year since we purchased the beautiful historic Gadsden Hotel. The Hotel is unique in every aspect of the business and a valuable piece of history. “We are currently restructuring and reorganizing our business model to prepare for the long-term vision. In the past year, under the current model, we have lost over $200,000. Every week we made payroll out of our pockets, regardless of the negative monthly cash flow. “Our mission has always been to redevelop the building. We are redirecting our financial resources to the long-term vision. We currently have our demolition permit and are working on fire suppression and renovation permits in the early part of the year with the guidance from the city of Douglas, Cochise County and State of Arizona. “Unfortunately, these changes impact many valuable people within our organization. However, we need to focus on the long-term vision we have for the community of Douglas. The Gadsden is the anchor and the heart of Douglas and critical to the revitalization of the downtown area. “The restaurant and bar are currently going through annual cleaning and maintenance. We will be open soon for our guests and events. The model will be streamlined to be able to manage staying open during the upcoming renovations of the building. Currently, the hotel will be operating the 22 rooms, and the lobby will remain open for tourists. “We are extremely disheartened by the comments on Facebook, especially when the language contains racism, endangerment of people\'s lives, and defamation. We are going to work with authorities for investigation and premeditative of it We are proud citizens of a great nation on this planet earth, and have been paying our taxes for over 38 years. “We trust the constitution and law order of this country.

The City of Page is making it easier for residents to stay informed and to receive Page-specific emergency alerts. City Manager Darren Coldwell first announced the new system at the June 14, 2023, city council meeting. “Kane has been working on, under my direction and under the police and fire, a new alerting system for the City of Page in case there's ever an emergency,” Coldwell said. The new Code Red system is now operational. The online software, in addition to sending emergency alerts, enhances the city’s efforts to keep Page residents informed about events and public meetings. The Chronicle met with Page’s information technology director, Kane Scott to learn more. “What we want the citizens to know is if they go to the cityofpage.org website now, right below the main picture, is this emergency notification system,” Scott said. “And what this new system is doing is it's allowing them to not only get an alert if there’s something big emergency-wise, but it’s allowing them to sign up for community meetings – i.e., council meetings and whatever meetings and also events that are coming up. So the event people will be sending out reminders that the balloon regatta thing is today or we’re having July 4 or movies in the park or stuff like that. Simply by clicking on that, it takes them to an explanation page that tells them all about it.” Page residents who don’t go to council meetings, read the local newspaper or visit the city’s webpage regularly are sometime surprised by city projects in the works and protest. Uniformed citizens often hear development news long after advertised public meetings were held, long after months or years of time and public funds were invested. In other words, uninformed citizens potentially waste public resources. Page’s updated website demonstrates its transparency and its efforts to keep community members informed on every aspect of city government. Online visitors can browse the city’s finances, read the minutes of council and board meetings, or read the discussion and action agendas scheduled for upcoming meetings. “People are still saying that we're not getting enough information out, but we’re trying very hard to put this data everywhere,” Scott said. “We're trying to do more ‘instant.’ So something that goes in the mail, you might not get or you get late. This will do even more. So they’ve just got to sign up.” Code Red is free, and users have the option to receive notices by text, voice or email. The basic setup includes emergency alerts like unsafe water warnings or building fires. Emergencies in Page might be rare, but citizens can also choose to receive event and public meeting reminders. The system is still new to Page, and more data will be loaded for upcoming events and meetings. Scott said the alerts and reminders will be brief and include links for additional information. City Council meetings provide downloadable “PDF Agenda Packets” that are often quite large. The Aug. 23 packet, for example, is 139 pages of text, images and diagrams – too large for a text, phone or even an email message. “Everything is based off the website,” Scott said. “You can easily get to all of the public meetings. And the other button we made even better, ClearGov, which is a revenue project, expenditures and your tax dollars at work. If you click there, then you can get in and see – I mean, you can literally go to our checkbook and search.” Scott wants all Page residents to go to cityofpage.org homepage, “click on the emergency notification system and sign up.” COMMUNITY Other items that may interest you More news View this issue Browse other issues 298 N Pine St Globe AZ 85502 Phone: 928-645-8888 Links of interest Get Social""}]"

Please give us a call at 520-458-9440 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy WILLCOX — The nation’s leading travel stop network opened a new location July 13 at Fort Grant Road off exit 340 on Interstate 10. The 13,000-square-foot station is a long-awaited addition to the amenities available in Willcox. It‘s a big deal for the city. Residents and local officials have been anticipating its opening since the city began working with Love’s two years ago. To the small town it’s an increase in revenues and jobs for its residents. The new station will provide truck drivers and motorists with 24-hour access to purchase gas and diesel at the pumps. Inside is a spiffy new convenience store with all the appropriate grab-and-go travel items: coffee, drinks of all types, popular snacks, candies, and menu or ready-made prepackaged food. That’s the edible side. There’s also a travel store with auto supplies like wipers, motor oil and emergency items. There’s a section for travel mementos, knickknacks and fashion, and another for electronics such as computer pads, headphones, chargers and cables. Sixty-seven diesel bays, a CAT scale, and Speedco and Love’s Truck Care will be part of the station. Inside, five showers, and a laundry are available. The Oklahoma City-based family-owned business has a network with 639 Love’s locations in 42 states. In honor of the grand opening, the company will donate $1,000 gifts to the Willcox Quarterback Club and the Willcox Theater and Arts. An Arby’s restaurant, which opened July 17, is part of the complex. That too, was highly anticipated locally. As soon as the announcement of a new Love’s being built was made the speculation about which restaurant would accompany the station started. Regional travel stops have at least one restaurant, and some, like the Benson location, can have as many as three. Pizza, chicken and sandwiches, were all in play and were discussed around town and on social media since the construction began just before the holidays. Arby’s, the chain restaurant that calls itself the place with “the meats,” has just that, in brisket, roast beef, chicken in strips or nuggets, and roast turkey. All these come in sandwiches, wraps, or if you’re feeling like a dip, the French dip and Swiss are on the menu. Spiced french fries are always more fun when they’re curly, so that’s a choice in the fried spud department. “We were really looking forward to it. One of our favorite places to eat is Arby’s,” said Lee McKenzie from Sunizona, adding, “the closest one for us was in Sierra Vista so we’re glad it’s here.” “It was the biggest conversation when we wondered what it was going to be,” Lee said. Katie, Lee’s niece, said she “knew what it was going to be as soon as I saw the Love’s sign come up. I just knew. I said, ‘we’re getting an Arby’s,’ and she said, ‘I sure hope so.’ ” Log In Keep it Clean. Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexually-oriented language. PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR CAPS LOCK.

grade teacher who was shot by her 6-year-old student in Virginia earlier this year is no longer working for the school, according to a spokesperson for Newport News Public Schools. Abby Zwerner was shot in the hand and chest as she sat at a reading table in her classroom in January at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, a city near the Chesapeake Bay in southeast Virginia. Police say the boy, who has not been publicly identified, used his mother\'s 9mm handgun, which was purchased legally, in the ""intentional"" shooting. Zwerner spent nearly two weeks in the hospital. Newport News shooting: 6-year-old who shot his teacher exposes flaws in how schools treat students with disabilities She notified the school\'s human resources department March 13 that she was resigning from her position as a teacher effective June 12, spokesperson Michelle Price said Tuesday. The last day of her 10-month contact was Monday, Price said. Attorney Jeffrey Breit raised questions about Zwerner\'s separation from the school in an interview with local WAVY-TV on Tuesday. Breit said Zwerner was ""shocked"" by the school\'s actions and was ""fired."" He also said the school has not paid Zwerner since February. Breit did not respond to USA TODAY\'s request for comment Tuesday. James Toscano, a spokesperson for a law firm representing Zwerner, declined to comment on the matter. In response to the allegations, the school released a copy of an email exchange with Zwerner in which she stated: ""I wish to resign."" Price also detailed the school\'s policy for workers\' compensation. She said the school district\'s human resources department began processing workers’ compensation for Zwerner ""immediately"" after the shooting, and Zwerner was on administrative leave with pay until workers’ compensation payments began. Price said Zwerner refused workers’ compensation, so HR staff used her sick leave to continue compensation. ""When Ms. Zwerner’s sick leave was exhausted, she was placed on unpaid FMLA (Family and Medical Leave), in accordance with federal law and school board policy. Had Ms. Zwerner accepted workers’ compensation, she would have received 66 2/3% of her average weekly wages tax-free,"" Price said. Virginia school board: Group says teacher shot by 6-year-old should get workers\' comp, not $40 million from lawsuit In April, Zwerner filed a lawsuit seeking $40 million in damages from school officials. The suit accuses the district of gross negligence for reportedly ignoring multiple warnings on the day of the shooting that the boy had a gun and was in a ""violent mood."" That same month, a grand jury indicted the boy\'s mother on charges of felony child neglect and recklessly leaving a loaded firearm so as to endanger a child, a misdemeanor. The felony charge is punishable by up to five years in prison. The misdemeanor is punishable by up to one year in prison. His mother also has been charged by federal authorities. A Newport News prosecutor has said his office would not criminally charge the boy because the boy wouldn’t understand the legal system and what a charge means.'}]"

capital of Sudan. Worry burned through my veins as my mind stirred over my family’s safety and the uncertainty of Sudan’s future. They were questions that had no real answers then. Months and battles and bodies later, I’ve still come up empty. I’ve visited Sudan regularly since I was seven. Some of my childhood experiences there were worlds away from the mundane life I lived in the U.S. Throughout my time there, I would drift down the Nile River on boat rides. Not to brag, but that’s not something you do every day. I still fondly treasure memories of lunch with my mom’s side of the family, when I would eat a variety of Sudanese and North African dishes, like fūl, mulukhiya and mullah. Eating them in the States will never feel like eating them in Sudan. Right after, I would spend the night with my cousins on my dad’s side because they were closer to my age. And if I weren’t there, I would play with my cousin’s small kids, who would visit from Australia. Since then, I’ve built long-distance relationships with them over 8,000 miles away from my home in the States. But April 15 changed these memories forever. On that day, fighting erupted in Khartoum between the Sudanese Armed Forces, the country’s military, and the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces, sparking a power struggle that worsened a devastating humanitarian crisis in Sudan. The two groups are still fighting over control of the country and its resources. Six months ago today, Sudanese people woke up to the news that war had broken out in Khartoum, and it quickly spread like wildfire across the nation. The capital city of the country has been all but flattened, and the stories coming out of Darfur sound like genocide… 🧵 Seeing Sudan in shambles has shattered my heart into a million pieces. I still wonder how long the war will drag on and when the world will stop turning a blind eye to the country I love. Sudanese people around the world are mourning the significant losses our country has sustained. But like Sudan itself, we remain standing courageously to ensure the world does not forget about our struggle. Sudan seemed to be headed toward a path to democracy after the fall of former President Omar al-Bashir’s 30-year regime in April 2019, which was riddled with humanitarian crises — the dictator is wanted by the International Criminal Court for 10 counts of crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. Initially, the military, led by Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, temporarily ruled the country after al-Bashir was ousted. Beginning with Sudan’s 2019 Constitutional Declaration and 2020 Juba Agreement for Peace in Sudan, the country embarked on a steady climb toward democracy. In 2019, the civilians and military formed the Transitional Sovereignty Council, a power-sharing partnership that would temporarily reign until democratic elections were slated to be held in 2022. Al-Burhan then became the council’s president. In October 2021, however, al-Burhan led the Sudanese military in a coup to seize power from the civilian representatives in the council, interrupting the country’s charted course toward democracy. After dissolving the council, al-Burhan repeatedly said the military would return authority to elected civilians. Nearly a month after the coup, Sudan’s prime minister was reinstated in November 2021 when he signed a controversial deal to reestablish the council and once again share power with the military and al-Burhan. As part of the deal, the prime minister’s role dramatically shrank, and he resigned less than six weeks later amid mass protests against his deal with the military. This left de facto control of Sudan to al-Burhan. Now, al-Burhan is leading the SAF in the war against his former second-in-command, who turned against him and is now leading the RSF against his forces to win control over Sudan. Sara Elhassan, also known as @BSonblast on social media, is a Sudanese American political writer who provides daily updates on X and Instagram to “fill the gap” in international media coverage of the war. She gathers news from media outlets, grassroots resistance committees and emergency response teams in Sudan. These local organizations usually post information about fighting or program initiatives happening in their communities. On-the-ground activists in Sudan will also contact her to relay information. Today's quick update [Oct 31]:- Intense clashes between SAF & RSF in Darfur cities of Elfashir & Zalingei, resulting in the reported fall of the latter to RSF.- Zalingei is the second Darfur state capital to be taken by RSF in the last week, after Nyala.#KeepEyesOnSudan Elhassan said she has had to fill the information gap herself because the world has falsely viewed Sudan and Africa as places where turmoil is unending, typical and even normalized.

I think it’s difficult for the world to care when they have no frame of reference for people they don’t know.” Major American media outlets have failed to televise and distribute significant information about the conflict in Sudan, according to The Nation. The lack of global media coverage of the war may even promote the perception that the conflict is improving, according to a United Nations memo. In turn, the U.S. and the rest of the world have responded slowly to Sudan’s spiraling humanitarian crisis — even as the bodies pile up and civilians’ lives are uprooted. “There’s a lot of stuff behind the scenes that make it difficult for the war not only to stop but also for people to know what is happening,” Elhassan said. “What role has the media played?

No, this isn’t about those folks who spend their winters in Arizona or Florida. The snowbird behind this warning is an actual bird, the dark-eyed junco, a small creature you probably know if you have a bird feeder and maybe even if you don’t. Trim, gray sparrows that flash white tail feathers as they take flight, juncos are called snowbirds because they arrive in our towns with the coming of snow. Come spring, they head back up into the mountains or north to Canada and Alaska for nesting. Juncos are among the West’s most familiar birds, reliable companions on summer hikes and winter days. The total population of the species is estimated to be around 200 million. Juncos are in no danger of extinction, so, what warning could they be giving us? Juncos may be abundant, but they are also in sharp decline. According to the Breeding Bird Survey, a decades-long monitoring study of the nation’s birds, junco populations are down by 42% since the surveys began in the late 1960s. But here is the peculiar part: There is no obvious reason for this loss of millions of birds. Juncos are adaptable, not requiring some disappearing habitat. They don’t make long-distance migrations to the tropics. Poisons or toxins don’t seem to pose a special threat to them. What seems to be killing juncos is simply … everything. Based on numerous studies, the leading human-related cause of death among birds is predation by cats: over 2 billion (yes, billion) birds killed per year in North America. This is followed by collisions: windows, 600 million birds; vehicles, 200 million; powerlines and communication towers, 43 million. Then there are pesticides and toxics, 72 million; lead poisoning, 12 million; and oil and wastewater pits, 1 million. That adds up to well over 3 billion dead birds per year. Nothing on this list is a deliberate effort to get rid of juncos or other birds. They’re just byproducts of the way we conduct ourselves in the world. These dangers, of course, are not faced just by juncos. A review of North American bird populations documents that we have lost almost one-third of our birds since 1970. The researchers summarized their findings in no uncertain terms: “This loss of bird abundance signals an urgent need to address threats to avert future avifaunal collapse and associated loss of ecosystem integrity, function and services.” It’s not just bird populations that are collapsing. Insect populations are crashing as well. Studies from the United States, Europe and Asia over the past 10 years document shocking declines in insect populations, as much as 50 to 75%. If you’re plagued by swarms of mosquitoes in the summer, you might think that’s not such a bad thing. But insects are crucial to the functioning of just about every ecosystem on Earth, serving as pollinators, decomposers and as food for countless species of critters higher up the food chain. Is there an exception to this relentless litany of population declines? Why, yes. It’s us. Since 1970, the human population of the United States has grown by more than 60%, while bird populations have fallen by a third. That doesn’t seem like a coincidence. Everyone has heard of the canary in the coal mine: the bird that miners brought underground to alert them to dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide.

Please give us a call at (928) 774-4545 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy Living near an airport can exacerbate pre-existing health problems due to the increased load of pollutants in the air. Dear EarthTalk: Is it unhealthy for you to live near an airport? -- M. Smith, Pittsburgh, PA Living near an airport can have negative effects on health and quality of life due to noise pollution and air pollution from aircrafts. The noise from airplanes can disrupt sleep, increase stress levels and lead to hearing loss. Air pollution from aircrafts can have negative impacts on respiratory and cardiovascular health. However, the degree to which these negative effects occur can vary depending on factors such as the proximity to the airport, the number of flights, and the type of aircraft. A study supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in collaboration with the University of California and Columbia University found that people who lived within six miles of 12 of California’s largest airports exhibited higher levels of asthma and heart-related problems. Admissions for respiratory issues like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at nearby hospitals were 17% higher than the baseline average. Heart issues also saw an increase — by as much as nine percent. In another study led by Rima Habre, an associate professor of clinical population and public health sciences, it was found that the culprit may be something known as ultra-fine particulate matter (UFP), a form of pollution emitted by aircraft, especially in the vicinity of airports. In her study, she hoped to observe the effects of acute exposure by asking participants to take walks in a park that was near a Los Angeles airport, as well as a park that was further away. She discovered that the inhalation of UFPs led to an increased inflammatory response in not only the lungs, but the entire circulatory system of the participants with asthma shortly after exposure. As Habre further elaborates, UFPs are not regulated, and many individuals who live in the vicinity of high-traffic airports are assuredly at risk. Lead exposure is another issue that many aren’t aware of. A study published earlier this month in PNAS Nexus discovered elevated blood-lead levels in children who lived near the Reid-Hillview Airport in Santa Clara County, California. The source of the lead pollution was found to be piston-engine aircrafts -- small single or two-propeller aircraft commonly used for training or trailing advertisement banners. Unfortunately, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), older adults, those with heart or lung-related conditions, and children (especially at schools), are also vulnerable to UFP pollution. In fact, researchers from the University of Washington’s Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) have stated that air quality inside a classroom can be worse than the air quality outside. Thankfully, the researchers are working on a solution that involves portable air purifiers, as well as upgrades to heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. Their research, known as the Healthy Air, Healthy Schools Project, is in part being conducted at 20 schools near SeaTac Airport, and will involve the use of purifiers with and without filters, along with an analysis of academic performance. Hopes are that the findings will inform future endeavors related to the improvement of air quality not only in schools, but in other buildings used by the public on a daily basis. The air children breathe may have an impact on their upbringing.A study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health shows certain low-income populations are being exposed to higher levels of dangerous fine particulate air pollution than other groups.Victoria Petro-Eschler, a mother of three, lives in Salt Lake City, Utah. Her family is all too aware of how the air they breathe affects their daily lives.""We never have just a quick little 48-hour head cold. We have a cough that starts, and we try to like Dimetapp it out, you know, and then it always settles into their lungs,"" Petro-Eschler said. ""You can\'t avoid it here. It is part of everything. It determines if my kids get to play inside or outside on certain days. You know, my kids go from one highway that they\'re in the shadow of for school and another highway that they\'re in the shadow of at home.""The air quality also determines how often the children are able to attend school.""My kids have been late for days out of the past two weeks because we have been dealing with chronic coughs and upper respiratory,"" Petro-Eschler said.They live on the west side of Salt Lake City, a community with a median annual income of $49,000. An airport, an interstate interchange, a quarry and multiple refineries are their neighbors.SEE MORE: Study: Global Pollution Kills 9 Million People A YearRichard Holman was one of the founding members of the Westside Coalition, an organization that made enough noise about the problem that they gained the attention of the Environmental Protection Agency. While each individual company meets EPA standards, it\'s the combination that affects nearby residents.""And it\'s not difficult to prove what\'s happening on the west side. These people are compromised,"" Holman said.A University of Utah study of 174 Salt Lake City County public schools showed schools with predominantly minority students were exposed to worse air quality. A separate study showed there were more school absences when the air quality was poor.Harvard professor Francesca Dominici was part of a study that looked at air quality throughout the United States. The study showed that air quality is not just a problem in Salt Lake City.""The most polluted area is the one that there is a lower socioeconomic status where they have multiple environmental stressors,"" Dominici said.Environmental stressors forced Holman to eventually move, out of fear for his health. Those same stressors ignited Petro-Eschler to run for city council.""To fix environmental issues is going to be slow and tedious. To fix the equity issues, the racial, the ethnic, the gender disparities, it\'s going to be slow and tedious,"" Dominici added.The EPA is evaluating environmental stressors for the next six months.Petro-Eschler worries a fix won\'t come soon enough.""My doctor, when I told her this last time, when I went to get the steroids, I looked at her and said, \'Am I killing my kids by living where I live?\' And she looked at me [like] ... she doesn\'t want to tell me that.""

The official record for State Press podcasts is the audio. Please listen to the audio as this transcript may only contain summary forms of the given episode. This is a feature story with original reporting from the podcast desk. Justin Gonzalez: It is really just amazing to see how concept has really evolved to where a lot of the residents here don't have cars, you know, they do take the light rail, take their E-bikes, and people just, it helps people work together, you know, we live in a place or a society where a lot of people are individualized, but now like here is just a lot of people, you know, mingling, and just working together just hanging out. Tyler Abrams: It’s hard to find affordable housing in the Phoenix area, and it's even harder if you're attempting to run a small business. If you’re a student, even dorming can be a hassle. Now, imagine you are a student attempting to run a small business and pay for your own apartment. In this feature of State Press Play, we explore the Culdesac, a new communal housing development in Tempe, Arizona. I’m Tyler Abrams, and this is State Press Play. What is Culdesac? Tyler Abrams: Culdesac offers a sustainable and affordable alternative to compact and crude apartment blocks by building their units around a walkable neighborhood concept. Similar to housing in Europe. Culdesac built apartments next to the light rail station at 2025 East Apache Blvd, Tempe. That’s not all. Tenants like Adrian Rodriguez, owner of Ito, a sustainable clothing company, can not only live within the apartments, but also opt to have their own storefront within the community. Adrian Rodriguez: I started Ito in high school. I originally in high school, like my freshman year, I was selling sneakers a lot and kind of through. Like my time and like reselling sneakers, I actually ended up really getting into fashion. And through that I kind of like, was drawing inspiration from a lot of my culture and decided that I kind of wanted to start my own, like business and brand and start making things that you know, I wanted to make. So that was a lot of fun. I originally heard about cold a sack from my friend Jada, I'd be like pointing out these spots to her. And I'd be like, Nah, but that spot is 5000, though is that spot is like $7,000 that building, I'd have to buy it for like a couple million, I don't know, half a million dollars, and things like that. And they were saying that they're opening up some live workspaces, where you can kind of like, you know, set up a little store. And the rent there is actually really affordable. Tyler Abrams: Tenants also have a host of benefits to access. The entire complex is built around forming a tightly bound community. Storefronts are built around the Little Cholla Marketplace, and towards the end of the square, there are accessible gyms beside the apartments, which is also located within the square. Tenants also have free access to the light rail, which is directly in front of the complex. Residents are also encouraged to use e-bikes to commute around the neighborhood, and over 1,000 parking spots are reserved only for e-bikes. These spaces are situated around the Little Cholla marketplace. For one bedroom one bath prices range between $1,360 to $2,210. Two bedrooms are leased at a starting price of $2,339 per month. Although tenants like Adrian Rodriguez save money living and working in these micro-retail spaces , other tenants find them more useful as storefronts only. Hanging around Little Cholla Tyler Abrams: The entire community of small business owners is built around the Little Cholla marketplace. It functions as a community plaza, hosting events and driving consumers to the small businesses within the plaza. This creates an environment where the business owners build relationships with the community and their customers. That is how the owner of Ito, a sustainable clothing brand, Adrian Rodriguez has built relationships with his customers and the other vendors in Little Cholla. Adrian Rodriguez: It's almost like I feel like more comfortable at a market than in my own store, which is like, a really strange thing just because like, the constant flow of people, like, there's always another chance to try again. And with the store, they're kind of like already in your space. So it's not really a flow of people, it's kind of just like they're in there. Every once in a while they leave and then another group comes in, but like, I've just really been having to, like, change up the way that I, that I pitched the idea to other people. And it's also like, like, the store is also my first time ever having like, returned customers that already know the concept. Tyler Abrams: When community events are held here, the entire plaza erupts with music and laughter. People within the community and others from around the Tempe area flock to Little Cholla to buy handcrafted clothing, food, and other lifestyle products while supporting the small businesses. It’s a model that everyone benefits from. Even if you don’t have a storefront, Little Cholla allows pop-up vendors to set up shop around the plaza square during the event. Jada Stratman: Yeah, so I am Jada Stratman. And I'm the owner of Brite Candle Co. So it's a small business here in Arizona, we main focus is like home fragrances. So I do handmade all natural, like soy candles, soaps, body products, as well. The opportunity to live and work and have that space where I'm able to make money out of my apartment, that's like a super cool concept that a lot of people can't like, grasp the idea that they're like, what your business is in your living room kind of thing. Tyler Abrams: Vendors like Jada mainly get the word out about their businesses by setting up at events hosted in the Little Cholla Marketplace. Their, vendors have the opportunity to sell and advertise their products to other customers at the event, creating a symbiotic relationship between vendors both within and outside of Culdesac. C'oni Antrews: I am the owner of Ooo So Ju’Cee LLC. I am a luxury drink concierge business. We provide cold pressed juices, wellness shots and bar services. I think actually gives me the opportunity to gauge towards the community more or less because I do a lot of farmer markets and I do a lot of online. So it's really good to kind of tap into being more in the community. I'm able to see all of my customers first of all face to face and then let them know where I'm located. So that drives the foot traffic to where I'm located, which is in the heart of Phoenix will shoot in Jefferson. So it just allows me to be in the community and then bring the community to where I'm located. Tyler Abrams: And other vendors like Syuzanna Sav, see themselves as an extension of Culdesac's marketplace. Syuzanna Sav: I'm Syuzanna Sav and I'm the owner of Domecor Home Vintage Decor store. I first started as an online store, I started selling on Instagram. And then I wanted to expand my audience. And I wanted to meet people. And I wanted to actually put all the fines I'm getting every day for people to see it in person. So I started going to the markets myself as a customer, to kind of see how everything works. I want my business to, you know, be nice, like in a fit in the market community. Tyler Abrams: Ultimately, it is these efforts that make the marketplace a community space. According to Alan Pettinger, co-founder of Pickers Playground and event organizer, activating this space for the community was their main goal. Allen Pettenger: My name is Allen Pettenger. I'm the event organizer, founder for pickers playground, and we host events at Little Cholla, second Thursday of the month. So we've kind of tapped into our follower base customers, shoppers, mainly based in central Phoenix. But we definitely have a little cult following at this point. And just kind of bringing bringing out our customer base and raising awareness about the space and the plaza and showing everyone that this is a pretty cool spot to hang out live, work, eat, play. Tyler Abrams: It’s also been a great opportunity to get the word out about the small businesses at Culdesac. Allen Pettenger: And it's a really good opportunity for people that have these micro retail spaces to kind of extend their retail space, bring stuff outside of the shop into the Plaza, where we're hosting events, their shoppers, it's""}]"

(Photo by NOAA, public domain, https://bit.ly/3ZBTe66) WASHINGTON - After three nasty years, the La Nina weather phenomenon that increases Atlantic hurricane activity and worsens western drought is gone, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday. That’s usually good news for the United States and other parts of the world, including drought-stricken northeast Africa, scientists said. The globe is now in what’s considered a “neutral” condition and probably trending to an El Nino in late summer or fall, said climate scientist Michelle L’Heureux, head of NOAA’s El Nino/La Nina forecast office. “It’s over,” said research scientist Azhar Ehsan, who heads Columbia University’s El Nino/La Nina forecasting. “Mother Nature thought to get rid of this one because it’s enough.” La Nina is a natural and temporary cooling of parts of the Pacific Ocean that changes weather worldwide. In the United States, because La Nina is connected to more Atlantic storms and deeper droughts and wildfires in the West, La Ninas often are more damaging and expensive than their more famous flip side, El Nino, experts said and studies show. Generally, American agriculture is more damaged by La Nina than El Nino. If the globe jumps into El Nino it means more rain for the Midwestern corn belt and grains in general and could be beneficial, said Michael Ferrari, chief scientific officer of Climate Alpha, a firm that advises investors on financial decisions based on climate. When there’s a La Nina, there are more storms in the Atlantic during hurricane season because it removes conditions that suppress storm formation. Neutral or El Nino conditions make it harder for storms to get going, but not impossible, scientists said. Over the last three years, the U.S. has been hit by 14 hurricanes and tropical storms that caused a billion dollars or more in damage, totalling $252 billion in costs, according to NOAA economist and meteorologist Adam Smith said. La Nina and people building in harm's way were factors, he said. Climate change is a major factor in worsening extreme weather, alongside La Nina, scientists said and numerous studies and reports show. Human-caused warming is like an escalator going up: It makes temperatures increase and extremes worse, while La Nina and El Nino are like jumping up and down on the escalator, according to Northern Illinois University atmospheric sciences professor Victor Gensini. La Nina has also slightly dampened global average temperatures, keeping warming from breaking annual temperature records, while El Nino slightly turbocharges those temperatures often setting records, scientists said. La Nina tends to make Western Africa wet, but Eastern Africa, around Somalia, dry. This particular La Nina, which started in September 2020 but is considered three years old because it affected three different winters, was unusual and one of the longest on record. It took a brief break in 2021 but came roaring back with record intensity. “I’m sick of this La Nina,” Ehsan said. L’Heureux agreed, saying she’s ready to talk about something else. The few other times that there’s been a triple-dip La Nina have come after strong El Ninos and there’s clear physics on why that happens. But that’s not what happened with this La Nina, L’Heureux said. This one didn’t have a strong El Nino before it. Even though this La Nina has confounded scientists in the past, they say the signs of it leaving are clear: Water in the key part of the central Pacific warmed to a bit more than the threshold for a La Nina in February, the atmosphere showed some changes and along the eastern Pacific near Peru, there’s already El Nino-like warming brewing on the coast, L’Heureux said. Think of a La Nina or El Nino as something that pushes the weather system from the Pacific with ripple effects worldwide, L’Heureux said. When there are neutral conditions like now, there’s less push from the Pacific. That means other climatic factors, including the long-term warming trend, have more influence in day-to-day weather, she said. Without an El Nino or La Nina, forecasters have a harder time predicting seasonal weather trends for summer or fall because the Pacific Ocean has such a big footprint in weeks-long forecasts. El Nino forecasts made in the spring are generally less reliable than ones made other times of year, so scientists are less sure about what will happen next, L’Heureux said. But NOAA’s forecast said there’s a 60% chance that El Nino will take charge come fall. There’s also a 5% chance that La Nina will return for an unprecedented fourth dip. L’Heureux said she really doesn’t want that but the scientist in her would find that interesting.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 12:11 pm (Karen Schaffner/Staff) Rocking a body con meadow top and matching skirt, Elizaveta Brotherton stands with a mannequin, clad in a graphite top with matching skirt. No one could guess that behind the concrete walls of a downtown apartment building is a budding clothing empire. Anavéta offers clothing through its online shop; pieces for young women who like very interesting, almost custom-made apparel. The choices include backless silk dresses (hot pink or electric blue, $275) and the barest of bikinis (red, cobalt, black, white or strawberry print triangle bottom, $40, and matching micro top, also $40). The brainchild of business partners Elizaveta Brotherton and Anya Gudimova, the online store features fashion for brave young women — or any women — who are not self-conscious about their bodies. The company is more than sexy clothing. The partners are joined by the desire to not harm the Earth. “What Anavéta is to me is more than a clothing brand, but a lifestyle,” Gudimova said in a statement. “We are building a community that is not only interested in fashion, but also beauty, health, and is passionate about learning about eco-friendly alternatives to our way of living. We source the best materials we can find, and work on creating a timeless core collection that outlives quickly passing fashion trends. We want to educate consumers of the effects the fashion industry has on the environment and share alternatives.” Brotherton added, “We created a vision focused on sustainability and ethical business practices, adding something to the industry, as opposed to bringing in another brand without any purpose.” To that end, they use natural fibers as much as possible — especially silk — and recycled, regenerated plastics that are turned into thread and finally fabric. That is turned into bikinis. Sizes run from XS to XL; no plus-size fashions as of yet. That requires more work and money than they can deal with right now. The 2-year-old company didn’t start with clothing; it evolved into that. “Originally we wanted to do women’s underwear and lingerie,” Brotherton said. “That’s how it started: as a dream.” They kept at it, coming up with names like Skins, Intimates and Exclusives, among others. Eventually they landed on, and branded themselves as Anavéta, a combination of their first names. Finally, they began to create their designs. Along the way, they met people who helped them make samples from their designs. They were also introduced to small manufacturers. Finding the right manufacturer, however, was challenging. “We couldn’t find anything small, like smaller order, made-to-order type stuff,” Brotherton said. Like any good entrepreneur, that didn’t stop the pair. “I sat down, and I started to learn to sew, myself, and I, with no experience, taught myself through online videos and just putting together lace and (other materials), just trying to make what I could,” she added. After a couple of months, her sewing improved, Brotherton said, and then she started to get orders. She created a silk dress, and the business blossomed. That’s also when she realized they needed to expand their line into regular clothing. “I found a local seamstress that helped me bring (my dress design) to life,” Brotherton said. “I posted a video of me developing from sewing underwear to sewing the dress to sewing our bikini samples. It blew up on TikTok and it got 2.3 million views.” Plenty of orders quickly followed. Now Anavéta has a dedicated seamstress, Michigander Miranda Root, whom they found online. They have also sourced an LA manufacturer. Brotherton works in her tidy, small apartment, surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook Broadway Boulevard Downtown. Accompanied by her black kitty, who likes to be involved in whatever she’s doing, Brotherton designs, does the books and fills orders. Standing guard next to her very neat desk is a mannequin wearing an Anavéta two-piece outfit (rib knit, body con, open back, turtleneck top, forest green or charcoal, $65, with matching skirt, $140) and across the room is a clothing rack with Anavéta samples. The lot includes a silk, bias-cut mini skirt (lavender, pearl or charcoal, $120) or a silk, mid-calf, bias-cut skirt (lavender fields, which is really a lovely light blue, or champagne rain, a beige shade, $210). Although Gudimova works thousands of miles away in Alaska, computers keep them connected. Gudimova and Brotherton agree on the company’s future. “As we’re evolving right now, we want to see Anavéta be a core collection,” Brotherton said. “We want to have things that are for everyday wear. Right now, it’s for resort.” They are also focused on sustainability. “We recognize that the most sustainable clothes are ones that have already been made,” Gudimova said. “We are launching an exciting project sourcing vintage fashion for our customers as part of our ‘Second Chance’ initiative. We will personally be sourcing unique pieces, and giving them a second chance, which helps keep clothes out of landfills.” “It’s going to be a curation of clothing that’s already out there in the world because it’s like the most sustainable practice since the clothes are already made,” Brotherton added. “We’re going to find these pieces and do small launches in order to stay on top of trends without mass producing this fast-fashion consumption. We’ll add things that match trends in the most sustainable way that we can.” Anavéta anavetawear.com Never miss an issue. Sign up for free today.

Please give us a call at 520-375-5760 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy Hermosa Project President Pat Risner fields questions from residents, many of whom expressed concern over environmental and health impacts of a potential manganese processing facility in Santa Cruz County. In a packed auditorium at Rio Rico High School Thursday evening, Hermosa Project President Pat Risner attempted to address concerns over a potential manganese processing plant in Santa Cruz County. But as residents wandered through the space, reviewing information provided by South32, questions lingered. One question in particular hung in the air: How would a manganese processing plant affect the health of local community members? After browsing through the open house – hosted by South32 – Yolanda Robles, a Rio Rico resident with 10 grandchildren in the area, worried aloud over potential health-related ramifications. “I still want to live,” she said. “I really love my life.” At certain levels, breathing manganese dust or fumes can lead to health complications similar to those of Parkinson’s Disease – slowed movements, stiffness, depression and anxiety, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In recent weeks, South32 representatives have described a number of precautions for the facility, including community checks, sealed containers for transport, dust monitoring and exposure limits set well below the federal government’s recommendations. As she left the meeting, resident Lisa Redpath said hearing about the community health checks made her feel more concerned – not less. “Something’s going to happen,” she said. The Hermosa Project in the Patagonia Mountains. The processing facility would support South32’s Hermosa Project – a mining operation in the Patagonia Mountains. For now, Risner said, no location has been determined for the facility, though he told the NI the plant would be constructed far from residential areas or schools. “We have no plans to place that facility in Rio Rico,” he told scores of attendees. “We haven’t decided yet where that facility will be.” Risner continued: “We do still prefer that facility to be in Santa Cruz County to maximize employment and economic benefits. But that is a preference, not a necessity.” Not all residents appeared satisfied by Risner’s answer. “Leave the county,” some of them shouted. ‘You get confused’ Thursday’s open house, had included a barrage of informational materials in English and Spanish, outlining the history and blueprint of the Hermosa Project. But speaking to the NI, Maria Cristina Renteria expressed a need for more Spanish-language resources, aside from the informational packets – for instance, Spanish speakers who could answer her questions about the mining operations and potential new facilities. “You get confused,” Renteria said, sitting outside the auditorium with her husband and friends. Renteria, who takes regular walks through Rio Rico, wondered how potential pollution would affect her and her family’s livelihood. “We need more information,” she stated. The U.S. Occupational and Safety Health Administration – more commonly known as OSHA – has established a manganese permissible exposure limit of 5 milligrams per cubic meter, not to be exceeded at any time. Those regulations aren’t stringent enough to shield workers from health impacts, according to Dr. Brad Racette, a neurologist in the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center and chair of neurology at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, who has studied manganese exposure for nearly two decades. “There’s a pretty strong consensus in the manganese health effects field that the OSHA exposure limits are far too high,” he said. Speaking to the NI last Tuesday, Risner said South32 sets a limit of 0.05 milligrams per cubic meter – 100 times lower than the federal regulations. The 0.05-milligram limit, Risner said, is determined by health recommendations in the United Kingdom. Another organization – the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists – recommends an even lower exposure limit at 0.02 milligrams per cubic meter for workers. “Their recommendation is the manganese exposure limits should be far lower” compared to OSHA, said Racette. But, he added, the ACGIH recommendations are not binding – they’re not requirements. Meanwhile, South32’s role in other countries has bubbled to the surface repeatedly for residents who’ve expressed concern over the mine’s local presence. “The history is dismal,” said Gerry Navarro, a Rio Rico resident. Those records have been well-documented: Over the past year, investigative outlet Carte Blanche, and later the Washington Post, reported on long-term Parkinsonian symptoms among South32 mine workers in South Africa. Risner, however, has continued to point to the Hermosa Project – and the processing facility – as next-generation, first-of-their-kind projects. “There is no analog for that facility … You’re not going to find an image of one of these online,” he said. “You’re not going to find a video of one of these online.” Shifting sentiments During Thursday’s open house, some residents described a shift in their sentiments over South32’s local presence. Kalani Kanae, who lives in east Rio Rico, said he’d been hesitant, at first, to oppose the project completely. That changed as Kanae attempted to find information about health effects and water supply. “As I’ve asked questions today, I’m not getting the straight answer,” he said. Kanae, who grew up in Hawaii, recounted his own experience in witnessing industrial development – large-scale pineapple farms, which used toxic pesticides. “I know the devastation that chemicals can (have) in people’s lives,” he added. Describing Rio Rico and Nogales, Kanae said he still wanted to see development. “Development,” he added, “that would be beneficial to the community.” And as the potential expansion of South32 came into play earlier this summer, resident Gerry Navarro said he’d wanted to look at both sides of the issue, and at previous community meetings, has cited a need for local employment opportunities. By Thursday’s open house, however, Navarro said he was leaning more against the project than before, after researching the health effects of manganese exposure. “And it is bad,” he said. Though he plans to take a free tour of the mine in the fall – something South32 offers to members of the public – Navarro noted that he was “not convinced” by the answers he’d received so far. “You can’t get your health back,” he added. \u200b Copyright © 2000- • Nogales International • 268 W View Point Dr, Nogales, AZ 85621 | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Contact Us | The NOGALES INTERNATIONAL is owned by Wick Communications.
