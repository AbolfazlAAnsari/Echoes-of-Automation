Sadly, it has been one of Vineland’s best-kept secrets,” said Val Neuber, president of the board of trustees. “Many of the events and actions of Vineland residents have had a national impact on history. We want current residents and visitors to learn about what has happened here.” “We would also like to share future plans for the museum,” said Warren Crescenzo, vice-president. “Our goal is to build an additional 2,000 square feet to the existing museum. The plan is to add exhibit space, increase the space for presentations, and make the entire museum barrier-free, with an elevator and larger restrooms.” Come early to the open house on December 2—before sunset—for a look at the museum’s new rain garden.

During inspections of 58 New Jersey stores in November 2022 and February 2023, OWM found more than 2,000 such instances where the price scanned for higher than the posted price — and sometimes as much as $5.95 higher.
