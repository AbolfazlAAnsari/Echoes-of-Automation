Lee approaches Mount Desert Island, communities are bracing for landfall. For residents, this means emergency preparedness. For visitors, it might mean an abrupt end to their vacation. The Bar Harbor Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday released a list of cruise ship cancelations due to the forecast. The ships, which were scheduled to make port daily through Saturday, are no longer coming here. They include the Norwegian Escape, the Vista, the Pearl Mist’s and the Caribbean Princess. As for community events that have been impacted by the storm, the Bar Harbor Bank and Trust Half Marathon and 5k, which is held by the Mount Desert Island YMCA and was scheduled for Saturday, has been canceled. With Lee expected to make landfall on Saturday, the YMCA made the call on Wednesday afternoon. “We spoke with a few more community resources and it just seemed a practical decision in light of the high winds,” said Ann Tikkanen, CEO of the MDI YMCA. “For the safety of the runners, I think we have to be cautious.” Before making the call, Tikkanen had said that this race would be difficult to call off because it has never been canceled in its history. To make it up to the runners, the YMCA will be providing a race map and T-shirt to those who registered for the race and who choose to run it on their own later. “We are setting up a plan so that runners can visit MDI before Thanksgiving, come run the course with a paper race route map, pick up a T-shirt, and receive a medal,” said Tikkanen. “We are optimistic that runners who have had this race on their 2023 race list will come by, visit and run!” Events aside, residents with boats are also preparing for the bad weather and are seeking protection for their vessels. Local boat yards and mooring fields are filling up with boat owners looking for a safe place to store their boats for the duration of the hurricane. “Our mooring field is full because we’re known to be protected out here, and we’re hauling boats like crazy,” said Allison Pinkham, office manager at the Henry R. Abel Yacht Yard. “Mooring balls have been checked and floats have been checked. At this time, we’re full mooring-wise and hauling-wise. We’re going to batten down the hatches.” “We started late last week calling customers to give them a heads up,” added Kirk Ritter, general manager of Hinckley Yacht Services. “As things developed, Monday morning, first thing, we started hauling boats at a high rate. Yesterday we hauled boats for 12 hours straight.” Ritter noted that storm preparation has caused a scramble all along the coast, and anyone who is able is trying to get their boats protected before the weekend. While Hinckley has a lot of space to haul boats, Ritter said that they are quickly running out of room due to the rush. “We’re still hauling. Fortunately, we’ve got about 17 acres here,” Ritter said. “We will be at capacity by the end of the day tomorrow. Like other yards, we’re turning away people. We’ve already hauled 50 [boats] and I’ve got a waitlist of 50 more.” More important than boats, however, is making sure that island residents and their families stay safe during the storm. Andrew Sankey, director of the Hancock County Emergency Management Agency, shared some of the concerns that the county has for the impending weather. He said that flooding of road surfaces and high winds are likely to be the biggest problems faced by Hancock County residents. Heavy rain and high winds can result in power outages and compromised utility services. Transportation could also be hampered due to flooding roads and downed debris. “We want folks to be prepared with the essentials that they may need,” Sankey said. “Make informed decisions, don’t take unnecessary risks, don’t drive through floodwaters.” Sankey also noted that making use of emergency supplies should be done so carefully and safely. He noted that improper use of generators or candles during a power outage could easily make a bad situation worse by causing carbon monoxide poisoning or a fire. “If you need to make use of emergency generation and emergency lighting, do so safely,” Sankey advised. Sankey also advised that in addition to standard emergency supplies, those who require life-sustaining medication should make sure that they have enough to last through an extended period. He also stressed the importance of communication and checking in on others to ensure safety and being aware of other people’s whereabouts before and after the storm. “In the aftermath of the storm, check on your neighbors and loved ones,” Sankey said. “Let people know that you’re safe and let people know where you’re sheltering in the storm.” Reporter Success!

Those that do get legal help are 80% more likely not to be evicted (they may instead go to mediation, work out a payment plan for back rent or agree on a timeline to find new housing).

The Proclamation of a State of Civil Emergency – declared for Androscoggin, Aroostook, Franklin, Hancock, Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Oxford, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Sagadahoc, Somerset, Waldo and Washington Counties – mobilizes all State of Maine resources to assist and support response and recovery efforts and positions the State to seek Federal disaster support in the coming weeks. The 14 counties were selected to target assistance to the areas hardest hit, though the State stands ready to assist all counties in need. “My Administration has been in close and constant communication with local and Federal officials throughout this storm, and I have been briefed by the Director of the Maine Emergency Management Agency as well as the Commissioners of the Department of Transportation, the Department of Public Safety, the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, and others on our coordinated response efforts,” said Governor Mills. “Since the beginning of this storm, I have told my Administration to assist and support local officials wherever needed to help Maine people respond and stay safe. My Administration has been and will continue to work around the clock, in partnership with local public safety officials, county emergency management personnel, and CMP and Versant to clear debris from roads, to assess and repair damage caused by flood waters, and to restore power to Maine people as soon as possible,” Governor Mills continued, “This declaration of civil emergency formalizes our all-hands-on-deck approach and ensures that every State resource is available to towns across Maine that need assistance. For example, helicopters from the Maine Forest Service are conducting general aerial assessments and helping CMP survey damage to the electricity grid so that power can be restored more quickly.” Governor Mills has also spoken with the President and CEO of CMP, Joe Purington, and the President of Versant Power, John Flynn, to receive updates about their power restoration efforts and to offer State support where needed. The Maine Department of Transportation is also working to clear roadways of debris, assess damage, and begin repair efforts while Maine Emergency Management Agency continues to coordinate resource requests with county emergency management officials. The Governor urged Maine people to continue to be vigilant and to exercise caution. “Flooding continues to be a serious risk in many areas of the state. I cannot stress this enough – if you live in an area that is hard hit, please stay off the roads as much as possible and stay away from flooded areas, including flooded roadways. Doing so will protect your safety and will allow first responders and restoration crews to assess the damage and move forward with their clean up and restoration efforts more quickly. We are looking at a multi-day recovery effort right now, and Maine people can do their part by exercising vigilance and caution,” the Governor said. In addition to further mobilizing State resources, the State of Civil Emergency strengthens Maine’s ability to seek Federal financial assistance through a Federal Disaster Declaration. In the coming days, Maine Emergency Management Agency will work with county emergency management officials to assess infrastructure damage. If that damage meets the financial statutory threshold exceeding the State’s ability to respond, Governor Mills said she will seek a Federal Disaster Declaration. Meanwhile, MaineDOT will also work with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to assess the damages on the state’s federal-aid highways and seek Federal financial assistance through FHWA under applicable sections of Title 23, U.S.C. “My Administration will seek any and all Federal financial assistance and support to help Maine people recover from the storm,” Governor Mills said. The Governor will continue to evaluate the necessity of the State of Emergency daily with the goal of terminating it when she deems it is no longer needed.

If Maine people need non-emergency assistance, like information about where to find a warming or charging center, they should call 211, or text their zip code to 898-211. The Governor declared the State of Civil Emergency verbally as permitted under state statute.

and “Life Changing 30 Minutes With Dr. Joel Wallach”) Dr. Joel Wallach begins by discussing the story of ""Crisco."" Excerpt: “Invented in 1901 by German scientists as a lubricant for submarines. Then sold to the Proctor & Gamble soap company who then made a deal with the then-fledgling American Heart Association. The soap company then gave the American Heart Association $1.7 million dollars for an ad campaign to promote the health benefits of cooking with ""Crisco."" The campaign stated that ""Crisco"" is a healthier alternative to animal fats found in dairy products.” “Animal fats” meant lard (rendered fatback), schmalz (rendered chicken fat) and bacon grease, basically lard. These were the fats Grammie Tucker and everyone used up on the Ridge. I never saw Crisco on the farm but I remember, during WWII when “Oleo” came on the scene in those lean years. A butter substitute, Oleo made its debut in plastic bags with a small capsule of orange die. The first time I saw it was at my Aunt Myrtle\'s. I was delighted when she let me break open the capsule and then knead the bag to mix it with the white fat, which was probably Crisco, to make it look like butter. Grammie Tucker wouldn’t touch the stuff. Eventually, the ""stuff"" evolved into already colored, butter-shaped “margarine.” That never touched Grammie’s table, either. She made her own famous tasting butter from the cream our two Jersey cows gave us, morning and evening, and saved up in the cool cellar-way until Friday, churning day. This gave us our own butter and plenty to swap at the general store for goods that couldn’t be produced on the farm, like sugar, flour and molasses. I wrote a column on lard some years ago that cited studies showing the organic lard was a vilified hero of fats. The lard sold in the supermarkets has been pasteurized, rendering it not so good. I either render my own from organic fatback or get it from Amazon — organic. I don’t make my own “schmalz” but do have a small crock for saving bacon grease. Fried eggs just aren’t the same cooked in anything but bacon grease. We kids, in high school here in Belfast in the early \'50s, used to render chicken fat on the wood stove and use to waterproof our black soleless moccasins. From the time they started making fake foods, they started bad-mouthing the natural ones. Follow the money. But back in my childhood on the farm, the word “organic"" in referring to foods, was never heard. That’s because we raised our own (back then, 86 percent of the population lived in rural areas and foods were not yet so adulterated that they required labeling. But slowly, small family farms started getting hard to maintain and the big guys took over much of the country\'s food production. This led to the need to find ways to preserve its shelf life and to ramp up production. Their bottom line was money, not health. Then a new kid came into the picture: government controls. That followed with lobbyists for the big producers. That led to our politicians being bribed and owned by the carpetbagger lobbyists of the producers. There’s a revolving door regarding money, lucrative jobs, etc., between the producers and the Food and Drug Administration. Not a healthy situation. Certainly, unhealthy foods. In the ’50s-’60s, I unwisely used Crisco and vegetable oils but I never could warm up to margarine. Back then, we didn’t have access to much research or books about the pros and cons of natural foods and manmade ""foods."" And then, the pièce de résistance of bad foods, the infamous GMOs came online. Our foods now came genetically, molecularly altered, chemically laden. And then, insult to injury, the Supreme Court allowed the producer of these toxic chemicals to patent its seeds in a plan to control the world’s food supply. (“He who controls the food, controls the people” is a centuries-old motto of dictators.) And how did our politicians allow Monsanto — or any company — to patent foods? And thousands of farmers, whose fields were contaminated with pollen from GMO crops, were now considered to be using Monsanto-owned seed and were not allowed to save their own seeds as had been the practice since man first put seed in the ground. Now they must buy seed from Monsanto. So, how did this get passed by the Supreme Court? By a judge on the court who had, before being appointed to the court, been a lawyer for Monsanto. Revolving doors. (I still have trouble believing Clarence Thomas was the judge responsible for pushing this through.) So now, unless you grow your food or can get it from local farmers or otherwise organic sources, your food is slowly leading you to debilitating illnesses. Now why did Monsanto start producing chemicals like the infamous Roundup (glyphosate) that our non-organic foods are saturated with? Well, back during the Vietnam War, they made their millions producing “Agent Orange.” After the war ended, there they were with all their chemicals and no place to sell them. Remember the story of Crisco. And they’ve been making their fortune since selling their deadly toxic chemicals for use on our growing fields: Roundup/glyphosate. People have been fighting against it for decades, but ""people"" don’t have the deep pockets that the big guys have to ""own"" politicians. GMO seeds and foods have been banned in almost all world countries except ours. That’s because Monsanto is an American company and they own the day here. (The German multinational pharmaceutical company Bayer AG acquired Monsanto in June 2018.) However, the “people,” through education and exposure, are making headway against our poisoned food supply. Indeed, Costco just came out with the announcement that they will no longer carry Roundup/glyphosate. It’s a start. There’s a comical little video clip on YouTube with a Monsanto lobbyist being interviewed regarding RoundUp/glyphosate, “Lobbyist Claims Monsanto’s Roundup is Safe to Drink”. The conversation goes about like this: Lobbyist: “You can drink a gallon of it and it won’t hurt you.” Host: “We have a glass of it here. Would you like to drink it?” Lobbyist: “No. I’m not stupid,” as he rips off his mike, and hurries off stage with “This interview is over.” For a good list of good versus not-good fats, you might want to search YouTube ""good fats & bad fats"" for a list.

three wastewater lagoons located behind the school. BAR HARBOR / MOUNT DESERT — By the time students arrive at Mount Desert Island High School by 8:45 a.m., morning showers have already been taken and toilets have been flushed for the last time in many homes in the Somesville area; in the afternoon, most students have left school by the time residential water usage has spiked again. When seasonal residents and renters come in the summer, there are far fewer people and far less wastewater discharged at the high school. So, what does all this have to do with anything? It means that if the high school’s wastewater was pumped to the treatment plant in Somesville, there is little chance the added sewage would exceed the plant’s capacity. And in fact, it could help the plant operate more efficiently in the winter. The high school needs to do something about its outdated wastewater treatment system. The wastewater is now pumped into holding lagoons behind the school building. Then at certain times of the year it is sprayed onto the hillside across the parking lot from the front of the school. Even though that practice is permitted by state agencies, many believe it is not the most environmentally sound approach. Residents of one nearby house think their well might have been contaminated with PFAS by water leaking from the high school’s lagoons. Haley Ward, the engineering firm hired by the high school, has presented three options for handling the treatment of wastewater. The first option is to rehabilitate the existing wastewater treatment system by lining the lagoons to prevent leakage. The estimated cost of that, not including sludge removal and disposal, is $267,000. Haley Ward’s second option is to abandon the existing lagoons and construct a new subsurface wastewater treatment and disposal system that would eliminate the need for the spray irrigation system. The estimated cost: $2.5 million. The third option is to pipe all of the high school’s wastewater to the treatment plant in Somesville. The price tag for that: $5.1 million. High school officials and representatives of Haley Ward met recently with Mount Desert Public Works Director Brian Henkel and Wastewater Superintendent Ed Montague to talk about the feasibility of that option. “The most critical factor to determine feasibility is the capacity of the Somesville plant,” Henkel said in a memo to the Select Board. “That capacity is 80,000 gallons per day (GPD), while the average daily flow is 30,000 GPD or 40 percent of the design capacity. The reported design flow for the high school is 9,300 GPD. “Adding the high school wastewater to the current average daily flows at the Somesville plant would result in 39,300 GPD or just under 50 percent of the design capacity,” Henkel said. In comments to the Select Board last Monday, he said, “There is room at the plant for the amount [of wastewater] that they would be generating at the high school. “And it would actually help the plant operation in some respects because it would give more continuity of flow. When you have very low flows in the dead of winter, it can be a little problematic operating that plant. “There are many additional considerations needed related to this potential project, not least of which would be the necessary funding,” Henkel said. “Public Works anticipates further conversations with the high school trustees and their engineers.” The Somesville treatment plant is about four miles from the high school. There is, however, a wastewater pump station at Babson Creek, about two miles from the school. The high school would be required to construct new sanitary sewer mains to convey the wastewater to the pump station. Reporter Success! An email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup.

region as 2022 began, and a tragic end to a 3-year-old girl’s life ended the year. In between was a whole lot of news regarding a waterfront park, high-speed internet, a possible school rebuild and much more. Here are some highlights from each month. Perhaps the most globally rare bird to have appeared in Maine is the one that is all over the news recently: Steller’s sea eagle. This is a massive eagle with a white, wedge-shaped tail, white wing patches on the brown body and an orangey-yellow bill. People are traveling hundreds and, in some cases, thousands of miles to the Boothbay region to see one of the world’s rarest birds. The bird is typically found in Siberia, but also has regular sightings in Japan, China and Korea – then it was gone. At the time of this writing, the bird had not been reported since Jan. 24, when it was back in Boothbay Harbor and on Southport Island after a few days over at Pemaquid Harbor. Boothbay Harbor selectmen reviewed the housing portion of the 2015 comprehensive plan Dec. 28. Selectman Alyssa Allen spearheaded the review, the last in a series ahead of first steps to build a new comp plan. The Boothbay-Boothbay Harbor Community School District building exploratory committee connected around 30 teachers, students, parents and community members over Zoom Jan. 6 for an educational visioning session. The workshop was the first of three to be held that month to give the CSD direction for its buildings, campus and educational programming. In 2020, Boothbay received a $250,000 matching federal Land and Water Grant to renovate Clifford Park Playground. Local businessman Paul Coulombe volunteered to contribute the town’s $250,000 required match. Town Manager Dan Bryer advised selectmen Jan. 12, the price tag is now closer to $1.75 to $2 million. Additional ADA-compliant equipment and tactile boards increased the project’s cost. However, Bryer assured selectmen the project wouldn’t cost taxpayers anything. “Paul’s ready to kick in the rest,” he said. Maine Center for Disease Control categorized Boothbay Region High School as having an outbreak Jan. 12. Alternative Organizational Structure (AOS) 98 Superintendent Robert Kahler made the announcement in a letter to the public Jan. 13 and notified Community School District committee members Jan. 12. He said COVID-19, other illnesses and excessive absences have contributed to the status. The CDC opens outbreak investigations once a school has reported 15% or more absences in a single day, said Kahler. Boothbay Harbor homeowners Joseph and Jill Doyle appealed a Sept. 8 planning board decision to Lincoln County Superior Court Jan. 26. This follows a town board of appeals denial of a request to reverse abutter Boothbay Harbor Waterfront Preservation’s site plan revision for an existing structure, a splash pad, on its 65 Atlantic Ave. property. Boothbay-Boothbay Harbor CSD Committee Chair Stephanie Hawke suggested to fellow members Feb. 9, the CSD should remove its mask mandate. Hawke said CSD students and staff should also now have the option whether or not to mask. “It seems foolish that the school really is the only place on the peninsula that has a mask requirement ... so, I think it's time. We're talking about mental health, we're talking about the kids and how they're struggling right now and I think getting back to some normal would be a big thing.” Selectmen are hoping to set more defined guidelines for Boothbay Common use. For decades, non-profit groups have raised money on the public land with activities such as craft fairs, barbecues and lobster bakes. In recent years, for-profit groups, like Boothbay Farmers Market, have used the spot. But selectmen have also granted approval for two for-profit groups which charged admission. When Tim Lewis handed over the keys to Mid-Town Motel on Feb. 11, he said good-bye to his family’s business of 66 years. The new owners, Brian “Buzz” Makarewicz and Mark Osborn, are neighbors and fellow hoteliers who own Topside Inn which shares a border with Lewis’ property and home so the business Lewis nurtured for decades will still be in view. The footbridge project will have to move forward without plans expanding the width of the bridge, selectmen learned Feb. 28. Civil engineer Will Gartley of Gartley and Dorsky is working on permitting requirements for the footbridge project and recently discovered the town's land use code does not support a one-foot sideward expansion as favored by the board, said Town Manager Julia Latter. Boothbay Region Seahawk senior basketball players Jaelyn Crocker and Lucas Hardwick were named to the 2022 Class C/D South Maine McDonald’s High School teams on Wednesday, Feb. 23. Boothbay Region High School technology integrator Abby Manahan resigned effective April 28 to become Regional School Unit (RSU) 13’s first Distance Learning Coordinator. “I really thought I'd be here longer and really wanted to be here longer,” she said. “But I see kind of an unsettling pattern of a lack of regard for the human resources we have inside our buildings. There seems to be a lack of respect and of empathy.” Southport resident Paul Zalucky is working to create pathways for refugees fleeing Ukraine. “We are now in the process of just trying to help the families that are there. I still have family in western Ukraine. They've moved out of the city and basically settled into an area which they think will hopefully remain outside the sphere of Russian bombs and missiles. We've had some friends who are also business partners (and) we've also helped them get their families out to Warsaw.” Gavin Carlson, BRHS boys basketball manager for the past four years, received the 2022 Patrick Thibodeau and John Titus Spirit of the Game Award, presented by Maine Association of Basketball Coaches. Three Southport residents believe a $2.1 million price tag is too expensive to expand high-speed internet town-wide. Celeste Brown requested selectmen hold a public meeting to discuss the broadband project’s progress. She was joined by Tom Myette and Doug Jones, who shared her views. In what might be getting to be a habit, the Boothbay Region High School math team repeated as the first place team in the small school division of the Central Maine Math League (CMML) during the final conference meet of the 2021-2022 season at Cony High School in Augusta on Wednesday, March 9. On March 8, ownership of Boothbay Harbor’s Meadow Mall transferred from Ellis Commercial Development Leasing & Management of Hermon to Main Street Parks of Ardmore, Pennsylvania. Southport has received a $1.5 million bank loan from First National Bank to finance the town’s municipal broadband expansion project. On March 30, selectmen signed the loan agreement with The First representatives Nicci Kimball and Alyssa Allen during the board’s weekly meeting. The town received a 3.69% interest rate for 15 years. Southport selectmen will soon review two petitions demanding referendum votes to reverse current broadband expansion spending. The Boothbay-Boothbay Harbor Community School District Building Exploratory Committee reviewed four concepts for the CSD campus March 30. Lavallee Brensinger architects presented changes ranging from additions and renovations to a new BRHS building and major Boothbay Region Elementary School and campus overhaul. Boothbay Harbor resident Ed Tibbetts, 65, was killed in St. Augustine, Florida the morning of April 2. Tibbetts and wife Kathy, 63, were crossing the A1A highway on foot near The Reef restaurant when they were hit by a van driven by a 17-year-old male from Warsaw, Indiana. Lincoln County taxpayers will pay more for county services this year. On April 5, the three commissioners approved an $11,754,515 tax commitment for 2022 which reflects a 7.4% increase. County officials reduced the final commitment figure by using $300,000 from surplus and discontinuing overlay. The central office, technology team and Boothbay Region Education Association worked together recently to create new job descriptions for the tech team. The team consists of AOS 98 Technology Director Brynne Roseberry, BRES tech integrator Zachary Gray and outgoing BRHS tech integrator Abby Manahan. The fire at Christine Sproul's house, 40 Sproul Lane, Boothbay on Friday afternoon, April 22, reignited early Saturday morning and destroyed the house. Longtime owners of Boothbay Region Greenhouses, Bob and Kitty Boyd, are planning on retiring. The business and property have been on the market, but, contrary to the rumors, it has not yet been sold. March 29, 2022 marks 40 years since the Boyds bought the business. Lavallee Brensinger (LBPA) architects presented three updated concepts for the CSD campus plan April 27. The Building Exploratory Committee is approaching the end of the concepts phase before moving on to schematic design and sustainability goals. LBPA Project Manager Joe Britton said the new concepts were designed based on feedback from the March BEC meeting.

In changing her plea from not guilty to guilty, Rebecca Moores, 43, admitted to shooting 53-year-old Paula Johnson in Johnson’s home at 515 Leighton Point Rd, in Pembroke, on Feb. 9, 2022, Moores was arrested in Pembroke on July 6, 2022, and charged with Johnson’s murder. By Will Tuell The Elm Street Panther junior high boys’ and girls’ basketball teams moved to 3-0 in the young season with strong wins over Rose M. Gaffney School of Machias and D.W. Merritt School of Addison last week. The back-to-back blowouts solidified the East Machias-based Panthers as one of the early favorites this season as Elm Street picked up victories on back-to-back nights. By Paul Sylvain The Machias Planning Board has cleared the way for a new county public safety building to be built on the site of the former District Attorney’s office building at 85 Court St. By Will Tuell The Sew Fetch Dog Company and Main Street Gift Shop will be closing their bricks-and-mortar location on 25 Main Street in Machias “at or around year’s end,” the businesses said on their social media pages last week. Machias River General, which is also located at 25 Main Street, is staying open, however. By Paul Sylvain After three grueling days of jury selection and pre-trial discussions between attorneys and Judge Robert E. Murray Jr., the trial of accused murderers Kailie Brackett and Donnell Dana Jr. finally got underway Friday morning in Washington County Superior Court in Machias. Brackett, 39, and Dana, 40, both of Pleasant Point, Perry, are charged with “intentional or knowing or depraved indifference murder” in the stabbing death of 43-year-old Kimberly Neptune on April 21, 2022. By Nancy Beal A wind farm in a neighboring town will cost Jonesport taxpayers $9,000 in lost revenue, selectman Harry Fish told fellow board member Denise Cilley at their Dec. 6 board meeting. by Jonathan Reisman By Paul Sylvain The spirit of giving is alive and well, thanks to more than a dozen merry elves at the Parish Hall on Broadway. Thanks to the unselfish efforts of these community elves, more than 600 needy people in the Greater Machias Area will enjoy a warm and happy Christmas this year. For the 23rd straight year, the Community Christmas Giving Tree Program is continuing its mission to “help area children, elderly, and adults with special needs to have a Merry Christmas.” By Will Tuell Wayne Smith’s recent piece about Christmas wreath-making, known simply as “wreathing” to most longtime Downeasters, got me to thinking about my own family’s forays into the woods in search of fir boughs -- “tips” -- during the months of November and December and our own family wreathing operation out of my grandfather’s garage. “Oh, I ought to write that up,” I said to myself, not really expecting to have the time to do so amidst several other articles I had in the works at the time. By Will Tuell Nearly five dozen cadets graduated from the Maine Criminal Justice Academy’s Basic Law Enforcement Training Program (BLETP) on Dec. 15, including Machias Police Department’s Tayler LeBlanc and the Maine Forest Service’s Joshua Noyes. By Paul Sylvain “Dike is OPEN”! Who could have ever imagined that those three little words, composed of just ten letters in all, would be the buzz of the town? But, a buzz, they did stir, shortly before noon on Dec. 15, when Machias Town Manager Bill Kitchen blasted them out in an email to local media. By Paul Sylvain In the first drug raid of its kind in Washington County, Machias police, assisted by multiple county, state, and federal law enforcement agencies, executed a search warrant on a suspected illegal commercial marijuana growing operation at 414 East Kennebec Rd. on Dec. 14. The raid, conducted at 9:30 a.m., resulted in the arrest of three men on illegal drug trafficking charges. By Nancy Beal The joint board that determines what happens in the three schools in Union 103--Beals and Jonesport Elementary Schools and Jonesport-Beals High School—held its annual meeting last week at which members elect officers for the board and a superintendent to oversee the schools. In 45 minutes, there was a new board chair and superintendent. By Paul Sylvain The holiday spirit seemed to put the Machias selectboard and Town Manager Bill Kitchen in a festive mood during a brief 45-minute meeting on Dec. 13. It was a meeting peppered with passing remarks about Christmas lights and about how many Grinches were seen in the town’s Christmas parade Dec. 2. by Jonathan Reisman The explosion of campus antisemitism and support for Jewish genocide (from the river to the sea) has shocked many Americans, but for this retired professor who spent 40 years on New England college campuses, it is no surprise at all. The sources of that antisemitism are relatively easy to identify. By Daisy Ratzlaff/University of Maine Cooperative Extension In the spirit of the season, the Cobscook Currents 4-H Club recently gathered for a special wreath-making event. Led by club leaders Jen Plaut and Jane Bell along with wreath-making instructor Suzanne Plaut, the club members came together to create beautiful balsam wreaths to adorn their own homes.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': ""There was a time, much to the chagrin of lobstermen, when huge tanker ships laden with fuel oil journeyed up the waters of the Sheepscot River. Their destination was Central Maine Power Company’s Mason Station facing Wiscasset harbor on Birch Point. Notwithstanding the resulting loss of lobster gear, it was awe inspiring watching ships of this size being maneuvered by tugboats around Westport Island and into the harbor. It’s a sight only to be remembered, because the power plant shut down for good over 30 years ago. The first time I witnessed a tanker’s arrival was in March 1980; I’d been working for about a year as a reporter for the Boothbay Register-Wiscasset Newspaper. The colossal ship’s arrival was really big news, no pun intended, and of course made the front page. The headline read: “Mason Station Gets Refueling Last Weekend.” A smaller “kicker” ran over the headline stating, “Close To $2 Million Worth Of No. 6 Oil Delivered.” Above the story was a picture of the massive oil tanker making its way through the roiling river channel separating the southern tip of Westport Island from Davis Island, Edgecomb. The news article, written by me, didn’t make mention of the loss of lobster gear as the tanker made its way slowly but deliberately upriver. The story actually began on March 7, a sunny Friday afternoon. Benny Rines Jr., a Wiscasset selectman, had stopped by to see me. I was renting a place on Davis Island and Ben and I were on the back porch that overlooked the river. I recall him saying he enjoyed reading my articles in the Wiscasset Newspaper. “But how do you find stories to write about every week?” he asked. I replied rather matter-of-factly, that news had a way of finding me. It was just at that moment, as if on cue an enormous oil tanker came around the tip of Westport Island. “Wow, you weren’t kidding!” said Benny. A minute later, camera in hand, I was taking pictures. The tanker, I learned was the Theodegmon and stretched 660 feet from stem to stern, about the length of two football fields. Three tugboats berthed at Bath and owned by Capt. Elliot Winslow were needed to ease the ship through “The Narrows” as it’s known and eventually alongside the station’s pier. The tanker was delivering 88,000 barrels of heavy crude to the generating station. That was about a “quarter of the station’s fuel holding capacity” according to what I was told by Nate Whitaker, Mason Station’s superintendent. I’d gotten to know Nate and Linda his wife pretty well. They resided on the southern part of Westport Island near East Shore Road with their two sons, Matt and Tommy, who both attended Wiscasset schools. Tommy had played soccer for me when I coached the high school’s soccer team and both boys were standouts on the wrestling team. When I got in touch with Nate about the tanker’s arrival he said CMP had paid $24 a barrel for the oil, which was a fairly high price in the late 1970s. Of course this was during the so-called “Energy Crisis” a time when gasoline and oil prices were soaring across the country. Nate went on to say next time I could get some better pictures of the tanker from the roof of the power station. Just a few months later I took Nate up on that offer. On Saturday, July 12, a gray, overcast day, I was standing on the roof of Mason Station. With me was Phil Clark, Mason Station’s assistant superintendent, watching as the Theodegmon made another appearance in the harbor. She arrived on schedule just before noontime on the morning’s high tide, flanked again by a trio of Winslow tugs which maneuvered the ship to the station’s pier. On this morning the tanker was delivering 60,000 barrels of fuel oil. Also on Mason Station’s roof that day was Brad Amazeen, who’d been hired to videotape the tanker’s arrival for a training film CMP was producing for its workers. When Mason Station first opened in 1942, the plant had burned coal to fired its generators that was shipped by rail. A railroad spur was laid to the power plant from the former Maine Central RR starting near the old whistle stop. The spur included construction of a huge wooden trestle to span Ward Brook that can still be seen today. Later, Mason Station was converted to burn oil which was a much cleaner fuel source. In the 1980s, CMP was using Mason Station as a “stand-by generating facility” bringing it online to supplement the needs of New England Power Pool. In spite of its age, Clark said the station was still a very productive power station and in excellent operating condition. The plant’s biggest liability he told me was the cost of oil. In 1975, #6 crude, the fuel the plant burned, was selling for less than $2 a barrel but because of the Energy Crisis, the cost of crude had skyrocketed more than 600%. You might be surprised to learn that CMP had purchased the oil the Theodegmon was carrying from the South American country of Venezuela. Times have certainly changed since then. I recall too, CMP officials telling me next time they would reach out to local lobstermen alerting them of a pending oil delivery so they might remove their gear from the river channel. The Theodegmon began off-loading its oil to the station’s above ground storage tanks at about 2 p.m. finishing that evening. The ship cast off at 7 a.m. the following morning. The tanker had divided its oil cargo with the William F. Wyman generating station located on Cousin’s Island in Yarmouth. Mason Station was decommissioned in 1990-91, its fuel storage tanks having been removed years ago. As for the three-story brick building housing the station, its fate is yet to be determined. Perhaps, someday, someone will figure out how best to make use of this property. I’ve included a picture I took that morning from Mason Station’s roof so you might appreciate the Theodegmon’s size. Not surprising an oil tanker’s arrival often caused motorists on the old Wiscasset bridge to slow, or even stop to watch. I used a Nikon FM 35mm camera with a 50mm lens to take my pictures, the resulting images being close to the way you’d see this with your own eyes.

According to the Nativity story in Luke’s gospel, the angels at Bethlehem promised us peace on Earth and goodwill toward our fellow humans. On Earth today, both of those blessings are in short supply. We’re responsible for that sorry state of affairs. Another bloody war now rages, not far from Bethlehem, and still we cry “peace, peace” when there is no peace. None of this is God’s will. It’s ours. “Angels we have heard on high, sweetly singing o’er the plain.” If we listen to that message, we might make some progress toward enjoying many more Christmases in the future. Rev. Robert Plaisted is a retired United Methodist clergyman, formerly of Bridgton and Bath, now residing in Auburn.
