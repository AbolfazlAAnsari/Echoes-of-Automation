Investigators were looking for evidence Wednesday of what caused a news helicopter to crash in the New Jersey Pinelands the night before, killing the pilot and photographer on board. Chopper 6 from WPVI-TV in Philadelphia was returning from an assignment at the Jersey Shore when it went down Tuesday night in a section of Wharton State Forest in Washington Township, Burlington County, authorities said. The TV station said the crash occurred around 8 p.m. The New Jersey State Park Police said they were notified of a helicopter that had gone missing shortly before 11 p.m. Wednesday afternoon, the station identified the pilot as 67-year-old Monroe Smith of Glenside, Pennsylvania, and the photographer as 45-year-old Christopher Dougherty of Oreland, Pennsylvania. During a live report in which she choked up with emotion, reporter Maggie Kent told of speaking with colleagues of the crew members at Northeast Philadelphia Airport, where the chopper was based. “They are described as the best guys that you would want to know, on the job for decades,” she said. “They are highly skilled in what they do. They loved their craft.” Earlier in the day, reporter Katherine Scott spoke on air about the loss of her colleagues. “Our hearts are just broken for these men,"" she said. ""They\'re broken for their families. We just can\'t believe this has happened.” The TV station said the chopper took off from Northeast Philadelphia Airport before 7:30 p.m. and the crew flew to an assignment near Galloway Township, not far from the Jersey Shore outside Atlantic City. Flight tracker data shows the helicopter’s altitude dropping while returning to Philadelphia, and it was last airborne over Wharton State Forest. A state trooper’s cruiser idled Wednesday near the forested scene, where paved roads turn to gravel and signs advised that motor vehicles were restricted from entering the area near the forest. The site is part of the New Jersey Pinelands, a million-acre wilderness area that stretches across more than seven counties and features dense woods, rivers and rare plant species. Video taken from a WTXF-TV helicopter over the wreckage site showed scattered debris, with some pieces on fire or smoking, as authorities searched with flashlights in the darkness. The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. The National Transportation Safety Board arrived at the crash site at 3:15 a.m. Wednesday and took control of the investigation. An officer with the park police found the wreckage shortly after midnight, said George Fedorczyk, chief of the department. “Due to the remote location of the scene and the limited visibility, it was determined at that point that the investigation would be suspended until sometime after daybreak,” he said at a morning news conference Wednesday. “Know that our thoughts are with the pilots, their families and the media community.” WPVI-TV reported that it leases the helicopter from U.S. Helicopters Inc., which is based in North Carolina. A spokesperson said company officials were not prepared to comment Wednesday morning. Emails seeking comment were sent Wednesday to New Jersey State Police, the New Jersey State Park Police and the FAA. There have been other deadly helicopter crashes involving staff from television stations in the United States. Among them was a July 2007 crash, when two helicopters from KNXV-TV and KTVK-TV collided over Phoenix while covering a police chase. Four people — both pilots and two photographers — were killed. In November, a pilot and a meteorologist who worked for a North Carolina television station died when a news helicopter crashed along a Charlotte-area interstate, with police praising the pilot for heroically avoiding the road in his final moments.

""Nadie podría haber creído razonablemente que el alcalde Rudy Giuliani sería capaz de pagar una cantidad punitiva tan alta"", afirmó Goodman. ""El Capítulo 11 brindará al alcalde Giuliani la oportunidad y el tiempo para presentar una apelación, al tiempo que brindará transparencia a sus finanzas bajo la supervisión del tribunal de quiebras, para garantizar que todos los acreedores reciban un trato equitativo y justo durante todo el proceso"". Michael Gottlieb, abogado de la madre y la hija, extrabajadoras electorales, dijo: “Esta maniobra no es sorprendente y no logrará saldar la deuda del señor Giuliani con Ruby Freeman y Shaye Moss”. La presentación enumera los activos de Giuliani entre $1 millón y $10 millones y sitúa su deuda total actual en $151 millones, incluyendo cerca de $1 millón adeudado en impuestos atrasados. También señaló que tiene otras demandas pendientes en su contra y estimó su pasivo total estimado entre 100 y 500 millones de dólares. El caso de quiebra fue asignado al juez Sean H. Lane, quien, al igual que Giuliani, era fiscal federal adjunto para el Distrito Sur de Nueva York. Al presentar una petición voluntaria del Capítulo 11, Giuliani obtendrá protección de los acreedores bajo la característica de “suspensión automática” de la ley federal de quiebras, que, con algunas excepciones, detiene los litigios en curso, así como la ejecución de sentencias preexistentes. Si la sentencia resistiera cualquier posible apelación, Giuliani no podría eliminar su deuda con Freeman y Moss. Los daños derivados de la difamación no pueden eliminarse en caso de quiebra. El juez que presidió el caso de difamación de Freeman y Moss levantó el miércoles una pausa de 30 días en el fallo después de que la madre y la hija dijeron que les preocupaba que intentara ocultar sus bienes. ""El hecho de que Giuliani no haya \'satisfecho las indemnizaciones monetarias aún más modestas otorgadas anteriormente en este caso\' proporciona una buena causa para creer que buscará disipar u ocultar sus activos durante el período de 30 días"", escribió la jueza de distrito estadounidense Beryl Howell en su orden. La decisión permite a Freeman y Moss perseguir los activos de Giuliani en Nueva York y Florida. Un jurado de ocho personas en Washington, D.C., otorgó inicialmente a Freeman y Moss más de $148 millones en daños y perjuicios la semana pasada después de que el juez encontró a Giuliani responsable de difamarlos repetidamente acusándolos falsamente de llevar a cabo fraude electoral en Georgia durante las elecciones presidenciales de 2020. En su orden del miércoles, Howell redujo el veredicto en aproximadamente $2 millones para reflejar los daños y perjuicios que ambos recibieron en un acuerdo el año pasado con el otro acusado en el caso, la cadena de televisión OAN.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura) A longtime producer for Tucker Carlson is out at Fox News after he was deemed responsible for the on-air headline that referred to President Joe Biden as a “wannabe dictator” because of the indictment of former President Donald Trump. The producer, Alex McCaskill, confirmed his exit in an Instagram post. Fox News did not comment on Friday. He had remained at Fox after Carlson, the network’s most popular personality, was fired on April 24. The reason for Carlson’s sudden ouster, less than a week after Fox agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems $787 million to end a defamation case, has never been publicly explained. It was during the last minutes of Carlson’s former time slot on Tuesday when the message appeared under separate onscreen boxes that showed Biden and Trump talking. It read: “Wannabe dictator speaks at the White House after having his political rival arrested.” WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor Carlson, in a Twitter monologue posted Thursday, said “the women who run the network panicked” about the post and scolded the person responsible. Carlson didn’t name the producer, but said he was “considered one of the most capable persons in the building.” The producer offered to resign with two weeks’ notice, but was told to clean out his desk and leave immediately, he said. Fox, in a statement on Wednesday, said the chyron had been taken down and the issue “addressed,” without further explanation. In an Instagram message posted on Twitter by Justin Baragona of The Daily Beast, McCaskill is pictured outside of Fox’s Manhattan office holding a box. “Today was my last day at Fox,” read the message under his picture. “It’s been a wild 10 years and it was the best place I’ve ever worked because of the great people I met. But the time has come. I asked them to let me go, and they finally did. To all my friends there: I will miss you forever.” A call and text message to a phone listed as McCaskill’s was not immediately returned. Plenty of Biden critics have suggested politics was behind Trump’s indictment by special prosecutor Jack Smith on charges of hoarding classified documents and resisting government attempts to retrieve them. Biden has not commented on the case. McCaskill was named this spring in a lawsuit filed by a former Fox producer, Abby Grossberg, who also worked on Carlson’s staff. Her lawsuit said McCaskill “habitually belittled female employees” at Fox. He said that a room at Fox set aside for employees to pump breast milk was a “waste of space” and should be replaced with a room for men to tan their testicles, according to the lawsuit. Fox has denied allegations in Grossberg’s lawsuit. ___ Associated Press correspondent Beatrice Dupuy and researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this report.

According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), eight states saw increases in coronavirus deaths based on data available through Nov. 11: Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Missouri, Michigan, North Carolina and Tennessee. The absolute increases ranged from 0.1 percent in Colorado to 3 percent in Maryland. Both Colorado and Maryland were the only two states where the percentage of deaths in the past week caused by COVID-19 was in the yellow range, meaning they fell within 4 to 5.9 percent of deaths. Maine nearly fell within this category at 4 percent. Nationally, the absolute increase in COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. rose by 0.2 percent that week, according to the CDC’s data. Hospitalizations due to COVID-19 also rose by 8.6 percent. Currently, only 1.3 percent of U.S. counties — 42 — are considered to have high hospital admission levels. Since the end of the public health emergency for the pandemic, hospitalization rates have served as the metric for community COVID-19 levels. About 86 percent of the country is currently considered low hospital admission rates. Last month, the CDC’s Respiratory Disease Season Outlook projected the U.S. would likely see a similar amount of hospitalizations as it did last winter. Whether hospitalizations end up being somewhat higher or lower than projected, they will likely be higher than before the pandemic. The majority of the country is experiencing minimal or low rates of emergency department (ED) visits in which people are testing positive for the virus. ED visits, however, did rise by 7.1 percent in the most recently recorded week. New Mexico is currently the only state reporting “substantial” rates of ED visits in which patients are testing positive, though data for states including Oklahoma, Missouri and Minnesota is not available.

WHYY Community Conversation Convener Amir Richardson (center) moderates and takes questions from attendees at a Bridging Blocks discussion on safe injection sites at the South Philadelphia library. (Sarah Glover/WHYY) News fatigue is real. There’s pressure to integrate emerging technologies, such as AI, into newsgathering, and to reverse the impacts of shifting social media algorithms to keep audiences engaged. News leaders spend countless hours redefining their digital strategies to beat the noise that misinformation and constant algorithmic changes bring. The business of media — the need to grow audiences and revenue — creates anxiety and uncertainty for news outlets large and small alike. Civic dialogue and prioritizing community initiatives to build connections for audiences will emerge as a cornerstone to audience growth strategies in U.S. newsrooms in 2024. A focused effort by local news teams to cultivate civic dialogue and IRL connections for engagement events will be prioritized. Civic dialogue can be used as a tool to grow audiences and reach new customers, as well as to test innovative tactics to develop partnerships and expand revenue models. At WHYY News, we are fortunate to have a built-in community and engagement team inside the news department, with community members in full-time positions. This structure is unique, as many newsrooms have community teams made up of journalists reporting on specific communities. WHYY sought systemic changes to local newsgathering and developed a new recipe for community and engaged journalism.

PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- Action News continues to mourn the loss of two members of our 6abc team after Chopper 6 tragically crashed Tuesday in Burlington County, New Jersey. A pilot and a photographer were in the helicopter when it went down in Washington Township, New Jersey just after 8 p.m. They were returning from an assignment at the Jersey Shore. The pilot was 67-year-old Monroe Smith of Glenside, Pa. and the photographer was 45-year-old Christopher Dougherty of Oreland, Pa. They have a long history with our station, with Smith being a part of the Action News team through U.S. Helicopters for over 20 years and Dougherty for 18 years. The loss of the crew members is being felt here at Action News and beyond as investigators search for answers into what caused the crash. SEE ALSO: Friends pay tribute to pilot, photographer killed in Chopper 6 crash ""Our hearts are just broken for these men. They\'re broken for their families,"" reporter Katherine Scott said during a report on Action News. ""We just can\'t believe this has happened."" Pete Kane, who is a retired Philadelphia journalist, was friends of Monroe Smith since high school. They also used to fly together. ""We had the same goals: that was to do the job the best we could do it. And I think we both did that. He did it till the end,"" said Kane. SEE ALSO: Friends, former colleagues remember 2 crew members killed in Chopper 6 crash Smith was a retired army pilot who was so proud of his son who was also a military pilot. He also has a new grandbaby. Dougherty is survived by two daughters and a wife. He was said to play guitar in the office from time to time while waiting for his next assignment. The chopper took off from the Northeast Philadelphia Airport before 7:30 p.m. and the crew flew to an assignment near Galloway Township, New Jersey. The crew was on their way back to base when the aircraft crashed. Flight tracker data shows the helicopter\'s altitude dropping while returning to Philadelphia. Chopper 6 was last airborne over Wharton State Forest before it crashed in a remote section of the woods. ""Preliminary air traffic control data shows the aircraft was sitting there and was on course at the time when the accident occurred,"" said Todd Gunther, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge. ""Tree strike images show it was in a descending pattern, in other words, it was descending when it impacted the trees."" New Jersey State Park Police say a debris field was located shortly after midnight a few hundred yards from Mullica River Road, in the area of Middle Road and Quaker Bridge Atsion Road in Washington Twp. A helicopter from a fellow Philadelphia television station captured video of the wreckage. Scattered debris, with some pieces on fire or smoking, could be seen as authorities searched with flashlights in the darkness. The area is part of the New Jersey Pinelands, a million-acre wilderness area that stretches across more than seven counties and features dense woods, rivers and rare plant species. The Federal Aviation Administration arrived at the crash site at 3:15 a.m. Wednesday and took control of the scene. The NTSB will lead the investigation. ""Due to the remote location of the scene and the limited visibility, it was determined at that point that the investigation would be suspended until sometime after daybreak,"" said Chief George Fedorczyk of the New Jersey State Park Police. ""Know that our thoughts are with the pilots, their families and the media community."" State park police say Quaker Bridge Road, Mullica River Road and Middle Road - all unpaved local roads within the forest - were closed as the investigation continues. Chopper 6 was a 2013 American Eurocopter AS-350 Astar, which 6abc leases from U.S. Helicopters Inc. based in North Carolina. U.S. Helicopters said in a statement the pilot and photographer were ""beloved"" long-time employees of the company. ""We deeply sympathize with their families and share in their grief as a result of this tragic event. We will share arrangements in accordance with the families\' wishes,"" the statement reads. ""We will cooperate with the FAA and other authorities during their investigation and are still gathering information, so we cannot comment or provide further information on the cause of this tragedy,"" the statement continued. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of our cherished colleagues."" During a Friday afternoon news conference, Gunther said the team has been ""charting the wreckage,"" looking to see where the wreckage path began and ended. Officials originally said the debris field from the helicopter was 100 yards, but Gunther said it is now about 200 yards long. ""We\'ve determined that the approach path, or approach angle if you will, into the trees from the flight was very shallow.
