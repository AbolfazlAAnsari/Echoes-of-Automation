Photo courtesy of Jefferson City News Tribune/Julie Smith Cole County has a new facility for those struggling with substance abuse or mental health issues. Landmark Recovery Center was the brainchild of Landmark Church Pastor Scott Breedlove. His daughter, and the center’s Office Coordinator Jerica Breedlove, says the center connects clients to resources which is unique in the Capital City. “We offer care where people can just walk in and we don’t treat them, we’re not a treatment center. So I think that’s what makes us unique is you’ll find plenty of treatment centers around the city, but we just provide peer work which is support and we can talk with people and work with them and we provide them with other resources. So we might connect them to actual treatment in town.” Breedlove says the center operates off three basic pillars. The first is connecting clients to basic resources, whether it’s help writing a resume, securing food assistance, or employment coaching. The second pillar is support for both their clients and their families. “We have peers who are people in personal, long-term recovery. Those people can work one-on-one with clients and participants who walk in. We also offer support groups all during the week; we have NA, Supporting Addicted Loved Ones, we have Anger Management, Parenting, all kinds of groups all throughout the week.” The final pillar is social activities that provide sober, clean fun opportunities. The center typically sponsors at least one big event each month. The one for November is a Thanksgiving dinner scheduled for Wednesday, November 24 at 6 p.m. at JC Park & Rec’s Cedar City Room in north Jefferson City. Although the center is housed inside Landmark Church, it operates as its own entity as part of the non-profit Landmark Recovery of the Capital City. The non-profit also operates Stacey’s House, a recovery house for women. The resource center is currently open weekdays from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. but hopes to eventually become a 24-hour resource for clients. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.
