investigation. The second piece can be found here. As local news outlets across the US struggle to stay afloat, pop-up newsrooms are filling the void. Organizations with ties to political parties, special-interest groups, and lobbyists have emerged under the guise of news. One of the biggest such networks, Metric Media, operates more than 1,200 local news sites across the United States, and encompasses multiple corporate entities including non-profit charities. The Tow Center has previously reported on Metric Media, but until now, little was known about the finances or partners of this network that claims to give “every citizen a voice in their community” and publishes “over 5 million news articles every month.” A new investigation by the Tow Center has discovered that this network has ties to founders of the Tea Party movement , to a non-profit described by Mother Jones as “the dark-money ATM of the conservative movement,” and to a Catholic political advocacy group that launched a $9.7 million campaign in swing states against the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden six weeks before the 2020 election.

(IRS records for the 2020 tax year will not be available until next year.) Our investigations relied on threat intelligence tools Farsight DNSDB Flexible Search and RiskIQ, IRS filings, Facebook and Google ad libraries, as well as our internal analytics tool to establish the connections within the network. Metric Media Foundation’s 2019 Form 990 filing discloses more than half of its revenue—or $236,750—was paid to Franklin Archer (listed as an “independent contractor”) for “publishing.” In the complex organizational structure of this operation, Franklin Archer is one of the companies that make up the core of the Metric Media network. Figure 1 breaks down the core entities and key stakeholders of the publishing network, the related entities run by those stakeholders, and the flow of money into the network based on 2019 IRS filings. There are five companies that make up the core of the network: Metric Media LLC, Newsinator (that, according to Iowa state records, has the alternative name Franklin Archer), Local Government Information Services (LGIS), Pipeline Media, and Locality Labs. At least one of these companies has changed its name: Locality Labs was previously known as Journatic and Blockshopper, and reporting by Deseret News says Pipeline Media is the new name for the same entity. There are two main stakeholders behind this network: Bradley Cameron and Brian Timpone. Cameron, Metric Media LLC’s general manager and president, says he is “currently retained by private investors to develop a national media enterprise,” with no additional information about the identities of these private investors. Cameron is also the founder and CEO of the management consultancy, Situation Management Group (SMG). Timpone, who describes his business as “software and data,” has long focused on creating low-cost automated journalism, and a This American Life investigation found his previous venture Journatic faked bylines and quotes, outsourced reporting, and plagiarized content. Whilst Timpone denied these allegations in 2012, saying “alias bylines” were limited to real-estate news briefs, a further investigation by Poynter found that this was not true. Neither Cameron nor Timpone responded to multiple requests for comment. In the past five years, Timpone has continued to focus on the technical infrastructure of this sprawling “local news” network, starting with LGIS in Illinois. Thirty-odd Illinois publications were initially owned by Newsinator, and the conservative SuperPAC Liberty Principles paid Newsinator $311,409 in 2016, according to data from the Illinois State Board of Election Expenditure for “Advertising – newspaper.” In the second half of 2016, Local Government Information Services or LGIS was created, which “took over production and distribution of [the Illinois] newspapers.” LGIS was a collaboration between Timpone and Dan Proft, the Chairman and Treasurer of the now defunct Liberty Principles.

But USA TODAY was founded on boldness. Your subscription is an investment in quality journalism that\'s worth paying for, journalism that strengthens our communities and our nation. And we\'ve got big plans. We\'re continuing to invest in our investigative reporting (most recently breaking a string of exclusive stories from the Surfside condo collapse). We\'re creating new ways to present content clearly and quickly (check out this visualization on tornado alley). We\'re bringing in new voices (have you read Connie Schultz?) to help make sense of this complicated world we share. And just wait until you see the team from USA TODAY cover Team USA at the Tokyo Olympics. We know how busy you are, so – true to our roots – we\'re constantly innovating ways to quickly, concisely, expertly deliver news with topical newsletters, daily podcasts, news by text and interactive chats with experts.

Not a subscriber? Become one here. We know you\'ll have more questions. You\'ll find answers here. But here\'s the bottom line: We are partners in this democracy. Together, we\'ll hold the powerful accountable. Together, we\'ll look out for the less fortunate, the marginalized. We will lean on each other for solutions that make our lives easier, better. We\'ll grow together when we understand perspectives different than our own, when we meet and hear from people outside our social media bubbles.

Eagles on Wednesday. February 7, 2021 at 4:00 a.m. by Graham Thomas Sam Jackson\'s actually playing time at the varsity level has been limited, but the Siloam Springs senior\'s soccer career is far from over. Jackson signed a letter of intent Wednesday to play men\'s soccer at John Brown University, joining a growing list of former Panthers who have continued on at JBU. ""I\'ve always wanted to play college soccer, especially at JBU,"" Jackson said. ""It\'s been a goal of mine. High school has been awesome. I\'ve got great coaches to get me where I\'m at and great teammates. It\'s great. I\'m loving it."" Jackson played some as a freshman on a Panthers team that finished as Class 6A state runner-up in 2018. As a sophomore in 2019, his role expanded greatly at the end of the season when an injury to Thad Wright on senior thrust him into the starting lineup at defender. Jackson went on to play well for the Panthers, who finished as Class 5A state runner-up. He earned All-State Tournament team recognition. Jackson figured to be a key cog in the Panthers\' defense in 2020, but the season was cut short after seven games because of the covid-19 pandemic. ""It\'s an incredible thing,"" said Siloam Springs head coach Luke Shoemaker. ""When you actually do the numbers, Sam\'s only gotten to start in probably 10 games in his career due to covid. But you and I both know the impact he made when he got on the field his sophomore year, replacing Thad on senior night. And Sam\'s just gotten better and better. He\'s got this drive within him that\'s led to that. He\'s got this endless pursuit to reach his potential."" Shoemaker compared Jackson to former Siloam Springs standout and current JBU junior Jack Bos. ""I always do the comparison with him and Jack Bos and now they get to be teammates together,"" Shoemaker said. ""When (JBU head) coach (Chris) Cole contacted me, and I already brought up Jack, one of his comments was, \'How would you compare him to Jack?\' That was basically his starting line. I wrote back -- probably way too large of an email -- but at the end of the day, there\'s so many similarities in personality and drive and what they can do for you on the field."" Jackson would join former SSHS standouts Bos, 2019 graduate Eli Jackson and 2020 alum Danny Daugherty at JBU. ""I am tickled to death to see a team of Eli Jackson, Jack Bos, Danny Daugherty, and Sam all on the field at the same time,"" Shoemaker said. ""That would be a dream come true.""

Partly cloudy skies. Low near 65F. Winds light and variable. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 12:42 pm Icy roads kept White County deputies and Arkansas state troopers busy Friday as numerous vehicles went off the road in the county due to the conditions. The White County 911/Dispatch Center reported that Arkansas Highway 13 from Arkansas Highway 267 to Booth Road was shut down Friday morning and troopers and deputies were working “multiple accidents.” Drivers were also being advised to avoid North Main Street in Searcy. Numerous vehicle reportedly had gone off the road near Muscadine Lane. Searcy Mayor Kyle Osborne said there were five or six vehicles “off in a ditch” on North Main Street. “We went out and worked on it a little bit for them and tried to get it thawed out for them a little bit so they could get those vehicles,” Osborne said. He said city employees also had been working for the past couple of days on the city’s streets, “trying to keep them clear.” It began sleeting in central Arkansas early Thursday morning. According to the National Weather Service, a sensor was activated at the Searcy Municipal Airport at 2:30 a.m. Thursday indicating sleet or snow White County Judge Michael Lincoln said in the county, “every road out there is slick and icy and it’s going to get worse.” “The highway department salts and clears their roads. The county, we don’t,” Lincoln said. “We don’t have the funds. We just have way too many miles to try to clear. I would just tell people to be cautious. If you don’t have to get out, don’t get out, and it’s not going to get any better.” Lincoln said he got reports that Arkansas Highway 11 and parts of Highway 13 were not clear. “I would think as the pandemic has slowed things down it just wouldn’t be as big of a deal as it is,” Lincoln said of drivers getting out on the icy roads. Judsonia Police Chief Robert Parsons said he called the Arkansas Department of Transportation on Friday to ask them “is [Arkansas] Highway 157 still a highway?” “They were like, ‘What?’” he said. “I told them it it hasn’t been sanded, salted or treated.” Parsons said Judsonia was averaging 10 cars an hour going off the side of the road and was told “it was not one of the primary highways. They would get to it when they could. Highway 13, Friendly Acres Park, the hills there, same problem, iced over.” He said he thinks a lot of people were driving around because it was payday Friday. Thursday would have been better to drive than Friday, he said, because most of the roads in Judsonia on Friday have a quarter to half-inch of ice on them, “a solid sheet.” Parsons said his department is very fortunate because it got three new Dodge Ram trucks so all of its full-time officers drive the new trucks that are all four-wheel drive. “That really saved us today,” he said. Parsons’ advice to drivers is “it’s not whether or not you need it, it is whether or not your life is worth risking for it.” “I had a guy who was sideways on the road and I said, ‘What are you doing driving?’ and he goes, ‘A buddy of mine needed a pack of cigarettes,’ and I said, ‘Are you kidding me, so you decided to drive up this hill?’ It is very treacherous.” Searcy Police Department Cpl. Michael Bullock and his wife, Julia, live on North Main Street and were observing the driving issues outside of their home Friday. “There are so many people stuck down here,” Julia Bullock said. “They are revving their motors, spinning out on top of the hill. We have heard people all day. We look out the window and see them sliding slowly down the hill.” Michael Bullock said at the end of his shift at 6 a.m. Friday, “we had three trucks in a ditch at the bottom of the hill.” What: Asks drivers to stay off roads if at all possible after ice blankets roads, causing some closures When: Friday Problem areas: North Main Street in Searcy, Arkansas Highway 13, Arkansas Highway 267, Arkansas Highway 157, Fairview Road, Arkansas Highway 11, Holmes Road, Honey Hill Road and Blue Hole Road Log In Keep it Clean.

campus March 13 to show their support of Black UA community members. Many marchers carried signs that called the administration out for supporting segregationists and racists. Members of the UA community gathered Saturday morning to protest racism on campus and the prominence of segregationist politicians as building and organization namesakes. In overcast and rainy weather, roughly 100 protestors gathered in front of Fulbright Dining Hall and marched along Garland Avenue and Maple Street toward Gearhart Hall. Led by Black Student Caucus member Tyrah Jackson, a junior, the group stopped in front of Old Main’s statue of former Sen. J. William Fulbright to call for its removal, before five speakers took to the upper level of Gearhart’s courtyard. Black Student Caucus members shared personal experiences of racism at the UofA and discussed their goal of creating an anti-racist campus. Speakers also called attention to the legacies of Fulbright and former Gov. Charles Brough, and the prominence of their names and likenesses on the UA campus. Brough Commons, Fulbright’s statue, the Fulbright Peace Fountain and the J. William Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences are named after the two figures. Fulbright Dining Hall is named for the late senator’s mother, Roberta W. Fulbright. “It does not matter if racism is being done consciously or subconsciously by the university, by the student body,” Jackson said during her speech. “What matters is that racism is being done at all. I believe the way to (be anti-racist) is to rid the university of its racist effigies, but also of its structural discrepancies that continuously promote institutional racism."" Jackson and her fellow speakers called for the removal of all symbols associated with Fulbright and Brough. Jackson said her ancestors survived the 1919 Elaine Massacre, during which more than 200 Black Americans were killed. At the time, Gov. Brough praised white citizens involved in what was the “deadliest racial confrontation in Arkansas history,” according to the Encyclopedia of Arkansas. University officials formed an advisory committee in August 2020 to evaluate the legacy of Fulbright and his place on the UA campus. The group, composed of students, faculty, staff and alumni, is expected to recommend a course of action to Chancellor Steinmetz, said John Thomas, manager of university communications. Protest organizers called on administrators to make changes to create a more inclusive campus for current and future students. Senior Jakayla Storey, a speaker, said Black students feel silenced and put on hold without a decision by administrators on the matter. “This is really hurting a lot of their students, especially their Black students,” Storey said. “I’m hoping that, with that being said, they will try to make a decision quicker and understand that, (with) the Fulbright name, there’s so many different names they could put in that place.” Other speakers, including graduate student Warrington Sebree, said change is needed to disrupt the cycle of systemic racism on the UA campus. The speeches’ subject matter struck a chord with Jacob Bellando, a senior, who said his Christian faith compelled him to speak out against racism and injustice on campus. He attended the protest to learn from and better understand the perspectives of students of color whose experiences differ from his own. “The legacy of Fulbright and Brough is a legacy of weak leadership and racist actions, respectively,” Bellando said. “Americans have this trend of idolizing white men who perform sufficiently good actions, without taking into account the great injustices that they either took part in, or were complacent in.” University officials support students’ right to protest and value input from students on the “issues that matter deeply to them,” Thomas said in an email. While committee members have yet to reach a decision on Fulbright and Brough’s place on campus, Storey thinks the protest’s turnout is a positive sign, she said. “We didn’t even expect this many people, so we’re really happy with it,” Story said. “We think everyone was really happy to be here, and that’s what really matters — that they’re motivated to make change after today.” Log In Keep it Clean.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 12:50 pm During a walk through the home of Bob and Janet Lowry in Hot Springs, it is obvious that their daughter, Victoria “Tori” Lowry, was loved and is deeply missed. A memory garden, located outside the front door, has plants and decorated rocks in memory of Tori. Their home is filled with mementos of the life she lived and her passions along items made in her honor after she died. Their daughter’s room is just as she left it about a year ago including a poster from her portrayal of Enid in Legally Blonde during her senior year at Lakeside High School and various paintings she created. Tori was killed in May 2020 by her boyfriend, Deadrick Garner, 21, of Hot Springs. He recently pleaded guilty to capital murder and aggravated robbery. For the two counts, Garner was sentenced by Circuit Judge Chris Williams to life without parole and a life sentence in the Arkansas Department of Correction. The sentences will be consecutive. While giving victim impact statements, Janet said she and her family had the opportunity to be a voice for her daughter. Now that justice has been served in the case, Janet believes her family can start to heal. Janet said that she never expected this could happened to her family. “It’s the unimaginable that you never dream would ever happen,” she said. By sharing her memories of Tori, Janet hopes that her daughter’s memory will continue to live on. Janet said she hopes her daughter is remembered for being a true friend and for her kind heart. “Anyone who knew her was blessed to have known her,” she said. “She loved life and she loved people.” Tori, who was born and raised in Hot Springs, was a creative person. She enjoyed singing and playing piano and even won awards for her musical talents. For years, she was an active member of the choir. Tori took voice and piano lessons under Jolene Williams and music just came naturally to her. Tori also participated in Destination Imagination, Yearbook staff and competed in the Garland County Fair Talent Show. With Destination Imagination, she along with her fellow students attended at the global tournament in Tennessee and in yearbook, she received high marks for her writing and photography. She did well academically and was an honors student. She was pursuing a degree in math at National Park College. In her free time, she also loved to cook and bake mainly from scratch and she and Janet enjoyed going to Broadway shows together. As a way to honor, Toni, her brother came up with the “Tori’s Voice” scholarship for the choir students at the Lakeside High School. This scholarship was made possible with donations from the Kappa Alpha Fraternity at Baylor University. Tori’s brother, Steven, had a close relationship with his sister. After earning an undergraduate degree from Baylor University. Steven is now pursuing a law degree at the same school. After his sister’s death, Steven decided to become a prosecuting attorney. “She is her driving force,” Janet said. “It makes me proud that he is taking something that was such a tragedy and he is using it to help other families get justice.” During this difficult time, Janet said really leaned onto her faith. “I know where she is at. I know she is with her heavenly father. I know that she is safe,” her mother said. “We know that we will see her again.” She mentioned that “the power of God” helps her ever day to get up and to go on with her life. The Lowry are also thankful to members of Trinity Church, family and friends who have helped to support them through this difficult time. “They have just showed us with love and they were there when we needed them most,” she said. She also commended the investigators and staff with the Hot Spring County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office for their hard work during the case. When their daughter was murdered, the detectives were at the Lowry’s home often. “They were going to find the person who did this to her. They were not going to stop until they found him,” she said. Along with keeping Tori’s memory alive, her mother also hopes to raise awareness about domestic violence. She encouraged others that if they see red flags in a relationship to leave. “When people are trying to encourage you and they are seeing things. Listen to those people. Take a step back and listen.” she said. “It’s not worth what could happen.” According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, on average nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the United States. In Arkansas, 40.8 percent of women and 34.8 percent of men experience intimate physical violence, intimate partner sexual violence and/or intimate partner stalking in their lifetimes.
