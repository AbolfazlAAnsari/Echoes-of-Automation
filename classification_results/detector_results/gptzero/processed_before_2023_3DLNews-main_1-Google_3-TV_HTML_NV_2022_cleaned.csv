A lot of people said that’s why they fired me. I don’t care, they don’t owe me a job. Fox News doesn’t owe me a job. That’s OK. I had a great time at the network, I’m proud of all the work I did, I’m proud of the work that I did with other people. The news division of Fox was great when I was there,” Stirewalt said during an appearance on CNN this week. The former top editor at Fox said he did not make the call himself but was rather “part of a decision desk team that made a call.” “Lordy day, did people get very angry about that,” he continued. “I had one U.S. senator call for my firing and say we were engaged in a cover-up. I thought, ‘Are there ballots under the table that I haven’t looked at? What are you talking about?’” Stirewalt was apparently referencing comments made by Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) just days after the election saying he and other “knuckleheads” at the network should be fired. The Arizona race call, which was made first by Fox, infuriated former President Trump and his allies on the night of the election. Biden won the state with the help of Maricopa County, a highly populated area that includes Phoenix. Since the election, Arizona has also been the subject of controversy after various members of the GOP have called for election recounts. Stirewalt was later laid off by the network in what it said was a post-election restructuring. “As we conclude the 2020 election cycle, Fox News Digital has realigned its business and reporting structure to meet the demands of this new era,” Fox said at the time. “We are confident these changes will ensure the platform continues to deliver breakthrough reporting and insightful analysis surrounding major issues, both stateside and abroad.” Earlier this year, Stirewalt was hired by startup cable channel NewsNation, which is owned by The Hill’s parent company, Nexstar Media, to serve as its top political editor.

The Washoe County District Attorney\'s Office says 26-year-old Dana Terry will be eligible for parole after serving 5 years. Terry previously pleaded to guilty to Driving a Vehicle While Having a Prohibited Amount of Marijuana in His Blood, Resulting in Death. On November 10, 2018, state troopers were dispatched to Mt. Rose Highway near Thomas Creek Road following reports of a crash. The DA\'s Office says during the investigation, it was determined that Terry had been driving on Mt. Rose Highway after smoking marijuana when he crossed the center line and struck another car head-on, instantly killing the driver of the other car. Soon after, two Good Samaritans arrived and tried to help both Terry and the first victim. Moments later, another car approached the scene but did not see the crashed vehicles or people in the highway due to limited lighting on a dark night. Despite attempting to take an evasive maneuver, the other vehicle hit Terry’s car, causing it to spin and strike both Good Samaritans. Both men who had stopped to assist were killed. (The Washoe County District Attorney\'s Office contributed to this report.) DECEMBER 1, 2020: A 23-year-old man was arrested Monday in connection with a 2018 crash that resulted in three deaths on Mt. Rose Highway. Nevada Highway Patrol issued a warrant for the arrest of Dana William Terry for his involvement in the crash. NHP says Terry turned himself in on November 30. He was booked into the Washoe County Jail on three counts of DUI. In 2018, Nevada Highway Patrol investigated a crash involving a silver Toyota Tacoma driven by Terry that was traveling eastbound in the westbound lane on SR-431. NHP says the Toyota Tacoma hit a sedan traveling westbound, killing 67-year-old Craig Wells Park. Two Good Samaritans stopped to provide assistance at the collision scene. Within several minutes, a GMC Yukon traveling westbound observed the crash and struck the right side of the Toyota Tacoma. The two Good Samaritans were then hit by the Tacoma and killed. NHP says an initial investigation suspected impairment in the crash. The two Good Samaritans were posthumously honored after the crash, which you can read about below. ------ Two men were honored for their courage on Tuesday, after sacrificing their lives in an attempt to save others. On November 10th, Brian Morris and Manuel Torres stopped to help people involved in a car crash on Mt. Rose Highway. During their efforts, a second crash happened and they were hit and killed by a separate car. ""As every good citizen should, both of these gentleman stopped, rendered aid to people in need, and unfortunately paid the ultimate sacrifice for that,"" says Rob Stepien, Deputy Chief with the Nevada Highway Patrol. ""This is an example of human selflessness and caring and love that needs to be memorialized and remembered in the community,"" says Chief Charlie Moore with the Truckee Meadows Fire Protection District. On Tuesday, with the help from NHP and TMFPD, the wives, children and families of Brian and Manuel were presented with the Meritorious Service Award and Citizen\'s Medal of Honor. It\'s the highest honors that can be given to a person who displays service over self. ""Nothing can bring them back, regardless of this medal or this award, it\'s just a way to show respect for the family,"" says Stepien. ""It\'s pretty evident from the tears at the podium, that the extreme amount of pain and loss, I can\'t even express it, I don\'t even have words,"" says Moore. But there are no need for words, because the memories of these two men will live on with their families forever. Manuel, who inspired everyone around him, will always be remembered as the man who put others first. Brian, a skilled geologist, will live on as a mentor, husband, friend and father who always displayed a passion for his work. ""His friends would say, if there was gold in the ground, he\'d be the one to find it,"" says Moore.

NHP says in light of this tragic event, if you ever see flashing red lights or signs of a crash, please slow down and move over to a further lane. This will help drivers avoid first responders and citizens who could be on the road assisting in a crash. UPDATE: The Nevada Highway Patrol (NHP) has released new information on the fatal crash that happened on Mt. Rose Highway on Saturday night. They said it happened at Thomas Creek road around 10 p.m. A preliminary investigation showed a silver 2001 Toyota Tacoma pickup was traveling eastbound on Mt. Rose Highway in the left-hand westbound lane. A green and tan 1995 Mercury Grand Marquis sedan was traveling westbound on Mt. Rose Highway in the westbound left-hand travel lane. The left front of the Toyota Tacoma struck the left front of the Mercury Grand Marquis and both vehicles stopped in the center turn lane and the westbound travel lanes. The driver of the Mercury Grand Marquis, 67-year-old Craig Park of Reno, sustained fatal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. Two good Samaritans, both traveling in separate vehicles, arrived in the scene moments later and stopped to help. As the good Samaritans were on the driver side of the Toyota Tacoma, a white 2002 GMC Yukon SUV was traveling westbound on Mt. Rose Highway observed the crash and steered to the left, striking the right side of the Toyota Tacoma within several minutes of the crash. The two good Samaritans, 43-year-old Rodolfo Torres of Reno and 57-year-old Bryan Morris of Reno were both struck by the Toyota Tacoma.
