One of the primary focuses of their Day of Advocacy was the creation of the Center for Firearm Violence and Intervention, which looks prevent gun violence before it occurs. “What the center would do is bring together resources to better understand what gun violence in Maryland looks like, and how to best allocate resources to community violence prevention groups to stop gun violence before it happens.” Says Ellen Ginsberg with Maryland Moms Demand Action. Another topic they are focusing on this legislative session is legislature that would aim to hold the firearms industry accountable for their alleged role in the gun violence crisis. “Our goal is to pass a state law that would set a code of conduct and a standard for firearm industry behavior and if they violate that it would allow for civil lawsuits to go forward to hold the gun industry accountable.” According to Ginsberg since 2005 there has been a federal law in place known as the ‘Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arm act’ that has protected the firearms industry from lawsuits. The only way to get around that federal act is if a state law has been violated. Which is what groups like Moms Demand Action is looking to establish. Because Local Matters © 2024 47abc.'}]"
