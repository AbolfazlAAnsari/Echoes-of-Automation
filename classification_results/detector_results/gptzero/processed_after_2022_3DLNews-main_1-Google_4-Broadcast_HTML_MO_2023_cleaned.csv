The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), along with John Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President, visited the Capital City Monday morning to announce the historic investment. “Today’s announcement shows how the Biden-Harris Administration is delivering on our commitment to use the federal government’s buying power to strengthen American leadership in clean manufacturing and jobs,” said GSA Administrator Robin Carnahan. “By incorporating clean construction materials in more than 150 projects across the country, we’re helping create good-paying jobs in the clean manufacturing industries of the future and sending a clear signal that the homegrown market for these sustainable products is here to stay.” The funding will support projects across 39 states, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and will catalyze the market for American-made low carbon asphalt, concrete, glass and steel. In Topeka, $25 million will go LEC (low-embodied carbon) construction materials for the Frank Carlson Federal Building and Courthouse. GSA will replace the windows and doors with blast resistant aluminum frames and insulated LEC glass that will reduce the building’s energy use and extend the building’s useful life. The concrete pavement sidewalks and parking area will be upgraded with LEC concrete to sustainably address deterioration, correct tripping hazards, and improve accessibility. The project is slated to be designed this fiscal year, with construction in 2025. The material will be used to meet the administration’s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from thousands of federal office buildings across the country. According to GSA officials, they’re hoping to be “net zero” by 2045. “Today’s announcement from GSA shows that the federal government is leading by example on tackling the climate crisis by spurring demand for low-carbon manufacturing,” said John Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President for Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation. “This is exactly what President Biden’s Investing in America agenda is all about–boosting American innovation, building a clean energy economy, and creating good-paying jobs all across the country.” The Inflation Reduction Act—the largest climate investment in history—provided $3.375 billion for GSA to invest in federal buildings to help reduce carbon emissions and catalyze innovation, primarily by acquiring and installing LEC materials for construction projects. More on GSA’s LEC projects can be found in this fact sheet. According to the administration, asphalt, concrete, glass and steel are some of the most carbon-intensive construction materials–accounting for nearly half of all U.S. manufacturing greenhouse gas emissions, and representing 98% of the construction materials purchased and funded by the government for its infrastructure investments. GSA is hoping to use the government’s “purchasing power” to increase demand for LEC materials to further the administration’s “Buy Clean” initiative.

The latest threats include the horse tranquilizer xylazine, which causes lingering flesh wounds in users, and nitazenes, synthetic opioids that appear to be even more potent than fentanyl. Often Mexican drug cartels press these chemicals into pills, which are counterfeited to resemble pharmaceutical-grade medications for ADHD, depression, and pain.

The Denver Police Department declined in an email to provide details about its investigations, citing safety and privacy considerations and because they are ongoing.

Officers responded to the home of one justice on Thursday evening, but police said it appeared to be a “hoax report.” That case is also still being investigated police said. The FBI said it is working with local law enforcement on the matter. “We will vigorously pursue investigations of any threat or use of violence committed by someone who uses extremist views to justify their actions regardless of motivation,” a spokesperson for the Denver’s FBI office, Vikki Migoya, said in a statement. In a 4-3 decision last week, Colorado’s highest court overturned a ruling from a district court judge who found that Trump incited an insurrection for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, but had said he could not be barred from the ballot because it was unclear that U.S. Constitution’s insurrection clause was intended to cover the presidency. The state’s highest court didn’t agree, siding with attorneys for six Colorado Republican and unaffiliated voters who argued that it was nonsensical to imagine that the framers of the amendment, fearful of former confederates returning to power, would bar them from low-level offices but not the highest one in the land. The court stayed its decision until Jan. 4, or until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the case. Colorado officials say the issue must be settled by Jan. 5, the deadline for the state to print its presidential primary ballots. Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.'}]"

If you weren’t a fan of the ending, or wanted something more from the show, you may be in luck. While fielding questions from the audience during a performance at the Wang Theatre in Boston over the weekend, Jerry Seinfeld himself hinted that he and fellow show creator Larry David are working on some sort of project regarding the finale. “Well, I have a little secret for you about the ending,” Seinfeld can be heard saying in a video posted to Instagram by Linda Henry, the CEO of Boston Globe Media. He goes on, saying he “can’t really tell it, because it is a secret.” “Here’s what I’ll tell you,” he says. “Something is going to happen that has to do with that ending. Hasn’t happened yet. And just what you are thinking about, Larry and I have also been thinking about it. So, you’ll see.” That’s as much as the “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee” host would say. “Seinfeld,” which ran from 1989 to 1998, was consistently one of the most-watched series on air at the time. The two-part finale had the highest television viewership when it aired, according to an Entertainment Weekly report. It was so popular, crowds stopped in Time Square just to watch. Despite its strong viewership, “The Finale” wasn’t exactly well received. A review in USA Today gave it one-and-a-half stars out of four, while users on a CNN “Seinfeld” message board expressed their disappointment. David acknowledged some of that hate in 2014, and Seinfeld said in a 2017 interview that he “sometimes [thinks] we really shouldn’t have even done it.” The show did have a bit of a reunion in 2009 on David’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” but it’s currently unclear if Seinfeld is hinting at a similar return via “Curb” (the HBO series is reportedly ending after its current season) or new episodes of “Seinfeld.” Hopefully, Seinfeld’s latest remarks aren’t just a bunch of yada yada yada.

(KKTV/Gray News) – A rescue dog in Colorado turned out to be more special than his family could have ever imagined. In the past few years, Lou the French bulldog has taken more than 200 foster puppies under his paw. But his journey to “Dad of the Year” was an unlikely one. Lou’s owner Kelley Likes said the dog came from a cruelty case in 2018 where he was left for weeks without food or water, among dozens of other dogs. Lou was one of the only dogs still alive when law enforcement forced their way onto the property. “He’s got some lasting effects from that – you can see he had frostbite on his ears,” Likes said. “He was living outside in an outside kennel. Somehow, he survived.” The surviving animals were taken to the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region (HSPPR), where they were given veterinary care, food, a warm place to stay, and other much-needed TLC. Under that love and care, Lou thrived. Likes, who is HSPPR’s vice president of philanthropy, was immediately drawn to Lou. “I ended up bringing him into my office, and he would roll around and lay in the sun. And I said, ‘I’m not going to adopt this dog.’ That lasted about five seconds. And here he is!” she said. About two years after adopting Lou, Likes and her husband decided to start fostering puppies. “He immediately took to them, rolled on his back, showed them he was a fun, safe place. And they kind of treat him like he’s a jungle gym, which is really fun to watch,” Likes said. But Lou doesn’t just play with the youngsters; he’s been a foster dad to them. “He kind of shows them how to be a dog, how to be well-adjusted, how to be comfortable in a home environment. He definitely helps them get adopted,” Likes said. Likes said the interaction with Lou is invaluable for the puppies when they move into their forever homes. “I think he knows they need a little extra love, and he’s here to do that and give them some support while they get through their foster care,” Likes said. Even if the puppies come in with their mother, Lou still likes to be a role model. “[He] is like a naughty uncle,” Likes laughed. Lou’s family said humans could learn a lot from him. “He’s very resilient, as a lot of animals are, and I think his resiliency is just something cool that animals can teach us.

(KFVS) - Cape Girardeau police completed an investigation this week into the actions of Cape Girardeau County Coroner Wavis Jordan regarding a 2022 death investigation. The case began with a complaint filed by one of the families featured in our First Alert Investigation into Coroner Jordan’s conduct. Christy Young-Clover filed her complaint back on October 19, 2023. Cape Girardeau Police Lieutenant Don Perry said the investigation into Young-Clover’s complaint is complete, and is now at the Cape Girardeau County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office for review for possible charges. Young-Clover sent me a copy of her complaint, which details her concerns regarding Jordan’s investigation of her son’s death in January 2022. “You can’t get natural causes out of suicide.” Jenny Blankenship shows me the two pieces of paper that lead her sister to file a police report regarding the actions of Cape Girardeau County Coroner Wavis Jordan. Christy Young-Clover’s son, Christopher Kight, died January 8, 2022. Cape Girardeau police investigated Kight’s death as a suicide, detailing several pieces of evidence found in his apartment, including this bottle of sodium nitrate and a printout detailing its use in suicides. But when Young-Clover received a copy of her son’s death certificate, she learned Coroner Jordan ruled Kight’s cause of death as a probable heart attack and manner of death as natural. I spoke to Young-Clover and her sister, Jenny Blankenship, about the difference between the two documents. “You can’t get natural causes out of suicide,” Blankenship said. “If you walk step by step through what they have in here, there’s nothing natural about the way my nephew died.” Do you think he did enough? I asked Young-Clover of Jordan’s actions in her son’s case. Do you think his office did enough? “No,” Young-Clover responded. “There’s no way he did enough.” In her written statement to Cape Girardeau Police, Young-Clover said she believes Jordan used false information to reach those conclusions before filing her son’s death certificate with the state. When I asked Jordan back in October how he determined Kight’s cause and manner of death without an autopsy or toxicology, he said he considered that information confidential. But, there’s a much more recent case raising questions about the investigation of a possible suicide - opened on December 10. This Cape Girardeau police report described an officer responding making a welfare check at a woman’s home after someone reported her not answering her phone. The officer described finding the woman dead on her couch. He described finding loose pills and pill bottles around the home and a glass with an intoxicating drink on the living room table. He noted no sign of a suicide note or foul play. But then a family member arrived and told the officer the woman was a recovering drug addict with a long history of suicide attempts. The officer detailed Coroner Jordan arriving at the home. After being briefed on the facts, the officer said Jordan advised him it sounded like a natural death. The officer then described how he and the family expressed their concerns to the coroner about her death being a suicide, and the need for a toxicology report. The officer wrote, ”....Wavis advised them he was going to document this incident as a ‘heart attack’ just for paperwork purposes because ‘suicide is a sensitive subject.’” We reached out to Coroner Jordan on Thursday afternoon, Dec. 14 for comment on both the police investigation and this latest case. We are awaiting his response. Copyright 2023 KFVS. All rights reserved.'}]"

(WFIE) - Tory Schendel Vyvoda and her husband Mark Vyvoda say they’re feeling shocked and joy after learning their great-aunt Yocheved Lifschitz was freed from Hamas captivity. Last week we told you about an Evansville couple who was looking for two family members being held hostage by Hamas. Mark Vyvoda and Tory Schendel-Vyvoda say after weeks of no information on their missing loved ones, they had assumed the worst. On Monday their great-aunt, 85-year-old Yocheved Lifschitz, was returned to Israel in what the family calls a miracle. “My body is still pulsating, it’s just like wow,” said Tory. 14 News met the Vyvoda’s at their home in Evansville only hours after they got the good news. “To hear that not only were there survivors, but you know that it was family, our family was safe,” said Mark. Lifschitz’s is one of the first Israeli hostages to be returned to family after she was taken from the southern Israel village of Nir Oz three weeks ago. Tory says she’s 85-years-old and needs an oxygen tank to stay alive. “Knowing the fact that she needs oxygen every night means that at least to me that there was some piece of humanity on the other side,” said Tory. Lifschitz has been taken to a hospital in Israel, where she is now surrounded by family. Her husband Oded is still being held prisoner by Hamas. “I had started the mourning process with my husband,” said Tory. “When you have health problems, you’re not sure what that’s going to mean, if anything, we thought it was detrimental, we thought it was the worst.” Lifschitz received care in an ambulance after she was transported over the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt. “Going back to the way of life that they knew won’t exist anymore,” said Mark. “The torture that they went through, being captured for weeks not knowing, can never be replaced.” The couple says their story should give hope to other families still waiting for news on missing loved ones. “It’s important to hold on to hope because frankly last week we had none, so it’s a whole renew of faith and why it’s important to keep fighting,” Tory said. Mark and Tory say the hospital has told their family that Lifschitz is in good health. Copyright 2023 WFIE. All rights reserved.'}]"

(KTLA) — A handful of skiers and snowboarders had a close call with nature when a black bear darted across a ski run at a California ski resort on Sunday. Tao Feng nearly collided with the bear at the Heavenly Mountain Resort in South Lake Tahoe. He captured the moment on video and posted it on TikTok. Feng was skiing down the Ridge Run trail around 11 a.m. Sunday when the bear came charging out of the woods and across the slope in between skiers and snowboards. “Didn’t realize it was a bear until it was too close,” Feng said. Thankfully, no one collided with the bear. Feng said he felt better about the situation when he saw the bear reunite with its mother on the other side of the trail. California is home to somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000 wild black bears and, according to the state Department of Fish and Wildlife, violent encounters with humans are extremely rare. Heavenly Mountain Resort straddles the California-Nevada state line. Submit Δ Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.
