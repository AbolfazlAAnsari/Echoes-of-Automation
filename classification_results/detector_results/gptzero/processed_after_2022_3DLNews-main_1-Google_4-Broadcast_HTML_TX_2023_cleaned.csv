ChatGPT takes the top spot, with more than 49 million views. The article had between 100,000 and 400,000 views almost every single day in the first half of the year, and the interest wasn’t confined to the English-language version of Wikipedia. Across all languages, ChatGPT picked up more than 79 million pageviews in total. The second-most popular article was Wikipedia’s annual list of deaths, which frequently makes an appearance in the most-viewed articles of each year. Individual deaths also spurred significant traffic on the site — the articles on Matthew Perry and Lisa Marie Presley were both in the top 25 most-viewed list. Other celebrities also appear, including Taylor Swift and Elon Musk, at No. 12 and 19 in the rankings, respectively. Meanwhile, several movies are among the most popular articles of the year. While Barbie trounced Oppenheimer at the box office, the latter was more popular on Wikipedia. More than 28 million people clicked on the article about the film, compared to 18 million who read the article on the Barbie movie. Here’s a look at the full list of 25 most-read Wikipedia articles of 2023: And here’s a look at the most-viewed articles over the past few years: According to the Wikimedia Foundation, the pageviews for 2023 are as of Nov. 28.

In contrast, his ouster was the lead story on ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts. Carlson was abruptly bounced from his popular prime-time show earlier in the day without any explanation from Fox.

Brian Kilmeade took over Carlson's hour, telling viewers that Carlson and Fox had agreed to part ways, “as you may have heard.” He swiftly moved on to other stories. Hannity led his hour-long broadcast with a story on Hunter Biden, the president's son, and interviewed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. Carlson's name came up when Hannity did a segment on the other big media story of the day, CNN's firing of anchor Don Lemon. He brought on Kellyanne Conway, former aide to President Donald Trump, to criticize Lemon as a studio audience cheered. “We're not talking about Tucker,” Hannity said, unprompted. “I don't have any details on it. He had a massive audience and he had a huge following. This guy (Lemon) had nobody.” Fox's other prime-time host, Laura Ingraham, didn't mention Carlson. Instead, she criticized Democrats in her lead story, “Whatever Happened to Hope and Change?” She also did a segment on a contest in Belgium where people pretended to screech like seagulls. Carlson, Hannity and Ingraham appeared close in November 2020.

The CBS News and YouGov poll found that 61 percent of likely GOP voters would vote for Trump in the 2024 Republican primary. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) trailed in second-place, garnering 23 percent of the vote. Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and former Vice President Mike Pence each received four percent of the vote while presidential candidate Nikki Haley received 3 percent of the vote. When asked what candidates they would consider voting for right now, 75 percent of likely GOP respondents said they would consider Trump and 51 percent said they would consider DeSantis. Twenty-one percent of voters said they would consider Scott, 16 percent said they would consider Pence and 15 percent said they would consider Haley. Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy received 13 percent of the vote, while former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie received seven percent when voters were asked what candidates they were considering. Sixty-one percent said news of Trump’s indictment does not affect their view of him. When asked what should happen to Trump if he is convicted of the federal charges, 80 percent of likely GOP voters said he should be able to be president. The Justice Department charged Trump in a 37-count indictment last week over his handling of classified materials after leaving the White House. Justice Department evidence revealed that the former president had documents containing nuclear and military secrets and the charges hold several decades of prison time. The poll included responses from 1,798 respondents interviewed between June 9 and 10 after the indictment was unsealed. The margin of error for the sample is plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.

Records show Roman Guzman was arrested in Middlesex County, New Jersey, and is awaiting extradition to Harris County. Guzman was charged with felony theft in April after prosecutors tracked him down by tracing money to a New Jersey bank account. During the scam, a man on the phone claimed to be a public defender named John Steinburg. According to charging documents, Guzman used the same name in a number of scams across Tennessee, Utah, New Jersey, and Texas. KHOU 11 News interviewed some of the victims in March, who reported a separate case. The couple, Fred and Kathy, said they were happy to hear someone was being held responsible for the scam. ""I was surprised to start with because I didn\'t expect that to happen,"" Fred said. ""I could have sworn I was talking to my son, we had a conversation,"" Kathy said. They told us they were called by a man claiming to be a public defender named Steinburg. The person then put someone that sounded like their son on the line and asked for thousands of dollars to get out of jail. They lost $5,000, but since then, we’ve talked to at least three other victims on the phone. Including the one in Guzman’s case who lost $40,000. In October 2022, a Houston woman gave $20,000 cash to get her son out of jail. Then wired a second $20,000 payment, but found out none of it was true. ""It looks like they’ve done a little bit of research just based on what they’ve talked to the victims about over the phone,"" Officer Shane Krantz, with Houston Police\'s Swindle Squad, said.

Biden released his long-anticipated announcement in a video early Tuesday morning, criticizing what he has branded as “MAGA Republicans,” including images of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and protesters opposing the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Despite the election season being in an early phase, Biden appears poised to win the Democratic nomination with only two long-shot opponents, self-help author Marianne Williamson and environmental attorney and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., opposing him. Trump also appears to be in a strong position to win the Republican nomination with him leading in most polls by double digits. If a Biden-Trump rematch does happen, it would be the first time in more than half a century that a presidential rematch happened but far from the first time ever. Here’s the presidential election rematches that have occurred in U.S. history: Former Presidents John Adams and Thomas Jefferson (White House Historical Society) The first rematch in a presidential election happened soon after the Constitution went into effect. John Adams and Thomas Jefferson had emerged as the leaders of the Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties, respectively, and faced off in two of the most bitter races in the country’s history. Adams and Jefferson first ran against each other in 1796. Candidates at the time did not directly campaign themselves and relied on their supporters to campaign for them. Jefferson was accused of having an affair with one of his slaves while Adams was nicknamed “His Rotundity,” an insult for his weight, according to The National Constitution Center. Adams ultimately won the race narrowly, 71 electoral votes to Jefferson’s 68. The 1800 election only increased the bitterness between the two sides. Jefferson’s critics accused him of being an atheist and his election would lead to “Murder, robbery, rape, adultery, and incest,” according to the University of Virginia’s Miller Center. Adams was accused of wanting to have one of his sons marry one of King George III’s daughters to create an American monarchical dynasty. Jefferson defeated Adams to deny him reelection, winning 73 electoral votes to Adams’ 65. Jefferson received the same number of votes as another Democratic-Republican, Aaron Burr, but the House settled the tie and Jefferson clinched the presidency on the body’s 36th ballot. Former Presidents John Quincy Adams and Thomas Jefferson (White House Historical Society) John Quincy Adams, the son of the second president, and Gen. Andrew Jackson first ran against each other in 1824 at a time when only one political party, the Democratic-Republicans, existed. The Federalist Party had collapsed by this point, and Adams and Jackson, along with fellow candidates William Crawford and Henry Clay, considered themselves to be members of the same party. The 1824 contest became the second in American history to go to the House to pick a winner when no candidate received a majority of the votes. Jackson won a plurality of the popular and electoral votes, causing him to expect to ultimately be elected president, according to the National Archives. Clay did not advance to the House tiebreaker but held considerable influence in the House as speaker. He advocated for Adams, with whom he was most ideologically aligned, helping him clinch victory. Adams later appointed Clay as secretary of state, which Jackson and his allies blasted as a “corrupt bargain.” Adams and Jackson soon after established their own political parties, the National Republicans and the Democrats, and faced off again in 1828. The contest was dominated by personal attacks, similar to 1800. Jackson was accused of being bloodthirsty and an adulterer, while Adams was accused of corruption and facilitating prostitution. Jackson’s widespread popularity helped him in the race and defeat Adams comfortably. Former Presidents Martin Van Buren and Willian Henry Harrison (White House Historical Society) Opponents to Jackson’s presidency rallied around the newfound Whig Party by the mid-1830s. But the Whigs were formed from a wide range of members who represented differing ideologies and regions of the country, and they struggled to form a consensus beyond opposing Jackson. They nominated multiple candidates from different regions to oppose Jackson’s vice president, Democrat Martin Van Buren. They hoped to send the election to the House and have one of their candidates win the presidency there. The strategy failed to stop Van Buren in 1836, but the plan did help launch Gen. William Henry Harrison onto the national political stage as the best-performing Whig that year. The Whigs nominated Harrison to face off against Van Buren again in 1840. Harrison’s supporters were able to successfully attack the increasingly unpopular Van Buren over a lingering recession and depict Harrison as a folk hero. Harrison comfortably won the election. Former Presidents Grover. Cleveland and William Harrison (White House Historical Society) Incumbent Grover Cleveland easily won renomination from the Democrats in 1888. Benjamin Harrison, the grandson of William Harrison and a former senator from Indiana, won the Republican nomination on the eighth ballot. The election focused mostly on the issue of tariffs, with Cleveland supporting lowering tariffs to try to reduce costs for consumers and Harrison supporting high protective tariffs to try to protect U.S. industries, according to UCLA. Republicans ran a more effective campaign and Harrison narrowly won. But Cleveland won the popular vote by about 100,000 votes. Cleveland faced opposition to become the Democratic nominee in 1892 but was the frontrunner and won the nomination. The race was similar to 1888 in that it focused on economic issues like tariffs, according to the Miller Center. Cleveland attacked the Harrison administration for a strong, protective tariff passed in 1890, and Republicans also had to face a third-party challenge from James Weaver of the Populist Party. Harrison was unable to overcome that, and Cleveland became the only president elected to two nonconsecutive terms in U.S. history. Former President William McKinley and former Ohio Gov. William Jennings Bryan (White House Historical Society/Portrait Gallery) The Republican and Democratic nominees in 1896 and 1900 differed greatly in their economic policies. William McKinley, a former Ohio governor who authored the 1890 tariff, was mostly supported by big business, while William Jennings Bryan, a former House member, was backed by farmers and small businesses. McKinley pledged to maintain the gold standard as the country’s currency, while Bryan condemned the plan and advocated for the expansion of silver as part of the currency, according to the Smithsonian Institution. Bryan ran a vigorous campaign while McKinley campaigned from his front porch. McKinley vastly outspent Bryan in the race and won the race. McKinley emerged as a popular president following the U.S. victory in the 1898 Spanish-American War and was easily renominated in 1900. Bryan was nominated to oppose him again. The contest focused on similar economic issues of currency and a battle between business and labor. Bryan also attacked McKinley over expanding U.S. influence in the world, arguing that the country was becoming an empire. McKinley won reelection and expanded his margin from four years prior by more than 100,000 votes. Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower and former Illinois Gov. Adlai Stevenson (White House Historical Society/Archives) Both Republicans and Democrats were interested in popular World War II Gen. Dwight Eisenhower running for president for their party. But Eisenhower ultimately decided to run as a Republican in 1952, and the Democrats nominated Illinois Gov. Adlai Stevenson. Stevenson could appeal to moderates and liberals in the Democratic Party and had extensive experience, but Eisenhower significantly outcampaigned him. The general widely campaigned with confidence and personality while largely ignoring Stevenson and attacking incumbent Harry Truman’s administration, according to the Miller Center. He attacked the administration for the ongoing Korean War, the spread of communism internationally and corruption and easily won the election. Eisenhower was a widely popular president as he decided to run for reelection in 1956, and Democrats seemed to have a steep challenge before them no matter who they nominated. They turned back to Stevenson again, but he had trouble finding issues that could stick. Eisenhower won again in 1956 by an even larger landslide than he won in 1952.

Wednesday by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton accuses the Biden administration of contributing to the censorship of conservative media. Paxton was joined in the suit by conservative media outlets The Daily Wire and The Federalist. In the suit, they allege the U.S. State Department used tax dollars to fund groups that work to censor right-leaning news outlets. Organizations such as NewsGuard and the Global Disinformation Index each received State Department funding, the suit claims. These groups have connections to major social media outlets such as Facebook, YouTube and TikTok. NewsGuard also holds contracts with the American Federation of Teachers and municipal entities, such as public libraries, across the country. These operations are nothing more than “government-promoted censorship enterprises,” the suit claims, that have harmed right-leaning sites by taking “advertising revenue” while “reducing the circulation of their reporting and speech.” The Global Disinformation Index allegedly kept a list of its top ten “riskiest” news sites, which included The New York Post, TheBlaze, and The American Spectator. “These entities generate blacklists of ostensibly risky or unreliable American news outlets for the purpose of discrediting and demonetizing the disfavored press and redirecting money and audiences to news organizations that publish favored viewpoints,” the suit reads. NewsGuard strongly rebuked the claims made in the suit in a statement to The National Desk (TND) Friday, citing instances where the company has rated right-leaning sources over left-leaning ones. The NewsGuard spokesperson also bucked the suggestion that the company offers ""censorship technology,"" as the suit claims. ""NewsGuard does not offer any technology that censors or blocks any content, or that blocks ads on content,"" the spokesperson said. ""Instead, we provide information--our assessments of sites--so that our clients can decide for themselves where to place their ads or which content to amplify, and each client decides for themselves how to use that data."" The Global Disinformation Index did not respond to a request for comment from TND. In a press release on the suit, Paxton accused the State Department of working to undermine the First Amendment. Paxton last month announced he would sue pharmaceutical company Pfizer for allegedly misrepresenting the effectiveness of its COVID-19 vaccine. In a statement to The National Desk (TND) Thursday, Pfizer said it believes Paxton\'s case ""has no merit.""'}]"

The situation drew national attention after claims of racial discrimination and civil rights violations surfaced. Lubbock-Cooper held a special board meeting addressing racism, leading to a board vote on a resolution. Shortly after, Slaton ISD announced its own resolution. Parents voiced concerns and called for accountability from the Lubbock-Cooper ISD board. The NAACP and affected families felt the resolutions were insufficient and said the board’s response was “damage control” and “too little, too late.” Emotions ran high as a mother demanded accountability from Slaton ISD over the impact of racial claims on her children. Charles “DJ Sancho” Sanchez in Feb. faced a legal ordeal involving allegations of inappropriately touching young girls. As his trial progressed, the defense labeled the charges as ‘malarkey,’ saying the accusations were unsubstantiated. However, during the trial, a motion for a mistrial arose due to concerns over several jurors’ engagement on social media, potentially impacting the case’s impartiality. Ultimately, Sanchez was found guilty and sentenced for the inappropriate touching of young girls. Lubbock County, grappled with a series of game room shootings beginning on March 13, with reports of a shooting that left four people injured. The incidents prompted local authorities and county commissioners to advocate for stricter regulations regarding game rooms. Law enforcement the next day arrested Jamie Lee Pruett, 49, on multiple charges of “Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon.” Tragically, one fatality was confirmed on March 19 in connection to the game room shootings – Christian Rios, 34. Plainview ISD faced intense backlash from angry parents following an incident at South Elementary School involving a video of 6-year-olds described as “inappropriate.” A concerned family member of the one of the students told EverythingLubbock.com that her 6-year-old family member was forced to perform a sexual act on another student. A statement from Plainview ISD on May 1 saying a sexual assault did not occur triggered a month-long controversy leading to protests, policy changes within the school and discussions about implementing electronic restrictions at the school. On May 22, the body of missing teenager Lakaria Moore was discovered in the 1200 block of FM 1729. The Lubbock Police Department’s search began after Moore was reported missing on May 21 and police believed she was in danger. Officers found a woman’s body and a vehicle potentially linked to the missing person’s investigation involving Moore. Christopher Carter was named as the wanted murder suspect involving Moore’s death. On July 31, investigators with the Texas Anti-Gang Center received a tip on Carter’s location at Stadium Motel. Carter was found dead with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. On Aug. 2, Tahdeejah Washington-Harris, 29, was arrested in connection with the homicide investigation for aiding Carter with means to avoid his arrest. Days later on Aug. 11, Jermaal Riggins, 37, was arrested and charged with tampering with or fabricating evidence. A murder-suicide investigation unfolded in Central Lubbock on Aug. 21 after police discovered three deceased individuals, LaCandria Ibrahim, 37, a nine-year-old male and a seven-year-old female in a neighborhood. Property management was attempting to get into the home and called 911 after finding Ibrahim. In a devastating event in Matador, Texas on June 21, a powerful EF-3 tornado claimed the lives of four individuals and left nine others injured. Among those who tragically lost their lives were Jo Etta Bumgardner, 85, of Matador, Randell (Randy) Rolin, 59, of Purcell, Oklahoma, Victor Valenzuela Jr., 43, of Austin, Troy Hernandez, 23, of San Angelo, DPS confirmed. Lubbock faced escalating concerns regarding its 911 emergency system, beginning July 7 and trailing into the end of the month. Mayor Tray Payne took to social media, saying dispatch issues should be improving, not getting worse. Then, numbers acquired by EverythingLubbock.com revealed a troubling increase in abandoned 911 calls, reaching over 30,000, doubling in just two years. These statistics shed light on the severity of the issue, raising fears among residents who experienced unanswered emergency calls. Despite criticism, former LPD Chief Floyd Mitchell defended the 911 system, prompting criticism from members of the city council and the Lubbock Firefighter’s Association. The situation further escalated as it surfaced that the LPD Chief did not want key information related to the concerns in official documents, intensifying concerns over transparency and accountability in addressing the city’s 911 issues. On Sept. 12, the LPD announced that Chief Mitchell had resigned after he was the subject of a closed-door discussion in an executive session of the Lubbock City Council. Gregory Rushin was named interim chief. A heart-wrenching tragedy struck Lubbock when 12-year-old Jordan Rosales lost his life in a shooting in the 1900 block of 44th Street on July 11. Two juvenile suspects were arrested in relation to the crime, one of whom was charged with manslaughter. According to the family, Jordan was shot by his friend in front of his siblings. As loved ones grappled with the loss, they came forward to speak with EverythingLubbock.com on the impact of gun violence, urging children to “put the guns down.” Zaydrian Valdez, 14, a relative of Jordan Rosales, also lost his life to a shooting on Dec. 3. Authorities said Zaydrian was with five other people, Alyssa Gonzales, 18, Angelina Estrada and Dehvin Garcia, both 17, a 16-year-old boy and a 13-year-old boy that night. The group were committing vehicle burglaries during which firearms were stolen. As Gonzales handled one of the guns, a round was discharged into Zaydrian’s seat. The 13-year-old attempted to dispose of the gun. Zaydrian was pronounced deceased at University Medical Center. On Aug. 10, LPD responded to a domestic dispute that ended fatally. Peter Martinelli, 24, was arrested the next day for killing his mother, Brigitte Curtis, 63, by stabbing her numerous times. Curtis was a well-known psychiatrist in the area, her death shocking the community. In a statement on Oct. 19, the Lubbock Police Department said it learned of “criminal allegations” against former Deputy Chief Leath McClure on Oct. 4. McClure was arrested and accused of continuous violence and threats of death with an apparent department-issued weapon against a female civilian employee with whom he had a relationship since 2021, court documents said. On Oct. 23, court documents showed the deputy chief requested a lower bond. His bond was lowered from $500,000 to $100,000 on Oct. 26 and he was released from jail. Effective Nov. 20, McClure resigned from the LPD. More top stories from 2023: Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Newspapers, especially the smaller ones that often serve as the eyes and ears for their communities, are in danger of disappearing. That’s according to the newest State of Local News report by Northwestern University. “We're not only in danger; we have been losing local outlets,” said Penny Muse Abernathy, a visiting professor at the Chicago-area school. She says as those papers vanish, so too have their trained watchdogs who monitor local government. “Not only have we lost newspapers, we have lost 60% of the newspaper journalists we had in 2005. So, 60% — that leaves 40,000 newspaper journalists that we had in 2005 that are not there now,” said Abernathy. For communities across the United States, the problem has created news deserts. “We have areas where people have an abundance of local news. Typically, that's around affluent areas and in metro areas. And then we have areas where people have to really, really look to find the local news and information and data that they need. And invariably those are the communities that need it the most,” said Abernathy. “They are low income, and they are traditionally underserved in marginalized communities, often with large ethnic populations that have not been served in the past well by mainstream media.” A map developed by Northwestern’s Medill School of Journalism shows areas served by two or more papers in dark blue, one newspaper in light blue, and no newspaper in white. “You lose a local newspaper, and you lose the person who shows up at the school board meeting, you lose the reporter who shows up at the zoning meeting or the county commissioner meeting,” said Abernathy. Memphis, Tennessee, is 64% Black, 27% white. There, in the home of the blues, veteran journalist Wendi Thomas runs the online nonprofit news source MLK50: Justice Through Journalism. “It can be hard to grow to the capacity you would want to be when you're relying on grants and foundations and the $10 check your mom can write every month,” said Thomas. Thomas started MLK50 six years ago; now she and her staff of six full-time journalists make sure the community has a voice. “I saw a void in news coverage that wasn't being filled here in Memphis. And it was kind of one of those things where, like, 'OK, who better to do it than me?'” said Thomas. MLK 50 covers a range of topics. But its most important task is making sure those abandoned by profit-focused media are heard. “We launched a newsroom focused on poverty, power and policy, which isn't something that traditional legacy newsrooms typically cover. But I knew we wanted to focus on marginalized people here in Memphis, the people who often aren't the subject of news coverage,” said Thomas. During her 30-year-career, Thomas worked at mom-and-pop newspapers and at conglomerates. “Rural communities have been hit hardest by the death of newspapers across the country,” said Thomas. With advertising flowing to online and social media platforms, many small papers closed. “That means that in a lot of these places, there is no one whose job it is to pay attention to how tax dollars are being spent, to what the county commission is doing, to what's happening at the jails. And in the absence of that sunlight from the media, all kinds of shady things happen in the dark,” said Thomas. Online news organizations have popped up around the country that rely on private funding, such as foundation grants — outlets like the Texas Tribune and Block Club Chicago — but that model is tougher outside metro areas. Abernathy says one solution might be using public dollars to help newspapers and local online media operate. “Western democracies in Europe and in Asia have figured out how to do that very successfully. And in fact, if you look back, there has been a postal subsidy for most newspapers since the very beginning of this country,” said Abernathy.

From natural disasters to wars, no assignment is too dangerous for the fearless correspondent. But Gutman was holding something back. For years, on the air and off the air, he\'d suffered from massive panic attacks. ""For some reason, I feel I can control the situation and myself when there are rockets coming down from Gaza, when I\'m in the eye of a hurricane,"" Gutman told ABC7. ""But it\'s when things are calm and there\'s the expectation of perfection, that I feel the overwhelming burden of anxiety and stress."" Matt chronicled his struggles, and his determination to find a solution, in ""No Time To Panic: How I Curbed My Anxiety and Conquered A Lifetime of Panic Attacks."" The journey to writing this book began in January, 2020. In the middle of a report on the helicopter crash that killed Kobe Bryant and his daughter, along with seven others, deep rooted pain bubbled up for Gutman, causing a panic attack on live TV. ""This one was a little different. There was other stuff going on in my brain at the time. It just so happened that Kobe was basically the same age as my father when he died in a plane crash. And I was the same age as Gianna,"" Gutman said. ""I\'ve been so good my whole career at compartmentalizing and keeping the painful stuff away. And I guess I failed and made a horrific mistake live on TV. And I regret it. And I ended up being suspended for a month."" Gutman searched for panic attack support groups but found they don\'t really exist. So he began researching and doing what he does best. ""I knew that I felt broken inside and that I needed healing and I needed to find a way to do it and there wasn\'t a roadmap,"" Gutman said. ""Eventually I did the only thing I know how to do, which is report."" ""I spoke to evolutionary psychologists and biologists and I spent months on this. And eventually I learned that we are wired to be anxious. It\'s not a mutation, it\'s an adaptation,"" Gutman revealed. ""And that made me feel so much better, just the knowledge that I\'m not broken, that I\'m normal and that there are lots of fellow travelers; 28% of Americans are expected to have a panic attack in their lifetimes."" ""I also figured out quickly that there\'s some deep stuff inside me from my childhood from PTSD from this job, in warzones, being held captive in Venezuela and being accused of being a spy for many days - that was not comfortable. And so I had stuff to deal with. And that\'s why I ended up gravitating away from conventional psychology to altered states,"" Gutman said. From holotropic breathwork to reiki to psychedelics and even toad venom, Matt\'s unconventional route helped him dig deep and get to the pain he had been carrying with him since childhood. And it\'s given him the tools to be able to handle a panic attack should another one arise. ""The real change is that I\'ve been able to tap into my pain. And the drill sergeant in my head that would tell me \'you\'re terrible, you\'re a failure, you\'re miserable look at you...\' he\'s retired,"" Gutman said. ""If I have a panic attack, I know I\'ll get through it and it\'s going to be OK."" Gutman knows his journey will differ from others\'. But there are plenty of lessons that he hopes readers take away from ""No Time To Panic."" Two are especially key. ""The first thing I want people to know is they\'re not alone, right? There are well over 100 million Americans who\'ve had a panic attack in their lifetime,"" Gutman said. ""The second is, panic is normal. We are wired for it and it\'s not a life sentence.""

The air readings throughout the city are normal, and no injuries were reported. Several roads were reopened after they were blocked off temporarily. Marathon GBR can refine 593,000 barrels of crude oil per calendar day and is in the 2938 block of 5th Avenue South. The order was issued around 9:10 a.m. The area that was affected was south of Marathon GBR to the Texas City Y. Marathon Petroleum Corporation released the statement below. “Marathon Petroleum personnel at the company’s Galveston Bay Refinery have resolved an operational upset that had led to a temporary increase in sulfur dioxide emissions earlier today. Emissions have returned to normal levels. There were no injuries. The City of Texas City has lifted a shelter in place that it had issued for an area south of the refinery,” the corporation said. “It was just like real foggy, like smoke looking you could smell it. It was bad,” said Steve Maldonado who lives nearby. Officials said no residential areas were affected. The following areas were affected by the shelter in place order. Marathon Petroleum Corporation shared the following information Sunday morning. “Marathon Petroleum personnel at the company’s Galveston Bay Refinery are responding to an operational upset that has led to a temporary increase in sulfur dioxide emissions. There have been no injuries. Air monitoring has been deployed in the community, and the City of Texas City has issued a shelter in place for an area south of the refinery. A map of the affected area can be found on the city’s social media channels. The safety of personnel and the public is our top priority as we work to resolve the situation,” Marathon Petroleum said. Sulfur dioxide is a colorless gas with an irritating odor, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If someone is exposed to the gas, it can cause irritation in your eyes, throat and nose. It can also cause nasal mucus, coughing, reflex bronchi construction, choking or shortness of breath. If people are exposed for long periods of time and at high levels, this can cause many respiratory symptoms. “Sulfur dioxide is used in many industries. It’s used to manufacture sulfuric acid, paper, and food preservatives,” the CDC said. According to environmental quality paperwork filed by Marathon, they believe a pump failure caused a compressor to trip. This resulted in excess sulfur dioxide emissions from a stack at the plant. The paperwork said the emission event lasted a total of five and a half hours. Copyright 2023 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.

How Does Dallas Cowboys Coach Mike McCarthy Explain Absence of \'Featured Component\' CeeDee? by: Adam Schultz Posted: Dec 27, 2023 / 09:11 AM CST Updated: Dec 27, 2023 / 09:11 AM CST Dallas Cowboys receiver CeeDee Lamb is having a career-best season as the No. 1 weapon for Dak Prescott in coach Mike McCarthy\'s ""Texas Coast Offense."" He is indeed, to use the coach\'s words, a ""featured component.\'\' Except, of course, when he\'s not. Against the Miami Dolphins in what would be a 22-20 Christmas weekend loss, the Cowboys wanted to start fast, and they did thanks to Lamb, who on the game\'s first drive, caught a nine and 13-yard pass while also rushing for nine yards. He was about to be in the groove. On the second drive, Lamb would snatch a 22-yard completion before a 49-yard touchdown in which he weaved through the Miami secondary on his way to having 93 receiving yards in the first quarter. But then something ""weird"" (Lamb\'s word) happened: He wasn\'t targeted throughout the entire second and third quarters before coming to life again in the fourth with gains of 14 and 11 as the Cowboys took the lead late. ""I went absent,\'\' Lamb said. Why, McCarthy is being asked. “You watch the game, the ebb and flow of the game, I thought the two backed-up series were not very good for us,” McCarthy said. “We didn\'t generate a first down on either one of those ... ""But CeeDee Lamb\'s the feature component of our pass game and anything other than that is, I mean those are the facts.” But hang on there, Mike. Credit: Sam Navarro-USA TODAY Sports If Lamb is the ""feature component"" of the Cowboys\' pass game, then No. 88 should have seen targets on a more consistent basis. So to go a half of football without a single pass in his direction was certainly odd. Now, was that due to Dolphins defensive coordinator Vic Fangio making some adjustments after Lamb\'s explosive start? That\'s been suggested, but we don\'t buy it. And here\'s why: That theory means the Dolphins ""solved\'\' Lamb in the second and third quarters, right? So what happened in the fourth, when Lamb re-appeared? Fangio dump his ""solution\'\' for a defensive concept that didn\'t work? Nonsense.

The increase was driven by families and those who lost housing for the first time. Homelessness in America spiked last year, reaching a record high, according to an annual count that provides a snapshot of one night in January. The report, released today by the department of Housing and Urban development, found more than 650,000 people were living in shelters or outside in tents or cars. That\'s up a whopping 12% from the year before. To advocates, it hardly comes as a surprise. ""We simply don\'t have enough homes that people can afford,"" says Jeff Olivet, executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. ""When you combine rapidly rising rent, that it just costs more per month for people to get into a place and keep a place, you get this vicious game of musical chairs."" Homelessness has been rising since 2017 in large part because of the country\'s massive shortage of affordable housing. There was a pause during the pandemic, and Biden administration officials say that\'s because of sweeping federal aid that kept people from getting evicted. But last year, in a triple whammy, that aid started running out. Inflation spiked to its highest level in a generation, and median rent hit a record high. Research has found that where rents rise, so does homelessness. Los Angeles is using AI to predict who might become homeless and help before they do The answer to veterans homelessness could be one of LA\'s most expensive neighborhoods This year\'s big jump was driven by people who lost housing for the first time, which Biden administration officials say reflects the sharp rise in rent. The largest increase was among families, and the count also finds a significant rise among Hispanics. Nearly 40% of the unhoused are Black or African-American, and a quarter are seniors. The annual count does not include the many people who couch surf with friends or family, and who may be at high risk of ending up on the street. In July, Takia Cheeks and her four children joined the surge in families losing housing for the first time. They\'d moved to Virginia so she could take a higher paying job at a corrections facility, and Cheeks was excited to no longer have to live ""paycheck to paycheck."" But it did not go well. Two of her children have disabilities, and she kept having to miss work to get them enrolled in school and set up with accommodations. After six days\' absence, her employer let her go. Meanwhile, the family\'s new apartment turned out to have no hot water or AC, not even screens to be able to open the windows. Cheeks had complained, and after losing her job she was evicted in a court hearing where she had no lawyer. She put the family\'s belongings in a storage unit and they all slept crammed into her Ford Fiesta in a Walmart parking lot. ""I\'m not getting sleep because I\'m watching over my children, because it\'s a lot of people walking around,"" she says. She would get everyone up at 6:00 in the morning to go to a Wawa across the street. ""Therefore I know it\'s not that many people in the bathrooms, for my children just to wash up,"" she says. Can states ease homelessness by tapping Medicaid funding? Oregon is betting on it Medical debt nearly pushed this family into homelessness. Millions more are at risk It was so hot in the car that Cheeks\'s daughter got first and second degree burns. ""I had to take her to the hospital,"" she says. Their rescue dog Max was also suffering so she gave him up, even though he\'d been an emotional support animal for her son with autism. After a few weeks, Cheeks got another job making deliveries for Amazon, and that let the family stay in a motel for a couple months. In October, they finally moved into a house with rental assistance, but that aid is temporary. The surge in migrants showing up at shelters around the country likely also helped push up the numbers, says Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness. It\'s not clear how many may have been included, because back in January the volunteers conducting the count did not ask whether someone was seeking asylum. But Oliva says homeless service providers who\'d already been overwhelmed are now struggling with this added population. ""We saw it in the state of Maine, in Minneapolis, in Chicago,"" she says. ""Our big concern is that there is a huge inflow of folks that are coming into these systems without any resources for these systems to serve them."" Oliva\'s group wants the Biden administration to make it easier for migrants to legally work, and to have their asylum cases heard more quickly. She also says the federal government needs to provide far more rental assistance. Unlike food and healthcare, housing aid is not an entitlement, and only a quarter of people eligible for it actually receive a subsidy. The annual count found homelessness numbers down from the previous year in Houston, Newark and Chattanooga. ""Homelessness is solvable and should not exist in the United States,"" HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge said in a statement. The Biden administration says it\'s stepped up funding and streamlined the process for housing vouchers, among other things, and that helped move more people into permanent housing this year. They also point out that a record number of new apartments — about a million — were under construction. \'Frustration all across the board.\' A day with homelessness outreach workers in L.A. To tackle homelessness faster, LA has a kind of real estate agency for the unhoused Inflation has also eased, but housing and food remain much more expensive than just a few years ago. Food pantries say they continue to see large numbers of people. And while rents on luxury condos in some places may be coming down, the massive housing shortfall is worst for the lowest-income renters, many of whom pay more than half their income on rent. To really bring down these numbers, advocates say there should be far more federally subsidized housing. Right now only one in four people who are eligible actually gets it, but expanding that would need more funding from Congress. Transcript: ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Homelessness in America spiked last year, reaching a record high. That\'s the finding of an annual count released today. Every January, the government conducts a one-night snapshot count of the nation\'s homeless, and this year\'s snapshot shows more than 650,000 people are living outside in tents and cars or in shelters. NPR\'s Jennifer Ludden is here to explain. Hi there.JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: Hi.SHAPIRO: We\'ve reported all year on places big and small struggling with homelessness. So is it fair to say that this big jump is not a surprise?LUDDEN: Absolutely - not a surprise, but the count is up 12% from the year before. And that is a huge jump. Now, homelessness - it\'s been rising since 2017, and that\'s in large part because of this massive shortage of affordable housing. There was a pause during the pandemic. The Biden administration says that is because of that sweeping federal aid for renters that kept a lot of people from getting evicted. But last year that aid ran out. Then inflation skyrocketed, and we saw median rents hit a record high. So given all that, advocates had really been warning about a major increase like this. Here\'s Jeff Olivet. He heads the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness.JEFF OLIVET: We simply don\'t have enough homes that people can afford. And when you combine rapidly rising rent - that it just costs more per month for people to get into a place and keep a place - you get this vicious game of musical chairs.LUDDEN: And Olivet says this rise in homelessness was all across the country - cities, suburbs and rural areas.SHAPIRO: Well, what does the report say about who specifically was without housing?LUDDEN: You know, the numbers are up across the board. The highest rise was for families with children. A quarter of the unhoused are seniors. And there was a really sharp increase in people who lost housing for the first time. I spoke with someone that happened to in July this year. Takia Cheeks is a single mom in Virginia. After losing her job and getting evicted, she says she and her four children started sleeping in their car in a Walmart parking lot.TAKIA CHEEKS: I\'m sitting up. I\'m not getting sleep because I\'m watching over my children because there\'s a lot of people that\'s walking around. And I was getting up early in the morning, go over to Wawa\'s, which was across the street, to make sure we get there early. Therefore, I know it\'s not that many people in the bathrooms for my children just to wash up.LUDDEN: You'}]"

In the 1970\'s and \'80\'s, Aedes albopictus mosquitoes came to the U.S. through the used tire trade. These stowaway insects, also known as Asian tiger mosquitoes, can carry viruses like dengue, Zika and chikungunya. They quickly adapted to city life in the southern, eastern and western U.S. Since then, due to globalization and climate change, insects and the diseases they carry are spreading more widely around the world. At a two-day workshop this week at the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine in Washington, D.C., global public health experts warned that countries like the U.S. are not ready for this looming threat. ""If we don\'t do anything, which is basically what we\'re doing right now, it\'s going to get worse,"" Tom Scott, a medical entomologist and professor emeritus at UC Davis, said during the workshop. ""The damage from inaction is enormous, it\'s unacceptable. It\'s unethical."" The workshop focused on arboviral threats, which are mosquito- and tick-borne viruses that can cause harm to humans. Tropical diseases that were once considered far away from the U.S. are becoming a presence. This year, the U.S. saw locally transmitted cases of malaria and a skin disease from tropical parasites. A Zika outbreak occurred in Florida and Texas in 2016-2017 and dengue has spread locally in the U.S. every year for over a decade. A skin disease caused by sand flies is on the rise in the U.S. The signs have long been obvious to tropical disease researchers. ""We don\'t pay enough attention in the United States to what is going on in other countries. We just kind of watch it spread and we don\'t prepare ourselves for that virus potentially coming to the U.S.,"" Laura Kramer, director of the Arbovirus Laboratory at State University of New York at Albany, told the workshop attendees. ""That happened with Zika, chikungunya and West Nile."" Researchers at the workshop said countries like the U.S. can expect more tropical diseases to come – and should be preparing for them. Global warming is expanding the range of some tropical insects and diseases. But the U.S. has lost a lot of its capacity to track insects. In 1927, every state had its own entomologist working to control insect populations and malaria, Erin Staples, a medical epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said during the workshop. In Florida\'s local malaria outbreak, forgotten bite led to surprise hospitalization ""Where are we now in 2022? We\'ve got sixteen state entomologists."" That means the nation\'s ability to monitor viruses like West Nile is sparse. ""We\'re not getting great information because we haven\'t maintained our infrastructure,"" Staples said. So what should the U.S. be doing? Public health researchers say Singapore is a shining example of mosquito control. The country has cut the number of mosquitoes – vectors for viruses such as dengue and Zika – by cleaning up the city environment and teaching good practices from a very young age. ""My four-year-old daughter will come home and tell me about vector control because she learned it in kindergarten,"" said Lee-Ching Ng, with the Singapore government\'s Environmental Health Institute. Singapore also has a big, expensive surveillance program, which tracks dengue cases by neighborhood and sends phone alerts when cases are high. And residents in Singapore can be fined or jailed for harboring mosquito breeding sites at home. Peter Daszak, president of the nonprofit EcoHealth Alliance, described Singapore\'s approach as ""the carrot and the stick.""

Experts say the U.S. can expect more tropical diseases and should be preparing. Here\'s NPR\'s Pien Huang.PIEN HUANG, BYLINE: In the mid-1980s, Aedes albopictus mosquitoes came to the U.S. through the used tire trade. These insects, also known as Asian tiger mosquitoes, can carry viruses like dengue, Zika and chikungunya. And they quickly adapted to city life in the South and East and Western U.S. That\'s an effect of globalization. Then there\'s climate warming. As the range of tropical insects and the diseases they carry spreads, Tom Scott, a medical entomologist, says we are not ready.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TOM SCOTT: If we don\'t do anything, which would be basically to do what we\'re doing right now, it\'s going to get worse.HUANG: Scott spoke at a workshop at the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine in Washington, D.C. The topic was arboviral threats - that\'s mosquito- and tick-borne viruses - and how countries like the U.S. should be doing more before their full arrival. But Erin Staples with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the U.S. has lost a lot of its capacity to track insects.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ERIN STAPLES: There was an entomologist in every state in the United States in 1927. That was due to try and eradicate malaria. Where are we now in 2022? We\'ve got 16 state entomologists.HUANG: That means the nation\'s ability to track viruses like West Nile is sparse.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STAPLES: We\'re not getting great information because we haven\'t maintained our infrastructure.HUANG: Experts say Singapore is a shining example of mosquito control. Lee-Ching Ng with the Environmental Health Institute Singapore says they\'ve cut the number of mosquito vectors by cleaning up the city and teaching good practices from a very young age.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LEE-CHING NG: My 4-year-old daughter would come home and tell me about vector control because she learned it in kindergarten.HUANG: Singapore also has a big, expensive surveillance program which tracks dengue cases by neighborhood and sends phone alerts when cases are high. In Singapore, people can also be fined or jailed for having mosquito breeding'}]"

But when lawmakers return, they’ll once again have to work on funding the government. Earlier this month, legislators voted on a stopgap bill to keep the government open into the new year. The federal government remains open, for now. On Nov. 16, President Biden signed H.R. 6363, the “Further Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act, 2024,” Robert Velez, Political Science Lecturer at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, gave a brief summary of the legislation. “What was passed was, what was called a continuing resolution that allows for the present level of funding for fiscal year 2023 to be continued. That’s why they call it a continuing resolution, until some date that they pick in the future,” he said. Velez said a lot of Congresspeople don’t generally like continuing resolutions because it’s basically an admission they didn’t get the job done and need more time. There are 12 appropriations bills that need to be passed to fully fund governmental operations. The legislation that was passed was a two-part or “laddered” bill. Velez explained, “In this case, there are three or four different departments that are funded through January 19. Then the Department of Defense and the remainder of the departments are funded through the first week in February. So we’ll be facing another deadline early in January, after the new year, for appropriations to go through.” All three U.S. Representatives from the Rio Grande Valley voted for the continuing resolution. Congresswoman Monica De La Cruz (R TX-15) issued a press release after her vote, a portion of which said, “While averting this shutdown was critical, we must focus on long-term solutions rather than temporary fixes. The American people deserve stability and certainty, especially in this economy. I am committed to addressing the underlying issues of our budget crisis to ensure our national security, protect seniors’ benefits, and fix our economy.” Congressman Vicente Gonzalez (D TX-34), also released a statement about his vote to support the continuing resolution. It reads, in part, “We cannot continue to hold the American people hostage for the sake of a political agenda. Shutdowns have adverse impacts on every part of the country, national economy, and national security.” Congressman Henry Cuellar (D TX-28) announced he was initially opposed to the continuing resolution, but eventually voted for the legislation. Velez said essential services would still operate in the event of a government shutdown, but that a lot of workers may not be paid during that time. “Even if the government shuts down, law enforcement continues, border patrol continues, the courts would continue to operate. So a lot of things would remain open. Even though some of those government employees, who are taxpayers too, would be working and not getting paid until government re-opens and the money is appropriated for the department that they work for,” he said. Velez said government shutdowns were becoming more frequent, and lasting longer. He said that in the past, shutdowns tended to last days if not just hours. They were symbolic more than anything else because legislators were often trying to make a political point by withholding their votes. However, that has changed. “The last one we had, under former President Trump, was the longest shutdown we had. It was like three weeks long and the longer they are, the more harm they can do to the economy. Again, people who are working without wages are going to be late on payments. Which affects landlords, which affects banks, which affects lenders. It can be very disruptive to the economy. ” Congress is scheduled to return to Capitol Hill on Nov. 28.

Soon after her mysterious death, Danishefsky’s loved ones would come to suspect that what happened was no accident. Here is a preview of Andrea Canning’s report: Shele’s hairdresser came to her apartment to give her hair a keratin treatment. New Year’s Eve was the next day, and Shele was going to a party. She knew to avoid moisture to keep her hair silky after the treatment, but the hairdresser reminded her anyway. No wash. No gym. If it was raining, use a hoodie and an umbrella. Work, a quick drink with friends, and then home to her kids by 8 o’clock. That’s when their visitation with their father, who lived across the hall, ended. After the kids went to bed, Shele logged into her dating profile. The next morning, her daughter found Shele in the bathroom. At first glance, it appeared she’d had a terrible accident getting in or out of the full bathtub. But why would Shele have taken a bath? She knew it would ruin her hair.

As the public got a glimpse of a world without The WaPo’s army of journalists, inside the newspaper’s offices editors published stories under the incognito byline, aiming to keep some news flowing to the outlet’s millions of paying subscribers. It wasn’t easy. The protest left The WaPo depleted of large swaths of its staff on several major desks. Suffice to say, the walkout was an inconvenience to management, a move that underscored to the powers at be the important role its journalists fulfill each day. With the work stoppage, which expired at 12:01am ET Friday, staffers sought to apply additional pressure on management as they seek a new contract after 18 long months of negotiations. Demonstrators were also protesting the recently announced 10% workforce reduction. Instead of filing stories, members of The Washington Post Guild spent the day picketing in the December cold. Outside the newspaper’s Washington, D.C., headquarters, demonstrators chanted slogans, sung pro-union songs, and carried signs that demanded a “FAIR CONTRACT NOW.” The union estimated that more than 700 staffers participated in the act of rebellion and that roughly 400 staffers came out for the physical demonstration, which included a rally from 12 to 2pm. The Guild, which asked readers not to engage with The WaPo’s content to show solidarity, saw some support from President Joe Biden. I’m told that the White House, Biden campaign, and Democratic National Committee all refrained from engaging with the outlet and elevating any of its content. While the union has been negotiating with executives for a year and a half on a new contract, it has yet to get close to arriving at an agreement. Wages, in particular, remain a major sticking point between the two sides. Executives have proposed a 2.25% pay increase, but union members have countered that it’s far too low after recent inflation pressures. The drawn out pace of negotiations has also not helped, causing dismay and frustration among members with management over the process. Unfortunately for members of The Guild, the labor dispute comes as The WaPo struggles financially, with the paper on track to lose $100 million this year. To that end, The WaPo’s management team has moved to cut costs, announcing in October that it aims to slash its workforce through voluntary buyouts. Staffers at The WaPo have balked at the need for cuts, often pointing out that the newspaper is owned by Bezos, one of the richest men in the world. For his part, Bezos has stressed that he wants The WaPo to be financially solvent. Patty Stonesifer, The WaPo’s interim chief executive, disclosed to employees when announcing the buyouts that the company had “overshot on expenses” under previous boss Fred Ryan and that management needed to “right size” the business. Last week, Stonesifer warned employees that if 240 people do not volunteer for the buyout offer, layoffs would ensue. Stonesifer said in a meeting this week that 175 employees had so far taken the buyout offers ahead of next week’s deadline. It’s not clear when such cuts would be made, if ultimately necessary. It’s hard to see The WaPo laying off employees just days before the Christmas holiday. But if the outlet does not reach the 240 buyout threshold, management has been clear that cuts will take place. Would they be carried out in the new year? If so, that would mean that newly announced publisher and chief executive, William Lewis, who is set to start on January 2, would be forced to oversee cuts in his very first days. It would be a terrible way to start his tenure at The WaPo. But if cuts are ultimately required, and they don’t happen in the days preceding the holiday break, he may not have a choice.

Marjorie Taylor Greene was the target of a swatting attempt at her Georgia residence on Christmas morning, the congresswoman and local police said, marking the latest instance of someone calling in a fake emergency to draw armed officers or SWAT teams to her home. The Rome Police Department quickly verified that the call was a hoax and did not send officers to the house, department spokesperson Kelly Madden said. â\x80\x9cI was just swatted. This is like the 8th time. On Christmas with my family here. My local police are the GREATEST and shouldnâ\x80\x99t have to deal with this,â\x80\x9d Greene wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter. A man in New York called the Georgia suicide hotline just before 11 a.m. Monday, claiming that he had shot his girlfriend at Greene's home and was going to kill himself next, Madden said. The call was quickly transferred to police when suicide hotline responders recognized the Georgia congresswoman's address. The department said it contacted Greene's private security detail to confirm she was safe and that there was no emergency at her residence. The call was then determined to be a swatting attempt, so the police response was canceled en route, Madden explained. â\x80\x9cWe determined before our personnel could get to her location that there was no emergency and there was no reason to respond,â\x80\x9d she said. â\x80\x9cHer security detail had it all under control, and there actually was nothing going on.â\x80\x9d The congresswoman, who represents the cities of Rome, Dalton and Calhoun in northwest Georgia, spent her first term stripped of committee assignments by the former House Democratic majority over racist comments, her embrace of conspiracy theories and her past endorsement of violence against Democratic officials. She has since gained more influence under the Houseâ\x80\x99s current Republican leadership and continues to be a firebrand for the far-right. Greene's statement that she has been the target of roughly eight swatting attempts is accurate, Madden said. Past calls claimed that dead bodies had been found in the bathtub and in other areas of her home, which is located about 70 miles northwest of Atlanta. Police also responded last year to false reports of shootings outside her residence. The department said it sent officers to the house in response to those prior incidents but has since formed a close working relationship with Greene's security detail, which allows officers to better assess the threat level. The criminal investigations division is working to identify Monday's caller and build a case, Madden said. Another New York man was sentenced in August to three months in prison for making threatening phone calls to Greene's Washington, D.C., office. Republican Rep. Brandon Williams said in a post on X that he was also targeted by a swatting attempt on Christmas Day. The Cayuga County Sheriff's office said it received a false report of a shooting at the congressmanâ\x80\x99s home in central New York and sent officers to confirm that there was no present danger. Sheriff Brian Schenck did not immediately respond to phone messages seeking further details. â\x80\x9cOur home was swatted this afternoon,â\x80\x9d Williams wrote. â\x80\x9cThanks to the Deputies and Troopers who contacted me before arriving. They left with homemade cookies and spiced nuts! Merry Christmas everyone!â\x80\x9d""}]"
