By Sommer Knight and Elena Reid Steinbeiss //February 4, 2024// Foster children must be included in sex-trafficking conversation (Deposit photos) By Sommer Knight and Elena Reid Steinbeiss //February 4, 2024// January was National Human Trafficking Prevention Month. Every year since 2010, this important designation serves as a platform to raise awareness about this devastating form of abuse and exploitation, empower survivors and recognize those who are leading the fight against smugglers and traffickers. Starting and amplifying the conversation around trafficking is vital to prevention. However, when it comes to those most at-risk of being trafficked, the foster care community is continually left out of the conversation. The vulnerability that foster youth inherit the minute they enter the system is unjust, and oftentimes our own biases or misconceptions can keep us from seeing the harsh realities facing young people who age out of care. Elena Reid Steinbeiss The truth is being sex trafficked is a major concern for this population. In fact, around 900 young people age out of the foster care system in Arizona every year, and statistics show one-third of those young people are sex trafficked. They are highly sought-after targets because traffickers know there is no family and likely no system of support. Some traffickers even target group homes, having kids already under their control to lure other kids into “the life”. It is a vicious cycle that too often goes unnoticed. These statistics should shake us to our core, it should lead us to the very question, how can we change this? How can we help make this better? The truth is, we can do better, and we must do better, starting with taking the time and effort to educate ourselves about what is happening in Arizona around sex trafficking, as well as who is most at-risk. According to the National Trafficking Hotline, in 2021 Arizona ranked 13th in the country with 651 reports of human trafficking tips. Officials identified 217 cases and 337 victims. Get involved with organizations that help vulnerable individuals and sex trafficking survivors. Dedicate time, energy and/or resources to support foster youth and organizations working with foster youth. With close to 14,000 Arizona children in the system right now, and only 3,000 licensed foster families, the need for foster parents is its own ongoing crisis. You can also support programs like Foster360 that helps foster children who have aged out of the system break the cycle of homelessness. Sommer Knight Did you know when young adults age out of the foster care system, they are more likely than their peers to experience homelessness and unemployment? They also have a high school graduation rate of just 42 percent and a higher education completion rate of less than 3 percent. By age 21, 71 percent of women will be pregnant, and 1/3 will find themselves sex trafficked, just to name a few barriers that these young adults face. How kids enter our foster care system is not by anything they did, it is by the unfortunate situation they are being removed from, our children and youth deserve to not leave one nightmare for the next. We need to be a part of making their futures one of hope, instead of fear and pain. One organization that is working to change these outcomes is Foster360. Foster360 offers holistic wraparound services that empower foster youth ages 18-24 with the necessary tools, education and mindset to succeed in life.

Foster360 also has affordable housing that allows young adults to take the stressors of increased housing costs off their shoulders and provide an individualized plan that will empower each young adult to have sustainable, long-term success in their lives and to never become homeless again. So, for those who now understand the harsh realities facing Arizona’s foster youth, how will this past month of awareness be different from years past? Will it spark action and lasting momentum? Or simply evoke emotions that ultimately get waved away. Awareness is nothing more than empty knowledge if it never moves from thought to action, and ultimately, into change.

There was an additional pending call at the same residence for a court order service referencing the male resident. Upon arrival, officers called the man and asked him to step out. The man exited the residence carrying a long gun and pointed it toward officers. Preliminary information shows that after the man pointed the gun toward officers, two officers fired at least one round each at him. At this time, it appears the man was struck by one of the rounds fired by officers and sustained a minor injury. The man returned to his house, where he refused to come out for several hours. After hours of negotiating with him, he came out of the house and was taken into custody with the assistance of the Special Assignments and K-9 units. The man has been identified as 43-year-old Judd Williams of Peoria. Williams was transported to a local hospital with no life-threatening injuries. No officers or bystanders were injured. The Glendale Police Department is the lead agency for this investigation as part of the West Valley Incident Response Team. Williams will be processed and later booked into the Maricopa County Jail on several charges including aggravated assault.

Runners slowly emerge from their homes and onto the roads and trail systems. Flagstaff’s running community is vast, with a rich history that makes the city an established location for runners. Whether it be the staggering elevation, countless urban trails or proximity to nature, Flagstaff draws athletes in from around the globe. Runners from beginner to collegiate and elite levels travel to the city to train. Brandon Joe, an employee at Run Flagstaff on Route 66, said he came to Flagstaff because it was “Hollywood” for runners. “People come out here just to see if they can make it,” Joe said. “Obviously, being around other individuals who are pursuing the same career is very motivating, but it is also just the unique culture Flagstaff has been known for.” Nathaniel White talks about the process that Buffalo Park went through to exist while sitting in his house in Flagstaff on Dec. 6, 2023. Since the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, where high elevation was a prominent drawback for many competing athletes from different countries, Flagstaff’s 7,000-foot altitude was an appealing training destination. Mexico City sits 500 feet higher than Flagstaff, making the northern Arizona city an applicable place to sharpen breathing techniques and acclimate to the thin air. To this day, when runners, swimmers and bikers need a place to gain endurance quickly, Flagstaff offers a solution. As a Navajo man, Joe said he traveled to the city not only for its notoriety as a runners’ capital, but to serve as an icon for diversity in the community as well. Although the Navajo Nation lies about an hour away from the city, he said there are few Indigenous runners in Flagstaff. “Being that close to my culture and my heritage, it was pretty nice,” Joe said. Long before the Flagstaff Urban Trail System (FUTS) was established in the 1980s by a committee on city council, the San Francisco Peaks and the surrounding forest served as a home for runners, Neil Weintraub, director of the Northern Arizona Trail Runners Association, said. FUTS (pronounced “foots”) connects patrons from the city to the Coconino National Forest. It is widely used by runners and hikers and serves as a footpath for tourists and locals. The 56 miles of trails maintained by the local government are widely recognized as a favorite spot for running and hiking. From rocky, uneven terrain to paved bike paths, FUTS is a recreational element that passes through much of the community. “I don’t necessarily see [Flagstaff] as more special than any other place,” Weintraub said. “What would make Flagstaff unique is the Coconino National Forest.” Within city limits, yet away from the large booms of car engines and train horns, lies Buffalo Park. The mesa has popular trails within FUTS and is frequently utilized by Flagstaff runners. “You can go up there [Buffalo Park] now, today, and you can see the Olympians and the professional runners,” Weintraub said. “It’s pretty inspiring.” Initially, the dizzying elevation of Flagstaff drew some attention to the small railroad and lumber town for athletes to train. Yet, many situations compounded around the same time and allowed the city to flourish as a hub for runners Nathaniel White looks over a newspaper clipping about the Buffalo Park initiative in his house on Dec. 6, 2023. Around the same time the Mexico City Olympics established Flagstaff as a viable option for elite-level training, city council voted in support of a proposition for a highway that would run parallel to Interstate 17. Former City Council Member Nathaniel “Nat” White was on a committee that proposed and maintained FUTS and was instrumental in creating an initiative to prevent Buffalo Park from having a highway built through its scenery. “If the Save Buffalo Park initiative hadn’t happened, the whole mesa would be totally different,” White said. However, eye-catching billboards adorning Route 66 were meant to sway readers into voting in support of the highway. The prominent phrase “Make the park available for everyone, vote no on [Save Buffalo Park] proposition” was posted on billboards scattered across Flagstaff, White said. Ironically, White said voting against the Save Buffalo Park initiative would have made the park less accessible to the public as a result of the highway. He and a group of activists, most of whom were runners, created the Save Buffalo Park initiative to overrule the recent vote supporting the highway. It took over 10,000 signatures on a petition and several attempts to inform the patrons to rally enough support for the cause and stop the highway from being built. A bronze buffalo now welcomes runners, hikers, bikers and many others into the park, with a plaque underneath explaining its history. “That plaque does not go into the fact that the park was saved by a bunch of runners,” Weintraub said. White later ran for city council, where he was part of another committee of mostly runners who started FUTS and other significant referendums. As an avid runner, he continued to make the city more of a place for others like him to enjoy. “From the city’s point of view and the minds of the community is this culture of ‘Let’s build a city within the forest, not carve it out of the forest,’” White said. Runners’ testimonials A diverse population enjoys running in Flagstaff. People from ages 12 to 80 use the trails and join running clubs, with minority groups emerging into the field each day. Weintraub said there are now more women in the community than men, compared to the early 2000s and before when it was the opposite. NAU history professor Elizabeth Schwall lived in several metropolitan areas, including Chicago and New York City. While she enjoyed running in those cities, she said she feels safer in Flagstaff than in any big city. “In any other place I lived, I don’t think I would have felt too comfortable running by myself because there’s always stories,” Schwall said. “I feel very safe here.” Nathaniel White looks at one of his Imogene Pass Run trophies at his house in Flagstaff on Dec. 6, 2023.

Even if she chooses to run with a stranger, they are “a couple degrees” removed from someone she knows. “It’s a cultural aspect of Flagstaff, and it’s a gigantic family,” White said. Another NAU professor in math, and Schwall’s faculty mentor, Angie Hodge-Zickerman, has been a Flagstaff runner for several years. She created her own running group of roughly 40 people, employees from Flagstaff Medical Center and the university. “Everyone just kind of knows each other,” Schwall said. “There’s a lot of people who are always up for running with others, and it doesn’t matter how fast or slow.” Flagstaff may be bridging the gender gap for runners, but Indigenous voices are disproportionately recognized.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 12:36 pm Kelly, Nick and Jeff Walters at one of their Jimmy John’s locations. “Locally owned” and “family business” are likely not the first words to come to mind when people think of a fast-food franchise or chain coffee shop. However, one West Valley family is looking to change all that — one coffee, sandwich and good deed at a time. Meet the Walters family. These Midwestern transplants own three Jimmy John’s locations — two in Glendale and one in Buckeye — as well as the Human Bean coffee shop on 19th Avenue in North Phoenix. Long before becoming familiar with the Jimmy John’s brand in their native Detroit, family patriarch Jeff Walters learned the true value of hard work growing up in a large family supported by a single income. When he wasn’t in school or at one of his jobs, he was dedicated to sports — something he passed on to his two sons as he coached their baseball teams while they grew up. “It’s something I can’t put a price tag on,” Jeff said. “I love being out there coaching, influencing and teaching kids how to work hard for a purpose.” It was while coaching one of his local high school teams that Jeff became familiar with the Jimmy John’s brand. The local franchise joined the team in raising funds for the upcoming season. Impressed with their involvement in the community, there was little question of where the family would turn to when they decided to go into business together after moving to Peoria four years ago. The family later opened the Human Bean in March 2023. “We did a little bit of research and just really loved what the brand stood for,” Jeff said. Started in Oregon by a duo of husband-and-wife teams over 20 years ago, the brand’s mission is grounded in integrity, community and quality. As for how the family runs the operation, Jeff described it as a “kind of a divide and conquer thing.” His two sons work largely behind the scenes, with Nick handling the accounting and Zack on IT support. Daughter-in-law Mackenzie handles the payroll, while soon-to-be daughter-in-law Monique is teamed up with his wife, Kelly, on the day-to-day operations of the coffee shop. Jeff also fondly refers to Kelly as the face of the franchise — known for greeting guests with a smile and striking up conversations with just about anyone. Jeff handles the contractors, landlords and any opportunities to grow and support their businesses. Despite enduring setbacks of the COVID-19 pandemic, including supply and employee shortages, the family has enjoyed success. However, no amount of it ever lets them forget the generosity shown to one high school baseball team so many years ago or another couple’s commitment to inspiring “authentic human connections with a bean on top.” “We do a lot of stuff in the community because they’re the ones who support us,” Jeff said. Some of their charitable work includes following in the footsteps of that original Detroit Jimmy John’s franchise and sponsoring local school sports teams. Those include Mountain Ridge High School, Verrado High School, Desert Edge High School, Deer Valley High School and Bellair Academy, among others. Employees posing at the Walters family Jimmy John’s location in Buckeye. They’ve raised money for St. Mary’s Food Bank and shown support for men’s health care through the Human Bean’s “Mochas for Men” campaign. They also recently sponsored Soldier’s Best Friend. “They train dogs to fit them with soldiers with PTSD,” Kelly said. They also give back to their employees. “We’ve also set up some scholarships for the employees that are advancing, taking on college courses,” Jeff said. He knows firsthand how difficult it can be to balance school and a job. “We really get to know our employees, their families and so forth,” Jeff said. “We treat them as if they’re one of our own.” “I hate calling them employees because they’re an extension to our family,” Kelly added. It makes sense. Communities have a powerful way of coming together when they know the stories and struggles of their neighbors. For the Walters family, that’s most clearly seen in their “Coffee for a Cure” event. “We donate 100% of sales,” Jeff said. “We partnered with HonorHealth and expanded that to a portion of our Jimmy John’s sales that same day. We donated close to $5,000 to HonorHealth just from that event alone.” Seeing everybody show up to the Human Bean wearing pink, buying a coffee, and simply sharing their stories of love, loss and overcoming was a powerful experience, especially for Kelly, who has a pink ribbon tattoo for breast cancer awareness. “We lost our sister-in-law to breast cancer, so it really hits home,” Kelly said. “I think everybody, every family, in one way or another has been affected by cancer,” Jeff added. He estimated that their franchises raised around $10,000 for charity in 2023 alone, and for his family, there’s always more to do and more to give. That’s why they plan to take over at least four more Jimmy John’s in 2024 and maybe even add another coffee shop to the mix. However, Kelly stressed that expansion will never come at the price of maintaining their personal touch. “We want to have a personal attachment to each store,” she said. “Everybody knows us. When somebody calls off, Jeff will go in and drive or I’ll go in and make sandwiches, or my son will go in and drive. We’re always in the store helping out.” “We’ll never be those people that don’t show up,” Jeff said. Never miss an issue. Sign up for free today.

As I turn towards the end of my first term in Congress, I’m so grateful to fight on behalf of some of America’s most engaged and sophisticated voters.

(Bob McClenahan and Poetry Inn/Submitted) “A dream is a wish your heart makes … When you’re fast asleep.” Or is it? Poetry Inn, a five-star boutique hotel nestled high atop a hillside overlooking what feels like the entirety of Napa below, feels like the most beautiful, romantic of dreams come to life. The brainchild of award-winning winemaker Cliff Lede and designed by iconic architect Howard Backen — known worldwide for his work on the likes of Cliff Lede Estate, Ram’s Gate Winery, Larkmead, Dana Estates, Knights Bridge Winery, The Napa Valley Reserve and Paul Hobbs Winery — the Poetry Inn is utterly grand, yet sensationally secluded and intimate. Almost hidden on a hillside, the dazzling property — named in homage to Cliff Lede’s prized Poetry Vineyard surrounding the hotel and recently refreshed throughout the interior by lauded St. Helena-based Erin Martin Design — is only accessible via a serpentine trail up a tranquil and green mountainside just outside of the Yountville area of Napa in Northern California. The hill seemingly ends at an immense gate, but when buzzed in, a world of wonder slowly appears in the distance. Visually, the property — which has a private hiking trail that leads guests from the inn to the top of the ridgeline — looks like a grand, multistory estate one might see in a film, but it is all too real. Upon entering Poetry Inn, guests are greeted with a welcome glass of wine at a sleek, modern bar, which doubles as the check-in area. Just beyond the bar is a great room with floor-to-ceiling windows with views one could only otherwise enjoy if in a hot air balloon. The great room features a stunning collection of artwork, oversized furniture and curated accents like antique typewriters, but also a bevy of artisanal snacks to enjoy before heading to one’s room. Strike that. There are no rooms at this hotel. The Poetry Inn only features suites, and there are just five across the entire property. Each, as noted prior, is named to honor a great poet — Robert Frost, E.E. Cummings, Robert Louis Stevenson, Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman — and there are thoughtful, tasteful accents that evoke the sensibility of each suite’s poet without feeling gimmicky. They all boast an ample balcony with plush seating (some with swinging daybeds), allowing all those who enter the chance to become one with that same insane view from the great room. Each of the suites also has a romantic wood-burning fire with a Firestarter log and bonus kindling, light fitness equipment, a spa-style bathroom covered in striking limestone and marble, and indoor-outdoor showers with rain shower heads. And then there is the service. Aeriel view of Poetry Inn.

Citing a developing mining operation in the Patagonia Mountains, an Arizona lawmaker is asking the federal government to impose restrictions on manganese air emissions. State Rep. Stephanie Stahl Hamilton, a Democrat whose legislative district encompasses part of Santa Cruz County, sponsored the memorial – a type of legislation that petitions or addresses other government agencies, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The bill requests that the Environmental Protection Agency add manganese to its list of pollutants regulated by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Currently, the NAAQS list only applies to six pollutants; manganese is not one of them. In her bill, Stahl Hamilton pointed specifically to the Hermosa Project south of Patagonia. The operation will involve manganese mining, though parent company South32 has cited a number of its own safeguards and restrictions for the mine, which is slated to begin fully operating in 2027. Nonetheless, residents and environmental advocates have expressed concern in recent months over the potential effects of high-level manganese exposure, which can lead to neurological complications. Stahl Hamilton’s bill has not yet undergone a reading on the House floor, according to the Arizona Legislature’s online bill tracker. Still, the bill has garnered two-dozen co-sponsors already within the State House of Representatives. \u200b Copyright © 2000- • Nogales International • 268 W View Point Dr, Nogales, AZ 85621 | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Contact Us | The NOGALES INTERNATIONAL is owned by Wick Communications.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan on Friday vacated the March 4 trial date in the case brought by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith but did not immediately set a new date. The move opens the door for a separate prosecution in New York, charging Trump in connection with hush money payments to a porn actor, to proceed first. That case has long been seen as arguably the least legally perilous of the four indictments Trump faces, with the alleged misconduct less grave than accusations of mishandling classified documents or plotting to subvert a presidential election.

McMahon has denied the allegations, and said he is prepared to defend himself in court. But, in a statement Friday, McMahon said that he has resigned.

Hunt and state federal road officials, a substitution plan providing for the building of the bridge at Vulcan Throne, north of Seligman. This route and bridge, the Fredonia people say, would permit year-around territory and would serve a large number of residents of the strip. Pipe Springs and Torroweap Valley already are settled, while practically all of the territory followed in the route by Lees Ferry is uninhabited. Charles McCormick and A.W. Judd of Fredonia are among those interested in the proposed road. Their investigation shows that the bridge at Vulcan Throne could be built from 50 to 100 per cent more cheaply than at Lees Ferry. Rumor has it that plans are being drawn at the office of the division superintendent at Winslow for a new depot for Flagstaff and that the Santa Fe officials intend soon to order the beginning of work preliminary to construction. No announcement has come officially from the railroad people. There is a possibility, but it is a scant one, that the present plans may not materialize. Though considering the growing local indignation over the present inadequate and disgraceful building and the strong protest recent sent to President Storey of the Santa Fe by the Flagstaff Rotary club, it is reasonable to assume that as long as the company has got to the plan-making stage, actual building won’t be long delayed.

Visibility was reported satisfactory as 18 large military cargo planes left here heading north. A squadron of 15 Navy aircraft were dropping their loads of hay over snow-buried regions near the Utah border in an all-out effort to save starving livestock. Other military craft were spotted dropping food and medicine at Indian settlements. Tomorrow a shuttle stop will be started at Winslow, with planes making one trip from Phoenix, and a second from Winslow, which is closer to the reservation. Sixteen carloads of hay were “redballed” by railroad to Winslow last night from Phoenix to be reloaded on the planes. A civilian helicopter was scheduled to take a nurse from Tuba City to join a doctor at the Navajo Mountain school, where an outbreak of disease was reported. A survey over the region today disclosed jeeps could carry surgeons to spots where needed. A mother and two children were rescued from their snowbound truck early this morning after being stalled in a raging blizzard more than 12 hours. Word of the rescuer was brought to Williams by Ollie Dotson, who had taken Mrs. Roy Hancock and her two young children to the Valle airport. Both were reported unharmed. Two snowplows and the truck had worked through the drifting snow to reach the pair after word of their plight had been sent by short wave radio from Valle airport to Williams. Hancock had left the truck and struggled 5 miles back to the airfield for help. 1974: Effective today, the City of Flagstaff has officially taken over the patrolling of the Coconino County parking lot, located behind the courthouse, and many county employees are upset over the decision. The Coconino County Board of Supervisors signed a three-year lease with the city this week allowing one-third of the parking revenue to go to the county and the remainder to the city. Several county employees expressed discontent with the $8-a-month parking permit fee they are required to purchase if they want to park their cars in the lot. “All other county employees, like out at the health department and at the county yard, get to park for free, but now we are being forced to park out in the streets if we don’t want to buy the permit,” one employee said. However, Jack Smith, county manager, explained that lot was never intended to be used by county employees. He said the purpose of the spaces has been for the use of jury members or patrons of the courthouse. “We have repeatedly asked the county employees not to park there, but every morning they jam it up. We can’t provide free spaces because we’re right in the middle of the city and no business in the city provides free spaces.” Smith said that as yet no one has come into his office to purchase the $8 permits. 1999: The proponents of a shelter for women recovering from drug and alcohol abuse will have one more shot tonight to sell their idea to the city council. The operators of the Center for Healing are asking the council to approve their request for a conditional-use permit to use a house at 38012 N. Fanning Drive in east Flagstaff as a place for women to stay while they learn to live sober lives. But their pitch to the council is expected to bring out more area residents and more opposition. “I’m trying to find some ways to reassure people who are scared” of the proposed halfway house and its residents, said Councilmember Norm Wallen. “I’m still not hearing it.” But Wallen did try to quell a point of contention between center supporters and neighbors of the house. Area homeowners had circulated an anonymous flier that emphasized the house’s closeness to Thomas Elementary School, while representatives of the Center for Healing told the council they have had few problems at other centers in the Phoenix area. “I continue to be disturbed at how we’re viewing these residents,” Wallen said. “They are women trying to overcome obstacles, and I think the need’s much greater than 15 beds.” Flagstaff's Morningrain Honani (3) shoots the ball during a game against Bradshaw Mountain on Friday night at Flagstaff High School.

night. The Lynx fell short, 63-62, in overtime. Posted by Quentin Jodie | Feb 2, 2024 | Basketball | REHOBOTH, N.M. The second-ranked Rehoboth Christian Lynx nabbed the matchup – if not the outcome – it wanted heading into the final weeks of the regular season. The 2A Lynx (13-6 overall) used Thursday’s game against 3A Bosque (14-5) as a precursor of what’s to come as the state playoffs loom in early March. “This was like a state playoff game,” Rehoboth coach Kevin Zwiers said following his team’s 63-62 overtime loss to the visiting Bobcats. “That’s the level of play we’ll see from teams at state,” Zwiers said. “We’re going to see that intensity and that competitiveness when we get to the playoffs. This was a good game for us as we move forward, as we get into our district season. “To play a team like Bosque is what we needed,” he added. “You want to go into the postseason tested, and not win all of your games by 40, 30, 20 points.” In Thursday’s marquee matchup, the Zwiers-coached team had the final possession in both regulation and overtime sessions. In the first circumstance, the Lynx inbounded the ball from the far baseline with 4.6 seconds left and dished the ball to senior Raeden West, who heaved an NBA-range three-pointer to no avail. On the ensuing miss, sophomore Kodah Chapman had his putback rim out as the game was knotted at 52-all at the end of regulation. “We got the shots that we wanted,” Zwiers said. “In a situation like that you either win the game or you go into overtime and that’s what we were talking about. We got off a great shot, we even had a put back opportunity that just rimmed out.” In OT, senior Kaleb Vail took the last shot with the Lynx trailing by one, but his potential game-winning three clanked off the rim as time ran out. “Bosque, you know, defended us well,” the Rehoboth coach said. “Again, we still put up a good shot, but it didn’t fall for us. It’s just the way it goes sometimes.” Navajo Times | Quentin JodieRehoboth Christian Matthew Olguin puts up a trey against Bosque defender Leo Dettweiler on Thursday night at Rehoboth High School. Senior Kyle Morris scored the go-ahead bucket for Bosque with 6.3 seconds left in OT as the fourth-ranked Bobcats erased a 57-54 deficit at the start of the extra period. “I’m just glad that we got out of here with a win,” an elated Bosque coach Clifton Davidson said. “Rehoboth is a very good team. Every time we come here, and every time they come to our place, it’s always a one-possession game. It’s always close regardless of anybody’s ranking.” Rehoboth opened the extra session by nailing 3-of-4 free throws, but the Davidson coached-team didn’t buckle. The Bobcats retook the lead 58-57 on a 4-0 run that was capped by an inside bucket from junior Oliver Tumolo, who finished with 13 points. The lead changed hands four more times until Morris earned the Bobcats the hard-fought win. “To be honest, our problem all year has been our ability to find consistency in getting defensive stops and getting offensive plays,” Davidson said. “They showed some resiliency today. We haven’t been able to do that all year, and so it was great to see them do that today.” Morris led the Bobcats with 21 points while senior Cooper Hautau added 15 and Tumolo chipped in 13. Rehoboth received a game-best 26 points and four treys from Raeden West. Raeden’s younger brother, Trajen, helped with 16 with three treys and senior Kaleb Vail added 13 points. “They were impossible to guard,” Davidson said of Rehoboth’s backcourt players. “Our whole defensive strategy coming into this game was to keep the ball out of their hands, keep them from getting wide-open threes. “Regardless of what we did, they found ways to get shots and create for themselves,” he added. “They’re just really, really good players.” The Lynx will wrap up the regular season with six district games starting with Navajo Pine on Tuesday. The four-team district also has Laguna Acoma and Dulce in the mix. “We’re going to approach our district games the same way we do every game,” Zwiers said. “We’re going to continue to work on our stuff and make sure that we’re getting better every time we step out on the court.” Share: Rate: Quentin Jodie is the Sports Editor for the Navajo Times.

Please give us a call at 520-458-9440 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy With three Mica Mountain players in pursuit, Douglas' Stephanie Ruiz gets off a shot on Jan. 30. DOUGLAS − Tucson Mica Mountain beat the Douglas Bulldogs 46-38 in overtime in 4A Gila Region girls basketball Tuesday, Jan. 30, at Douglas High School. The Thunderbolts snapped Douglas’ six-game winning streak and avenged an earlier 54-50 loss to Douglas. A Bulldogs win Tuesday would have secured the Gila Region championship. With the loss Douglas drops into a second-place tie with Rio Rico behind region leader Mica Mountain. Mica Mountain and Rio Rico meet Tuesday, Feb. 6, in Tucson. The Thunderbolts beat the Hawks 48-44 several weeks ago at Rio Rico Douglas needs to root for Rio Rico to win in order to create a three-way tie for first, at which time the power rankings will determine the region champion. The Bulldogs played Tuesday’s game minus one of its key players, junior power forward Francia Rubio, who was averaging 10.3 points. In the second quarter Monday Rubio received a hard foul, which led to her making a retaliatory move that ended with both players ejected. They also must sit out the next game. Douglas struggled without Rubio, shooting just 2 of 22 from 3-point range. Junior Scarlette Ruiz led the Bulldogs with 10 points. Corazon Santa and Dana Rubio followed with six each. “This was a tough loss,” Douglas coach Clint Hill said. “Not having Rubio tonight hurt. Fortunately, we will have her back for state. That’s a good team we played tonight.” Hill admitted the physicality of the Rio Rico game the night before may have impacted his team slightly as they were not as fresh as he would have liked. The Mica Mountain game originally was scheduled for Feb. 2 but was moved up three days for reasons Hill said he’s not aware of. Douglas was 0-for-5 from 3-point range in the first quarter but still managed an 8-3 lead. The Thunderbolts got their offense going in the second quarter, taking a 14-10 lead. The Bulldogs outscored Mica Mountain 15-8 in the third, taking a 25-23 lead into the fourth quarter. Douglas' Carolina Anguiano battles a Mica Mountain player for the rebound Tuesday, Jan. 30, in Douglas. Mica Mountain led 34-31 late in the game when Evelyn Gonzales, who hit the game-winning 3 against Rio Rico, drilled an off-balance 3 as she was falling to the floor, tying the game at 34-34 and forcing it into overtime. The Thunderbolts outscored Douglas 12-4 in OT to win. Going into the game Douglas had been ranked ninth in the 4A girls basketball rankings. Mica Mountain was 14th. When the updated rankings were released on Wednesday, Douglas had dropped to 11th while Mica Mountain had improved to ninth and Rio Rico remained seventh. Douglas, headed for the post season playoffs, finishes the regular season 23-5 overall, 9-3 in conference, 8-2 in region. The Bulldogs have a loss to Rio Rico and Mica Mountain. Log In Keep it Clean.

enhanced penalties for those convicted of multiple counts of retail theft. PHOENIX – Saying thieves pay attention, a state lawmaker and a prosecutor are moving to enhance the penalty against those who engage in multiple incidents of organized retail theft. HB 2435 would allow judges to sentence someone who has a record of at least two prior convictions to 4.5 years in state prison. Maricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell said the current penalty is just 2.5 years. “I have seen, time and time again, that criminals pay attention to sentences and trends within the criminal justice system,” she said Tuesday. “And word does spread among them.” Mitchell said that includes people who come from other states, where such crimes may not be pursued and those arrested are released without bail. “These are groups that work together,” she said. “So word will spread and it will be effective.” Pima County Attorney Laura Conover said she agrees that retail theft has become a big problem in her community and across the nation. It has become more visible as shoppers not only face higher prices but also often find that the goods they want are now locked behind glass shelves, requiring them to find a staffer. And in some communities, stores that have been victimized have been shuttered. But Conover said she is not convinced that tinkering with sentencing laws is the solution. The key, she said, is focusing attention on those “professionally minded criminals,” the ones buying and trafficking in those stolen items from the thieves who have taken them from the stores. “We have to use our precious resources with higher level investigations that get at those who are profiting off of the problem,” said Conover. “And we have the penalties that we need to send them away for quite some time.” What that includes, she said, is the ability to prosecute them for being involved in fraudulent schemes. That is a Class 2 felony which, in the case of repetitive offenders, can mean anywhere from 5 to more than 15 years in prison. More to the point, Conover said she disagrees with the contention that a 4.5 year sentence for those who are doing the stealing in the first place will make a difference, particularly in cases where those who are doing the theft are driven by mental health or substance-abuse disorders. She said the only way to actually disrupt what's going on is “getting at the root causes.” “It doesn't matter if you send this person (to prison) for two years or four years,” Conover said. “There's no treatment in prison,” she continued. “So they either come out, in two years or four years, in a worse place or in worse shape. And we've done nothing but pay top dollar and burned that taxpayer dollar.” Still, she said, people who are arrested repeatedly and “are not getting with the program” are already facing felony charges. Mitchell said she has a different view of those who are engaged in retail theft. And the key, she said, is that in order to be convicted of this crime they have to be found guilty of having an intent to resell what they have stolen. “This goes back to debunking the false narrative that is out there that the people that we're looking at are people who are just shoplifters who are shoplifting single items in order to support themselves, feed themselves,” Mitchell said. “That is not what is happening here,” she said. “What is happening is these people are targeting stores and taking either large quantities or items with large resale values like alcohol or cosmetics and they are sending it to a fence.” And those proceeds, said Mitchell, go into what she called “the stream of criminal commerce which includes funding all sorts of other criminal activities.” Michelle Ahlmer, executive director of the Arizona Retailers Association, which got House Speaker Ben Toma to sponsor the legislation, said all this is different than shoplifting. That is a separate crime, with the penalty based on the value of the stolen items. So, for example, someone found guilty of lifting something worth less than $1,000 could be sentenced under laws making that a misdemeanor, carrying six months in the county jail with a possible $500 fine. Steal something worth more than that and the presumptive sentence is a year in state prison. “We actually have resources, in some cases, where we can help them,” Ahlmer said. But this, she said, is different. “This is an organized retail crime, you can even go so far as to say syndicate,” Ahlmer said. “We have apprehended people who have shopping lists, who are told not to steal above a certain level because they will have a higher felony. This is not your average person walking in and putting something in their purse and walking out.” Ahlmer said there's a reason this kind of theft has blossomed. “The burgeoning effect has happened because certain states, certain communities have turned a blind eye to prosecuting,” she said. “And we are lucky that in Arizona we are lucky that we don't have that situation thanks to Rachel Mitchell and some of the other support we've had throughout the state.” Ahlmer and Conover do agree on one thing: Any retailer who sees this going on should not try to detain a suspected thief. “We do not apprehend,” said Ahlmer. “That is for the safety of our staff and the safety of our consumers,” she said. “We don't want anyone to get in the middle of a conflict.” Instead, she said, incidents can be pursued later with evidence from cameras. Conover sees it through the lens of what she calls “ongoing threat of harm.” “We are perhaps less concerned by a corporation losing $20 of food or what have you than we are the person that is told to leave the property and, instead of leaving the property turns around and is very aggressive back on the employee,” she said. And Conover said that law enforcement is more focused on that kind of assault than the underlying theft. The legislation is awaiting a hearing in front of the House Commerce Committee.

A $1.7 million project to install an elevator, and construct a new entryway, has begun at the Oro Valley Community and Recreation Center. The town of Oro Valley “is thrilled” to announce the start of work by Barker Contracting Inc., which installed construction fencing at the 10555 N. La Cañada facility the week of Jan. 8. Completion is expected in October. “We are committed to creating a space where everyone can fully participate in the many activities available at the CRC, and this elevator will make a much better user experience,” said Paul Keesler, Oro Valley public works director. When it’s done, the building will have a new entrance to the Overlook Restaurant, the golf pro shop and other community rooms. The entryway is being lowered several feet for enhanced accessibility, with the elevator to be installed nearby. Construction requires a temporary closure of the restaurant entrance, the town release said. While the Overlook Restaurant remains open during the work, access is being temporarily rerouted to the ramp near the loading dock through Monday, Sept. 30. Visitors to the facility can find wayfinding signage during construction. Last March, the Oro Valley Town Council gave unanimous approval to allot $1.75 million for the project, long sought by people with disabilities and their advocates. “The physically challenged people in our community will now have a facility they can easily use,” resident Jim Horn said in email. “Seniors will now feel comfortable entering and leaving the building. ... It was a long time in coming, too long, too many missed opportunities, but that’s behind us now, and many physically challenged people will feel a sense of relief that the new entrance will be finished.” For years, people with physical challenges have used a side ramp, walking or rolling past garbage dumpsters, to access the building, which was the El Conquistador Country Club before the town acquired it in 2015. Inside, those guests have encountered further obstacles to reach the bar, restaurant, golf, meeting space and other facilities.

time for many students, leading to mental health issues like anxiety, burnout, self-doubt and depression. By embracing different outlets, like joining a club or investing time into a hobby, college students can combat negative feelings, cultivating a sense of accomplishment and belonging. When students feel overwhelmed with classes, finding a club or extracurricular activity can be the key to having a better time while pursuing a degree. A 2023 study conducted by the National Library of Medicine shows roughly 60% of college students suffer burnout throughout college. However, participating in extracurricular activities can prevent academic exhaustion for some students. Around campus, there are many clubs where students can surround themselves with like-minded individuals. Joining a club can be a daunting experience, due to a fear of trying new things or meeting new people, but the payoff for breaking out of your shell can yield results of lifelong friends or a new passion. Participating in extracurricular activities can positively affect a student’s mood and attitude toward their college experience. Young adults and teens gain a sense of community from clubs and organizations, which leads to a positive outlook on life overall. With many on-campus opportunities at their fingertips, students can find an organization that sparks their interest and helps them take care of their mental health. There is no right or wrong answer as to what activities a student should take part in. Experimenting with clubs offers a chance for students to throw themselves into one of the many extracurriculars offered on campus. This includes, but is not limited to, music, games, religion or any special interest a student may have. Learning something new can be critical to improving self-esteem and morale in general by allowing a student to surround themselves with people they feel comfortable with as opposed to people they have to be around, such as in class. NAU’s extracurricular options can provide hope for students struggling with mental health issues. While these activities provide students with an outlet other than classwork, they also help reinforce academic skills and are proven to increase grades by developing better habits and an improved routine. I have seen many of my peers dedicate their whole college experience to taking classes rather than trying new activities outside of school. I was one of those students afflicted with debilitating burnout, trapped in a cycle of the same classes every day. While I did like my classes, I needed something different to add to my routine. I went out looking for an extracurricular that could change how I felt, which led me to wanting a relationship with God and involving myself with the church. I decided to show up at the Newman Center and immediately made strong connections with the people working there. It was a surreal experience to be welcomed with open arms by people I didn't even know. I connected with the priest, and since then, I’ve gained a sense of community I never thought I’d find. Although my experience may differ from others on campus, getting involved in any extracurricular is a good starting point when wanting to improve mental health. NAU students fortunately have many options for non-academic activities on campus. Getting more involved can drastically improve students’ mental health and connect them with meaningful communities.

In some of the other sections of work there could be. That area south of Soldiers Pass is where they’re setting up their yard … all their construction equipment is being staged there.” The project will replace approximately eight miles of water mains, some of which have been in place since the 1960s, at an estimated cost of $16.1 million. “We’re right in the beginning stages, so there’s going to be a lot more to come,” Butler said. “As minimally invasive as it is, the style of work that they’re doing on the lines, there’s still a disruption to all the people in the neighborhoods. There’s no way of getting around that, but that everybody’s doing the best they can as far as notifying.” The first phase of construction, which was completed this week, included the construction of two new arsenic removal systems and the refurbishment of three storage tanks off Panorama Boulevard and two tanks on Airport Mesa. Mains replacement work will begin on Willow Way, followed by Yule Avenue, Birch Boulevard, Oak Creek Boulevard and Inspirational Drive, although the work order may change as the project progresses. Butler estimated that crews will need between four and eight weeks to complete pipe replacement. The mains replacement will affect 751 accounts, including 553 single-family residences, 46 multi-family residences and 152 commercial, industrial or institutional properties. “There will be water outages,” Butler said. “We have an alert system that will notify all of our residents. Anybody that goes on our website and signs up for alerts … If I have to make a repair on a street, I send out an alert that they’re going to be affected [at a given] address … We’ll notify them ahead of time that they’ll be out of water and it shouldn’t be more than a few hours to get it turned over to the other line. Everyone will have water through the construction, aside from the time when the water gets switched over to a different line.” Representatives from contractor Summit Construction have been going door-to-door to notify residents about the project and flyers will be mailed to homeowners a few weeks before construction work is due to start on their street. “Approximately 75% of the project will be completed by pipe bursting,” the project summary stated. “This technique will allow the lines to be replaced in their current locations and will decrease the need for a great deal of open trenching.” The Environmental Protection Agency’s water technology fact sheet on pipe bursting explains that it is “a method by which the existing pipe is opened and forced outward by a bursting tool. A hydraulic or pneumatic expansion head [that is] part of the bursting tool is pulled through the existing pipeline … As the expansion head is pulled through the existing pipe, it pushes that pipe outward until it breaks apart, creating a space for the new pipe. The bursting device also pulls the new pipeline behind it, immediately filling the void created by the old pipe with the new pipe.” “The old pipe is left in place and works almost like a protective sleeve,” Butler elaborated. Fire Hydrants The project will replace 42 fire hydrants, while nine existing ones will be connected to a new water main. Butler said existing hydrants have been leaking due to age but did not have an estimate of the amount of water lost. “It’ll improve the water flow and capacity of that area,” SFD Fire Marshal Dori Booth said. “We’ll have more water available from the fire hydrants that are there. Then replacing existing hydrants with new hydrants and even adding in a couple. That reduces the distance between hydrants [which] will help improve the capabilities of [SFD] by having less of a supply line to create in the event of a fire. It’s helpful all the way around. Then also with improved infrastructure like these water projects, it also improves our [insurance] rating, which is what insurance looks at to help determine rates for homeowners. So as the water supply increases, then it goes into a factor of things that the insurance companies look at to help determine the cost of homeowner’s insurance.” Once new valves are installed, the number of homes affected by outages during repairs is expected to decrease. “When I make a repair, when there’s a water leak and someone’s out of water, I have to dig it up and fix it,” Butler said. “A lot of times every 500 feet, there’s a valve, and when we [turn] off a couple houses of water, these valves are [often] not working, they’re so old. And I have to expand that scope to include sometimes two or three streets and turn everybody off of water to make a small repair.” In spite of the age of the water mains, Butler said, there have been no issues with water quality. “We’ve upgraded our meter system too, so the old meters have been replaced with new digital e-series meters that also have the ability to transmit the consumption via cell phone towers,” Butler added. “Instead of reading the meter physically by hand, it’s all done through a software interface that gets all that data collected, then that communicates to the billing software.” “The airport’s master plan shows the airport supporting certain development and there was never a consideration for fire suppression of water for that development,” airport manager Ed Rose said of his current system, which has an 88,000-gallon capacity. “I’m working on trying to secure increased storage capacity here [at] the airport. I’ll need probably 150,000 gallons of additional water as a ballpark [estimate] and a delivery system, a spine of water to run to the mesa so it can be tapped into.” Residents can sign up for email or text alerts to receive information about work schedules and possible outages at oakcreekwater.ruralwaterusa.com.

Please give us a call at (928) 774-4545 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy NAJAF, Iraq (AP) — Militants loyal to radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr kept their hold on a revered shrine, and clashes flared in Najaf on Saturday, raising fears that a resolution to the crisis in the holy city could collapse amid bickering between Shiite leaders. An unofficial mediator pleaded with al-Sadr to disarm his militants, pull them out of the shrine and disband his militia immediately."" We are in a race with time,"" said Hussein al-Sadr, a distant relative of the cleric. Clashes between U.S. troops and al-Sadr fighters were brief but heavy, punctuated by gunfire and explosions, with one blast hitting the street 50 yards from the Imam Ali Shrine at the center of the standoff. Marine Capt. Carrie Batson said U.S. troops came under mortar attack in the Old City and destroyed two militant mortar positions with gunfire and an Apache helicopter attack. The fighting died down after about 45 minutes, returning the city to the relative calm that it has seen. Still, the flare-up reflected the danger that peace efforts could fall apart once again, mired in last-minute delays. Al-Sadr\'s Mahdi Army militia still held the Imam Ali Shrine, their stronghold throughout this month\'s fighting, and while it has agreed to hand it over to Shiite religious authorities, the two sides were squabbling over how to do so. Meanwhile Saturday, a series of attacks targeting U.S. and Iraqi forces across the country killed a U.S. soldier, a Polish soldier and five Iraqis. Militants have been using car bombs, assassinations, sabotage, kidnappings and other attacks in a 16-month insurgency aimed at destabilizing the country. The violence in Najaf, which had spread to other Shiite communities, posed the greatest risk to the interim government of Prime Minister Ayad Allawi. Government officials had threatened to raid the mosque to set an example to other insurgent groups, but such an operation risked turning the nation\'s majority Shiites against the government. The crisis appeared on the verge of resolution Friday, when insurgents decided to remove their weapons from the shrine and said they were willing to turn the holy site over to representatives of Iraq\'s top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Husseini al-Sistani. Then, the handover bogged down Saturday amid arguments over its implementation. Al-Sadr\'s followers said they tried to give the shrine\'s keys to al-Sistani\'s representatives, who refused to accept them. But an aide to al-Sistani — who is in London undergoing medical treatment — said al-Sadr\'s followers must leave the holy shrine\'s compound, ""close the doors and hand over the keys."" ""We cannot receive the shrine compound unless they agree to this formula,"" said the aide, Sheik Hamed Khafaf. Sheik Ali Smeisim, al-Sadr\'s chief lieutenant, said the militants would not leave until a delegation from al-Sistani\'s office inspects the shrine to ensure its treasures are intact, so they could not be accused of taking anything. Khafaf said the violence precludes such a delegation. In a hastily called news conference in Baghdad on Saturday evening, Hussein al-Sadr, who had headed a peace delegation to Najaf earlier in the week, appealed to the militants to end the standoff ""to keep the sanctity of our holy sites, to ease the suffering of Najaf and to quiet the situation."" He asked al-Sadr himself to send him a handwritten letter with his response, which he promised to relay to the government. ""I call on Muqtada al-Sadr — and all our brothers and sisters — to understand the depth of this crisis,"" he said. The standoff has frustrated many in Najaf, who have suffered cuts in their water and electricity, had their streets rocked by explosions and seen scores of their neighbors killed since the fighting started Aug. 5. ""All parties are stalling,"" said Saeed Mohammed, 41. ""There has been no change, only more shelling and clashes that have hurt the city even more."" The proposed handover of the shrine to religious authorities offered a face-saving way to end the fighting, allowing Iraq\'s interim government to keep its pledge not to negotiate and the militants to say they had not capitulated. As the crisis continued, al-Sadr aide Sheik Awas al-Khafaji said Saturday that kidnappers had lifted their threat to kill a U.S. journalist abducted in the southern city of Nasiriyah along with his Iraqi translator Aug. 13. The kidnappers, calling themselves the Martyrs Brigade, threatened Thursday to kill Micah Garen, 36, of New York, within 48 hours if U.S. troops did not leave Najaf. Al-Khafaji said Saturday that mediators told him the death threat had been removed and they were working for Garen\'s release. ""We hope that he will be released today and our efforts would be fruitful,"" he said Saturday. ""As for the Iraqi translator, we have received assurances that he is going to be released with the journalist."" Also Saturday, coalition forces arrested Maj. Gen. Jaadan Mohammed al-Alwan, the police chief of volatile Anbar province, accusing him of corruption and criminal activity, including extortion, embezzlement and accepting bribes, the U.S. military said in a statement. Al-Alwan also has possible connections with kidnapping and murder, the military said. Al-Alwan\'s arrest was authorized by the Iraqi government, and he is to be replaced by an interim chief to be appointed by the governor, the statement said. Violence continued Saturday elsewhere across Iraq: —Insurgents bombed an oil pipeline in Berjisiya, 20 miles southwest of the southern city of Basra, setting it ablaze, said Lt. Mohammed al-Mousawi of the Iraqi National Guard. The pipeline had been closed for a week due to threats, and the attack did not appear likely to effect exports. —Attackers fired a rocket-propelled grenade at a U.S. military vehicle in Baghdad, killing one soldier and wounding two others, the military said. As of Friday, 949 U.S. service members have died since the beginning of military operations here in March 2003, according to the U.S. Defense Department. —A Polish soldier was killed and six more were injured when a car bomb exploded near their convoy outside the city of Hillah, 60 miles south of Baghdad; Polish troops exchanged gunfire with the insurgents, killing some of them, Maj. Krzysztof Plazuk said. The death brought to 10 the number of Polish soldiers killed in Iraq. — An Iraqi National Guard soldier was killed and two guardsmen and three civilians were wounded when a bomb exploded in the northern city of Mosul, a guard official said. — Assailants detonated a roadside bomb after a U.S. convoy drove by in Baqouba, 35 miles outside of Baghdad, killing two civilians and injuring four, a hospital official said. A separate roadside bomb exploded in Sabtiya, near Baqouba, after a U.S. convoy passed, killing a street cleaner and wounding another Iraqi. — In Ramadi, 70 miles west of Baghdad, gunmen shot dead Lt. Col. Saad Smayer, a senior police officer, as he left home for work, police said. — Arizona Daily Sun Have any questions? Please give us a call at (928) 774-4545 Have any questions?

David Murphy, 64, was the driver of the vehicle from which authorities seized two pounds of methamphetamine in south Mohave County. Authorities were tracking the Murphy vehicle by cellphone before the Oct. 26, 2023 traffic stop in the 1800 block of U.S. 93 in the vicinity of Wikieup. After previously pleading guilty to transportation of dangerous drugs for sale, Murphy made a Jan. 30 appearance for sentencing before Judge Doug Camacho. ``I apologize to the Court your Honor for my actions,” Murphy said. ``This is a life sentence for me, but I did wrong. That’s all I have to say.” Camacho ordered a 7.5-year prison term. Judge Billy Sipe on Jan. 9 rejected a plea deal proposed for case co-defendant, Manya Bock, Murphy’s neighbor and a passenger in the suspect vehicle hauling drugs back to Kingman. Bock, 50, Kingman, was to receive a five-year prison term under the proposal. Judge Sipe rejected the deal, unwilling to accept the sentencing limitation while thinking Bock deserves more time behind bars for the drug offense and its commission while she was on probation for an unrelated burglary. — Dave Hawkins, Special to Today’s News-Herald Log In Keep it Clean.

Please give us a call at 520-625-5511 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy Assistant Editor The Town of Sahuarita found significant support for a single contracted garbage collection service among residents who responded to a survey last fall. The town this week reported 66% of 723 respondents selected “very supportive” to the question, followed by 19% at “somewhat supportive”; 6% “neutral”; 5% “very unsupportive”; and 3% choosing “do not support.” Sahuarita’s population was 35,638 as of July 2022, the latest U.S. Census figures available. At four people per household, the survey reached about 12 percent of the town\'s population, assuming just one person per household answered the survey. Madera Highlands, a planned community in Sahuarita, moved to one trash hauling company in 2018 despite pushback from many residents. But not all households made the move to Republic Services, and several residents are are still served by other companies. The town said the fall survey screened respondents’ location, ensuring they lived in Sahuarita. The 12-week survey closed Nov. 17. While the survey found significant support for community-wide contracted service, it also found 32% of respondents were “satisfied” with their current service, followed by 27% selecting “neutral” and 22% saying they were “very satisfied.” The survey found low responses for residents unhappy with their current service, with 13% selecting “dissatisfied” and 6% choosing “very dissatisfied.” The town also reported Sahuarita residents pay $13 to $23 more per month for solid waste service than other Arizona municipalities with organized collection. The town listed nine jurisdictions ranging from populations of less than 10,000 to some with slightly more than 100,000 residents. The most similar sized community, El Mirage in the Phoenix metro area with about 36,000 people, has monthly rates of $18.52 compared to Sahuarita residents’ $38.38. The results are part of a larger discussion that will go before the council with no date set yet, a town spokeswoman said. In October, Sahuarita Public Works Director Galo Galovale told the Green Valley News and Sahuarita Sun the survey marked the first steps into gauging what residents want and possible future solid waste collection options. The town doesn’t have a dedicated solid waste department, leaving residents to rely on multiple private trash collection companies providing service within the same neighborhoods and traveling the same roads. At the time, Galovale said the wear and tear on streets was a major concern for the town. ""We\'re seeing pavement failure because of the heavy truckloads,"" he said. ""So, we\'re just trying to see how we can make sure that we\'re not spending a lot of our HURF funds in those kinds of repairs — making sure that we have our infrastructure in good shape."" Counties and municipalities receive shares of Highway User Revenue Funds, HURF, from the state. During the survey, Galovale said the town was in the research phase of improving solid waste collection, saying the results could bring no changes; discussing the findings with current providers; or taking a plan for an in-depth study of a single-provider service to the Town Council.

Two days after delivering her second State of the State address to launch the legislative year, Gov. Katie Hobbs came to the West Valley on Jan. 10. She spoke before a crowd of around 600 at the Phoenix Raceway during a WESTMARC-sponsored luncheon event for fellow elected officials, community leaders and media. Avondale Mayor Kenn Weise kicked things off, thanking the governor for her continued efforts to work with West Valley communities. After being introduced by WESTMARC President and CEO Sintra Hoffman and Phoenix Raceway President Latasha Causey, Hobbs gave her 35-minute speech. She began by summarizing the main issues she wanted to address, including securing the southern border, creating more jobs for working-class residents, dealing with the housing crisis, preserving Arizona’s water future, ensuring the quality and safety of schools, and making sure health care remains accessible to those who need it. The first issue Hobbs discussed was what she described as the “failure” of the federal government in securing the southern border. “When my fellow Arizonans gave me the honor of this office, I pledged to not play the same old political games that created this crisis and that have continually hurt communities, families and our state,” Hobbs said. She went on to detail how her administration took the “extraordinary step” of sending the National Guard for additional security following the closing of the Lukeville port of entry. In addition to awarding $84 million to help border communities manage the influx of migrants, Hobbs mentioned the creation of Operation SECURE within the Arizona Department of Homeland Security. “This session, I’m seeking ongoing funding to better coordinate our border response and continue fighting this humanitarian, economic and enforcement crisis. This new funding will expand the Operation with critical investments in border security, as well as resources to intercept the flow of fentanyl,” Hobbs said. The governor discussed the Arizona job market strength — saying that more residents were employed than at any point in the state’s history. Arizona also attracted more than $32 billion in foreign investment. “That $32 billion means jobs, jobs and more jobs for working people in Arizona. We created over 56,000 jobs in 2023. And we’re just getting started,” Hobbs said. As a magnet for high-tech and manufacturing businesses, she attested that Arizona leads the way in “building our nation’s future.” Hobbs also discussed how employment programs like Future48 and the BuilditAZ Apprenticeship Initiative are helping ready residents to fulfill jobs in those industries. “With our investments in Future48 workforce accelerators, we will prepare thousands of Arizonans every year for jobs building our nation’s future in industries like semiconductors, renewable energy, and aerospace and defense,” Hobbs said. Just as she highlighted the state’s strong job market, the governor didn’t shy away from addressing the ongoing housing affordability crisis. “Our housing affordability crisis has erased feelings of prosperity for too many,” Hobbs said. She said her administration worked to alleviate the pressure on Arizonans in 2023. “This past year, I worked with many here to find new and effective ways to address this issue,” Hobbs said. “We directed $150 million to keep more Arizonans housed through rental assistance programs, allocated money to provide access to legal aid for up to 1 million more Arizonans who are facing eviction or housing instability, and made a historic investment to create more housing that’s actually affordable for middle-class families.” This included the unveiling of the Arizona is Home Mortgage Assistance Program. “This program will help working-class families throughout the state with down payment assistance and mortgage interest rate relief,” Hobbs said. “That means a family of four living in Phoenix making up to $75,000 a year will have the opportunity to purchase a quality, affordable home.” Hobbs discussed the hot-button issue of Arizona’s water future. While the state currently uses less water per year than in the mid-1950s, she urged the audience that this was no time to relax. Those in violation of their water privileges need to be held accountable and Arizona must work collaboratively — within and outside the state — to ensure our water future is secure. “There is no better example of this than the agreement I negotiated earlier this year with our neighbors, Nevada and California, to conserve at least 3 million acre-feet of water — enough for 9 million homes — by 2026,” Hobbs said. She touted the agreement as both standing up to the federal government and safeguarding Arizona’s natural resources. Hobbs then moved on to discuss the state of Arizona’s education system. She applauded efforts by legislators for the passage of the Aggregate Expenditure Limit, which promised to keep schools open and students learning. “In addition to the AEL override, we also worked together to find bipartisan solutions to further support our public schools — including a $300 million infusion for K-12 schools,” Hobbs said. She also insisted on raises for teachers, improving school safety, addressing abuse of the state’s Empowerment Scholarship Account program and the expansion of university medical schools for the next generation of health care professionals. WESTMARC Board of Directors poses with Gov. Katie Hobbs at the Phoenix Raceway. The governor wrapped up her address with an overview of the state’s health care system. This included putting into place support systems for families dealing with childhood illness. “No family should have to go bankrupt to care for a sick child,” Hobbs said. “To combat this disturbing trend, we expanded KidsCare eligibility for thousands of Arizona children — enabling them to receive the care they need whether it’s routine checkups or lifesaving procedures without forcing their parents into mountains of debt or heartbreaking GoFundMe campaigns.” Part of this also included driving down the price of prescription drugs.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 12:29 pm The Governor’s Office of Highway Safety recently awarded the Peoria Police Department $189,721 in grants to help increase DUI enforcement, traffic enforcement and education in and around Peoria. Each of the grants allows the department to conduct additional enforcement throughout the fiscal year by participating in saturation patrols and selective traffic enforcement details focusing on speeding, red-light running and DUI enforcement. In addition, some of these grants will allow the Peoria Police Department to purchase equipment that will assist in the reconstruction of serious injury and fatal collision investigations. The department will use $42,827 of the grant funds to continue to improve the enforcement of traffic safety laws intended to reduce death, injury, property damage and promote roadway safety, along with deterring aggressive and distracted drivers. The funds will also provide for continuing education that increases the public’s awareness associated with the dangers of speeding and aggressive/distracted driving, as well as continue to provide training and updates on traffic laws to officers. The department will utilize $83,240 of the grant funds to reduce impaired driving, which is a high-priority objective for Arizona. Effective enforcement is an essential countermeasure to reducing DUI offenses and the deadly crashes that can be associated with impaired drivers. Driving while under the influence can carry a hefty price tag, including criminal and legal expenses, property damage and, more importantly, death. Peoria will use $22,309 of the grant funds to promote motorcycle safety in and around the city. This funding will allow Peoria police motorcycle officers to provide instruction to intermediate riders and further promote safe riding habits. Two motorcycle safety courses will be offered for free to the riding public this year. Officers will continue to address motorcycle safety through education and enforcement utilizing these funds. Peoria police will utilize $35,313 to help increase pedestrian, school zone, school bus and bicycle safety in the city. This funding will allow Peoria police officers to focus their time on making the roadways safe for pedestrians. The Peoria Police Department plans to utilize grant funding for overtime enforcement and provide educational awareness about the traffic laws and safety rules in these areas. This grant will also allow the department to continue its Bicycle Safety Partnership by providing instruction to grade school students as well as hosting multiple Bicycle Safety Rodeos throughout the city. The final $6,032 will go toward purchasing equipment and training on it regarding the reconstruction of serious injury and fatal traffic collisions. This evidence is an essential part of the reconstruction and helps investigators better understand the circumstances that led up to and had an aspect in the collision. This funding will allow Peoria police officers to provide a multi-faceted approach to traffic safety through education, deterrence and aggressive enforcement of our state traffic and DUI laws.
