The victim is believed to be a 10-year-old occupant of the home; however, as of late Tuesday, fire officials had not officially released the name of the girl who perished in the blaze.

The investigation is continuing and investigators are looking at all possible accidental causes.” Approximately 75 volunteer firefighters battled the two-alarm blaze for about one hour, before bringing it under control, fire officials reported. The blaze displaced four adults and a 13-year-old — the victim’s surviving family members — at 317 Willow Dr., according to fire officials. It also displaced three adults and three children who lived at 319 Willow Dr., fire officials said. In addition, the fire displaced two adults and four children at 315 Willow Dr., fire officials added. The American Red Cross is assisting the 17 displaced residents, the spokesman reported. As of Tuesday, MOSFM detectives continued their investigation to pinpoint where the deadly blaze started and to determine what caused it, according to fire officials, who further reported, “Investigators have been unable to locate working smoke alarms in the home.

Sanderlin/Baltimore Sun The Orioles scoreboard announces the 30-year lease agreement that will keep the team in Baltimore shows Governor Wes Moore and Orioles Chairman and CEO John Angelos applauding in Angelos' box during a game against the Boston Red Sox on September 28, 2023. Karl Merton Ferron/Baltimore Sun Maryland Governor Wes Moore, left, and Orioles Chairman and CEO John Angelos are seen in the suite after the announcement of a new 30-year lease of the stadium that will keep the Orioles in Baltimore during a game against the Boston Red Sox on September 28, 2023. It seemed like the perfect moment at the perfect time. Just after the third inning Thursday night at Camden Yards, the Orioles were up 1-0 against the Boston Red Sox and widely expected to clinch the American League East title before a jubilant crowd, when Gov. Wes Moore and Orioles Chairman/CEO John Angelos — side by side and applauding — suddenly appeared on the stadium’s video board. Beneath the two men was a statement that seemed to bring even more good baseball news.In all caps, it said the team, the governor, the state and the Maryland Stadium authority had that very day, after three years of frustrating negotiation, “AGREED TO A DEAL THAT WILL KEEP THE ORIOLES IN BALTIMORE AND AT CAMDEN YARDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 30 YEARS!!”Neither side would discuss it that night but promised details the next morning. Unfortunately, the scoreboard claim didn’t stand up to the light of day.At a news briefing Friday morning, where journalists were told they couldn’t quote anyone by name, state officials confirmed that no actual lease had been finalized. Instead, a memorandum of understanding — containing no legally enforceable promises — had been signed expressing a commitment to an eventual 30-year lease and various other provisions. In other words, they’d agreed to agree at some point in the future, while the clock for the expiration of the current lease on Dec. 31 keeps ticking.Isn’t that what they’ve been doing for the past three years? What makes this any different?Could it be that they were so swept up in Oriole Magic they felt compelled to exchange the sports-world version of promise rings? Or maybe they didn’t want the playoffs to be marred by constant speculation about whether the Orioles would really, really stay in Baltimore. We have so many questions (including these: Why not just let the team’s clinch be the big news of the day? Why make it about you?).To be fair, everyone expressed a lot of commitment to one another during the news briefing, with senior representatives from both the state and the team saying they expect a 30-year lease deal to be struck any day now (though they acknowledged there’s an option to extend for a year or two if that doesn’t occur, as was done after the first 30-year lease expired in 2021).In response to an editorial board question, administration officials said they chose to sign and announce an MOU because a lot of the “key parameters” are in place and “there’s been a lot of interest [in and questions about] where we are and what’s happening.” They wanted “to be able to share that news,” they said. We’re happy they’ve started to see the value in transparency, given that both sides have been clammed up tight when it comes to lease talks. But they didn’t need an MOU to tell us what’s going on. And an MOU does not guarantee a future for the O’s in Baltimore, no matter how many times officials say it does. That’s like trying to convince your grandma that living together is as good as marriage; it’s a story full of holes.This might all feel like nitpicking at a time when we should be celebrating. The Orioles won the AL East for the first time in nine years. On the same night, they won their 100th game of the season — the last time that happened was 1980. They’re headed for the playoffs, for crying out loud. They’ve been a joy to watch and have done our city proud.

(Frank Ockenfels/AMC via AP) Marylanders who watched the series premiere of AMC’s “Feed the Beast” may have seen a familiar local face.Ten-year-old Elijah Jacob of Catonsville made his television debut in the show, which stars David Schwimmer and Jim Sturgess. The show premiered Sunday, June 5, and will regularly air Tuesdays at 10 p.m. on AMC.“Feed the Beast” is about two best friends, played by Schwimmer and Sturgess, who try to realize their dream of opening a restaurant.Elijah plays the role of TJ Moran, the son of Schwimmer’s character, Tommy Moran. TJ had witnessed the death of his mother in a hit-and-run accident; he frequently uses a sketch book to draw his memories of what happened to her, Elijah said. He appears in all 10 episodes of the first season, he said.“He’s just trying to basically get over it and move on with his life,” he said. “But he can’t because it was such a big hit on his life.”Acting is fairly new for the Westchester Elementary School fifth-grader. When he was 6, he started modeling, but by the time he was 9, he realized he wanted to change gears and give acting a try. He started by taking part in commercials. Most actors get their start that way, he said.He likes the idea of playing roles he never would have been himself.As he did commercials, he started auditioning for television shows. His agent and manager told him about the audition for the role of TJ Moran. “I felt like I could play that role, and as an actor you want to be challenged in some things,” he said. “I felt like that was my role where I could be challenged. My manager believed in me and my agent believed in me, and I just went for it and eventually I got it.”The show filmed from February to May in Queens, New York, Elijah said. He balanced his school and his job by having a tutor on set. And while he caught up in his schoolwork, being on set gave him a different kind of education.Elijah described Schwimmer, whose resume includes “Friends” and “The People Vs. O.J. Simpson,” as a mentor who helped him understand scenes and how he should be thinking. Sturgess, in addition to helping out Elijah, was someone he would joke around and hang out with — the veteran of such films as “Across the Universe” and “Cloud Atlas” taught him how to play guitar, a craft Elijah wants to continue learning, moving forward.“It was the best first big experience on a TV show I could really ask for,” he said. “Everybody was willing to help.”Elijah’s mother, Carly Eutsler, accompanied him in New York and said he fit in well with the cast and crew.Everyone on set “taught him so many things that no school in the world could teach him because he’s learning firsthand as he’s doing it,” she said. “Just how kind they were to him and teaching a young actor and wanting him to succeed struck every chord with me.”When the show premiered, Elijah was satisfied with his performance.“I like to watch myself act, but I’m a critic of myself,” he said. “As the show went on I feel like I became a better actor, so I expect more of myself sometimes.”The experience was one that inspired Elijah to continue acting.

criminal trial scheduled to begin in March, but legal appeals threaten that date Former President Donald Trump speaks during a break in his civil business fraud trial at New York Supreme Court on Oct. 25, 2023. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) Associated Press//December 14, 2023// Donald Trump’s 2020 election interference case in Washington once appeared likely to be the first of the former president’s criminal trials to begin, with the judge having scheduled a March 4 start date. But appeals of issues central to the case are threatening to change that. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan on Wednesday put the case on hold while Trump pursues his claim in higher courts that he is immune from prosecution. Chutkan raised the possibility of keeping the March date if the case promptly returns to her court, but it is possible the appeal could tie up the case for months. Potentially further complicating prosecutors’ effort to go to trial swiftly is the Supreme Court’s review of an obstruction charge used against Trump and hundreds of his supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump’s lawyers have made clear that their legal strategy involves pushing his trial off until after the 2024 election and they could use the Supreme Court’s involvement to try to further delay the case. Trump is the current front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. A look at the legal issues complicating the trial date and the potential political ramifications: WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE OBSTRUCTION CHARGE? Trump is charged, as are more than 300 people accused of participating in the Capitol riot, with obstruction of an official proceeding, which refers to the joint session of Congress held Jan. 6 to certify Democrat Joe Biden as the winner of the presidential election. The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it would consider a case challenging the use of the obstruction charge against a former police officer who joined the mob at the Capitol. Trump’s lawyers could try to make the argument that Trump’s case cannot go forward until the Supreme Court rules on the scope of the obstruction offense, which potentially could affect both the obstruction charge and a related conspiracy charge against Trump. His team would have to persuade the trial court judge to agree to the pause. At least two other Jan. 6 defendants convicted of the obstruction charge have asked to cancel sentencing hearings scheduled for next week and put them off until after the Supreme Court rules on the issue. Under the Supreme Court’s normal schedule, the justices would not hear arguments on the case until late March or April. David Alan Sklansky, a former federal prosecutor, said he does not think Trump has a good argument for delaying the case while the justices review the obstruction charge. Sklansky, now a professor at Stanford Law School, noted that cases move forward all the time even though they involve laws that are being challenged in other cases. “If the Supreme Court ultimately decided to interpret the statute that’s an issue in that case narrowly, that could affect whether convictions under that statute in Trump’s case would be upheld on appeal,” Sklansky said. But he said: “It would be unusual to delay a trial waiting for the Supreme Court to decide a legal issue of this kind.” WHAT OTHER ISSUES ARE COMPLICATING THE MARCH TRIAL DATE? Immunity. It’s a word and legal concept that will dominate discussion in the courts in the coming weeks. And it could wind up delaying the trial. In addition to taking up the obstruction statute, the Supreme Court is also being asked to consider a question with an even more direct impact on the Trump case. It’s one that never has been tested before the justices: Is a former president immune from federal prosecution? Chutkan rejected the Trump team’s arguments that an ex-president could not be prosecuted over acts that fall within the official duties of the job. After Trump’s lawyers appealed, special counsel Jack Smith’s team sought a quick, once-and-for-all resolution, asking the Supreme Court this week to not only consider that question but to fast-track a decision so the case can continue along the current schedule. The Supreme Court has said it would decide quickly whether or not it will hear the case. In the meantime, Smith’s team also asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to expedite a decision of its own on presidential immunity. That appeals court late Wednesday agreed to expedite the case, setting deadlines for briefs to be filed between Dec. 23 and Jan. 2. But the appeals court has yet to set a date for when it will hear arguments. COULD ANY OF THE OTHER THREE CRIMINAL CASES AGAINST TRUMP REACH TRIAL BEFORE THE ELECTION? It’s possible. The other criminal case brought by Smith charges Trump with illegally hoarding classified documents at his Florida estate and obstructing FBI efforts to get them back. The trial is currently scheduled for May 20. But the judge in that case has pushed back has multiple other deadlines and signaled an openness to revisiting the trial date during a pivotal pretrial conference set for March. A separate case on charges that Trump falsified business records in connection with hush money payments to a porn actress is set to go to trial on March 25 in New York state court, but that date isn’t set in stone either. Judge Juan Manuel Merchan, responding to a Trump team request to postpone that trial, said in September that he would rather stick to the original schedule for now and wait until the next pretrial hearing in February to see if “there are any actual conflicts” requiring a delay. No trial date has been set in Fulton County, Georgia, where the district attorney’s office has charged Trump with trying to subvert that state’s election in 2020. Prosecutors have asked for an August trial date, but his lawyer has said it would amount to “election interference” to stage a trial then. WHY DO THE TRIAL DATES MATTER? The trial dates carry enormous political ramifications. If Trump was the GOP nominee and won election next November, for instance, he presumably could use his authority as head of the executive branch to try to order a new attorney general to dismiss the federal cases or he potentially could seek a pardon for himself — something that’s a legally untested proposition. Smith’s team is looking to secure convictions and sentences in the coming year before that election. Trump, as a private citizen and not an officeholder, possesses no more power or privileges than anyone else under the law. In a recent filing in the election subversion case, Smith’s team said the “public has a strong interest in this case proceeding to trial in a timely manner.” Trump’s team has accused Smith of trying to rush the case through for political reasons. Trump’s lawyers told an appeals court this week that “the prosecution has one goal in this case: To unlawfully attempt to try, convict, and sentence President Trump before an election in which he is likely to defeat President Biden.” Alanna Durkin Richer and Eric Tucker report for The Associated Press.

The weekend will consist of genealogical, educational and networking programs and activities as well as tours to several of the missions “It’s American history,” Southern Maryland Descendant Gathering Steering Committee Chair Julie Hawkins Ennis said during an interview at St. Francis Xavier Church in Newtowne Neck. “I’m African American, but we didn’t even know this history. It’s not here to hurt anybody. I’s not here to say anybody’s less or better. It’s Black history that people need to know. We need to learn from it.” On Nov. 13, 1838, Jesuit missions in St. Mary’s, Charles and Prince George’s counties sold 272 enslaved persons to Louisiana plantations in Terrebonne, Iberville and Ascension parishes. The enslaved, who were forced to work various jobs such as farming, housekeeping, gardening and cooking for the churches, were sold for $115,000 (about $3.5 million today) to help the Catholic church support what was then Georgetown College, which Ennis said was “failing economically.” “It was an eye-opener because being a Black Catholic, and especially my grandmother who was a devout Catholic,” Hawkins Ennis said. “We would never think that priests not only had enslaved, but also sold them.” The enslaved were taken to a holding cell in Alexandria, Va., and then shipped south aboard the Katherine Jackson. But not every priest was in favor of the plan. The Rev. Joseph Carbery of St. Inigoes told his 23-year-old cook, Louisa Mahoney-Mason, and her mother, Anna, to hide in the woods and later bought her back for just over $600. “She was a very faithful woman and well recognized in the community,” Southern Maryland Descendant Gathering Steering Committee Co-Chair Henrietta Pike said of Louisa, who is Pike’s two-time great-grandmother. One of the reunion tours is scheduled for St. Ignatius in St. Inigoes, where Mahoney-Mason was employed. “I’ll get to stand on the same ground that she cooked in,” Pike said. The story was unearthed by students at Georgetown University in 2016 when an embarkment list for the Katherine Jackson was discovered. The project was named GU272 in honor of the number of enslaved people who were sold. “We lost family,” Hawkins Ennis said, “and we had no clue they were even out there.” Ennis said the organization has found more than 10,000 descendants “and the list is growing.” They include doctors, actors and musicians, such as Kanye West, whose father recently owned a water cafe in Lexington Park. “The goal of this is to find all the people who were left behind to connect all of us together,” Pike said.

It has been published weekly without interruption since that time and is delivered free to most Greenbelt residents. Kalen J. Wright, a Greenbelt News Review paper carrier since the sixth grade, wears multiple hats. He is a scholar, athlete, entrepreneur, an award-winning film/podcast producer, a nationally recognized hip-hop dancer and a Taekwondo Black Belt specialist. Wright is a senior at Northwestern High School (NHS) in Hyattsville, where he attends the Jim Henson Performing Arts program and has always maintained a GPA of 3.7 to 4.0. He is on the NHS varsity track team and competes in cross country, 800-meter, 1600-meter and 3200-meter races. He began running for NHS in the 10th grade, and by the end of the year received the Most Improved Athlete Award. Wright has earned a Black Belt in Taekwondo, competing in this sport since he was in second grade. His experiences with Taekwondo have taught Wright that being uncomfortable or failing can be a catalyst to greater learning and improvement in skills. For example, he used to be afraid of spiders and to overcome that fear he learned everything he could about them. He said: “If you know what it is, and how it works, it’s hard to be afraid of it.” During his time competing in Taekwondo, he fought individuals older and bigger than he, helping him gain greater confidence in his skills and in his ability to overcome any challenge. Wright loves hip-hop dancing. He placed fourth in a solo national competition in July at the Virginia Beach Festival. He currently studies dance at Making Moves Dance Collective in Beltsville. To enhance his chances for getting into college, Wright is a fourth-year scholar with LEEP to College Foundation, Inc. (L2C). This college preparatory program helps under-represented youth to improve high school graduation rates by visiting various colleges, offering SAT preparation and fostering engagement in leadership and community development training. They also offer workshops in mental health, college readiness and financial planning. Wright was among a small team of students that produced a monthly podcast to discuss current events from a teenage perspective. He edited and produced the podcast on various media platforms. Wright is an entrepreneur – his business Always Seeking Knowledge (ASK), a clothing and apparel company – creates athletic clothing and apparel for people 15 to 35 years old. His clothing designs and ad enabled his selection to the Jim Henson program. Wright’s second business is called Drippy Film and Media Productions for which he writes and produces short narrative films. In 2023 at the 11th Annual Prince George’s County Public Schools (PGCPS) Digital Film Festival he won first and second place for Best Microfilm and Best Special Effects for a feature film. Wright’s filmmaking has already earned him a scholarship to the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), where he plans to join their Digital Cinema program. Upon admission, he’ll be awarded a $76,000 scholarship ($19,000 annually), providing he enrolls the fall after his graduation from high school. The award was for demonstrating outstanding achievement in art, design and creativity. Wright plans to major in film production in college and is looking at both Bowie State and RIT. He likes science fiction and wants to own his own film studio one day. Wright envisions moving in the direction of Tyler Perry and maybe Rod Sterling because he likes psychological films that make people think. He has completed MATLAB simulations, the Python coding program, Arduino projects, computer engineering coursework and has drafted a final research report as an apprentice in the Army Educational Outreach Program High School Apprenticeship at Texas Tech University in 2021. Wright’s parents are his greatest influencers – his father is an engineer with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and his mother is a physical chemist. He describes his father as a problem solver and his mother as creative. Both parents are entrepreneurial and so were Wright’s grandparents. When asked how he became engaged in so many activities over the years, Wright said: “My parents put me in stuff, and I am not afraid to try stuff and fail at it. If I want to do something, I try it.” © 2024 Greenbelt News Review'}]"

Mark Lennihan/AP An arrangement of oxycodone pills sits next to a bottle in New York in 2018. gorodenkoff / iStock via Getty Images The federal NOPAIN aims to incentivize outpatient surgical centers to use pain relief methods like nerve blocks and long-acting numbing medications. When Jennie Burke’s 13-year-old daughter needed hernia surgery six years ago, it wasn’t the operation Burke feared — it was her daughter’s recovery from it, and whether she’d need opioids to keep the pain at bay.At the time, Burke’s brother was “hitting rock bottom” from a heroin addiction that would later kill him. Like many Americans in the early 2000s, he became addicted to opioids after being prescribed OxyContin following an appendectomy. In 2020, the year he died, 68,630 people died from opioid overdoses.Given her family’s history with addiction, Burke was determined to keep her daughter off opioids. But she didn’t have to worry. Though a discharge nurse gave her daughter a prescription for 44 oxycodone tablets after her surgery, she was able to control the pain by alternating between Tylenol and ibuprofen, and never complained of intolerable discomfort.Burke, who lives in Baltimore with her family, was relieved — but also angry. If she hadn’t known better, she might have given her daughter all of the pills in the days following the operation. Studies show a person’s risk for chronic opioid use increases after they take the medication for longer than three days, and goes up even more sharply after five days.“In many instances, it’s easier to get narcotics than it is to get other modalities of pain relief,” Burke said. “It makes no sense.”But Burke and other advocates nationwide are hopeful that may soon change. The NOPAIN Act — which Congress passed in an end-of-year spending package — will take effect in 2025, setting up a separate Medicare payment for certain non-opioid pain management approaches in outpatient and ambulatory surgical settings.The law aims to incentivize outpatient surgical centers to use pain relief methods like nerve blocks and long-acting numbing medications. They can help keep patients safe from chronic opioid use or addiction, although the alternative methods are more expensive. As enacted, the legislation expires at the end of 2027, meaning Congress would need to take further action to extend it.An estimated 5 million people who are 12 years or older are addicted to prescription opioids in this country, according to data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Studies suggest that up to one-third of people who take opioids for chronic pain misuse them, and more than 10% become addicted over time. The number of opioid prescriptions dispensed in the U.S. peaked in 2012 at 255 million and has dropped to 142 million in 2020, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.As the availability of opioids has decreased in the country, research suggests that a smaller share of people struggling with opioid addiction started with prescription drugs. Data from a 2015 study of people entering treatment for opioid use disorder shows that about 24% of them reported oxycodone as the first opioid they used regularly to get high. In 2005, that share was about 42%. This 2013 photo shows OxyContin pills arranged for a photo at a pharmacy in Montpelier, Vermont.But there still are U.S. counties where enough opioid prescriptions are dispensed annually for every resident to have one. In Baltimore in 2020, 68.6 opioid prescriptions were dispensed for every 100 people — higher than the nationwide average rate of 43.3 prescriptions per 100 people. In Talbot and Allegany counties, which had Maryland’s highest dispensing rates that year, 91 opioids were prescribed per 100 people.As a whole, America prescribes more opioids per capita than any other country in the world — a disparity that may be partly explained by the fact that its medical system gives more autonomy to health care providers, imposes fewer regulations on practices, and is more permissive of drug companies marketing directly to providers, according to a 2021 report from the Congressional Research Service.Experts and advocates say the difference in how opioids and non-opioids are reimbursed by insurance also feeds into the problem.Opioids are reimbursed under Medicare Part D — meaning they don’t eat away at the payment a hospital receives for a surgery. The NOPAIN Act aims to create parity in how methods of pain relief are covered by removing non-opioid options from the payment, as well.There’s pent-up demand for non-opioid pain relief options, said Chris Fox, executive director of Voices for Non-Opioid Choices, a Washington, D.C.-based organization that lobbied for the NOPAIN Act.In 2019, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services made non-opioid options a separate payment for Medicare patients treated at ambulatory surgery centers, there was a 120% increase in the use of the anesthetic Exparel in the centers over the course of a year, Fox said.Since changing how non-opioid methods are reimbursed reduces the amount of opioids prescribed, Fox and other advocates argued CMS should enact the law in 2024, a year earlier than scheduled. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and 10 other governors, all Democrats, signed a letter in May to support early implementation.“We’re making the case, doing what we can, to tell CMS and anybody who will listen that there’s a real opportunity here to save lives, prevent unnecessary addiction and exposure to opioids following an acute pain incident,” Fox said. “We really need to bring this relief to our communities, to our constituents, to our patients and to our health care professionals sooner rather than later.”However, CMS didn’t take that step in July when the agency released its proposed Outpatient Prospective Payment System rule, which recommends Medicare payment rates and policies for outpatient and ambulatory surgical centers for the coming year.In an emailed statement, a CMS spokesperson said the agency is required to implement the rule Jan. 1, 2025. To prepare for the change, the spokesperson said, CMS asked for comment on the devices and drugs that people believe would meet the definition of non-opioid treatments for pain relief. The federal NOPAIN aims to incentivize outpatient surgical centers to use pain relief methods like nerve blocks and long-acting numbing medications.Dr. Eric Shepard, director of anesthesia at the Frederick Surgical Center, is similarly frustrated with the length of time that will pass before the NOPAIN Act is implemented. He and advocates with Fox’s organization are urging CMS to reverse course before finalizing the outpatient rule in early November.Since the 2019 CMS rule change, doctors at his center use “a fraction” of the opioids they did before, Shepard said. Now, patients who receive mastectomies at his center get long-acting nerve blocks and go home on Tylenol and ibuprofen. They don’t even get a prescription for a narcotic, Shepard said. Patients getting a total joint replacement get no opioids on the day of surgery and are prescribed a limited amount of oxycodone or tramadol afterward, in combination with an extended-release anesthetic.He predicts that once the NOPAIN Act is implemented, more surgical patients will receive implantable, long-release medications and nerve blocks instead of opioids. And, he said, there should be pressure from Congress to get all insurance plans to cover non-opioid methods of pain relief.“You’ve got to make sure that all payers are willing to reimburse for all these techniques and technologies that allow us to eliminate or minimize the use of opioids, because we’re not 100% there,” he said. “We’re about as close as we’ve ever been, and yet it’s not used the majority of the time.”Dr. Sarah Merritt, a pain medicine specialist based at the Lifestream Health Center in Bowie, also expressed support for the NOPAIN Act. Surgeons and anesthesiologists want to write fewer opioid prescriptions, she said, and she hopes the law will help them do so.But to further reduce opioid prescriptions, she said, doctors need to be better compensated for the extra time they spend with patients, educating them on pain management and keeping track of the other medications they take.Burke, who wrote an essay for The New York Times about her daughter’s hernia surgery, encountered another hurdle in 2020 with her daughter, when the teen needed a spinal fusion. This time, Burke knew her daughter would need opioids to get through the surgery and the pain afterward. She had long talks with her daughter’s doctors about how to limit the teenager’s exposure to the drugs, and they came up with a plan to use an eclectic combination of pain relief methods.Her daughter was off narcotics within five days of leaving the hospital.“Opiates provide mercy,” Burke said. “We need them in society, but we also need a variety of medications. We need access to mental health care. We need education, and our physicians need time. They need to be given time by their employers to speak with their patients. The NOPAIN Act is one facet'}]"

Press//Lindsay Whitehurst//November 30, 2023// Inspector general launches probe of decision to move FBI HQ to Maryland Associated Press//Lindsay Whitehurst//November 30, 2023// WASHINGTON — A federal watchdog will investigate how the Biden administration chose a site in Greenbelt for a new FBI headquarters following a contentious competition marked by allegations of conflict of interest. The Inspector General for the General Services Administration is probing the decision to locate the Maryland facility over a site in Virginia., according to a letter released Thursday by Virginia lawmakers. The new building would replace the FBI’s crumbling headquarters in nearby Washington, D.C. Virginia’s senators and representatives said in a joint statement that there was “overwhelming evidence” suggesting the process was influenced by politics and called on the GSA to pause anything related to the relocation until the review is complete. The acting inspector general said that his office would immediately begin evaluating the GSA’s process and procedures for selecting the site and share a copy of any report that results, according to a letter sent to Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia. “We applaud the inspector general for moving quickly and encourage him to move forward to complete a careful and thorough review,” Virginia’s delegation said in a joint statement. The agency said it welcomes the review and pointed out that it had already released decision-making materials and a legal review of concerns raised by the director of the FBI. “We carefully followed the requirements and process, and stand behind GSA’s final site selection decision,” an agency spokesperson said in a statement. The review comes after FBI Director Christopher Wray told staff in an internal message earlier this month that he was concerned about a “potential conflict of interest” in a GSA executive choosing a site owned by a previous employer. Wray said his objections were about the process rather than the site itself. GSA, which manages the government’s real estate portfolio, denied any conflict.

What kept them involved, often for decades, was the satisfaction they found writing factual, fair community news; spotlighting local residents; and their personal dedication to maintaining a respected news source that enables a cohesive, connected city and citizens. By, For and About The News Review’s core function is to report local government, Greenbelt Homes, Inc. (GHI), zoning, development, public infrastructure and education news, holding government accountable to citizens, and equipping Greenbelt residents for informed public debate and decision making, the backbone of democracy. It also covers local residents: their accomplishments, joys and tragedies. The newspaper is mostly a volunteer effort, by the people, for the people and about the people of Greenbelt. That began with Greenbelt’s 1937 founding, when applicant screening included willingness to be involved in community activities, and the first paper was published within six weeks after the first residents moved in. At that time women in Greenbelt were less likely to be employed outside the home, yet many Greenbelt wives were well-educated and well-informed, having grown up with newspapers, attended college and worked before marriage. They wanted to explore the community, and spend time with other adults, to make a difference in Greenbelt. The News Review offered (and offers) diverse roles, by day or evening, from a few hours to many, with token payment. For some women, the pay helped for incidentals, and the newspaper involvement gave them meaningful work, connections, and community. Dorothy Sucher (Writer, 1960- 1971) Dorothy Sucher arrived in Greenbelt in 1957. “For a while I went quietly crazy in my GHI house surrounded by babies,” she wrote. She joined the Co-op Nursery, as a mother and board member, and the News Review. She said the News Review came to be her focus beyond her family, that people came to know her as herself, not a wife and mother, and she thrived. She later cofounded the Greenbelt Museum and founded the Women’s Investment Group of Greenbelt and the Greenbelt Writers Group. She was smart, artistic and wrote beautifully, producing city council reporting, feature stories and the opinion column Point of View. In addition to the News Review, she taught writing, was an essayist, a published mystery writer, a watercolorist, gardener and designed her Greenbelt home. In midlife she became a psychotherapist. Sandra Lange (Writer and Layout, 1966-Present) Sandra Lange filled leadership positions in the Greenbelt Homemaker’s Club, the League of Women Voters, the Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt Democratic Club, chaired the Greenbelt Labor Day Festival, led Greenbelt’s 50th and 60th anniversary celebrations, and cofounded the Greenbelt Museum with Sucher, in conjunction with the 50th anniversary. She met Elaine Skolnik at a GHI meeting and, knowing Lange had been an English teacher, Skolnik recruited Lange to the Greenbelt News Review. Lange reported on topics including GHI board meetings and city government and services. She applied her artistic skills to arranging stories and display ads while laying out the paper. Elaine Skolnik (Writer and Board President 1957-2015) Elaine and Al Skolnik moved to Greenbelt in 1952. She said it was love at first sight: “Oh, those tall pines and oaks, the lake, the large green areas on which the playgrounds beckoned to the children, the cooperative babysitting club, the co-op nursery school and kindergarten. It was such a sweet life.” She served on the Park and Recreation Advisory Board, was president of the Co-op Nursery School and vice president of the Co-op kindergarten, and worked behind the scenes for council and GHI candidates. During 1960s and 1970s development battles, she was a leader of the steering committee of the Citizens for a Planned Greenbelt (CFPG), which formed to fight the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission’s 1965 College Park-Greenbelt Master Plan. The plan called for Greenbelt to become the second largest employment center in the state. In response, CFPG demanded the preservation of the concept of the planned community of Greenbelt. Elaine began by reading her husband Al’s article drafts to ensure their understandability for readers. She nervously took on the Our Neighbors column, and much later reported on development issues. She didn’t drive, but spent hours on the phone, for Our Neighbors, organizing 1950s News Review fund drives and interviewing developers. Williamson wrote, “She was a super sleuth reporter interviewing developers, digging into the details of their projects and then writing about them in the newspaper, a challenging task she was proud of.” After Al’s unexpected death in 1977, Elaine had a profound effect on the paper, providing guidance and strength at this time. Until 1986, she was News Review president, decided which news the paper should cover, assigned stories to reporters and continued her own investigative reporting, which she particularly treasured. She was thorough, tenacious and accurate. Virginia Beauchamp (Writer and Editor, 1957-2016) Virginia Beauchamp moved to Greenbelt in 1957 and said the News Review offered “an opportunity for adult conversation and to learn more about my new community.” She was a University of Maryland professor and scholar who later founded the University’s Women’s Studies program and was instrumental in implementing Title IX sex discrimination protections in Maryland educational institutions. She helped found the Women’s Action Coalition of Prince George’s County, served on the Prince George’s County Commission on Women to improve quality of life for local women and girls, and in 2003 was inducted into the Maryland Women’s Hall of Fame. Beauchamp began in 1957 as a reporter and a senior copy editor until stepping away in 2016 at age 95. Williamson remembered her as a determined woman, with a husband in Vietnam, raising children, running the household, teaching, with no childcare resources, “and being paid squat!” Her requests to the university for pay comparable to her male colleagues were denied because “you have a husband,” when in fact his Army pay was minimal. Quiet, demure and tough, Williamson said “she pursued things she felt strongly about and carried those efforts into the paper.” Williamson said Beauchamp used her language skills to easily read and fix what wasn’t written well. “She taught and explained so people learned a lot. And she made sure we understood what the [news] issues really were. She was our professor.” Mary Lou Williamson (Editor and Writer, 1962-Present) Beauchamp recruited her neighbor Williamson in 1962, when the paper was assembling a 25th anniversary history of Greenbelt and she discovered Williamson had studied history. Williamson progressed to proofreading the paper and writing headlines, later becoming an accomplished city council reporter. She first became editor in 1964. Sucher and Williamson alternated the editor role between 1963 and 1967, upon the Sucher family’s temporary move to Switzerland where her husband worked at CERN and Williamson taking a maternity leave after Sucher’s return to Greenbelt. As editor, Williamson worked to expand the size of the paper from four or six pages to eight, and much later to 12, increasing advertising revenue to fund more content. Williamson wrote she has “…had a life-long love affair with newspapers. We were always a two-newspaper family when I was growing up in Chicago – Tribune in the morning, Sun Times in the evening. I had a brief stint as sports-page editor in ninth grade and three years on my college newspaper, two as business manager.” She moved here in 1962, filling leadership roles for the Greenbelt Nursery School and Eleanor Roosevelt Instrumental Music Parents Association, volunteered for the Greenbelt Municipal Swim Team, led a 4-H club and later edited the Greenbelt 50th anniversary book Greenbelt: History of a New Town. Hard News News Review history cannot be told without Al Skolnik, who set the standard for reporting news accurately, truthfully and fairly, without added interpretation. The News Review published both hard news (city council, GHI, city and county government, zoning and development) and more general community news. Al was board president and news editor. The paper was and is a cooperative, with members filling their main roles, sharing roles, pitching in as needed and according to their interests, and mentoring new members to absorb the paper’s standards and culture. They learned journalistic writing and integrity by writing, being edited, proofreading others’ work and reading published articles. Sucher, Williamson, Elaine Skolnik, Beauchamp and Al Skolnik were among those who covered city council, the GHI'}]"

I have always had a hard time saying goodbye to things. Moving from country to country throughout my life — from Korea to Japan, Japan to Scotland, Scotland to Hong Kong and Hong Kong back to Korea — I was constantly forced to leave my friends and memories behind. With no time left to process the change fully, I have had to cling to the memories of the past. Even as I mouthed goodbye, I never fully meant it, always reminiscing about my life in the previous country. Since being accepted to Hopkins two years ago, I have again been forced to say goodbye to people and things almost regularly. As I prepared to leave Seoul for Baltimore, I was forced to say goodbye to many reminders of my home, from my favorite cafes to my childhood bedroom to my mom’s kimchi. These departures triggered the child in me again, tugging me back into a sea of memories that I could not swim out of. The fact that I was saying goodbye to my native language first hit me while traveling from Korea to the U.S. I heard less and less Korean on the plane as I flew into San Fransisco, and then to Baltimore. By the end of my trip, all I heard was English, occasionally mixed with some lines of Spanish, which confirmed that I was truly disconnected from my home community. An unexplainable wave of sorrow engulfed me, prompting a long session of hot tears and uncontrollable snot. When I arrived at Hopkins, I had hoped that I was done with goodbyes, but there have been many goodbyes in my experience here. At the end of my freshman year, I had to say goodbye to my roommate, my room in Wolman Hall and the lab mentors I had connected with throughout the year. Still, after a year in college, my farewells have become surprisingly calmer, accompanied by a last look and a deep sigh. On my face, I wear an ambivalent smile to assure everyone around me that I am okay and to trick myself into thinking I am used to saying goodbye now — when I am not. The problem is that I am never prepared to say goodbye. When I realize that I’m approaching the end of an era, I find myself already situated in the moment of having to greet a farewell. This has happened in the wake of parting from my friends, my parents, my hometown and my country. I find myself panicking as if I could not have expected the parting; I frantically grasp at my jumble of memories as if trying to preserve them. And before I realize it, these emotions wrap around one another until it becomes a big knot that I can’t even start to unravel. Waves of helplessness consume me, and I, time after time, become even more fearful of saying goodbye. We always prepare for the start of something: new books, altered schedules and bubbles of excitement. But never in my life have I prepared myself for the end of something. How can I think of an end to something while I can still access it easily? Why should I go out of my way to recognize that what I have right now will not be there forever? Reflecting on these questions, I think the reason why goodbyes are so hard for me lies in the fact that I always seem to have regrets. I believe that if I could go back, I would have been nicer; I would have spent more time there; I should have enjoyed that moment more than I had. It is difficult to think in the back of my mind that nothing lasts forever, but it has to be recognized. Finally, after struggling with goodbyes for so long, I’ve come to learn that knowing there is an end to something makes me try harder to make the most of every moment and appreciate the time I have with the people I have. With this in mind, I can finally understand the good in “goodbye.” Yuna Um is a sophomore from Seoul, South Korea studying Neuroscience.

The crash by the 10 mile marker on southbound I-81, near the Hagerstown Regional Airport, was reported at 9:34 a.m. Friday, according to emergency service officials. Southbound I-81 remained closed in that area around 4 p.m. Friday as state police continued to investigate the crash. A Pennsylvania Department of Transportation webcam showed trucks blocking southbound I-81 at Exit 3 for U.S. 11, with long lines of traffic slowly exiting the interstate. Live blog from Friday\'s fatal crash: Two killed in Interstate 81 crash Friday near Hagerstown airport, police say: Live update The deceased were identified as Wesley Merrick, 55, and Alicia Eve Cornell, 46, both of Wellsville, N.Y., according to a state police news release and spokesperson Elena Russo. Wellsville is 44 miles west of Corning, N.Y., and just north of the Pennsylvania state line. Merrick was driving a Chevrolet Tahoe that, according to the preliminary investigation, hit the rear of a tractor-trailer that had begun to brake due to traffic. That caused a chain reaction, with three additional tractor-trailers and a pickup truck colliding with one another. Cornell was the rear left passenger in the Tahoe. Two other passengers in the Tahoe were taken to area hospitals. Merrick\'s wife, Carrie Merrick, 49, was flown via state police helicopter to the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland in Baltimore. She was the front seat passenger. The other rear seat passenger, Kevin Dye, 59, of New York, was taken via ambulance to Meritus Medical Center east of Hagerstown, according to state police. Darrin Wayne Shank Jr., 55, of Williamsport and the driver of one of the tractor-trailers, also was taken to Meritus, according to state police. Shank was driving a tractor-trailer from Estes Express Lines, based in Richmond, Va. The company provided the following statement: ""Earlier today, an Estes truck was involved in an accident near Hagerstown, Maryland, while traveling on Interstate 81. We are cooperating with local and state law enforcement as they respond to and investigate this situation. We extend our deepest sympathies and prayers to those involved in this tragic accident."" Washington County Emergency Services Director R. David Hays said there were three other patients who refused being taken to the hospital. Hays said five people were trapped in vehicles when emergency responders arrived, including the two deceased. One of those trapped was able to climb out on their own. One was the person taken to Shock Trauma and the other was taken to Meritus, he said. State police said the two who died were pronounced dead at the scene. Hays said the state\'s Go-Team, a group of surgeons with blood units for trauma patients, was being flown to the scene from Shock Trauma until it was determined it was no longer needed on scene. Not counting police, Hays said more than 60 emergency personnel responded to the crash. Among the units responding were Washington County\'s hazmat team and the rehab unit, which helped take care of emergency personnel working in the heat during a prolonged response. Once crews are done they will review what went well, what didn\'t and how everyone is doing, Hays said. That is when officials will determine if any of the responders need counseling, he said. The hazmat unit pumped diesel fuel from one of the tractor-trailer tanks and put down absorbent to contain fluid spills, Hays said. In addition to state troopers, the Washington County State\'s Attorney\'s Office had representatives at the scene. The more than six-hour closure of southbound I-81, still closed into late Friday afternoon, caused traffic congestion on surrounding roads and backups on I-81 in Pennsylvania. At least two school districts, Washington County Public Schools in Maryland and Greencastle-Antrim School District in Pennsylvania, announced the traffic issues were expected to cause delays for school buses taking students home Friday. While it wasn\'t known where the New Yorkers were headed, the crash happened at the start of a typically busy holiday traffic weekend. Another fatal I-81 crash: ATV racing champ among 5 killed in I-81 crash Russo said state police had already announced it will have extra troopers on the road, statewide, looking for impaired, distracted and aggressive drivers and drivers speeding and violating the rules of the road. State police are ""asking motorists to heed caution this holiday weekend due to the higher volume of traffic,"" Russo said. Friday\'s fatal crash on Interstate 81 is the second fatal crash along the highway in the Tri-State area in less than a month. A blown tire led to a crash in Greene Township, north of Chambersburg in Franklin County, Pa., the night of Aug. 9, killing five people and a dog. Donald Molander, Kimberly Molander and their children Miranda Molander, 21, and ATV-racer Dane Molander, 19, of Middletown, Pa., and James Shade, of Martinsburg, W. Va., were pronounced dead at the scene, according to Pennsylvania State Police. The Molanders were traveling south on I-81 in an RV that was towing an enclosed trailer. The front left tire blew out, causing the motorhome to travel across the grass median and into the northbound lanes. The RV struck a tractor-trailer head-on. Shade was driving the truck.'}]"

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 5:32 pm MOOREFIELD, W.Va. — Braylee Corbin started the ninth inning with a boom, and Sammy Colaw put the finishing touches on a triumphant Petersburg win. Tied at four entering the top of the ninth inning, Corbin sent a go-ahead homer over the center-field fence. Ten batters and five runs later, Colaw crushed a grand slam, stunning a Moorefield team that had several prior chances to win it. With a 10-run final inning and an iron man 143-pitch, nine-inning complete game by Colaw in the circle, the third-ranked Vikings outlasted No. 5 Moorefield, 14-4, in extra innings. Colaw went the distance, allowing four runs (three earned) on nine hits with 10 strikeouts and six walks in nine innings pitched. The All-Area pitcher went 4 for 4 at the plate with five RBIs and three runs scored, and Corbin, Colaw’s All-Area catcher, went 3 for 4 with three ribbies and three runs. Addy Kitzmiller and Gracie Carpenter also had three-hit days for Petersburg. Petersburg (3-1) got off to a fast start with a Colaw RBI single in the first inning. Carpenter doubled in a run in the third, and another crossed on a wild pitch for a 3-0 Viking lead. Moorefield (3-1) made it 3-2 when Amber Williams hit an RBI single in the third and a Yellow Jacket came home on a steal play. Corbin tripled in a run in the fifth to up the Vikings edge to 4-2. Moorefield plated a pair of runs in the sixth inning on the base-paths to level the score at 4-all. The Yellow Jackets threatened to walk it off in the seventh when Allie Biser struck a two-out double, but Colaw stranded her to force extras. Moorefield loaded the bases with one out in the eighth, but Petersburg made a pair of clutch defensive plays to extend the game. Colaw recorded the second out by fielding a grounder and cutting down the winning run at the plate. Then, a slicing liner by Seanna Heavner was stabbed by Kitzmiller at first base to push the contest to a ninth. That’s when Petersburg blew the game open, providing Colaw with more than enough run support. Williams took the loss in a heartbreaker for Moorefield, allowing 10 runs on 14 hits with six Ks and six walks in 8 1/3 innings pitched. The right-hander threw 131 pitches. McKenna Crites and Cici Kump topped the Yellow Jackets with two hits apiece. Moorefield has a doubleheader at Philip Barbour on Saturday at 1 p.m. Petersburg hosts Buckhannon-Upshur on Saturday at noon and Washington at 4 p.m. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

Jurors deliberated for less than two hours before finding Tramelle Williams, 23, guilty of first- and second-degree murder, assault, armed robbery and multiple firearms offenses in connection to the death of Taijay Daniels just after 7 p.m. Dec. 8, 2022. Daniels didn’t stand a chance that night, said Dorchester County State’s Attorney Amanda Leonard, echoing what she told jurors at the outset of the trial. That night, the 24-year-old was walking down Race Street, alone and on his phone. But when he reached the road’s intersection with Pleasant Street, Williams’ plan was already in action, Leonard said. Surveillance footage shown in court provided a glimpse of Daniels’ last minutes walking past a corner market, followed by Williams shortly after. A video from the apartment complex on Pleasant Street showed a man identified as Williams approaching Daniels with a gun. Daniels dropped his phone as Williams extended his arm, shooting him in the back. Then, Williams shot again, striking Daniels in the head twice before taking his belongings and leaving. Only 13 seconds passed between the robbery and the first shot, Leonard said. A Cambridge resident on his way home that night found Daniels’ body lying facedown on Pleasant Street within minutes of the shooting. Though police and emergency medical services personnel performed CPR, Daniels was pronounced deceased at the scene. Daniels’ death was ruled a homicide by multiple gunshot wounds, all of which were “rapidly fatal,” a state medical examiner testified. One was fired at close range, evidenced by gunshot stippling and soot deposits on Daniels’ skin. “He knew exactly what he was doing,” Leonard said in her closing argument Thursday. Williams was arrested Dec. 9, 2022, following a foot pursuit on Lincoln Terrace. After he attempted to flee, a Cambridge police officer fired, shooting Williams in the leg. Police testified to recovering a phone from Williams that night, which was identified by Daniels’ mother as belonging to her son. A Glock 43X was also recovered near Williams. DNA evidence pointing to Williams was found on the gun, and casings found near the shooting site were found to be consistent with those test-fired from the same type of gun, forensic analysts said. In her closing argument, defense attorney Stephanie DeLang countered prosecutors’ reliance on surveillance footage and forensic evidence and their sureness of Williams being the shooter, saying they only showed what fit their narrative. Daniels’ blood was not on the gun, despite it being fired at close range, she said, also highlighting a lack of forensic testing on the phone recovered during Williams’ arrest. Ballistics evidence showed the casings were consistent with having been fired from the same type of gun, but did not point to the exact gun used, DeLang said. While she didn’t deny a shooting occurred based on the surveillance footage, DeLang argued that jurors could not determine the identity of the figures seen in the video — witnesses told police there was a lot of foot traffic in the area that night, she said. “Do not guess, and do not give the state the benefit of the doubt,” she said. Leonard pointed out that no other suspects were ever developed in the case. Following the trial, Leonard, who prosecuted the case with Senior Assistant State’s Attorney Ella Disharoon, said she was thankful for the jury’s time and the verdict. Dorchester Circuit Judge William H. Jones ordered a pre-sentence investigation, deferring sentencing for 90 days. In January, Williams is set to stand for another trial related to a second fatal shooting in Cambridge, which occurred roughly three hours after Daniels was shot. Around 10 p.m. Dec. 8, 2022, police responded to the 700 block of High Street for a second gunshot victim, who was identified as Lory Eugene Fields, 69, of Cambridge. Fields was found lying in a yard with a gunshot wound to his head. He was declared deceased at the scene. Williams is facing additional murder and robbery charges in connection to Fields’ death.

(AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson) Capital News Service//Minnie Stephenson//December 14, 2023// After the back-to-back shootings in October at Morgan State University and Bowie State University, advocates for historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) say that underfunding is leading to lack of proper safety and security resources on their campuses. Their concerns have drawn support from Capitol Hill. Rep. Alma Adams, D-North Carolina, and the founder of the Congressional HBCU Caucus, sent letters to President Joe Biden, Education Secretary Dr. Miguel Cardona and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, saying there needs to be a “concerted effort to provide funding to HBCUs for them to protect their student body and faculty from violence.” She added that safety and security on HBCU campuses must be a “top priority” and requested that her office meet regularly with the Biden administration to discuss funding and safety concerns. On Oct. 3, five people were injured after a shooting on Morgan State’s campus during homecoming festivities. Just four days later, two people were injured after a shooting on Bowie State’s campus, also during homecoming. Ryan Coleman, president of the Randallstown NAACP, was on Bowie State’s campus visiting family when the shooting happened. The police presence on campus that night was not sufficient, he said. “You saw some police…but it became really obvious that they weren’t walking around the campus…they weren’t patrolling like that,” he said. “There were multiple events on the campus with multiple people. And there just wasn’t any police presence at those individual events.” Coleman described the scene during the shooting as “chaos.” While sheltering in a dorm with his family, he said he saw people running and trying to get off campus, and that the police didn’t start evacuating campus until about an hour later. “The Bowie State University Police were over their heads, it was obvious they did not have the police resources to handle this,” Coleman said. “If there was an active shooter who actually wanted to do harm to students, I have no faith that that person would’ve been stopped at all.” After the shooting, Bowie State President Aminta Breaux said the school would revisit the idea of adding metal detectors to campus, but emphasized that “no one person has the solution to all the challenges the university faces.” Bowie State University did not respond to a request for comment about the police presence during the shooting there. At Morgan State, President David K. Wilson announced his plan to extend a fence barrier around campus, saying it will help limit “unfettered pedestrian access.” The school also said it plans to hire more police officers, implement more security cameras around campus and add metal detectors at entrances. The measures will cost millions of dollars and the school said it hopes to receive additional state and federal funding. After watching the shooting unfold at Morgan State, Coleman wrote a letter to the president of Howard University, where his daughter is enrolled, urging the school to take action during its homecoming celebration in October, including increasing police presence and adding metal detectors at entrances to events, among other precautions. At its homecoming celebration, Howard officials said that safety was their “main priority” ahead of the events, and the school had its campus police and Metro police patrolling campus. On Monday, college officials across Maryland gathered behind closed doors to discuss campus safety in the wake of the Morgan State shooting. They discussed prevention technology on campus, and the importance of doing checks on existing security measures, like security cameras, according to WBAL in Baltimore. Campus officials also emphasized the importance of community policing, and that schools should partner with surrounding police departments. Coleman said that when he has visited the University of Maryland or other non-HBCUs in Maryland, those institutions seem to have the resources they need, whether it’s funding, programming or security on campus. Maryland HBCU Advocates spokeswoman Sharon Blake echoed Coleman, saying that underfunding at the institutions is widespread, whether it is in programming, scholarships or security. “When you don’t have enough money, you cut corners wherever you can. And that, of course, does include public safety, and that’s unfortunate,” Blake said. In Congress, Adams has passed many bills that supporting HBCUs. Last year, in the wake of bomb threats against HBCU campuses across the country, Adams passed a resolution that condemned violence at HBCUs and reaffirmed Congress’s support for these schools. In 2019, Adams also passed legislation that established two fiscal years’ worth of mandatory funding for minority-serving institutions. Earlier this year, the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) proposed legislation that would direct $100 million each year from FEMA’s non-profit grants security program to go towards safety initiatives on HBCU campuses. Adams’ office said she is “strongly in favor” of this proposal. In terms of federal funding, the Biden-Harris administration has invested over $7 million in the nation’s HBCUs, and has directed money in the 2022 and 2023 spending packages, specifically supporting scholarships and grants, as well as institutional development. While the administration has not specifically increased funding for campus safety in reference to shootings, the Department of Education did secure over $2 million in grants to help schools recover after violent events, such as bomb threats. Additionally, in September, the Biden administration sent letters to the governors of 16 states, including Maryland, asking them to direct more money for their land-grant HBCUs. In the letters, Cardona and Agriculture Secretary Thomas Vilsack said they found that the states’ land-grant HBCUs received a collective $13 billion less than they should have in the last few decades, according to an analysis by the National Center for Education Statistics. Maryland’s land-grant HBCU is the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, which the analysis found to have a $321 million funding gap in state appropriations in the last 30 years, compared to the predominantly white land-grant universities in the state, including the University of Maryland College Park. “The longstanding and ongoing underinvestment in University of Maryland Eastern Shore disadvantages the students, faculty, and community that the institution serves,” the two secretaries wrote. “It is our hope that we can work together to make this institution whole after decades of being underfunded.” The letter also acknowledges that the state government has been making steps toward addressing the funding gap in recent years. In 2021, then-Gov. Larry Hogan approved legislation giving $577 million to Maryland HBCUs over a decade, which Moore has said he will uphold, according to his office. Moore allocated $422 million for all four schools in his first budget, and in February approved $3 million in grants to three schools, including Morgan State and Bowie State. Since Moore took office, funding for Maryland HBCUs has increased over 20%, according to his office. Moore’s office said that he “firmly believes that every student deserves to feel safe on campus and that everyone involved needs to work hard to ensure that these tragedies no longer take place in Maryland.” But even the increased funding and support still does not rectify decades of underfunding, Coleman said. “Even if (HBCUs) are given some money … they’ve been underfunded for 30 or 40 years, and they’re not really being brought to a whole,” he said. Their concerns have drawn support from Capitol Hill. Rep. Alma Adams, D-North Carolina, and the founder of the Congressional HBCU Caucus, sent letters to President Joe Biden, Education Secretary Dr. Miguel Cardona and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, saying there needs to be a “concerted effort to provide funding to HBCUs for them to protect their student body and faculty from violence.” She added that safety and security on HBCU campuses must be a “top priority” and requested that her office meet regularly with the Biden administration to discuss funding and safety concerns.
