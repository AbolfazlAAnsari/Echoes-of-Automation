An Escambia County (Ala.) Schools board member who was recently re-elected as vice president was arrested Dec. 4 on revealing grand jury information charges, according to court records. Jackson According to an indictment that was returned by the grand jury, Cynthia (Cindy) A. Jackson, 72, of Brewton, has been charged with revealing evidence from the grand jury. Get the latest news sent to your inbox According to the indictment, Jackson allegedly, “did corruptly obtain information pertaining grand jury considerations, evidence or other matters taken or transpiring within or before a grand jury, to-wit: obtained and disclosed information in a grand jury subpoena, in violation of Code of Alabama 12-16-215. District Attorney Steve Billy said Tuesday the indictments came about after he got some information in late summer about some COVID money issues. “I was asked to look into it by actually an employee,” Billy said. “We issued the subpoena, and of course we didn’t issue the subpoena until October. That was what. It was just to find out some information. “When I issued the subpoena, of course, it was issued to an employee of the school board,” he added. “Of course, Ms. Jackson (allegedly) illegally obtained a copy from the school board employee. Then, she had it on her phone, and then she sent it to Sherry Digmon. Of course, she (Digmon) printed it out and published it (in the Atmore News). Of course they misrepresented where they got the copy of the subpoena. That’s where it came from, from Ms. Jackson’s cell phone.” Two search warrants were executed Oct. 23 on Jackson and Digmon’s cell phones, according to court records. According to the search warrants, which have been made public, Digmon allegedly violated the Alabama Open Meetings Act; and Jackson allegedly violated the Alabama Open Meetings Act and made public statements about grand jury indictments that haven’t yet occurred, which is a violation of Alabama Code 12-16-214(4). Billy confirmed that the search warrants for Jackson’s cell phone yielded that she allegedly shared the grand jury information with Digmon. Jackson, who represents District 4 on the board of education, was recently elected to serve as the board’s vice president. Jackson was booked at 11:49 a.m. Dec. 4, and released at 12:12 p.m. on a $25,000 bond. This is the third arrest of someone who allegedly revealed grand jury evidence in over a month. According to Advance archives, Digmon, who is also a member of the board of education, and News Reporter Don Fletcher were arrested Oct. 27 on revealing grand jury evidence charges. Both were formally indicted Dec. 1 by a grand jury, which was recalled. Billy said in an Oct. 28 interview the arrest of Digmon and Fletcher stemmed from the publishing of an article, which was in the Atmore News, where a subpoena and COVID checks were mentioned, and “even called out some names.” The article was published in the Wed., Oct. 25, edition of the Atmore News. “They also mentioned – and I was at the school board meeting on the (Oct.) 12th, and they said I mentioned that (subpoena and COVID checks) at the school board meeting, which is not correct at all,” Billy said in the telephone interview. “I didn’t mention anything about COVID at all. That was just misinformation. They were at the meeting. That was, I think, calculated.” During the meeting Billy was referring, the district attorney spoke in defense of Superintendent Michele McClung, whose contract was not renewed by the board. Additionally, Digmon, was arrested on ethics charges on Nov. 1, alleging that Digmon used her position and materials for personal gain. Billy said the next step for Jackson would that she would come before a court, and be arraigned in front of a judge or either her attorney will file a written waiver of arraignment and file it that way. “Beyond that, they’ll be starting to exchange discovery and then they’ll be on track for a trial setting,” he said. “At the first of the year, Judge Fuller would dictate that when it would be tried.” The code by which Jackson was arrested Dec. 4 states: Grand juror, witness, etc., prohibited from revealing, disclosing, etc., a juror’s questions, considerations, etc.; no person to directly, indirectly, etc., by any means obtain information as to juror’s questions, considerations, etc. No past or present grand juror, past or present grand jury witness or grand jury reporter or stenographer shall willfully at any time directly or indirectly, conditionally or unconditionally, by any means whatever, reveal, disclose or divulge or attempt or endeavor to reveal, disclose or divulge or cause to be revealed, disclosed or divulged, any knowledge or information pertaining to any grand juror’s questions, considerations, debates, deliberations, opinions or votes on any case, evidence, or other matter taken within or occurring before any grand jury of this state. Nor shall any person at any time, directly or indirectly, conditionally or unconditionally by any means whatever, corruptly or with intent to influence a grand juror or other person authorized by law to attend a grand jury, or by threat of harm to person or property, or by force applied to person or property, or by threatening letter or communication, or by offer of reward, remuneration, gift, benefit or thing of value of whatever nature or kind, obtain or endeavor to obtain, any information pertaining to, or any knowledge of any grand juror’s questions, considerations, debates, deliberations, opinions or votes on any case, evidence or other matter taken or transpiring within or before any grand jury of this state.'}]"

Of course, to the extent that the FOXes continue to report the lies emanating from the Trump hen-house, the network must necessarily report real “fake news”; after all, they honed their “journalistic” skills communicating most of the 30,000-plus documented mis-statements of fact from Trump when he was in the White House, after his clearly fraudulent campaign of 2016 (re-read the Mueller Report, if you have doubts about that, sans the Barr mischaracterization of it). There’s an inherent difficulty in relying upon unreliable sources of information and “news” such as Trump and FOXNews. You cannot count on any particular news story to be truthful, that is, factual (a fact is something that was or is and that can be verified by a disinterested observer). That makes their news as reliable as rumors on Wall Street about “hot stocks,” which if acted upon may cost you more than embarrassment. It may cost you money – or more. During the heart of the on-going pandemic in 2020-2022, it actually cost many Americans and Alabamians their health and some, their lives. After reading a report from one of our state’s most accomplished physicians, who spent nearly three years fighting the coronavirus virus and the non-factual rumors associated with it, I am more convinced than ever about that. That is a high price to pay in order to ignore the obvious signs of “fake news” telecast on FOXNews and coming out of the Trump WH and to insist that Trump was truthful when he spoke on the subject. What to do? Stop ignoring the truth; stop pretending that Trump and his once-favorite TV news source were truthful and still are truthful. My personal rule of thumb in both cases is and has been since 2015: Whatever Trum, Carlson, Hannity, or Ingram say, I assume it is not factual unless and until it has been verified by an independent source in a position to know the matter. Whether it’s the size of the last president’s only inaugural crowd or whether it’s his denials that he possessed purloined top secret governmental materials at Mar-a-Lago, or 30,000 other documented untruths in between, a person would be foolish, indeed, to take his word for it. The same goes for the FOXNews primetime anchors and FOX executives who have been foxing their viewers for two decades. Now we know from their own words that, not only have they cynically and knowingly told their viewers lies and communicated to them misinformation; they have done so for the most crass reason imaginable: to avoid losing TV ratings points and market-share. To be sure, as Trump has done for years, FOXNews denies what their own words say, objecting that they have been taken out of context. We shall see, when we see the specifics of their defense, what they consider the truth to be. In the meantime, I’ll resort for understanding to these wise words of the 18th century Dean of St. Patrick’s, Jonathan Swift: “Some modern zealots appear to have no better knowledge of truth, nor better manner of judging it, than by counting noses.” Why does that matter? — Because novelist John Galsworthy was right when he wrote that “honesty of thought and speech and written word is a jewel, and they who curb prejudice and seek honorably to know and speak the truth (— instead of spreading lies —) are the only builders of a better life.” Indeed, our corporate lives depend on it.

Panthers’ 10-7 loss in the first round of the Class 5A state playoffs on Friday, Nov. 10 at Barney Hood Stadium. (Chris McCarthy/Messenger) By Chris McCarthy, Publisher/Editor Southside finished three points short of the program’s first playoff victory in five years on Friday, Nov. 10 at Barney Hood Stadium. Trailing Boaz 10-7 with 90 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, Southside faced a do-or-die- fourth down and 19 from the Pirate 49-yard line. The Panthers looked like they were in business when quarterback Jordan Bryan connected with Cayden McMichael on a crossing route. McMichael went low to make the catch and tried to avoid contact with the ground, but his knee was ruled down at the Boaz 33, two yards short of the first down marker. Boaz took over on downs and knelt three times to run out the clock, ending Southside’s season at 8-2. The Pirates (6-5) gained a measure of revenge from when the teams met on September 29, when the Panthers edged Boaz in overtime by a score of 48-45. The Pirates host Pleasant Grove in the second round on Friday, Nov. 17. With the respective defenses combining to force 10 punts and holding on four fourth down conversion attempts over the game’s first 32 minutes, the game was scoreless until late in the third quarter when McMichael provided Southside prime field position with a 35-yard punt return to the Boaz 34. Halfback Mason Teague took it to the house on the first play from scrimmage, and Caleb Ogle pushed through the extra point for a 7-0 lead at the 1:59 mark. Boaz answered on the ensuing possession, a seven-play, 70-yard drive that was highlighted by a 39-yard pass completion from Tyler Pierce to Jakai Hudgins that put the Pirates at the Southside 20. The Panther defense allowed a yard over the next three plays to force a field goal attempt, which Jose Arreguin pushed through the uprights from 37 yards away with 23 seconds remaining in the quarter. Koal Garrett’s 38-yard return of the following kickoff put the ball near midfield, but the series netted minus-five yards, forcing Southside to punt. Starting at its own 21, Boaz converted three third downs and one fourth down to get inside the Panther 10, where on third down and 7 Pierce threw to Tyler Sullivan for a touchdown. With Arreguin’s PAT, the Pirates went ahead 10-7 at the halfway mark of the fourth quarter. Southside then made it to its own 48 before having to punt, and Boaz soon embarked on what turned out to be the game-winning drive. The Panthers got the ball back at their own 13 after Pierce’s touchdown pass, and four straight Teague runs moved the ball to the Southside 26. Southside then pulled out some razzle-dazzle when Bryant pitched the ball to Teague, who completed a pass to Garrett all the way to the Pirate 39. Three plays later, Bryan and McMichael teamed up for a 39-yard touchdown pass, but the play was nullified by a holding penalty. Pirate safety Elijah Kelley broke up a pass on third and 19 that was intended for Garrett, who was standing beyond the first down marker. That set up McMichael’s close-but-not-close enough reception, sending the Panthers packing for the 2023 season. Teague rushed for 141 yards on 21 carries, while Bryan was 5 of 14 in passing for 117 yards. He also gained 56 yards on nine carries. McMichael had three receptions for 73 yards. The Southside defense bent somewhat but did not break in the first half, forcing five punts and holding on a pair of fourth down conversion attempts. The Panthers missed two field goal attempts, one from 41 yards out and another from 39 yards away. Jevonte Strong finished with 13 tackles, followed by Brody McCutcheon and Brayden Bowers with 12 each, Tytan Rich and Kolby Dodd with 10 each, Blake Phillips with nine, Silas Osborne and Cameron Flowers with six each and Brody Burnett with five.

Eliana Johnson, NewsNation’s Elizabeth Vargas, and SiriusXM's Megyn Kelly.Image provided by NewsNation The Republican presidential hopefuls are not the only ones taking center stage at the University of Alabama on Wednesday. NewsNation, the upstart 24/7 cable TV network that bills itself as “unbiased,” will broadcast its first presidential primary debate at a time its emergence is stirring a debate over whether balanced political journalism has a place in the highly competitive and fragmented cable TV world. The news channel was rebranded from WGN America in March 2021, and has seen its audience grow over the past 1,000 days. But the network’s ratings remain far behind cable TV’s mainstays – Fox News, MSNBC, and CNN – and it also trails conservative upstart Newsmax, according to the most recent Nielsen ratings. “The debate will definitely bring new eyes to the network, which is a good thing for a media organization trying to compete for a new audience in a sea of other networks,” said Stefanie Hicks East, assistant professor of Journalism and Communication Studies at Troy University. The debate will air on NewsNation from 7-9 p.m. Wednesday at the Frank Moody Music Hall. “This will probably be the first time many Americans turn on NewsNation, and you only get one first impression,” said Daniel Bennett, associate professor of political science at Arkansas-based John Brown University, a private Christian institution. Indeed, the debate comes at a time when NewsNation is elbowing itself into a conversation among the biggest players on cable TV by positioning itself at the heart of a debate that underscores politics in America: Should the news be agenda-free, unshackled from partisan biases and delivered in a manner that is engaging and financially sustainable? Polling suggests NewsNation is trying to pitch to the public what it says it wants. According to a Pew Research analysis last year, three-quarters of U.S. adults say journalists should strive to give all sides equal coverage. NewsNation’s efforts also come at a time of continued dwindling confidence in all media. A Gallup poll in October showed the trust in mass media – newspapers, TV, and radio – to be tied at its historical previous lows recorded in 2016. “There is a strange cable news marketplace right now,” said Josh McCrain, assistant professor at the University of Utah, who has measured dynamics in media bias. “I think the idea that there is some sort of untapped potential for a centrist outlet is there. It seems to make sense, to me, from a business model perspective to give this a shot.” He added, “But there is not enough potential demand for an ‘unbiased’ news program that people will want to tune in regularly. I could be wrong, but there is not a lot of evidence for it.” In Alabama, the network, and its pitch to the country, will be on full display.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 1:40 pm Digital Editor, Investigative Reporter Five-Mobile and El Papi on Dauphin Street in downtown Mobile (Staff Photo) Two Dauphin Street restaurants in downtown Mobile will close at the end of this year, an owner confirmed Friday. Co-owner Cris Eddings said sister restaurants Five-Mobile and El Papi will serve their last customers on Dec. 31 and shut down beginning Jan. 1, 2024. The businesses were opened in 2016 and 2018, respectively. “We’re very sad, but we’re really thankful to the community for supporting us during this time. We’re also sad for our staff. They’ve been incredibly hard-working. We truly appreciate the efforts they gave to keep operations going,” he said. “Our lease terms are coming to an end at the end of January. We thought it was in our best interest not to continue. We love Mobile and we love downtown, but the numbers weren’t there for us.” Eddings said his other restaurant, Chuck's Fish Mobile, is “doing great” and will remain open. He said there will be exciting developments in the next year. Chuck’s has acquired 1,800 square feet in an adjacent building, where it will expand, according to Eddings, who noted they currently have 4,000 square feet. “We have some fun and exciting plans with that new space,” he said. “We’re beginning to build it out now.” Chuck’s will also be opening its seventh location statewide this year in Huntsville. It currently has restaurants in Mobile, Birmingham, Montgomery, Tuscaloosa, Athens, Georgia and Tallahassee, Florida. Eddings said roughly 35 staff members will be out of work with the closures. “Whether it’s at Chuck’s or other downtown restaurants, we’re making efforts to try and find them great jobs and give them good recommendations,” he said. “We feel really optimistic about the future with downtown. We’re sad we couldn’t make it work, but we’re thankful to the community for the years they supported us.” Eddings said both the Five and El Papi buildings are “operationally great to work out of” and have a great landlord, Wendell Quimby.

Chance of rain 70%. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 1:34 pm Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin challenges Teamsters Union President Sean O\'Brien to a fight at Senate committee hearing in Capitol Nov. 14,2023. It does not equate with the ill-famed Washington incident 167 years ago when a South Carolina congressman, Preston Brooks, bloodied a Massachusetts senator, Charles Sumner, with blows from a cane in anger over his criticism of slaveholders. But Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin said Friday given a do-over of his verbal challenge Tuesday to fight Sean O’Brien, he might leap the ornate horseshoe dais barrier between the two and go nose-to-nose with the Teamsters Union president. Mullin did not predict the outcome in an interview with the Norman, Oklahoma, Transcript, but noted he’s a former professional mixed martial arts fighter and the maneuver could have allowed him to get to O’Brien “faster.” “Honestly,” Mullin said, “I thought the guy would just kind of back out.” Instead, O’Brien engaged in back-and-forth insults with Mullin about the reason for his ire – a series of critical tweets aimed at the conservative Republican senator by O’Brien, including one saying, “you know where to find me. Anyplace, Anytime cowboy.” Mullin said the Senate hearing room was the right time and place. To which O’Brien replied, “I’d love to do it right now.” Mullin replied, “Well, stand your butt up then.” O’Brien rejoined, “You stand your butt up."" Mullin rose from his chair, prompting Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee conducting the hearing, to demand he sit down. ""You are a United States senator,” Sanders reminded Mullin. Mullin sat down but the invectives between Mullin and O’Brien continued for several minutes, with Sanders banging his gavel intermittingly until the shouting stopped. In his interview with the Norman Transcript, Mullin said O’Brien baited him five times online before he spoke up at the hearing. “It was just calling him out for being a bully online,” said Mullin. “A lot of people can be powerful behind a keyboard … but very seldom do you get called out on those words.” Inducted seven years ago into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame as an Outstanding America entry, Mullin, 46, competed as a young man in the welterweight mixed martial arts class with the Tulsa-based Xtreme Fighting League. He claims he went undefeated in five professional fights. And, he added his wife, Christine Rowan Mullin, is also a former fighter as a professional kickboxer. “I’m more afraid of her than Sean O’Brien,” he said. Norman, Okla., Transcript reporter Brian D.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 1:45 pm Cliff Williams / The Herald Friends and classmates of Masen Googins sign a memorial for the 17 year old who died in a crash Friday. “Forever 17” references Goggins’ age and “Always 23” references his football jersey. By all accounts Masen Goggins always smiled and had a big heart. The 17-year-old Elmore County High School student died in a car wreck Friday. Still in shock, friends, family members and school personnel shared what life with Goggins was like at a Monday prayer vigil. “I have prayed. I cried. I cried for his family, his friends and our school since I learned what happened,” ECHS principal Jason Eason said. “Words sometimes just don’t matter. It is more about being there and loving people. That is what Masen did.” Eason recalled an encounter with Goggins just last week. No word words were spoken, but there it was — Goggins “infectious smile.” “Masen’s light shined bright at Elmore County High School by the way he treated his teachers and friends,” Eason said. “Masen was a special kid. He will always be a part of Elmore County High School.” Vessel Church pastor Adam Turner said Goggins was a great young person and a model for others to emulate. “He was a very respectful young man. He was kind. He was compassionate,” Turner said. “He had a big smile. He had a big heart. He was the greatest friend to so many. He loved this town. He loved this school. He loved the teachers. He loved Dr. Pepper. It has 23 flavors. It is funny how that happened.” Goggins wore jersey No. 23 on the football field. It adorned the walls of the school’s gym for the vigil. ECHS football coach Kyle Caldwell remembers meeting Goggins two years ago as he came to town. “When I first met Masen, he was nothing but smiles and giggles,” Caldwell said. “I didn’t know him and he acted like I was his best friend.” Coach Justin Weeks said he never met anyone quite like Goggins. “He taught me just as much as I taught him,” Weeks said. “He had an infectious laugh. He had a personality that connected with everyone he met.” Weeks shared a story of Goggins being the center of attention at a seven on seven camp at Alabama State University over the summer. He said players from ECHS were huddled up with another teaming during an extended break. Weeks went to investigate and found Goggins shadow boxing someone from the other team. “Afterwards they hung out and got to know each other,” Weeks said. “That was the kind of energy Masen had. He connected people.” Success! An email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup. Error! There was an error processing your request. Want to get special offers in your inbox?

Eason said Goggins loved his family, friends and especially his “momma.” Sister Miley Goggins said she couldn’t remember how times people referred to her as being Masen’s little sister. “Now I hope I don’t get called anything else,” Miley said. “I will never forget how he made me feel included in everything. One of my favorite things is when I would call him when he was with his friends, I made sure to say, ‘I love you.’ He never hesitated to say it back no matter who he was with.” Goggins’ friend group, known as MOB, was obvious at the vigil. Nearly two dozen dressed alike in sweatshirts with the letters. Goggins was often with Tate McNeely. The pair met years ago and have been inseparable. Neely recalled a time when their friendship and Goggins willingness to help his friends. Neely said he was having difficulties on the pitching mound but Goggins made the play. “He always had everyone’s back,” McNeely said McNeely and Goggins were on the golf course over the summer — a lot. “He always found a way to sweet talk somebody into driving us everywhere,” McNeely said. “He was fun to be around.” Tony Ray recalled Thursday night, the day before Goggins’ death. The two were picking up Goggins’ parents and made a pitstop. Like always, Goggins had a way of getting Ray to pay; that night, it was Taco Bell. When it came time to pay he said, ‘I got you next time,’” Ray said. To close the vigil, Eason offered advice for teachers and staff gathered at the vigil. “Let his light shine from your classrooms,” Eason said. “Be there for one another as our students will still need you in the months and years to come.” Eason, fighting back tears, also offered advice to his students. He said he saw the students’ love of Goggins. “I felt it which tells me the impact he had on you. I share your hurt,” Eason said. “The hurt you feel will take time to heal, if it ever does. But make sure you honor your friend by how you live. Be kind to one another. Be there for each other. Be respectful. Love your family and friends the way Masen did. Young people, I love you.” Cliff Williams is a staff writer for Tallapoosa Publishers, Inc. He may be reached via email at cliff.williams@alexcityoutlook.com.

(Courtesy of Regional Clinic) By Emma Kirkemier, News Editor Local healthcare practitioners have joined together at Regional Clinic with the same vision in mind: forming the area’s first multispecialty clinic and prioritizing interdisciplinary patient care. “It’s nice to be part of medicine as a whole,” said Dr. Ken Davenport, MD, FACS, the clinic’s general surgeon. “I think it’s probably good for your medical practice to be around other specialties, to be around people who may see the patient differently than you do because they’ve taken care of different systems.” Supported by the clinic’s five experienced nurse practitioners and many staff members are its seven doctors: Dr. Ramesh Chellamuthu, MD, MBA; Dr. Krishna Keri, MD; Dr. F. Duncan Scott, MD; Dr. Faris-Al Faris, MD; Dr. Nicolas Bordas, MD; Davenport and Dr. Lindsay Frederick, MD. Chellamuthu, Keri and Scott are practicing nephrologists, while Al-Faris is dual-certified in critical care and nephrology. Bordas, who became the first non-nephrology addition to the clinic in 2020, specializes in infectious disease. Davenport is a general surgeon, and Frederick is a gynecologist — in fact the only female gynecologist currently practicing in the area. “It’s unusual,” Davenport said. “It’s only a recent thing where they have multispecialty practices. It really just makes sense, because no one is each other’s boss, but we all have the same viewpoint about how we want to take care of patients. You have a great office, you have a great staff and you’re able to practice the way you want to practice.” “It’s definitely new in this area,” Keri said. “If you go to really big cities, there are physicians who work well together and form a single group, but it’s not that common.” Regional Clinic has seen patients flock to its six locations in recent years to take advantage of its various specialties. “The growth is mainly because there is need,” Keri said. “Once the patients realize there is a (specialized) physician locally available and they don’t have to travel to Birmingham or Chattanooga, they kind of start to come to you, and that has fueled about 20 to 25 percent of our growth. We keep the patients local, so they don’t have to travel too far.” Keri sees the bulk of his nephrology patients in the Gadsden and Boaz offices, as well as covering local hospitals including Gadsden Regional Medical Center, Encompass Rehabilitation Hospital of Gadsden, Riverview Regional Medical Center and Marshall Medical Center South. “This was one of the practices that I found which had an opportunity to serve the community, and that was why I decided to move to Gadsden and start working at Regional Clinic,” Keri said. Keri worked in small towns in Wisconsin and Tennessee before coming to Alabama, realizing along the way that he prefers rural to urban healthcare settings. “Come summer, I get a lot of tomatoes and bell peppers and all this stuff that patients bring to me,” Keri said. “They bring their backyard vegetables, some of them. It is personal in a way; you get to know them really well.” According to Regional Clinic practitioners, relationships fostered in the practice are strengthened by the small-town setting. “I think overall in Gadsden, there’s a great collegial atmosphere amongst the physicians and medical staff, and that’s something I have loved and valued the whole time I’ve been here,” said Frederick, who has been practicing obstetrics and gynecology in Gadsden for 11 years. “I feel so lucky that I came here and have had nothing but wonderful people to work with.” Several doctors also attested to the fact that the interdisciplinary setup makes it much easier to seek consultation. “I don’t need to go through the complicated system of paging or finding a different practice that provides the service, which puts a lot of delay into it,” Al-Faris said. “If you need a different specialty from a different clinic, it might take a day to get the consult, versus I’ll just reach out to my buddy who is across the hall from me, and I’ll get an answer in 10 minutes.” “Working with other physicians within the clinic has been very useful,” Keri agreed. “Nephrologists depend a lot on surgeons for various procedures: putting in the dialysis catheters, removing them, infections related to them and all that. We have a surgeon who is in our group, so we can just talk to him about what to do. And with nephrology and catheters there are a lot of infection situations. We have an ID physician in the group who takes care of this stuff as well.” “I have some patients that I’ve referred to Dr. Davenport, maybe for a breast mass or something like that,” Frederick said. “He is a great resource for me if I need a surgical consult or need to talk to him about a patient, especially because we both do robotic surgery, and he has really moved that along in this area.” – Chellamuthu started the clinic in 2016 as a nephrology practice, but his expansions since then have been strategic and intentional. Chellamuthu recruited each doctor to the practice in turn. “I don’t think that this hodgepodge of people came here randomly,” Bordas said. “This was not coincidental, and I have to give credence to Dr. Chellamuthu. I think he has a very good idea of what he’s doing, and I don’t think it’s a coincidence that we meld like we do.” “This is such a great group,” Frederick said. “You go into places and you can feel an energy, and everyone here is happy to be at work. They’re friendly with patients, and regardless of what type of medicine we practice, I think that personal relationship with the patient is important to all of us.” “I worked with most of them before I joined the practice, so I saw them in the hospital and saw how they talked to patients,” Davenport said. “I saw the courtesy they gave them and the respect they gave them. They’re very patient-forward; they’re kind. It’s wonderful to pour yourself into a practice that you know has those values.” Most of the physicians worked with Chellamuthu and the nurse practitioners in a hospital setting prior to joining the practice, but those that did not still found themselves drawn to Chellamuthu’s ideas. “When I was looking for a job (during residency), I found Regional Clinic,” Al-Faris said. “After the first phone conversation I had with Dr. Chellamuthu, we realized we had the same vision of what we want to do.” According to Al-Faris, the clinic’s main attraction was the opportunity for him to use his full potential as a dual-certified physician. “A lot of places will offer you either to work as a critical care physician or just a nephrologist,” Al-Faris said. “But Dr. Chellamuthu offered me the opportunity to practice integrated nephrology and critical care, the way it’s meant to be.” Al-Faris was the first-ever fellow to specialize in critical care/nephrology at his program in Albany, New York. “The critical care/nephrology specialty is very young,” he said. “There are few places around the country that offer training. It came out of necessity that nephrology is a specialty that’s heavy on physiology and how the body mechanics work. Understanding that helps you manage the most sick patients.” Unlike most of their peers at Regional Clinic, Al-Faris and his partner Bart Clapp, DNP, CRNP, almost exclusively see patients in local hospitals. “Whenever any patient in any specialty gets sick enough that there is a life-threatening condition — no matter what the illness was, whether it’s an infection or an organ failure like heart failure or kidney failure or a stroke — if that condition becomes life threatening, they need more attention and care,” Al-Faris explained. “And that’s when they become an ICU patient. You have to act quick, and you will see the result of that quick. When you have someone who’s not able to breathe, the next day you can have them sitting up saying, ‘Oh, I feel so much better.’ That is something you cannot do in regular internal medicine. That’s what critical care medicine can do.” “We don’t see anybody in the clinic,” Clapp added. “[Al-Faris] might not be as widely known as some of the other physicians, just because he’s not in the community as much, but if you come to our hospital and you’re under Dr. Al-Faris’ care, it’s going to be A-plus.” The mutual respect between practitioners was evident in their speech. “Not every small community hospital has a specialist that’s this deeply specialized,” Al-Faris'}]"

Oliver recalled playing baseball on the park’s diamond in his youth in 1959, the year after it opened. The field had since become overgrown, but the city recently restored it, complete with new fences. Oliver’s wife Teresa attested to the fact that the councilman frequently spent time in and around the park or driving by to check on the construction and restoration efforts. “That’s how you know that he was really passionate about this,” she said. “He’s been working towards this for a long time.” According to Attalla Mayor Larry Means, the city has made good use of the site since acquiring it from the former Attalla Elementary School that once occupied the property. Means noted that citizens often make use of the gym, as well as the baseball diamond, basketball court, walking trail and playground. District 2 Councilman Anthony E. Cylar alluded to the possibility of adding a batting cage near the baseball field in the future. With his continuous time and attention to the project, Oliver noted that there was still work to be done, including, eradicating a few ant beds alongside the walking track.

Daniel Thomas pose for a photo at the Thursday, Sept. 7 meeting of the Gadsden Rotary Club at the Gadsden Country Club. By Kaitlin Hoskins, News Editor The Gadsden Rotary Club welcomed Major General Sheryl Gordon to its weekly meeting at the Gadsden Country Club last Thursday, September 7. Gordon, the Alabama National Guard’s first female general officer, spoke to Rotary Club members about the Alabama Army and Air National Guard, its mission and her role as adjunct general and future plans for the Guard. Gordon assumed her duties as the 42nd adjutant general of the Alabama National Guard, July 28, 2017. As adjutant general, she advises the governor on military affairs and commands the Alabama Army and Air National Guard and its more than 12,000 citizen soldiers and airmen. She became the Alabama National Guard’s first female general officer in 2009 and is the first female adjutant general in Alabama National Guard history. Prior to her selection as Adjutant General, Gordon served as Assistant Adjutant General and Commander of the 62nd Troop Command in Montgomery. So far in her career, Gordon has earned several awards and decorations, such as Meritorious Service Medal (with 2 Bronze Oak Leaf Clusters), Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal (with 1 Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster), Army Reserve Component Achievement Medal (with 1 Silver Oak Leaf Cluster and 2 Bronze Oak Leaf Clusters), National Defense Service Medal, Humanitarian Service Medal, Armed Forces Reserve Medal (with Silver Hourglass Device), Army Service Ribbon, Army Reserve Component Overseas Training Ribbon (with Numeral 2), Alabama Veteran Service Medal (with 1 Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster) and Alabama Special Service Ribbon. She also received the Alabama Faithful Service Ribbon (with Silver and Bronze Saint Andrews Cross) and Alabama Basic Training Ribbon. During her informative talk at the Gadsden Rotary Club, Gordon explained what the Alabama National Guard does, like responding to natural and man-made disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and wildfires. She also explained how soldiers in the national guard hold civilian jobs or attend college while maintaining their military training part time, like Gadsden Mayor Craig Ford, who is an active member of the Alabama National Guard and was just promoted to the rank of major this past week. Gordon shared with those in attendance that the Alabama National Guard would be getting new F-35 fighter jets in December. The aircrafts will replace the old F-16s that are being phased out. Gordon hopes the new F-35s will be able to have the signature red tails, like the F-16s did. Gordon also spoke about overseas training missions and recent deployments of the Alabama Guard. Gordon explained the how the national guard has a dual state-federal mission, which means that the soldiers protect domestically but can also be deployed to assist overseas in times of need. To round out her speech, Gordon said she was blessed to be able to do this for her career. For more information about the Alabama Army and Air National Guard, visit www.al.ng.mil.

Michael Keaton thought his vision of Batman was unlikely to happen. The 71-year-old actor took on the title role of the superhero in the 1989 film directed by Tim Burton and returned to star in its 1992 sequel \'Batman Returns\' but explained that he believed his own views on the character would not make the final cut because he couldn\'t imagine anyone wanting to see him portrayed in that way. He told Empire: ""I remember exactly where we were. He said, \'I wanna talk to you about something… I just want you to read this, because I think I\'m gonna make this movie\' What\'s interesting if you think about this is that up until then, his and my relationship was only \'Beetlejuice\'. So there was something, I don\'t know that I\'ve ever asked him this, actually, but something gave him the idea and so he said, \'go home and read it. ""I said, \'Well, no one\'s going to do what I think, this is probably not going to happen, because I can\'t imagine anyone would want to make the movie that I see\' and all I said, \'listen to me Tim.\' And I started to go down the list of the guy, Bruce Wayne with him, my take on him and he didn\'t say anything but his hair was long at the time and I could see it moving as he nodded, \'yes… yes… Exactly.\' He\'s a rare breed, a true artist and a true original. He was already seeing it and it was basically the Frank Miller stuff. And I wasn\'t aware of all that stuff, I just knew what it was, but I knew I had to read the Miller stuff. And I thought, \'oh, this could be interesting.\'"" Michael added that his vision of the Bruce Wayne character was as having a ""depressed"" nature and recalled that Tim complied with the idea to his surprise. He said: ""He\'s depressed. I wasn\'t really committing to it because I didn\'t know what he\'d say. Actually, I don\'t know I thought he might say but if I was saying it to a studio exec, they\'d say, \'I don\'t know if he\'s really depressed… I\'m not so sure…\' I was sweating bullets and Tim said, \'Oh yeah, for sure.\' We also thought he was odd, an odd dude, which was fun."" Mel B is still trying to ""build herself back up"" from her marriage to Stephen Belafonte. The 48-year-old pop star was married to the producer from 2007 until 2017 in what she has alleged was an abusive relationship - although he has always denied the claims - and only realised when she managed to get herself out of it just how ""bad"" it was. She told OK! Magazine: ""You\'re told day in day out that you\'re fat, you\'re ugly and that no-one is going to want you. I had that for 10 years, as well as all the other abuse my abuser did to me. ""Your self-esteem and worth are at zero so you have to build yourself back up, which I\'m still doing to this day. Looking back, it was only when I got out of that relationship that I realised how bad it had all been, and then I had to embark on getting myself back to how I was before I was married."" The Spice Girls star - who was known as Scary Spice during her time in the 1990s girl group alongside Geri Halliwell, Victoria Beckham, Emma Bunton and Melanie C - is now engaged to hairdresser Rory McPhee and explained how she has turned to fitness for the sake of her mental wellbeing. She added: ""At the start of January, I gave myself a proper New Year\'s resolution that I really stuck to and gave my lifestyle a complete turnaround. I made sure I was getting enough sleep, meaning I now go to bed at 9.30pm during the week and wake up at the same time every day. ""Weekends are different because I still like to socialise and I like to have a Sunday dinner. I\'ve been doing weights too. I committed myself to doing a really good weights workout twice a week, and some long dog walks. I\'ve been sticking to it and have seen my body shape get back to how it used to be. ""I\'m focusing on my mental health too, making sure I\'m doing some mindfulness and some yoga just to give my brain a good clear out of all the crap that I\'ve accumulated over the years."" Black Sabbath star Geezer Butler had to cut out ""at least 50 pages"" from his memoirs for legal reasons. The 73-year-old rocker is best known for being part of the heavy metal band alongside Tony Iommi, Bill Ward and Ozzy Osbourne and explained that when writing his memoir \'Into the Void\' - which is due to be released on June 6 - that the ""original manuscript was deemed unsuitable for modern readers"" and he was forced to omit some of its content when lawyers descended upon the publishing house. He told The Sunday Times: ""At least 50 pages of them [had to go]! I had this whole thing back from them, \'You can\'t say this; you can\'t say that. I said, \'I was with Black Sabbath, not the Osmonds.\' "" Geezer - whose real name is Terence - also explains in the book that the band ended up stealing various items from gigs and selling them for scrap metal after firing band manager Patrick Meehan and finding themselves without a great deal of cash despite signing a massive record deal. He said: ""God knows how much Warner Brothers advanced for the albums. Apparently, it was one of the biggest amounts of money ever in the record business. All we wanted to do was play music."" Meanwhile, the \'Sweat Leaf\' hitmaker endured a nervous breakdown in 1998 just after the band had got back together and went on to add that all these years later he is unable to really enjoy anything nor feel any ""misery"" towards anything because of the medication he is on. He said; ""I think it\'s probably because of the antidepressants I\'m on. You can\'t get really excited about anything. but you can\'t get miserable about anything."" \'\'Into the Void: From Birth to Black Sabbath and Beyond\' is due to be released on Thursday 8 June. Britney Spears says she has gained weight. The 41-year-old pop star took to social media on Sunday (04.06.23) to share a video of herself dancing around to the Janet Jackson hit \'All Nite (Don\'t Stop)\' where she wore white knee-high boots, turquoise bikini bottoms and white crop top and noted in the caption - which was initially in Spanish - that she has put on a few founds but is now able to ""move her butt"" all day. She captioned the post: ""I gained weight, but at least I have butt now and can move it all day!"" The \'...Baby One More Time\' hitmaker - who regained control of her multimillion dollar fortune and various aspects of her life since a conservatorship that had been governed by her family for over a decade was terminated in November 2021 - recently took to social media to seemingly deny rumours that she had had a breast enhancement in the early days of her career. Alongside a throwback snap of herself in a bra, Britntey - who has sons Sean, 17, and 16-year-old Jayden with ex-husband Kevin Federline but is now married to actor Sam Asghari - wrote on Instagram: ""Only shoot I ever did in the woods !!! Way back before I had kids. only thing I remember is my stylist saying \'Uhhhhhhhhhhh !!! Your boobs Britney … they\'re huge what happened ???\' I said I have no idea [shrugging emoji!"" Just weeks ago, the \'Toxic\' singer was reunited with her mother Lynne after years of not speaking amid the conservatorship battle. Sources told TMZ that Lynne was driven from LAX airport to the home of Britney\'s manager, Cade Hudson, and from there took an Uber to her daughter\'s home. Insiders told the outlet that ""the ice between mother and daughter is thawing"" and the pair had exchanged text messages before Lynne came to visit. The source added: ""Lynne is committed to making it right with her daughter."" After her mom left, Britney and her husband took a short drive before returning home. Niecy Nash gets bombarded with requests for therapy sessions. The 53-year-old actress features in the TV series \'Never Have I Ever\' as therapist Dr. Jamie Ryan and admits that fans are unable to separate fiction from reality. Niecy told Entertainment Tonight: ""Oh, let me tell you something, everybody wants it. They\'re all in my DMs, asking me what I think. I said, \'Listen, I play a therapist on TV. Everybody relax.\' ""Here\'s the thing, I go to therapy so I do have'}]"

Local news organizations went to work, too, dispatching photographers, reporters and videographers to capture the scene and bring the story to your screens. Still other reporters worked the phones, getting the latest on school closings, road barriers, outages and other disruptions. Later, stories of faith, survival and grief would emerge, as neighbors recalled their fear, and Flatwood honored those lost to the storm. Local journalists aren\'t just casual observers. They live in and care deeply about their communities. At the Montgomery Advertiser, having a stake in what happens here is integral to our mission of strengthening communities through discovery, connection, solutions and the celebration of our neighbors. This is the kind of journalism that improves communities. It gets people talking about what is acceptable — and what isn\'t — in the way our governments are run, our children are taught, our health care is managed. It has impact. Readers tell us so. In today\'s Montgomery Advertiser, you\'ll find the Impact Report, a premium edition that highlights some of the stories that made a difference in our USA TODAY Network communities in 2022. It includes our election guide, our climate coverage, and 26 vignettes selected from our newsrooms across the nation. We recently assembled a list of 20 of the biggest stories in Montgomery in 2022. But some of our most impactful work of the past year was building relationships that allowed us to deliver continuing coverage of our readers\' most important stories. Meet some of the reporters and photojournalists behind that work. Over the past 18 months, Hadley Hitson has been covering the rural South for the Montgomery Advertiser and Report for America. Her role was created to serve readers who reside in news deserts, and it was funded by Gannett, Report for America, and the generous donations of our readers. From the first days, Hitson has reported for these residents, not about them. It\'s a distinction that has allowed her to truly understand their needs, put the public officials who serve those rural communities on alert, connect rural residents with trusted resources and deliver a bigger bullhorn. Here\'s how Hitson describes the impact of this work: ""A lack of access to basic necessities like healthcare, sanitation and education remains common throughout the rural Black Belt. During 2022, the Advertiser dedicated time and space to highlighting these rural problems and the people solving them. ""The goal was not to give Black Belt residents a voice — theirs have been shouting for years. Instead, the Advertiser published dozens of articles with the goal of amplifying these voices and delivering them to readers who would not otherwise know much about these rural towns that dot the state. In turn, many of our readers stepped in to make a difference. ""Some donated to the Black Belt Unincorporated Wastewater Program, which is working to solve Lowndes County’s sewage crisis. Others submitted public comments to the state regarding the landfill that Uniontown residents say is polluting their community. A few reached out to connect people featured in articles with resources to help their situations. ""And all in all, there was progress: decisions made, resources dispersed and communities connected."" Brad Harper covers a wide array of topics, each with some tether to our local business community and public servants. Harper loves to tell stories about the people of Montgomery, and he coaches reporters for our Community Hero series. He\'s also deeply interested in the ways Montgomery preserves its history and lifts its oldest neighborhoods. From Harper: ""Communities are held together by the resilience and dedication of their people, their civic engagement, their access to opportunity and the history that all of that was built upon, for better or worse. That’s especially true in Montgomery, and it’s why we remain dedicated to helping our readers understand those issues through changing times. Historical tourism:Activist Michelle Browder buys site where J. Marion Sims experimented on slaves ""Amid reports of underage workers in the state’s manufacturing industry in 2022, our exclusive coverage has detailed why Alabama’s worker shortage is unique and charted efforts to implement a new education and training model on the local level. We’ve gone behind the news of a record $1.7 billion surge in Montgomery business investment to analyze why those projects are coming, while also following a push for more investment in west Montgomery ahead of next year’s whitewater park opening. Building a new future:City buys Governor\'s House Hotel, will demolish it for new project ""From council meetings to planning sessions, we’ve analyzed the ground-level decisions that shape local government and strived to give residents the information and tools they need to get involved. At the same time, we continued to honor the everyday heroes in the community who are committed to making this a better place in every aspect of life — educators, activists, blue-collar heroes and more, some of whom have been rolling up their sleeves since the civil rights era."" Drove adoptions:Dogs euthanized \'to make space\' as Montgomery area shelters are overwhelmed by increasing animal cruelty cases Evan Mealins joined the Montgomery Advertiser in June as our Justice & Equity reporter. His work goes beyond the criminal justice system to explore the social justice issues of our time. Mealins\' take: ""One of the biggest themes that emerged in 2022 around Alabama\'s justice system was mobilization. Prisoners led a labor strike protesting their often destitute living conditions and harsh sentences; activists and sympathetic Alabamians led rallies protesting the same; the governor moved to stop executions after a series of failed attempts to carry out the ultimate punishment. Three-hour delay:ADOC \'cannot confirm\' if Joe Nathan James Jr. was fully conscious before his execution Alan Eugene Miller:Alabama death row inmate relays \'painful and traumatic\' hours before state called off Sept. 22 execution Another failed execution:Kenneth Smith \'strapped to a gurney\' for hours as courts weighed appeals ""We reported on all of the above, helping make more Alabamians aware of the apparent infection of injustice into the state\'s justice system, from arrests to sentencing. While not aligned in their mission, activism and in-depth reporting are symbiotic — impactful stories raise interest to overlooked issues, creating action and the desire for continuing reporting. ""Many of the conversations, protests, court filings and government actions might not have happened if not for the Advertiser and other outlets shining a light on injustice."" Jake Crandall and Mickey Welsh bring stories to life through their extraordinary photography and videos. Each shared a few of the images that meant the most to them over the past year, and a full gallery of the year\'s best. ""When I think of the impact of photojournalism, I\'m thinking of the visual context our photos give to our stories. Whether it\'s just a face to a name, or a setting, or an emotional connection. ""When I think of the photos that embody that, first is Perman Hardy, a Lowndes County activist, standing in her backyard where the sewage drains. The story:In Lowndes County, 80% of homes lack reliable sewage systems. These women got tired of waiting. ""Next is the Tallapoosa Girls Ranch, which was difficult because we could not photograph faces. I love the setting and the obvious friendship and connection. The story:A year after I-65 crash killed 10, Tallapoosa Girls Ranch director leans into work, love for ranch family ""And then the photo of JD Davison, the Fort Deposit hometown hero, returning to celebrate after being drafted into the NBA. I just love that he is the big star now, but he is walking down this street in his hometown like he probably has a thousand times before. It really shows his humble personality."" Here are some of Welsh\'s picks: ""One shows a large crowd of protestors at the Alabama capitol and their fervor for reproductive rights during a rally responding to the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. ""The next shows a moment between a mother and her transgender son as they discuss their options as the Alabama Legislature passes bills restricting medical care for transgender youth in the state. ""The third shows Alabama State University Head Coach Eddie Robinson, Jr., celebrating with his team after they defeated Alabamas A&M in their biggest game of the year in his first season."" Your support as readers, subscribers and donors has allowed us to do much of this work. And we are committed to bringing you even more in 2023. We appreciate each of you, and wish you the best of all that the new year has to offer. Paige O. Windsor is the executive editor of the Montgomery Advertiser. Reach her at pwindsor@gannett.com.'}]"

10:36 am Thursday, November 9, 2023 By Wayne Clark LANETT — The Lanett mayor and council had a discussion on Monday about the salary of a city employee. Perhaps it might have been more appropriate to have taken place in an executive session, but near the end of Monday’s open session it came up over Richard Carter’s $85,000 annual salary as airport manager. The discussion began after Mayor Jamie Heard said he didn’t like the way he was being treated by some members of the council. “I’m an honest person and try to treat everyone the way I would like to be treated,” he said. “I don’t like to be accused of doing something wrong when I haven’t done anything wrong.” He added that this was all about Carter’s salary. “I want someone to tell me what I did wrong,” he said. “He was approved for the position by the council, and his salary was approved in the budget. If I did something wrong, I want to know what it was.” City Attorney Stanley Gray said the salary was with the recommendation for hire made by the council’s three-member Airport Committee, which is made up by Council Members Angelia Thomas, Tifton Dobbs and Ronnie Tucker. “The Airport Committee discussed this and made a recommendation to the mayor and council,” Heard said. “I think we have already discussed what should have been discussed.” Tucker said he doesn’t remember voting on the salary. “I don’t have a problem with the salary,” he said. “I just have a problem in how it was approved.” Dobbs said the problem with bringing it up is that it was setting a new precedent. The salary is based on what the council did in approving the hire and approving the city’s annual budget. “We voted on the salary, and the person to fill the job,” he said. Tucker then said the discussion shouldn’t be going on in an open session. “I don’t think the mayor intended to do anything wrong,” Thomas said. “It’s something the committee needs to discuss, have an agreement and bring it to the full council. We need to do things the right way. This has nothing to do with Mr. Carter, the mayor or the committee. Let’s just stop pointing fingers.” “This is in the budget,” the mayor said. “I’m the kind of person who speaks my mind. This is something that should have been agreed to before we voted on it. I don’t want this subject to be talked about in 20 different ways when we leave here. If you ever have a concern about something, pick up the phone and call me.” Gray said he was open to talk to any member of the council any time on any issue. Complicating the matter is a $10,000 clerical error that had to be corrected. “There’s no ethical problem here,” Gray said. “His salary is in the approved budget,” the mayor said. “We need to have a come to Jesus agreement on what the salary should be,” Tucker said. “We need to be doing things the right way.

Troup County Manager Eric Mosley clarified in a follow-up interview that the LaGrange Callaway Airport that the airport manager makes $68,000 a year.

This would be big news for the city. Airports where business class jets can land and refuel will bring in more air traffic and generate some significant revenue for the city. “You will see a big increase in planes and helicopters here once we start selling jet fuel,” Carter said. “We are doing okay right now with gas we are selling to the turboprop planes.” Carter said the biggest plane that has landed so far in Lanett is a Falcon 900.

Road in Rainbow City. (Submitted photo) By Emma Kirkemier, News Editor Nick and Sarah Burtram are bringing the bin business to Rainbow City. The couple’s business Buddy Bins opened at 105 Sutton Bridge Road on March 10. Nick and Sarah are 2016 and 2018 graduates of Ashville High School, respectively, and both performed in the Gadsden State Show Band. The two owners’ concept is simple: purchase large pallets of merchandise from liquidation warehouses — merchandise usually consisting of returns to large corporate retailers like Amazon — and sell the items individually at discounted prices. “We get it from various stores like that, and then we sell it for a certain price per day, starting at $8 and then working its way down throughout the week,” Nick said. Buddy Bins is freshly stocked on Friday, when the price per item is $8. Saturday’s price goes down to $6, then Monday to $4, Tuesday to $3, Wednesday to $2 and Thursday to $1. The store is closed on Sunday. The tricky thing about liquidation merchandise, the Burtrams said, is that they are unfamiliar with the content until it arrives. “It really just varies week to week,” Sarah said. “We’re not really going to know until that shipment comes in, because it really is a mystery even to us what we’re getting. We don’t know what we’re buying until we get it.” According to Sarah, however, that variety characterizes the appeal of bin stores. “It’s a big treasure hunt,” she said, and her husband agreed. “To sum it all up, it literally is a treasure hunt,” he said. “You come in here and you look through a bunch of stuff, and some stuff isn’t worth what the dollar day is, but then at the very bottom you could find something that’s worth $300.” The Burtrams distribute items throughout the store’s namesake bins, awaiting customers to discover their hidden gems. The thrill of discovery is not reserved solely for the customer, however; the owners find items in their stock, even days after the merchandise has been loaded into bins, that they did not know they had. “I will tell you, I have touched everything in this store, and I can only name a select few things,” Sarah said. “And on top of that, we’ve stocked every single one of these bins, and we can still walk up to a bin and see stuff we didn’t know we had,” Nick added. The Buddy Bins building is filled with containers stacked with merchandise. The fragile items are removed from the general bins and displayed on a rack at the back of the store. These are glass items, dishes and other breakable materials. Meanwhile, the distinctive blue bins hold everything from children’s toys to home decor to tools to diaper bags. Valuable finds have included name-brand shoes, sprinklers, comforters, Amazon Echos and other electronics. “Whenever people try to ask us what kind of stuff we have, I literally can’t say,” Nick said. “I have to say, ‘a little bit of everything.’” He joked that the store is currently overstocked with packages of zip ties, which came by the hundreds in one fateful shipment and are being sold for $1 each, regardless of the day’s fixed price on other items. “This is people’s hobby,” Sarah said. “Everything in this store, it’s all ‘wants,’ so everybody is spending their fun money, basically, on this type of stuff.” While both are new entrepreneurs, Sarah has several years of experience in the bin business. “I worked over in Bargain Bins (in Gadsden) for two years,” she said. “I was assistant manager, and then I just found a passion for this type of stuff. [Nick] is actually letting me follow my dream and making it his.” Sarah enjoys the variety in her work, as well as the process itself. “There’s something about seeing the store empty out every week, like all the products gone, and then it refills every single week,” she said. “It’s cool to watch, and no day in this store looks exactly the same.” Both owners agreed that launching Buddy Bins has taught them a lot about the world of retail. “I would have never thought that I would be a business owner,” Sarah said. “If you would have asked me last year about this, I probably would have told you that you were crazy.

We’re going to try and get between 24 and 26 7-foot-tall pallets of merchandise at a time. That should last us two weeks.” Physically unloading the merchandise, as well as keeping track of it, presents a unique challenge that is sometimes just as unpredictable as the items themselves. “It doesn’t need to go unsaid that we have a lot of family that have helped,” Nick said. The store has received much family and church support, the latter coming from the Burtrams’ home church of Goldenrod Avenue Baptist in Gadsden. The journey to opening day began months ago, when the couple first decided on the concept of their business. “We started the idea back in August,” Sarah said. “But we really didn’t get to start renovating, of course, until we got here in January.” Buddy Bins currently employs only Nick and Sarah Burtram — “It’s all us,” they said. “Since being in college and in band together, we haven’t really had a hobby together,” Sarah said. “So it’s cool getting back into something together like we used to.

Annie Dee Wilkerson Moody Dearman pulling up at her Fairfield home. “Each week until the renovation of the old courthouse is complete, we will commemorate the history of the building by remembering a trial or event that happened there.” Dwight Hyndle Shelton was found not guilty in the murder of his aunt, Annie Dee Moody Wilkerson Dearman in Lawrence County, by a jury of his peers. The case, which unfolded in 1968, revolved around the tragic events of October 4, 1967, when Dearman was shot five times in her front yard in the Fairfield community. The evening of the incident, Dearman had spent her time with her boyfriend, despite the fact that she was a married woman. Her husband, Virgil Dearman, and their children were home and said to be asleep during the murder. Initial statements from Virgil claimed he had heard the gunshots and spotted an unidentified car speeding away from the scene. However, in subsequent testimony, Virgil altered his account, suggesting it was, in fact, Shelton’s truck he had seen leaving the vicinity, but that he was too afraid to implement Shelton during his first interview. The prosecutor, focused on witness testimonies indicating that Shelton had been seen at Draper’s Market late that night, which would have put him near the scene of the crime, corroborating Virgil’s accusation. They also pointed out that Shelton and Dearman had been in a fight just days before her murder, where she was said to have shot at Shelton’s truck, telling him to get out of her yard. In a public statement, Shelton’s attorney stated that Shelton had been out of town during the time of the murder making it impossible for him to have committed the murder, however, in what has been described as a bold move, his attorney did not call one single witness to testify on behalf of his client during the trial. The wife of Dearman’s boyfriend testified that she’d recently learned of the affair between Dearman and her husband. She went on to explain that Dearman laughed at her when she confronted her about the affair, which prompted her to tell Dearman that she would “get even with her.” Dearman, who typically carried a gun, did not have one on her the night of her murder. Her boyfriend explained to police that he’d had possession of her gun, because Dearman had a bad feeling that someone was planning to hurt him and asked him to take her gun to protect himself. Judge Reneau Almon presided over the trial that captured the attention of Lawrence County residents, primarily due to its intricate web of relationships, potential motives, and the baffling nature of the crime. Onlookers regarded the case as a genuine whodunit, given the number of potential suspects and their potential reasons for harming Dearman. Years later, ghost stories and theories are still being told, and people have come from all over to try and crack the case. Curious residents and investigators alike have consumed local tales, as well as published pieces regarding the murder, including a book titled “Back to Midnight” by Glenda Yarborough, which was loosely based on the murder. Elesia Dearman Reinhardt, Annie’s daughter, remembers her mother, “She used to plant sunflowers outside her bedroom window and sing ‘You are my Sunshine’ to me and my brothers.” Records state that Dearman was shot anywhere from just feet away, and many have pointed out the irony in she and Shelton being buried just feet from one another in Moulton Memory Gardens. Annie was also buried next to her first husband, Jonas Moody, not Virgil Dearman. Log In Keep it Clean. Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexually-oriented language.

The body was autopsied, and then returned to the Marshall County Coroner’s Office. The child was buried in the Crestview Cemetery in Guntersville under the name of Angel Jane Doe. In 2019, Sheriff’s Office officials provided Parabon NanoLabs with samples from a 26-year-old cold case of a body found in Marshall County.

On Nov. 30, Sheriff’s Office investigators, District Attorney’s Office investigators and the coroner’s office retrieved the remains of Angel Jane Doe from Crestview Cemetery. The remains were taken to the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences for DNA retrieval. Nugent said back in the 1980s, DNA testing wasn’t widely available. Today, any body taken to the Department of Forensic Sciences has DNA collected and filed. Back at the time Baby Angel Doe was found, that wasn’t the case. After her DNA is collected, Nugent said her remains will be returned to her gravesite. Hundreds of thousands of genetic markers are read from a DNA sample using microarray genotyping. Parabon has worked with partner labs to create an optimized protocol to ensure high-quality results be obtained from forensic DNA samples. The resulting genotype data can then be compared to other genotype samples in public GG databases. Using software tools that objectively compare genotype files, it is possible to determine how much, if any, DNA is shared between two individuals and estimate how closely or distantly related they are.

During the hour-long media day session, Alabama football backup quarterback Ty Simpson spent much of it sitting at a round table to the left of Tyler Buchner. Buchner, another backup quarterback, has already made clear he will be leaving Alabama after the season ends. He announced he will be transferring to Notre Dame to play lacrosse. It remains to be seen whether the guy who was sitting next to him Saturday also decides to transfer out. Simpson was competing with Jalen Milroe for the starting quarterback job coming into the 2023 season, but he never found a way to surpass him. When Alabama officially named a starter before Ole Miss, it was Milroe and has been Milroe the rest of the way. Milroe has already announced he will be back next season; Has Simpson made a decision? ""I’m really just focused on Michigan right now,"" Simpson told The Tuscaloosa News. ""I haven’t really thought about where I’m going or if I’m going to stay or whatever. I love this team, I love this coaching staff, I love the University of Alabama. But right now I’m just really focused on, if my number gets called, beating Michigan."" If Alabama loses the Rose Bowl, the former five-star quarterback won\'t have tons of time to think about his decision. The transfer portal window closes Jan. 2 for all players not part of a New Year\'s Six bowl, and those players have an extended five days. Does that make things stressful having a small window? ""It certainly does,"" Simpson said. ""You look at Malik Murphy who’s a friend of mine at Texas. He felt like transferring was best for him and he left the team when they were going to the playoffs. It certainly does. But I think there’s a lot of credibility with staying and waiting out and making sure this is the right place to be or whatever. It certainly does for sure. At the same time, I committed to the University of Alabama at the start of the season and when I was a recruit and I’m going to own up to that commitment until the season ends."" TOMMY REES: Inside the mind of Tommy Rees, the coach who revived Alabama offense en route to Rose Bowl MIKE BROCK: Bear Bryant helped launch his law career. Now Mike Brock helps Alabama as a trustee If Simpson decides to return, the quarterback room will be crowded in 2024. After Milroe, as of right now, the room will include Dylan Lonergan, Eli Holstein and Julian Sayin, a five-star quarterback in the 2023 class who is with the team this week as an early enrollee. Simpson in his second season with the Crimson Tide served as Milroe\'s primary backup. He saw time in six games, finishing the season 11 of 20 (55%) for 179 yards with no touchdowns and no interceptions. He was sacked five times but ran for two touchdowns. He averaged 6.1 yards per carry. Simpson entered after Buchner against South Florida, and Simpson managed enough to get Alabama the win. He completed 5 of 9 passes that day for 73 yards but was sacked five times in about a half of action. He did run for a touchdown in the game vs. USF, though. And he almost had a long touchdown run vs. Chattanooga, but he let go of the ball short of the goal line. ""I’ve certainly grown a lot, to the USF game to the last games I’ve been in, I’ve certainly got to hold onto the ball, but that’s a learning moment,"" Simpson said. ""Confidence in myself and confidence and understanding what the offense is trying to do, I feel like it’s been a night and day difference. I’m really excited about my future.""

Free Access Roan Gannon Before he was Dr. Roan Gannon at Sand Mountain Family Practice, the Guntersville resident and physician was a pilot in the Army and later a flight instructor before going to medical school and flying for the Marshall County Sheriff’s Office on an as-needed basis. As a third generation military man, Dr. Gannon was active duty Army from 1997–after graduating in 1996 from UAB with a major in political science and a minor in theater–through 2004. One of his grandfathers was a Merchant Marine in WWII, the other helped build the first nuclear bomb on the Manhattan Project. His father was an Air Force fighter pilot. Dr. Gannon knew he wanted to fly, but it was the Army who accepted him into flight school first. “The year I got in was pretty tough to get flight spots for any branch, so when the Army said you’ve been selected, I went,” he said. Dr. Gannon went to Fort Rucker (now Fort Novosel), Alabama, which is where all training for Army aviators takes place. He then spent a year in Korea, becoming an aircraft commander, before coming back to the States to Fort Campbell, where he was stationed with the 101st Airborne. He then rotated back to Fort Rucker and was trained to become a flight instructor. The day he moved back, though, turned out to be a pivotal one: He arrived at his new apartment in Dothan the night of Sept. 10, 2001. The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon happened the very next morning. That day was quite “chaotic” and, since he hadn’t officially signed in to Fort Rucker yet, Dr. Gannon wasn’t sure what to do. “I was literally between the 101st Airborne at Fort Campbell and Fort Rucker,” he said. “So, I called back to Fort Cambell and asked if I needed to come back.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 1:29 pm The Jackson County Commission will use American Rescue Plan Act funds to renovate the former DHR building, located on Liberty Lane in Scottsboro, and will relocate county administrative offices to this location. In 2021, the Biden administration implemented the American Rescue Plan Act in response to the economic crises that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. Jackson County has received $10,027,745 in funds from this plan. Jackson County Commission Chairman Bill Nance said the pandemic put a strain on the economy across the nation, and Jackson County was no exception. “We had to shut down a number of services that were provided across the county,” Nance recalled of the pandemic. The funds must be obligated by December 24, 2024, and must be spent by December of 2026. Nance said he and the commission are working hard to make sure all of the funds are obligated for citizens to ensure the money is not pulled back. When planning on how to spend the ARPA money, Nance said the commission looked at projects that had to be done. These funds will allow the commission to complete many needed projects without having to borrow against the General Fund. Liberty Lane One of the biggest projects the county will undertake with its ARPA funds is to renovate a building located on Liberty Lane, where DHR was once housed. After the renovation, the following offices will be housed there: revenue commission, mapping and appraisal, probate judge, Jackson County Cooperative Extension Office, Community Action Agency and driver’s license testing. The offices are currently located in the courthouse and at a county building located on Highway 72. “There are a couple of things that we thought about when we got into the discussion about Liberty Lane,” Nance said. “First of all, we have a building that is right at 19,000 square feet that has been vacant for about five years. The building is in really good shape and it is in a good location in terms of accessibility.” Besides accessibility, Nance said the county is responsible for a number of buildings and fewer buildings would be more cost efficient. “Most of those buildings are not in excellent shape,” he said. “It’s a big maintenance cost … If we could consolidate into fewer buildings it is more cost efficient for us to do that.” The commission also took juvenile court into consideration when planning this change of venue. Juvenile Court will fill the space that is left open once the offices currently located in the courthouse move to the Liberty Lane location. “Juvenile court is a very emotional situation when they are having to deal with families and the issues that they deal with there,” Nance said. Nance explained that response time to an emergency situation at the juvenile court building, which is currently located on Broad Street, might not be sufficient. “That building is separated from us by a distance … The judges felt that moving juvenile court into the courthouse was a very good solution to that … this is an opportunity for safety and welfare of families and court personnel to be in a more consolidated location,” Nance said. The commission expects to award the contract for renovation of the building in February. The cost will be $2 million. “The renovation is not going to be just paint the walls and take up the carpet,” Nance said. “We are really going to renovate that building to make it more convenient for the services that we provide. The people will be able to park right in front, walk in the door, do their business and walk out.” There are 125 parking spaces at this location. The commission office, Veteran’s Affairs, the sheriff’s office and the board of registrars will remain in the courthouse, along with the courts of Jackson County. The old juvenile court building and the county extension building will be sold to help fund modifications and renovations at the courthouse. Courthouse modifications and repair When the administrative offices vacate their space in the courthouse, modifications will be made to house juvenile court. ARPA funds will be used to replace the courthouse HVAC system and install a new county communications and IT system. In addition to that, the courthouse has several structural issues that must be addressed. “This courthouse has had a foundation issue for years and years,” Nance said. A report from 2017 showed that there are issues caused by water intrusion. “The system we have to remove water from the roof is not adequate,” Nance said. “It overflows and goes right down to the side of the courthouse. That has created structural issues. The settling has created some cracks in the foundation and porticos have cracks. We have roof issues as well.” Nance said while these issues are not an imminent threat, if they are not corrected they will continue to worsen. The commission has been working with an engineering and architecture firm to develop a design that will address all of these issues. “This is work that has to be done to preserve this very historic and beautiful old courthouse,” Nance said. “And so this is an opportunity to use ARPA funding and not have to borrow money.” The projected cost of these improvements will be $3.7 million in ARPA funds and $700,000 from a state grant. Water projects Another area the commission wanted to focus the county’s ARPA funds on is water. “We decided we would try to help our Water Authority for water projects. They are responsible for water, but in the American Rescue Plan one of the areas for counties was to improve water infrastructure,” Nance said. Local water authorities put together a list of projects and submitted grants to the state. The county offered to use ARPA funds to pay any matching funds that might be required. “We have had a number that have been approved to date, and some of them came in without requiring matching funds,” Nance said. The commission so far has contributed $1,079,951 in ARPA funds to aid water authorities in improving water quality in the county. These projects include running water lines to the Wannville community, helping Pisgah cover matching funds for an ADEM grant to finish upgrades to its water system, helping the DeKalb and Jackson Water Authority improve water quality for 3,500 Jackson County households, and partnering with the Cumberland Mountain Water Authority, the Jackson County Water Authority, the Town of Hypo and Scottsboro WSG to help cover matching funds for an ADECA grant that provided a new pump station and higher capacity water lines to improve water quality and reliability for nearly 3,500 households in Paint Rock Valley, Paint Rock, Woodville, Pleasant Grove, Hytop and Skyline. Sheriff’s office and jail Nance said another location that needs attention is the Jackson County Jail. ARPA funds will be used to pay for several projects that will improve the facility. “Our jail is showing age,” Nance said. “We continue each year doing repairs to the jail.” Nance said the building is in need of a new HVAC system. “The HVAC system that is there is not up to the latest standards,” he said. The funds will also be used to purchase a new body scanner that can detect and prevent drugs and other items from coming into the jail illegally. In addition, ARPA funds will be used to purchase new laptops for patrol cars. The estimated cost of these projects is $1.7 million. Log In Keep it Clean.
