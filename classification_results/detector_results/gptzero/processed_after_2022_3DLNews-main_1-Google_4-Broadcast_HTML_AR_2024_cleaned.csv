BOTELHO | The National Desk TOPICS: WASHINGTON (TND) — A federal appeals panel ruled former President Donald Trump can face trial on charges that he plotted to overturn the results of the 2020 election, rejecting his claims he is immune from prosecution. The decision noted Trump refused to concede to now-President Joe Biden. The document also asserted Trump and his supporters continuously tried to challenge the results of the election, which allegedly led to the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. ""Many of their attempts were allegedly criminal,"" according to the decision. Trump addressed the issue on Truth Social, which is his social media platform, a few hours after the ruling. The former president also shared posts of several polls, which all favor him as the GOP frontrunner. NBC News reported that Steven Cheung, who is Trump\'s campaign spokesman, said the former president ""respectfully disagrees with the DC Circuit’s decision and will appeal it in order to safeguard the Presidency and the Constitution.” A District of Columbia federal grand jury previously indicted former Trump on the following four criminal counts based on his alleged attempts to change the outcome of the election: The trial was originally set for March, but it was postponed last week and the judge didn\'t immediately set a new date. The trial date carries enormous political ramifications, with special counsel Jack Smith\'s team hoping to prosecute Trump this year -- and Trump hoping to delay it until after the November election. If Trump were to defeat Biden, he could presumably try to use his position as head of the executive branch to order a new attorney general to dismiss the federal cases or he potentially could seek a pardon for himself. The appeals court took center stage in the immunity dispute after the Supreme Court last month said it was at least temporarily staying out of it, rejecting a request from special counsel Jack Smith to take up the matter quickly and issue a speedy ruling. _______ EDITOR\'S NOTE: The Associated Press contributed to this report.'}]"

(WGHP) — A man is wanted in a series of violent crimes that took place in North Carolina over the weekend, according to authorities. Around 9:30 p.m. Saturday, officers responded to a location in Lexington where three adults were shot. The Lexington Police Department said the victims were taken to a hospital, but there is no word on their condition. On Sunday morning, Davidson County sheriff’s deputies were called to the Community Fellowship Moravian Church in Lexington due to a report of a break-in. Sheriff Richie Simmons said that the suspect, identified as 39-year-old Zachary Lee Plowman, broke into the church and slept there overnight, waiting for the pastor and his wife to arrive. The suspect allegedly held the pair at knifepoint and hijacked their car before letting them out about 5 miles south of the church. Bloodhounds were dispatched, as well as helicopter in the search, according to Simmons. However, the search was called off after every resource was exhausted without gaining any further leads. Investigators also sent reverse 911 calls to neighbors in the area to see if they saw anything. The Lexington Police Department located the suspect vehicle in the triple shooting early Sunday morning and attempted to pull over the driver, who drove away to elude the officers. Police later found the car abandoned north of Lexington a short time later. Evidence inside the car was processed and Plowman was identified as a person of interest in the triple shooting as well.

Trump’s team vowed to appeal, which could postpone the case by weeks or months — particularly if the Supreme Court agrees to take it up.

If on the other hand the Supreme Court accedes to Trump’s request, any timetable it establishes would determine how much longer the trial might be delayed. If the court grants Trump’s request without speeding up the appeals process, Trump would likely have until early May before he would need to file his full appeal. But the justices could set much quicker deadlines for reaching a final decision. The Supreme Court has previously held that presidents are immune from civil liability for official acts, and Trump’s lawyers have for months argued that that protection should be extended to criminal prosecution as well. They said the actions Trump was accused of in his failed bid to cling to power after he lost the 2020 election, including badgering his vice president to refuse to certify the results of the election, all fell within the “outer perimeters” of a president’s official acts. But Smith’s team has said that no such immunity exists in the U.S. Constitution or in prior cases and that, in any event, Trump’s actions weren’t part of his official duties. Chutkan, who is presiding over the case, rejected Trump’s arguments in a December opinion that said the office of the president “does not confer a lifelong ‘get-out-of-jail-free’ pass.” Trump’s lawyers then turned to the D.C. appeals court, but Smith asked the Supreme Court to weigh in first, in hopes of securing a fast and definitive ruling and preserving the March 4 trial date. The high court declined the request, leaving the matter with the appeals court. The case was argued before Judges Florence Pan and J. Michelle Childs, appointees of Biden, a Democrat, and Karen LeCraft Henderson, who was named to the bench by President George H.W. Bush, a Republican. The judges made clear their skepticism of Trump’s claims during arguments last month, when they peppered his lawyer with questions and posed a series of extreme hypotheticals to test his legal theory of immunity — including whether a president who directed Navy commandos to assassinate a political rival could be prosecuted. Trump’s lawyer, D. John Sauer, answered yes — but only if a president had first been impeached and convicted by Congress. That view was in keeping with the team’s position that the Constitution did not permit the prosecution of ex-presidents who had been impeached but then acquitted, like Trump. The case in Washington is one of four prosecutions Trump faces as he seeks to reclaim the White House. He faces federal charges in Florida that he illegally retained classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate, a case that was also brought by Smith and is set for trial in May. He’s also charged in state court in Georgia with scheming to subvert that state’s 2020 election and in New York in connection with hush money payments made to porn actor Stormy Daniels. He has denied any wrongdoing. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.'}]"

(WHNS/Gray News) - A kitten paralyzed by a BB gun has not had movement return to his back legs, but it isn’t stopping him from being active and playful. The Esther Neonatal Kitten Alliance (ENKA) took in 7-week-old Tommy in December. He was unable to use his back legs, and after an X-ray, a BB gun pellet was discovered in his back. A neurologist recently saw Tommy to investigate after he showed some twitching in his toes. However, the doctor did not find any evidence of his brain sending signals to his back legs and said the twitching was the result of a nerve reaction. The neurologist does not believe Tommy will ever be able to walk with his back legs again, WHNS reports. Tommy currently lives in a foster home, where he is equipped with a ‘drag bag’ that allows him to scoot around. He is playing with other foster kittens and zooming around freely, the shelter said. ENKA is working to help him through some stomach issues and to get him neutered. The hope is for him to be up for adoption by early March. Tommy will need lifelong special care. He will need a house without stairs and someone who will be able to change his diaper multiple times a day. ENKA, a nonprofit in North Carolina, provides care to newborn and medically-challenged kittens with the goal of giving the young, sick and injured a chance to thrive.
