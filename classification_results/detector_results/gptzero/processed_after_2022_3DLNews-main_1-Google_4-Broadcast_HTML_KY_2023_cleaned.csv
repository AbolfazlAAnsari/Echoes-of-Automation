(WITN/Gray News) - There have been 14 flu-related deaths in the state of North Carolina so far in 2023, according to WITN. The most recent death is that of a fourth-grade girl. The ECU Health Medical Center in Greenville said there were between 80 and 90 positive COVID and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases in children in their system last week, and over 370 positive flu cases. The death of 9-year-old Jasmyne Kite is prompting health officials to warn not only of the flu but also COVID-19 and RSV. Jasmyne attended Wells Elementary School in Wilson before losing her life to the flu. A GoFundMe was set up to help Jasmyne’s family pay for her funeral expenses. A message alongside the fundraiser said Jasmyne had viral myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle brought on by the flu. WITN spoke with Jasmyne’s father, who said the family is looking to raise awareness about how serious the flu can be in children. ECU health’s pediatrician-in-chief Matthew Ledoux said the flu can be particularly dangerous for children. “Their systems are pretty young, and they haven’t been exposed to most of those things,” he said. Ledoux also said the airways of infants are very different from those of adults, making it much more difficult for them to breathe, cough, and get secretions while afflicted with RSV. The principal of Wells Elementary said counselors will be at the campus to help process Jasmyne’s death but also encourage parents to talk to their children. Ledoux said families can take precautions to prevent getting sick from the flu or other illnesses. “We did learn that social distancing, especially when you’re sick, works,” Ledoux said. “We know that masks can help for sure, and then washing your hands very well.” Jasmyne was initially taken to the hospital last Wednesday and passed away on Monday.

Just in case you haven't heard the latest Evansville, Indiana controversy, allow me to fill you in. I was there on the fateful night of November 16, 2023. High school students performed. Mayor Lloyd Winnecke gave an emotional speech as his final time to flip the Christmas light switch for the city. Honestly, from my vantage point, which is very low to the ground, I didn't see anything off-putting with the lights. I was also dealing with a bit of a distraction - The Grinch! I'm not even going to share the millions of negative comments about the tree, the mayor, our city, politics, taxes, or the people who strung the lights. It's been exhausting. I don't think anyone ever paid much attention to it until this year. If you walk just a few blocks south on Main Street, you will see beautiful decorations for Christmas, and year-round, courtesy of the Downtown Evansville Economic Improvement District. That, I should add is different than the folks responsible for the city's tree. I saw Photoshop pics of a newly decorated tree in Downtown Evansville, but that was fake news. In reality, the tree's lights are gone! So, our very clever Evansville Police Department's Sergeant Anna Grey prepared a statement to update the public on this breaking news regarding the city's Christmas tree. I have a recording from The Grinch himself confessing that he was going to steal the lights and all of the presents! But instead, he stole our radio station and flipped it to Christmas music 24/7. I was also photographed with The Grinch, but I swear that I had nothing to do with this! *Wink* Gallery Credit: JD Knight Gallery Credit: Bruce Mikels""}]"
