Yes, it creates a weakened roster. Beyond that? The good news with 2024 NFL free agency approaching: There is no pressing need to re-sign any of those players, which is good for the salary cap and for not having to plug critical holes in the lineup. The bad news: Losing those players will provide minimal, if any, compensatory draft picks. Those are the free-agency realities for general manager Brian Gutekunst, who presumably will show little, if any, allegiance to his Class of 2020. The emergence of quarterback Jordan Love, the first-round pick in that draft, has saved the franchise a long and painful rebuild. Otherwise? Pro Football Focus recently published its top 150 free agents. It paints a picture of what should be a relatively easy string of decisions for Gutekunst. Really, there will be no reason to stretch the budget to bring back any of the players. Leading the way at No. 92 on PFF’s list, guard Jon Runyan is Green Bay’s best free agent. A sixth-round pick in 2020, he is a reliable workhorse with 50 consecutive regular-season starts and a history of quality pass protection. However, the Packers made the decision months ago when they began splitting snaps between Runyan and 2022 third-round pick Sean Rhyan. Once Rhyan showed he was good enough to continue getting playing time, it was apparent which direction the team was headed. As the better player, Runyan would continue to start. As the young player with two more full seasons under contract, Rhyan would continue to play. “The writing’s on the wall,” Runyan said in early December. He could have been bitter about the situation but was a pro throughout an odd season. In the five games spanning Game 14 against Tampa Bay and the playoff win at Dallas, Rhyan played roughly 50 percent of the snaps. In the playoff loss at San Francisco, he played 20 snaps (30 percent). He probably will start at right guard in 2024. So will Runyan. Somewhere else. The Packers have three more players on PFF’s 150-man list but they are all buried toward the bottom. Running back AJ Dillon is No. 132. A second-round pick in 2020, he is coming off a dismal fourth season. With Aaron Jones in and out of the lineup, the Packers needed the powerful Dillon to carry the load. He did not. Dillon averaged 3.4 yards per carry – down almost a full yard from 2021. His missed-tackle rate has dropped like a rock, from 26.1 percent in 2020 to 12.8 percent in 2021 to 8.1 percent in 2022 to 6.7 percent in 2023, according to Sports Info Solutions. The offense didn’t take flight until Jones was healthy and Dillon was sidelined with his own injuries. His “success rate” was a career-worst 50.0 percent, though that ranked 16th out of 48 qualifying runners, he didn’t fumble on any of his 210 touches and he’s an asset in the passing game. Safety Darnell Savage, a first-round pick in 2019 who played under the fifth-year option this season, is No. 145. By performance, letting Savage go should be easy. After an All-Rookie season, Savage had four interceptions and 12 passes defensed in 2020 and two interceptions and nine passes defensed in 2021. Among safeties during those three seasons, he ranked eighth with 26 passes defensed – just one behind Minkah Fitzpatrick and Tyrann Mathieu. However, he had one interception and five passes defensed in 2022 and zero interceptions and a woeful one pass defensed in 10 games in 2023. And he’s got five years of terrible tackling on his resume with a career missed-tackle rate of 21.7 percent, according to Sports Info Solutions. But maybe new defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley will see Savage as a strong schematic fit, with excellent athleticism and fixable flaws. Slot corner and kick returner Keisean Nixon is No. 146, which feels too low compared to Dillon and Savage because of his all-around value as a two-time All-Pro kick returner. Originally signed in free agency in 2022, Nixon started 13 games but was the primary nickel defender in all 17 in 2023. He had one interception – a brilliant one against the Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes – and six passes defensed. He gave up too many catches (73.3 percent) and missed too many tackles (20; 20.2 percent), according to Sports Info Solutions. But Nixon didn’t give up too many big plays (a decent 7.6 yards per target), and his big kickoff return at San Francisco was a reminder of that game-changing skill. As for the rest of the 2020 draft, only four of the nine selections were on the roster in 2023: Love, Dillon, Runyan and third-round pick Josiah Deguara. Listed by the team as a tight end but in reality an H-back/fullback, Deguara started a career-high four games in 2023 but his playing time and production was slashed from 367 snaps and 25 receptions in 2021 to 258 snaps and 13 receptions in 2022 and 196 snaps and eight receptions in 2023. He wasn’t targeted a single time in the passing game over the final nine games. The Packers kept undrafted rookie Henry Pearson on the practice squad all season as a potential replacement.

the arenas of social justice and mental health. The Olympic gold medalist has published a new memoir, Dear Black Girls: How to Be True to You, where she shares a deeply personal collection of stories from her own experiences growing up in South Carolina and navigating the world of professional basketball as a Black woman. Wilson spoke with ABC News’ Linsey Davis about her life experience and advice for others on ABC News Live. ABC NEWS LIVE: Congratulations first off on writing the book, and I’m curious because you had written an essay back in 2020 with the same name, “Dear Black Girls.” What made you decide you wanted to expand it to a book? A’JA WILSON: Well, I actually wrote two [essays], “Dear Black Girls,” before the [2020 WNBA COVID] bubble and then “Dear Black Women” after the bubble. And it was like I kind of had a revolution, like in the bubble. I had time to really dive into myself. And then that’s when I got so much great traction from it. And I was just like, “You know what? We can form this into a bigger story because I have more to tell.” ABC NEWS LIVE: Throughout the book, you talk about being a double minority, being Black and being a woman. I want to quote you here. You say, “The truth is we’re a double minority is like the world is constantly reminding us you’re a girl. Oh, and you’re a Black girl.” Tell me about how this intersectionality of gender and race has impacted you. WILSON: It’s impacted my whole way of life, honestly. When someone [is] talking about the basketball, it’s just like, “OK, yeah, your sport is not a sport because you’re a woman.” But then, on top of that, we don’t get looked at as much or viewed as much because we are Black women and we may not look as the marketable type or people may not want to see us. And it’s hard, but I think the beautiful thing that I found within it is just using my personality, making people understand that I’m human and I’m real, [and] that I go through things. Yes, you see me in a uniform. Yes, you can see the banners, the trophies and the rings. But behind all that, I’m a human. I’m a young Black girl [who’s] trying to navigate this world that’s not the nicest. And understanding that I can still be successful in my field and level and whoever I want to love and have fun from there. ABC NEWS LIVE: It’s become really kind of like a political hot rod in this country as far as is America a racist country [and] has it ever been? And you share a story of a fourth-grade sleepover. Share that with our viewers. WILSON: Yes. So I was in the fourth grade, and one of my friends who I thought was really my close friend, was having a birthday party, and she was just like, “Yeah, you can come, but you can’t stay inside the house. You have to stay outside. Because my dad doesn’t like Black people.” And that right there struck my core because I was a young Black girl in a private school, and I just thought everybody was friends. I thought we were all equal, and we were all fair. And that’s when I kind of realized, as I grew up, my parents had to have that conversation with me that you’re not really liked all the time, but you don’t need to change who you are and who you want to become. And I kind of took that story, [which] kind of struck my core for a while, and, as I got older, it didn’t get easier. But I just understood more of like understanding who I am and how I want people to view me, and I continue to do that to plant seeds for the next generation. ABC NEWS LIVE: There was a part in the book that really struck me where you talk about “life had never been so good, and I had never felt so anxious and so afraid. Everyone always talks about the fear of failure, but the thing I never hear anyone talk about is the fear of success.” Explain what that means for people who have never felt that. WILSON: Yes…We’re human. We’re always just fear of rejection, [and] fear of failure. And it’s just this feeling that we’re getting like, “Oh, I don’t want to do it.” But then I’m like, when it’s actually success, sometimes success can open up a whole other level for people to come into. And it’s kind of hard to be out there and be vulnerable and allow people into your life to nitpick it and judge you on different things, and that comes with success. You come underneath that spotlight where people have no choice but to pay attention to you, and that’s hard and it’s hard to hide from it, as well. And I think that’s why I was so open with my mental health, because I needed people to know I’m human. ABC NEWS LIVE: What would you like for young readers, perhaps even particularly young Black girls, to take away from this book? WILSON: Ooh, I would just tell them, just feel the feelings. I think sometimes we carry a lot on our shoulders. We’re swept underneath the rug. We feel like we have to put on a mask every single time we wake up. But some days we don’t need to do that and understand that it’s OK to feel not OK. It’s OK to have days where you’re just like, “I don’t feel like A’ja.” “I don’t want to do this,” and know that you’re still OK every step of the way and give yourself some grace.

FM Leaders of the Abandon Biden campaign are asking Michiganders to “vote their conscience” in this year’s election. Members of the Abandon Biden campaign held a press conference at the Greenfield Manor Feb. 1, 2024 in Dearborn to express their outrage with President Joe Biden not meeting with the Arab American community during his visit to Michigan. President Joe Biden was in metro Detroit last week to meet with union leaders, but he did not meet with Arab American or Muslim community leaders. Organizers of the Abandon Biden Campaign held a news conference in Dearborn a day before the president’s Michigan visit to express their displeasure of his support for Israel’s attacks in Gaza. Samraa Luqman, the group’s co-chair, says the campaign is asking people to show up for the primaries and vote, rather than sit out the primary election. “We are not telling people not to vote for Trump, we are telling people to essentially vote their conscience, just like the Democrats did in 2016. Right? We’re telling them go and vote for anybody but the person that is committing a genocide, so whether that is a Republican candidate, another Democratic candidate voting uncommitted, or writing in free Palestine,” she said. Luqman says the community is upset that Biden is attempting to meet with people without calling for a ceasefire. “It’s almost as if he’s saying, I will go and I will win Michigan without you guys intentionally seeking endorsements from the UAW or campaign events there and not actually calling for a ceasefire or committing to sending somebody that is a policymaker or changer to our community,” she said. She says campaign leaders are encouraging people to vote “uncommitted” in the primary election. Abandon Biden campaign leaders says the movement initially started in seven swing states and is expanding nationally. Palestinian American Khalid Turaani is the co-chair of the Abandon Biden campaign. He says the movement hopes to hold Biden accountable for his support of Israel throughout the conflict. “The abandoned Biden campaign held its first conference in the city of Dearborn where people from the seven swing states came to Michigan to coalesce around the idea that we must punish Joe Biden, Joe Biden is right now beyond, beyond repair beyond redemption,” he said. Last week Arab American leaders declined to meet with Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez. Biden says Israel has a right to defend itself following Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7, which left more than 1,200 dead. Israel’s military response in Gaza has killed over 26,000 Palestinians. The group is also asking for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Use the media player above for the full interview with Samraa Luqman, co-chair of the Abandon Biden campaign.

U.S. President Joe Biden recently approved the Michigan governor’s request for a major disaster declaration in multiple counties due to damage caused by storms in late July and August 2023. During that time, storms brought strong winds and heavy rain that caused significant flooding, in addition to seven tornadoes. The approval of the disaster declaration request means Michigan residents affected by those storms now have access to assistance through the federal government. Here’s how that works. Home owners and business owners that experienced damages or other issues related to the August storms and flooding are eligible to apply for assistance. The assistance comes from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA for short. However, the exact type of assistance available varies depending on the needs of the person, family or business. For some, assistance from FEMA may come in the form of grants for temporary housing or home repairs. FEMA could also offer low-cost loans to “cover uninsured property losses,” officials said. The FEMA assistance is meant to help people and businesses recover from the effects of the storms. To see what kind of assistance you may qualify for, you’ll have to submit an application with the federal government online, by phone, or on the FEMA app. ---> Affected by 2023 flooding? FEMA opens Michigan centers to help: Here’s where The disaster declaration was approved for the following counties: Residents and business owners in those counties can apply for assistance. Entire communities will also be allowed to request assistance regarding hazard mitigation measures and the like, officials said this week. Applications for assistance can be submitted online, over the phone, or using the FEMA app. Copyright 2024 by WDIV ClickOnDetroit - All rights reserved.

The experts around the NFL have the Packers either going big, or small with their first-round pick. by: Jacob Westendorf Posted: Feb 9, 2024 / 09:08 AM EST Updated: Feb 9, 2024 / 09:08 AM EST GREEN BAY, Wis. – The Super Bowl will be played on Sunday but, for 30 other NFL teams, the offseason is in full swing. The Green Bay Packers started their offseason by hiring Jeff Hafley as their defensive coordinator. There will be more moves. The Packers are still up against it from a salary cap standpoint and likely will rely heavily on the draft to add to their team in hopes to get back to the Super Bowl. From that perspective, the focus for many NFL mock drafts has mostly been in the secondary. That makes sense given Brian Gutekunst's comments regarding the need to shore up the secondary at both levels of the defense. “I think a little bit of that will be determined as we sit down with Jeff and get his vision for what we’re going to do on defense,” Gutekunst said in his postseason media availability. “But we’re going to have to add numbers there, for sure. “think more and more in the National Football League, those positions — along with the nickel position — are becoming interchangeable positions. You ask a lot of those guys. And I also think you have to have depth because defensive backs get injured and you have to be able to adjust and be able to keep playing high-level football, no matter who’s in there.” Related: Hafley’s NFL Pass Defenses Have Been Terrible* If a mock draft is not taking a defensive back, they've been focusing on the offensive line, where the Packers could be looking for as many as three new starters if they are not satisfied with Rasheed Walker as the left tackle of the future. Here is a look at the latest mocks. According to Curt Popejoy, Guyton is a huge, powerful blocker that is built to be a strongside tackle in the NFL. With that line of thinking, the Packers would have an interesting decision to make with Zach Tom. Tom was the team's best offensive lineman by almost any measure in 2023. If David Bakhtiari were to be released, the Packers could elect to move Tom to left tackle, while putting the massive 6-foot-7, 328-pound Guyton at right tackle to help open holes in the run game. If Bakhtiari is on the roster when the team starts its 2024 season, it could move Tom to center, a position Gutekunst has said in the past he felt was Tom's best. You can read the full mock here. According to Josh Edwards, the Packers could have a decision to make at left tackle. That part is known. Mims, like Guyton from the previous mock draft, is massive, measuring in at 6-foot-7 and 340 pounds. He started for Georgia last season and was one of the best players on the SEC finalist. Mims and Guyton would represent a slight departure from the preferences the Packers have typically shown with their offensive tackles. Both would be the heaviest players they've drafted in the first four rounds with the intention to play at tackle since they took Derek Sherrod in 2011. The only players in the last 30 years the Packers have taken that crossed the 320-pound threshold are Sherrod and Chad Clifton. Gutekunst has deviated from the typical Packers thresholds before. Perhaps he could do it for a player he thinks is a long-term solution at tackle. You can read the full mock here. Lance Zierlein has a similar thought process to Curt Popejoy from The Draft Wire. The Packers' offensive line could use some reinforcements. Perhaps Zach Tom could slide over to left tackle if they do not believe Rasheed Walker is the long-term answer? Some of this is contingent on what decision the Packers make with David Bakhtiari. If he's on the roster, that wouldn't preclude the Packers from taking an offensive tackle, but it's hard to envision a scenario in which Guyton would become a preferred starter as a rookie. You can read the full mock here. According to Luke Easterling the Packers have a secondary that needs help at both levels. DeJean would be a versatile playmaker that could help them at either cornerback position as well as safety. The Packers have liked dipping into the talent pool at Iowa. Last year, they used their first-round pick on Lukas Van Ness. DeJean would help at both levels of the defense and on special teams. He excelled as a punt returner at Iowa, where he averaged 11.5 yards per return in 2023. One of the best plays of his career did not count but was incredibly impressive. COOPER DEJEAN!

Using the PFF Mock Draft Simulator, I took my spin at trying to fix the Packers' secondary. Rakestraw was set to be one of the participants in the Senior Bowl, where the Packers have loaded up on talented prospects in recent years. Some of those players include Christian Watson, Karl Brooks, Jayden Reed, Luke Musgrave and Jordan Love. Rakestraw, unfortunately, was unable to participate in the Senior Bowl due to an injury that held him out of the game. He's an aggressive corner that would fit well if Jeff Hafley wants to play more man coverage. With Eric Stokes remaining a question mark, the Packers have needs at both the nickel and boundary positions. Rakestraw would likely play on the boundary if he were to be the one that Gutekunst picks when the Packers are on the clock. Related: NFL Free Agency Rankings Blessing, Curse for Packers""}]"

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Menu PONTIAC, Mich. (WXYZ) — A jury has found Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the Oxford High School shooter, guilty on Tuesday in connection to the deadly November 2021 shooting. Crumbley was convicted on all four counts of involuntary manslaughter. She faces up to 15 years in prison. Speaking with 7 Action News following the verdict, former Wayne County Chief Judge Timothy Kenny said the jury\'s verdict came from the specific facts of the case. “It is an unprecedented case, the charges that have been brought in this particular case, and for those of us who are parents and have raised children through those challenging teenage years, we recognize that there are things that our teenage kids don’t always share with us and can be concerning,"" Kenny said. ""But in this particular case we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that this case, I think, was driven by the facts, in great respect, with the fact specifics of the background, and particularly, I think what was compelling was the way that Jennifer Crumbley handled that school the day of the shooting. I mean with all of this concern about the mental health issues and his having a gun and the drawing, to then have an 11 or 12-minute meeting with school officials and then say ’I’ve got to go back to work’ I think is pretty strong evidence to indicate that it’s reflective that Jennifer Crumbley blew through a lot of red lights that she should have been aware of.” One juror told reporters that they took their work seriously. She said the thing that really hammered it home was that Jennifer Crumbley was the last adult with the gun. On Tuesday afternoon, Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard issued a statement on the guilty verdict. “My first thoughts today are with the families of the victims and the community so terribly impacted by this tragedy. You have my unwavering support. I know that this is not just a reopening of a wound, it is tearing wider a wound that has yet to heal. Each time my staff re-lives that terrible day in that school through their testimony, I can see the burden in their faces,"" said Bouchard in a statement. “I applaud the jury that plowed new ground with this verdict today. If among a parent’s first thoughts when you hear word there is an active shooter at your child’s school isn\'t to wonder if my child is hurt but is my son the gunman. That tells me you saw the signs and did nothing. Accountability and responsibility matter. There is ongoing help and support for the community not just through the Sheriff’s Office, but through the Oxford Resiliency center. Reach out.” In November 2021, Crumbley’s son shot and killed four students – Hana St. Juliana, Tate Myre, Justin Shilling and Madisyn Baldwin. Several others were injured. The shooter’s parents were arrested following the shooting and were set to have separate trials. Following two weeks of witness testimony and then closing arguments in Crumbley’s trial, the jury came back with a verdict after two days of deliberating. On February 5, the judge gave jury instructions to members of the case, and they began deliberating. The jury came back twice to ask questions – first related to the instructions. The second time, they asked if they could draw their own conclusions as to why Crumbley\'s son, the shooter, never took the stand. Judge Cheryl Matthews told them no and that they could not make any assumptions as to why the shooter did not testify. The shooter pleaded guilty to the murders of four of his classmates and was sentenced in December. But since he is planning to appeal his life sentence, if he were to get on the stand and plead the Fifth, the judge said it would have triggered a mistrial in his mother\'s case. “The defendant is not required to prove her innocence or do anything. If you find that the prosecutor has not proven every element beyond a reasonable doubt, then you must find the defendant not guilty,” Matthews had told the jury. Crumbley’s trial received national attention, specifically from legal experts since the unprecedented charges against the parents could impact how future school shooting cases are handled by prosecutors. Craig Shilling, the father of Justin Shilling, spoke to 7 Action News during jury deliberations with a statement he wanted to read about the trial. He said he understands the task given to this jury is a monumental one. “I hope that they\'re taking their time and they’re making sure to look at all the evidence and make sure that they make the right decision,” Craig Shilling said. “Regardless of the outcome of this trial, it is my intention to maintain the search for the truth and for full accountability.” To come up with their verdict, the jury had to determine if Crumbley was both careless and grossly negligent. THE TRIAL Throughout the trial, the court heard from several lawyers and saw nearly 500 pieces of evidence including text messages, video of the day police searched the Crumbley home following the shooting and items found at a Detroit warehouse where Jennifer and her husband James were arrested when authorities were searching for them. Text messages between the shooter and his parents were also presented in court. Testimony included law enforcement, school officials and Jennifer Crumbley herself. The dean of students at Oxford High School at time of the shooting took the stand to speak about the day of the incident. After teachers found disturbing drawings and internet searches, the shooter’s parents were called in for an emergency meeting. Afterward, the shooter was sent back to class and his parents left. Jennifer Crumbley returned to work. Her boss was one of two colleagues to testify about her the day of the shooting, saying after the school meeting, she had opportunities to leave work or continue working from home to address issues with her son but decided to stay. Hours later when the shooting happened, colleagues testified that Jennifer Crumbley had a strong reaction and left work in a panic. A 49-minute video showed Jennifer Crumbley in the back of a police car as officers searched her home. Prosecutors wanted jurors to take notes of her demeanor. Inside their home, officers say they found multiple BB guns, knives and targets in the shooter\'s two bedrooms. Crumbley was asked about the gun and ammunition, which she said was her husband’s responsibility. Evidence found at the warehouse after the couple’s arrest included cigarette butts near their vehicle, a mattress, food, $6,617 in cash and prescription medication. A longtime friend of Jennifer Crumbley, who she admitted to having an affair with, also took the stand. She messaged him after the shooting saying ""We\'re on the run again.” However, Crumbley testified that she and her husband were not hiding but were waiting for their attorney to turn themselves in. During closing arguments, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald spoke about what constitutes an involuntary manslaughter conviction and detailed it through the law. She then went through the different witnesses who testified for the prosecution. ""Just the smallest thing could have saved Hana and Tate and Justin and Madisyn,"" McDonald told the jury during closing arguments. She pointed to what she said were many missed opportunities where Jennifer Crumbley could have helped prevent the shooting including seeking mental health treatment for him. Defense attorney Shannon Smith said the evidence provided by the prosecution was cherry-picked to paint a picture that did not resemble Crumbley\'s actual life. Smith said the Crumbley “family played together,” “had fun together” and “did what families do.” Smith also pointed to the school after leaders told his parents during an emergency meeting hours before the shooting that they didn\'t think the shooter was a threat. ""No parent would purchase a weapon if they believed their child had mental illnesses,"" Smith told the jury during closing arguments. She also said the shooting “was not foreseeable for Mrs. Crumbley.” The trial for James Crumbley is expected to start in March.'}]"

Washington to recognize Moscow\'s interests and persuade Ukraine to sit down for talks. Putin also said that Russia stands ready to negotiate a potential prisoner exchange that would free Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was detained last March on espionage charges he denies. Putin hinted that Moscow wants the release of its agent imprisoned in Germany. Most of the interview, released on Thursday, focused on Ukraine, where the war is nearing the two-year mark. Putin repeated his claim that his invasion of Ukraine, which Kyiv and its allies described as an unprovoked act of aggression, was necessary to protect Russian speakers in Ukraine and prevent the country from posing a threat to Russia by joining NATO. Putin pointed at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\'s refusal to conduct talks with the Kremlin. He argued that it\'s up to Washington to stop supplying Ukraine with weapons and convince Kyiv, which he called a U.S. ""satellite,"" to sit down for negotiations. ""We have never refused negotiations,"" Putin said. ""You should tell the current Ukrainian leadership to stop and come to a negotiating table."" Putin warned that the West will never succeed in inflicting a ""strategic defeat"" on Russia in Ukraine and rejected allegations that Russia was harboring plans to attack Poland or other NATO countries. It was Putin\'s first interview with a Western media figure since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago. White House national security spokesman John Kirby tried to minimize the impact of Carlson\'s interview ahead of its release: ""Remember, you\'re listening to Vladimir Putin. And you shouldn\'t take at face value anything he has to say."" Putin has heavily limited his contact with international media since he launched the war in Ukraine in February 2022. Russian authorities have cracked down on independent media, forcing some Russian outlets to close, blocking others and ordering a number of foreign reporters to leave the country. Two journalists working for U.S. news organizations — The Wall Street Journal’s Gershkovich and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\'s Alsu Kurmasheva — are in jail. Asked by Carlson whether Russia would release Gershkovich, Putin said Moscow is open to talks but repeated that the reporter was charged with espionage, an accusation Gershkovich has denied. ""He was caught red-handed when he was secretly getting classified information,"" Putin said of Gershkovich, adding that he doesn\'t exclude that the reporter could return home. ""There is no taboo on settling this issue,"" Putin said. ""We are ready to solve it but there are certain conditions that are being discussed between special services. I believe an agreement can be reached."" He pointed to a man imprisoned in a ""U.S.-allied country"" for ""liquidating a bandit"" who killed Russian soldiers during the fighting in the Caucasus: ""He put our soldiers taken prisoners on a road and then drove a car over their heads. There was a patriot who liquidated him in one of the European capitals."" Putin didn\'t mention names, but he appeared to refer to Vadim Krasikov, a Russian serving a life sentence in Germany after being convicted of the 2019 brazen daylight killing of Zelimkhan ""Tornike"" Khangoshvili, a 40-year-old Georgian citizen of Chechen ethnicity. German judges who convicted Krasikov said he had acted on the orders of Russian federal authorities, who provided him with a false identity, a fake passport and the resources to carry out the hit. The Wall Street Journal reaffirmed in a statement that Gershkovich ""is a journalist, and journalism is not a crime,"" adding that ""any portrayal to the contrary is total fiction."" ""We\'re encouraged to see Russia\'s desire for a deal that brings Evan home, and we hope this will lead to his rapid release and return to his family and our newsroom,"" it said.

that said there was evidence that President Biden willfully mishandled old classified documents. But it also said his actions did not warrant criminal charges. The report by special counsel Robert Hur, though, magnified another issue - Biden\'s mental acuity as he campaigns for a second term in the White House. Joining us now to talk about all this is NPR White House correspondent Asma Khalid. Good morning, Asma. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: So this report was more than 300 pages, with photos showing where some of these documents were found. But that\'s not what is getting the most attention, right? Tell us what is, Asma. KHALID: I mean, to be clear, the report does clear the president, as you say, of any criminal wrongdoing. FADEL: Right. KHALID: But the special counsel injected questions about the president\'s mental sharpness into this report. And at one point, it describes the president as a, quote, ""sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory."" It described the president as having trouble remembering specific timelines and details. The White House said these comments were inappropriate and irrelevant. FADEL: What is Biden saying? KHALID: So Biden points out that his situation was in stark contrast to former President Donald Trump, who is facing criminal charges over classified documents. Last evening, Biden held a hastily arranged press conference where he was very angry about suggestions that he had mixed up timelines of when his son died. But, you know, Leila, the reason this report is so damaging to the president is that it cements a perception that a lot of voters already have, that Biden is too old to do the job. And, you know, frankly, it is an issue that the campaign cannot easily quell. Polls indicate that age is the president\'s biggest political liability. And it\'s not just an issue with Republicans, also with some Democrats. And now, because of this report, I think it\'s an issue that, you know, might have been whispered about before but is now being very much openly discussed publicly. Reporters in the room last night asked very blunt questions, like, is your memory getting worse? The president insisted his memory is fine. And at times last night, Biden seemed very defensive. Here\'s an exchange with CNN reporter MJ Lee. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MJ LEE: Many American people have been watching, and they have expressed concerns about your age. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: That is your judgment. That is your judgment. LEE: They - this is according to public polling. They express concerns... BIDEN: That is not the judgment of the press. FADEL: OK. So Biden\'s downplaying it there. But as you mentioned, these concerns are very real among voters, including voters NPR has interviewed. So where is this coming from? KHALID: Well, the president is 81. And the challenge for Biden is that he has repeatedly mixed up people and names. And, you know, it even happened last night when he was responding to a question about Israel in Gaza. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: Initially, the president of Mexico, El-Sisi, did not want to open up the gate to allow humanitarian material to get in. KHALID: And Biden there meant to say the president of Egypt. And, you know, Leila, his broader answer was actually rather newsy, but it got overshadowed by this very tangible example of something that does concern people. And this comes on the heels of three other incidents in recent days where the president mixed up current world leaders with their long-dead predecessors. The White House was asked about these incidents, and the press secretary pointed out that lots of people misspeak. FADEL: Now, I assume Republicans are delighting in this, right? KHALID: That\'s right. The RNC quickly issued a statement saying this is proof that Biden can\'t handle the job. You know, the thing is, though, that his likely opponent in this election, Donald Trump, is 77 and also faces serious questions about his mental sharpness. For example, he recently mixed up his GOP challenger, Nikki Haley, and the former speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. FADEL: NPR\'s Asma Khalid. Thank you, Asma. KHALID: Thank you.

(WOOD) — A registered sex offender was charged with several felonies, including rape, after authorities say he groomed a teen girl online for months, drove to Washington state to get her and brought her back to his home near South Haven. At a news conference before the suspect’s Friday arraignment, the girl’s mother thanked investigators for their hard work to find her daughter. “I get to bring my daughter home,” she said. “The past three weeks have been nothing short of a nightmare and one I hope no other parents have to experience.” Keith Freerksen, 30, appeared in a South Haven courtroom via video to be arraigned on nine criminal counts, including multiple counts of human trafficking of a minor for commercial sexual activity and criminal sexual conduct. “This individual is a convicted sex offender who groomed a 14-year-old girl online for a significant period of time. He then took it upon himself to travel across the country, take this 14-year-old from her home state of Washington, and kept her here in Van Buren County for roughly three weeks. We believe that he is an extreme risk to the public,” Assistant Prosecutor Rachel Keeley told the judge. Judge Arthur Clarke agreed, also saying he believes Freerksen is a flight risk and noting there is “great evidence towards his guilt.” He denied bond. That means Freerksen will stay behind bars while his case makes its way through the judicial system. He’s expected back in court on Feb. 14 and Feb. 22. He said his family was getting him an attorney. He is also expected to face new charges in Washington, the Van Buren County sheriff said. Freerksen was previously convicted of child porn charges in the Orlando, Florida, area in 2017, the Michigan Sex Offender Registry shows. The 14-year-old girl, whose name News 8 is not using because she is a juvenile and may be the victim of a crime, was reported missing Jan. 6 from Mount Vernon, which is north of Seattle. Initially considered a runaway, police soon realized that she’d been speaking with a strange man online for “several months.” “(The man) had provided her with money and other gifts, clearly grooming this young lady and gaining this naive girl’s confidence,” Van Buren County Sheriff’s Office Detective Lt. David Walker told Judge Clarke during a probable cause hearing on Thursday. Walker said Freerksen clearly knew the girl was a teenager: She told him her age. “They built up a relationship. He was able to talk her into him picking her up in the state of Washington,” Walker said. “The missing girl never told any family or friends that this was her plan.” Investigators were able to use license plate readers in various states and cellphone records to track his car from South Haven to Mount Vernon, where he stayed for about 13 hours before returning to Michigan, Walker said. Mount Vernon police say they learned the teen may have used a ride-sharing service and tracked down who ordered the car. That pointed them to Freerksen. The Van Buren County Sheriff’s Office says detectives got a call Wednesday from the FBI’s Seattle office, looking for information about Freerksen and filling sheriff’s detectives in on the case. It was enough to get a search warrant, Sheriff Dan Abbott said Friday. Abbott said his officers checked out Freerksen’s home on Blue Star Memorial Highway in South Haven Township. “The suspected vehicle used to transport the victim from Washington to here was observed on the property,” Abbott said. Abbott explained there are three homes on the property. He said his detectives confirmed Freerksen was in one of them, so they moved in to get him Wednesday evening. “The suspect immediately said she (the teen) was there to the detectives that was talking to him,” Abbott said. “However, once they read (the) Miranda (rights), he lawyered up right away and wouldn’t speak anymore.” Other family members on the property pointed detectives to where the girl was. “Once the detectives found out her location, they went and entered the structure and located the victim immediately,” Abbott said. At the probable cause hearing, detectives confirmed she was in Freerksen’s home. “(The teen) did disclose to investigators that he provided her housing, a cellphone, clothing, food and marijuana on multiple occasions, this while she was at his home,” Walker said. Walker went on to say that the teen told investigators about “multiple sexual encounters” with Freerksen while she was at his home and that while she was still in Washington, she sent him nude photos. After she was found, the teen’s parents were soon on a plane to Michigan. They were expected to return to Washington Friday night. “By God’s grace, this victim was able to be united with her family, alive, and able to recover from what she went through over these past three weeks. Not every victim can say that, nor walk away from something like this alive,” Abbott said at the Friday news conference, reading from prepared remarks. He added that while there are no other known victims, more may come forward now that the case is public. “I’ve seen it over and over that nothing good comes out of a child opening up an app and talking to a total stranger on a computer,” Abbott said. He would not name the specific social media platform involved in the case, but said it has since been taken down. “We’ve all heard the conversation for years about something’s got to be done, but yet nothing’s getting done,” Abbott said. He said he hopes the case will serve as a catalyst to hold app and tech companies accountable for keeping kids safe and for new federal legislation to better control convicted sex offenders’ online activity. “There are safeguards on millions of products in this world, but yet websites are still readily available to our children at the touch of their fingertips,” Abbott said. “I ask you why? Why is there a website like the one used in this case, where it’s OK for a kid to get on this website and talk to a total stranger? I would love to have the company defend why that’s a good idea.” “This is a call to action,” the teen’s mother said. “This predator was able to use social media platforms to reach my child from across the country. He was able to use these platforms to groom my child over an extended period of time. How many more children have to be victimized before these social media platforms are held to a higher standard? How many more families have to suffer the way mine has?” The sheriff urged parents to watch what their kids are doing online. “If they get mad at you, it is what it is,” he said. “I think most parents would say they would rather have a mad child than a child who has to go through this or winds up missing and never recovered.” He said to watch for signs that something may be wrong, like sudden behavior changes. He said his department’s school resources officers are trained to watch for warning signs, too. —News 8’s David Horak contributed to this report. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

(WOOD) — A man wanted on several felony warrants was taken into custody after an hourslong standoff Thursday afternoon at a Grand Rapids home, police say. The Grand Rapids Police Department said the man gave himself up and was taken into custody. A News 8 crew on scene saw officers putting a man in handcuffs around 5:35 p.m. The standoff began around 1:40 p.m. as officers carried out a planned warrant on the 1700 block of Newark Avenue SE near Orville Street, according to GRPD. A 35-year-old man was wanted on eight felony warrants, half of which were drug-related and half gun-related, GRPD Capt. Terry Dixon said. Officers used a method known as “surround and call out.” “Basically, we surround the house and then we give commands … to come out,” Dixon explained. Dixon said often, people will exit quickly — but not in this case. “Unfortunately, that particular subject barricaded himself into the home, which brought out a number of resources including the Special Response Team, crisis negotiators along with some others, Major Case Team, K-9, etc.,” he said. A News 8 crew on scene also heard police detonate flash grenades. Just before 5 p.m., Dixon said officers had not yet been able to search the house thoroughly and previous attempts to communicate with the man had not been successful. “Our goal here is to make sure that we get him out safely and peacefully,” he said. Dixon said it was not clear whether the man, whose name was not released, lived at the home. According to Dixon, the street was blocked off “for safety purposes” because the man was wanted on gun-related charges. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.
