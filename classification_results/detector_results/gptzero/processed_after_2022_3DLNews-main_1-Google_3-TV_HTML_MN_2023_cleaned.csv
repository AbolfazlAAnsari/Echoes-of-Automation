News Meta, the parent company of Facebook announced plans to build a new data center in Rosemount, Minnesota. Facebookâ€™s parent company, Meta, is planning to build a data center in Rosemount. The more than 700,000 square foot center will be along County Road 42, just east of the Dakota County Technical College. WCCO\'s Kirsten Mitchell explains the impact on the Rosemount community and beyond. Facebook and Instagram users earlier today reported that they were booted out of the social media platforms, with many unable to log back in. Two conservative-led states took on social media Monday in arguments before the highest court in the land. The two cases concern Republican-backed state laws that aim to restrict social media companies like Facebook and X, formerly Twitter, from moderating content. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg directly addressed families after prodding from Sen. Josh Hawley. Since it was posted last week, it\'s gained more than 1.4 million views on Tik Tok and more than 49,000 views on Facebook. Meta wants children and teens on Facebook and Instagram as long as possible so it can collect and sell their personal data, state prosecutors allege. Minnesota, Wisconsin and dozens of other states are suing tech giant Meta. Minnesota has joined a massive lawsuit accusing Meta of purposefully deploying features on its social media platforms that are harmful to mental health among youth. The University of Minnesota hit the ""like"" button on a massive new Facebook facility in the metro area. The University of Minnesota hit the ""like"" button on a massive new Facebook facility in the metro. Rosemount Police Department took to Facebook on Wednesday to share a cheeky picture of a homemade speeding ""leaderboard"" that had been added to a speed sign. The application to collect part of Meta\'s data privacy settlement is simple, requiring only a few minutes to fill out. In particular, transgender, non-binary and gender non-conforming users are subject to hate speech and harassment on social media, the report found. Officials are urging people to stop using the lounger, and asking online marketplaces to regulate attempts to re-sell it, two years after the recall. Dr. Vivek Murthy urged policymakers and tech companies to take ""immediate action"" to protect young people. The court sidestepped a ruling that could have limited the scope of a federal law known as Section 230 that serves as a powerful shield for internet companies. TikTok\'s uncertain future could spur Facebook\'s resurgence, but only if the latter can woo young users. YouTube\'s decision means the former president\'s accounts on three major social media platforms have been restored ahead of the 2024 election. Zuckerberg said funding low-priority projects is costly and company functions better as leaner organization. In a Facebook post\u200b, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the new verification system called ""Meta Verified"" will cost $11.99 month on web or $14.99 a month for iPhone users. The Supreme Court is for the first time considering the scope of Section 230, which provides legal immunity to online companies for content posted by third parties. Earlier this month, Trump\'s presidential campaign asked Meta to reinstate him on the social media platform. Facebook event advertising polar plunge at ""Lake Chipotle"" garners 1.6K responses from users. The historian notes the felony conviction of a former American president by a jury of peers, proving all are equal under the law, would never have taken place in countries ruled by authoritarians.

Sunday is off to a quiet start across Minnesota, but storms will return later in the day. School safety is top of mind for a group of Wayzata teenagers.
