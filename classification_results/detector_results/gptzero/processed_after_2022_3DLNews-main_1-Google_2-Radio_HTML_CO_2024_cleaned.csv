'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': ""MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: A court hearing in one of former President Donald Trump's legal cases featured a different main character. A MARTÍNEZ, HOST: Yeah. That's right. Yesterday's main protagonist was Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis. She's fighting off an attempt to remove her from the Georgia election interference case involving the former president. Trump and other defendants accuse her of a conflict of interest stemming from a romantic relationship with a prosecutor that she hired for the probe. MARTIN: WABE's Sam Gringlas has been in the courtroom and he is with us now from Atlanta. Good morning, Sam. SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Hey, Michel. MARTIN: OK. So awkward, embarrassing, all of the above - but what exactly does this personal relationship, which the two have now acknowledged, have to do with the Trump case? I guess I'm asking, how did we get to this hearing? GRINGLAS: Well, Michel, this began when one of the defendants lobbed an accusation of his own. He said DA Fani Willis had been in an improper relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade and that she stood to financially benefit from this prosecution, with the money Wade earned from the case funding fancy trips with Willis, essentially a disqualifying conflict of interest. Though none of this touches on the underlying case focused on 19 people who allegedly tried to interfere with the 2020 election. MARTIN: So now a judge is trying to decide whether to disqualify the DA. What's the testimony been like so far? GRINGLAS: Well, the two prosecutors already acknowledged that they had been more than colleagues, but there were still many unanswered questions, some very personal, like, what exactly did the relationship entail; who paid for what? Michel, there were gasps in the room when Willis suddenly appeared saying she wanted to testify. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FANI WILLIS: You're confused. You think I'm on trial? These people are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020. I'm not on trial, no matter how hard you try to put me on trial. MARTIN: Well, I mean, it sounds kind of intense. What exactly was so contentious? GRINGLAS: Prosecutors insist the relationship did not begin before Willis hired Wade for the election probe, but an ex-friend of Willis disputed that. Another disagreement - whether Willis paid Wade back for her share of vacation expenses - that matters because it gets to whether Willis has a financial stake in this prosecution. Willis and Wade say she reimbursed him in cash. Defense attorneys like Craig Gillen were skeptical, as you can hear in this exchange with Wade. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CRAIG GILLEN: You don't have a single solitary deposit slip to corroborate or support any of your allegations that you were paid by Mrs. Willis in cash, do you? NATHAN WADE: No, sir. GILLEN: Not a single solitary one. WADE: Not a one. GRINGLAS: Wade says he didn't have a paper trail for this money because he spent it. MARTIN: So now you've got prosecutors with one version of events, and you've got these defense lawyers with another. What does the judge do with that? GRINGLAS: Last night, I called up a law professor who was actually sitting right behind me in court, Georgia State University's Anthony Michael Kreis. This is his take. ANTHONY MICHAEL KREIS: The evidentiary testimony that we heard today was essentially not terribly revealing. What this is essentially boiling down to is a battle of credibility. GRINGLAS: So not only will Judge Scott McAfee have to weigh what legal standard to use here - you know, an actual conflict versus an appearance of conflict; he's also got to judge the facts themselves. Look, the window is already narrow for Trump and his codefendants to stand trial before the next election, and delays from disqualification or appeals could make that opening even smaller. And I think this underscores, despite the seemingly tabloid nature of this story, the stakes are quite high. MARTIN: That is WABE's Sam Gringlas in Atlanta. Sam, thank you. GRINGLAS: Thanks, Michel. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Israeli forces have entered and taken over southern Gaza's largest hospital, where they believe bodies of some Israeli hostages are being held. MARTÍNEZ: And despite international pressure, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows Israeli forces will go into the southern town of Rafah. That's where at least a million Palestinians are sheltering. After another phone call with President Biden last night, Netanyahu, in a social media post, again rejected calls for a two-state solution. MARTIN: We're going to go now to NPR's Eleanor Beardsley, who is following all this from Tel Aviv. Eleanor, hello. ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: So what are Israel and the Palestinians saying about what's happening in this hospital? BEARDSLEY: Well, according to Gaza's health ministry, there's no power or heating in the hospital, and fuel for generators is set to run out in the next 24 hours. And the ministry said there are patients on respirators and babies in incubators. They called it a catastrophic situation. Late last night, Israeli Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari spoke. He said Israel does not enter hospitals without good reason. And he said they have proof that Hamas has been hiding and operating inside the Nasser Hospital complex. He even named ambulance drivers who he said had confessed to transporting hostages. You know, Israeli media are also reporting there may be hostages' bodies in that hospital, but we don't have any proof of that yet. MARTIN: Meanwhile, there's been an increase in cross-border rocket fire in the country's north with the Iran-backed Hezbollah forces in Lebanon. What can you tell us about what's going on there? BEARDSLEY: Yeah. The two sides have traded rocket barrages that have gone deeper into each other's territory. One Israeli soldier, a young woman, was killed and several injured in an attack this weekend, Israel responded with rockets into southern Lebanon, killing eight civilians there. Both sides say they are ready for war if it comes to that. But keep in mind the rhetoric heats up and cools down regularly between Israel and Hezbollah over the border. But there's no doubt it's very high now. And this is happening as Israel remains poised to send ground troops into southern Gaza, the city of Rafah, where at least a million Palestinians are sheltering. And even Egypt is getting increasingly nervous about this and preparing for a possible influx of Palestinian refugees. MARTIN: I understand that you've also been talking to the families of Israeli hostages right now. What are they saying? BEARDSLEY: Yeah. You know, Michel, they're still the main moral voice in Israeli society, and they carry a lot of weight. Usually, they meet on Saturday nights. But last night, they gathered in front of Israel's Defense Department in Tel Aviv as the War Cabinet was meeting. They blocked a major four-lane road downtown. They clearly wanted to send a message. And along with huge pictures of hostages, they carried signs that said time is running out and Biden, please save us. They're furious that Israel has left cease-fire talks, and they think winning this war must begin with freeing the more than 130 hostages still being held by Hamas. I spoke with 31-year-old Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel is in Gaza. Here's what he said. GIL DICKMANN: The most urgent thing is to bring home the hostages. That's the most urgent thing because it's going to take time to win this war, and the hostages have no time. We have to make sure that they're home, and this is the most important thing. Then we can deal with all the other things. MARTIN: And I understand that President Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke last night. Can you tell us anything about that? BEARDSLEY: Well, yeah. Well, of course, Biden urged, you know, care in Rafah. He said, you must take care of the civilians first. But it seems that Netanyahu continues to defy U.S. wishes. Shortly after that call, Netanyahu tweeted that a two-state solution is out of the question, and he called it a reward for terrorists. MARTIN: That is NPR's Eleanor Beardsley in Tel Aviv. Eleanor, thank you so much for this reporting. BEARDSLEY: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Shock gave way to grief last night in Kansas City, Mo., as the community turned out for a vigil to honor Lisa Lopez-Galvan. MARTÍNEZ: The 43-year-old mother, community leader and radio host died in Wednesday's shooting. The violence broke out at a parade held in celebration of the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl win. MARTIN: NPR's Brian Mann is in Kansas City this morning. Good morning, Brian. BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Good morning, Michel. MARTIN: So you were at last night's vigil. Thank you for that. What did you hear? MANN: Yeah. People in Kansas City, especially in the Hispanic community, really adored Lisa Lopez-Galvan. They described her as one of those people who just kind of connect everybody and put all the pieces""}]"

Robert Hur’s report on his yearlong investigation into President Joe Biden’s handling of classified materials was made public last week, it said no charges were warranted because the evidence wasn’t sufficient to support a conviction. That might have been the end of it as a legal matter but two sentences near the top of his executive summary, the 14-page recap of the massive 388-page document, created an enduring political firestorm. Seized on by the news media in the immediate scramble to report the news — and by Republicans eager to capitalize — was the sentence: “Our investigation uncovered evidence that President Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified materials after his vice presidency when he was a private citizen.” And then came Hur’s politically damaging suggestion that, in deciding whether to prosecute, he had considered that Biden would likely present himself to a jury as a “sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” A closer look at the rest of the report, though, shows despite Hur’s “willfully retained and disclosed” assertion there were other innocent explanations that couldn’t be ruled out, and language about Biden’s apparent memory lapses didn’t contain much context, leading to questions about their relevance. Norm Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served as special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee from 2019 to 2020, told ABC News Hur’s executive summary stands “in tension” with the rest of the report. “There’s a leap in the executive summary from the evidence, and those kinds of leaps and editorializing are contrary to the most fundamental principles of how prosecutors are supposed to operate when addressing uncharged conduct,” Eisen said, describing the summary as “misleading.” “Extraordinary care is called for precisely because that can be so damaging,” Eisen added. Some observers have compared the matter to the controversy sparked by then-FBI Director James Comey’s condemnation of Hillary Clinton as “extremely careless” while announcing his decision in the middle of the 2016 election campaign not to recommend charging her for use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. Though in this case, Hur as a special counsel was mandated to explain his findings in a report to Attorney General Merrick Garland, who vowed to make it public for transparency. Here is a closer look at what else Hur said in his report. Retention of documents Classified materials relating to Biden’s time as vice president and as a senator were found at three locations: Biden’s Delaware home, the Penn Biden Center in Washington and the University of Delaware. For the documents found at the Penn Biden Center and the University of Delaware, Hur said the evidence suggested they were likely sent and kept there by mistake after being packed by staff. Those found at Biden’s Delaware home presented the strongest possible criminal case, Hur said. There, investigators found marked classified documents about a troop surge to Afghanistan in 2009 in a damaged box as well as Biden’s handwritten notebooks that Hur said contained classified information. Even more specific, because Biden was president when the materials were found in his Delaware home, Hur concentrated on a period of time immediately after the Obama administration when investigators believed Biden (then a private citizen) may have stored those materials at a home he was renting in Virginia. In February 2017, according to tape recordings from the ghostwriter of Biden’s memoir, Biden said he “just found all this classified stuff downstairs” as the two men spoke about a handwritten memo Biden had sent to President Barack Obama over the Thanksgiving holiday in 2009 advising against a troop surge to Afghanistan. Hur said there was evidence that “supported the inference” that when Biden said that to the ghostwriter “he was referring to the Afghanistan documents.” That’s because, Hur said, other files in the box where the Afghanistan documents were eventually found were dated as being created in the weeks prior to that conversation, making it appear that Biden had recently accessed the box. But Hur said there was no photographic evidence placing the Afghanistan documents at the Virginia home, and their path from the Obama administration to Biden’s Delaware home remained unclear. Other innocent explanations couldn’t be ruled out, like the possibility the documents were brought to Delaware during the vice presidency and forgotten about. “While it is natural to assume that Mr. Biden put the Afghanistan documents in the box on purpose and that he knew they were there, there is in fact a shortage of evidence on these points,” the report read. “We do not know why, how, or by whom the documents were placed in the box. We do not know whether or when Mr. Biden carefully reviewed the box’s contents.” “We find the evidence as a whole insufficient to meet the government’s burden of proving that Mr. Biden willfully retained the Afghanistan documents in the Virginia home in 2017,” he added. “That is, evidence falls short of beyond a reasonable doubt.” On the issue of Biden’s handwritten notebooks, Hur wrote the “evidence shows convincingly” that Biden knew they contained classified information, pointing to his years in government service and subsequent familiarity with protocols of handling classified material as well as his comments to the ghostwriter to be careful because the entries he was reading aloud may be classified. But Hur said the evidence wouldn’t “meet the government’s burden at trial.” The special counsel expected Biden’s defense would focus on his understanding his notebooks (which contained notes about official meetings but also personal details, like “gut-wrenching” entries about his son Beau’s death) were his own personal property, as was the case of Ronald Reagan’s diaries, and that “enough evidence supports this defense to establish reasonable doubt.” Disclosure of classified information This portion of the report focuses heavily on Biden’s conversations with his ghostwriter, Mark Zwonitzer, as they worked on his memoir “Promise Me, Dad.” Hur stated that their investigation found Biden read near-verbatim entries from his notebooks containing classified information to Zwonitzer on three occasions, according to tape recordings and transcripts obtained from Zwonitzer. Two of those times he read notes of a meeting that occurred in the Situation Room in 2015. The third time, the report said, Biden read an entry recounting a National Security Council meeting that occurred in 2014. During this conversation, Biden warned Zwonitzer some of the information may be classified, but he also stressed he was “not sure.” “Mr. Biden should have known that by reading his unfiltered notes about classified meetings in the Situation Room, he risked sharing classified information with his ghostwriter,” Hur wrote. “But the evidence does not show that when Mr. Biden shared the specific passages with his ghostwriter, Mr. Biden knew the passages were classified and intended to share classified information.” Hur also noted there is no classified material in the published memoir. Biden’s mental acuity Sprinkled throughout the report are references to Biden’s state of mind. These are among the most controversial aspects of the report. Hur’s critics call them “gratuitous” while his supporters say they are part of establishing Biden’s intent and whether he acted willfully. The White House and some legal experts have suggested that language was politically motivated, stating conclusions only a medical professional was qualified to make. In his executive summary, Hur described Biden’s memory as being “significantly limited” both in his five hours of interview with the special counsel in October 2023 and in his conversations with his ghostwriter in 2017. Later, Hur wrote that Biden’s memory in the interview was “worse.” According to the special counsel, Biden “did not remember when he was vice president, forgetting on the first day of the interview when his term ended (‘if it was 2013 – when did I stop being Vice President?’), and forgetting on the second day of the interview when his term began (‘in 2009, am I still Vice President?’).” The special counsel continued: “He did not remember, even within several years, when his son Beau died,” and “his memory appeared hazy when describing the Afghanistan debate that was once so important to him.” Biden, choking back emotion, responded to the detail about Beau’s death in his news conference last week. “How in the hell dare he raise that?” Biden said, telling reporters that his first reaction to the question was that it was none of Hur’s business. It’s not clear, based on Hur’s report, how Beau came up as a topic in their interview. But at another point in the report, Hur wrote that Biden’s state of mind when it came to his handwritten notebooks was “compelling” and “clear, forceful testimony.” Biden’s attorneys highlighted the apparent “contrast” in a letter written to Hur ahead of the report’s release. “The report uses highly prejudicial language to describe a commonplace occurrence among witnesses: a lack of recall of years-old events,” Richard Sauber and Bob Bauer wrote to Hur. “You refer to President Biden’s memory on at least nine occasions — a number that is itself gratuitous.

Especially to keen-eyed fans in the state of Colorado, there was a glaring injustice unfolding right before your very eyes - much bigger than just another Kansas City championship - as none other than Denver Broncos legend John Elway was forced to present the Vince Lombardi trophy to the Chiefs, on stage, for the world to see. Many Super Bowl parties across the Centennial State likely erupted in the same exclamation, right around the same time, as Elway first appeared on screen carrying the trophy toward the podium. Something to the effect of ""what the fudge?!"" was shouted at TVs from Trinidad to the Wyoming border and beyond, with the word ""fudge"" being something quite a bit more colorful, especially as seen through blue and orange glasses. Painful as it was to see, there was a perfectly good explanation as to why. Super Bowl LVIII marks the 25th anniversary of Super Bowl XXXIII, otherwise known as when the Denver Broncos defeated the Atlanta Falcons for their second world championship - in Elway\'s final game as an NFL player, where he won MVP honors. He was chosen months ago as one of the former players who would participate in the ""parade"" of people who walk the trophy to the podium for the annual presentation after the game. Still, it hasn\'t excused him from taking quite some heat from people across social media. Brutal takes, but all fair. Agreed - that was very tough to watch. Maybe he was hoping the 49ers would prevail - with so many connections to his old Denver Broncos teams - but he gambled and lost. Or maybe the mere possibility the Chiefs would be the winner should have been enough to sit this one out? Either way, it\'s gonna leave a bad taste in the collective mouth of Broncos fans for a while. Gallery Credit: Jacklyn Krol Gallery Credit: Wesley Adams'}]"

Thanks for joining us. CHARLES MAYNES, BYLINE: Happy to be with you. MARTIN: So what do we know at this moment? MAYNES: Well, we know Navalny was in a penal colony in Russia's far northwest. This is above the Arctic Circle, where he'd been transferred late last year. There were some concerns about his health at the time. He was serving out a 19-year sentence for a slew of charges, all widely seen as politically motivated. But the regional prison authorities, as you note, said Navalny collapsed after a walk in a prison yard. Doctors were unable to revive him. He'd been in declining health for years after his imprisonment due to a past poisoning attack. So there always were these questions about Navalny surviving in these harsh circumstances.

I'm thinking he might be the only opposition leader a lot of Americans know. So just tell us about his significance, and especially in Russia. MAYNES: Yeah. You know, he was a longtime critic of President Vladimir Putin and Russia's authoritarian government. And of course, his imprisonment, as I noted, was widely seen as payback for his political ambitions. You know, he wanted to be the next president of Russia, and he didn't hide it. Now, he emerged as a breakout political star during anti-government protests over a decade ago and really made enemies in the Kremlin with anti-corruption campaigns that exposed graft in the government's inner circles, including with President Vladimir Putin. And this had consequences for Navalny's safety. He barely survived a poisoning attack in 2020. He blamed it on the Kremlin. But I think what Navalny did was really cleave at sort of generational differences in Russia. You know, Putin has always tapped into older Russians, or if you'd like, the Soviet generations, you know, grievances over the end of the Soviet Union, over the end of the USSR. In turn, Navalny, he channeled this younger generation's hope that, you know, Russia could break free from this sort of repressive past and become more of what he called a normal country, a European country. MARTIN: Where does this leave the opposition in Russia? MAYNES: Well, in tatters. You know, most are either in prison or exile. And Navalny was the leader, and he's now dead. You know, he'd been urging supporters to campaign against the invasion of Ukraine. I mean, even as he was behind bars, he remained, like, an active participant in Russian politics, and he had the moral weight from it because he stayed in Russia.

in one of former President Donald Trump's legal cases featured a different main character. A MARTÍNEZ, HOST: Yeah. That's right. Yesterday's main protagonist was Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. She's fighting off an attempt to remove her from the Georgia election interference case involving the former president. Trump and other defendants accuse her of a conflict of interest stemming from a romantic relationship with a prosecutor that she hired for the probe. MARTIN: WABE's Sam Gringlas has been in the courtroom and he is with us now from Atlanta. Good morning, Sam. SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Hey, Michel. MARTIN: OK. So awkward, embarrassing, all of the above. But what exactly does this personal relationship, which the two have now acknowledged, have to do with the Trump case? I guess I'm asking, how did we get to this hearing? GRINGLAS: Well, Michel, this began when one of the defendants lobbed an accusation of his own. He said DA Fani Willis had been in an improper relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade and that she stood to financially benefit from this prosecution, with the money Wade earned from the case funding fancy trips with Willis. Essentially, the defendants argue Willis has a disqualifying conflict. To be clear, though, these claims have nothing to do with actions by Trump and others to undermine Georgia's 2020 election result. MARTIN: So now a judge is trying to decide whether to disqualify the DA. What's the testimony been like so far? GRINGLAS: Well, the two prosecutors already acknowledged that they had been more than colleagues, but there were still many unanswered questions, some very personal, like what exactly did the relationship entail? Who paid for what? Michel, there were gasps in the room when Willis suddenly appeared saying she wanted to testify. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FANI WILLIS: You're confused. You think I'm on trial. These people are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020. I'm not on trial, no matter how hard you try to put me on trial. MARTIN: Well, I mean, it sounds kind of intense. What exactly was so contentious? GRINGLAS: Prosecutors insist the relationship did not begin before Willis hired Wade for the election probe, but an ex-friend of Willis disputed that another disagreement, whether Willis paid Wade back for her share of vacation expenses, that matters because it gets to whether Willis has a financial stake in this prosecution. Willis and Wade say she reimbursed him in cash. Defense attorneys like Craig Gillen were skeptical, as you can hear in this exchange with Wade. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CRAIG GILLEN: You don't have a single solitary deposit slip to corroborate or support any of your allegations that you were paid by Mrs. Willis in cash, do you? NATHAN WADE: No, sir. GILLEN: Not a single solitary one. WADE: Not a one. GRINGLAS: Wade says he didn't have a paper trail for this money because he spent it. MARTIN: So now you've got prosecutors with one version of events and you've got these defense lawyers with another. What does a judge do with that? GRINGLAS: Last night, I called up a law professor who was actually sitting right behind me in court, Georgia State University's Anthony Michael Kreis. This is his take. ANTHONY MICHAEL KREIS: The evidentiary testimony that we heard today was essentially not terribly revealing. What this is essentially boiling down to is a battle of credibility. GRINGLAS: So not only will Judge Scott McAfee have to weigh what legal standard to use here, you know, an actual conflict versus an appearance of conflict, he's also got to judge the facts themselves. Look, the window is already narrow for Trump and his co-defendants to stand trial before the next election, and delays from disqualification or appeals could make that opening even smaller. And I think this underscores, despite the seemingly tabloid nature of this story, the stakes are quite high. MARTIN: That is WABE's Sam Gringlas in Atlanta. Sam, thank you. GRINGLAS: Thanks, Michel.

Certain cities are more expensive to live in than others in the United States and Denver, Colorado is one of those expensive cities to live in. A recent study done by Gobankingrates.com highlights what you would need to make when it comes to income to be considered ""lower middle-class"". In some of these cities, you would need to make around $150,000 to fall into this category. Denver sits just outside of the top 20 most costly cities on Gobankingrates.com list at 21. To be considered lower middle-class in Denver, your income would have to be between the amounts of $57,235 and $95,392. While this seems like a lot of money, these numbers are for combined household income. That may be bad news if you are single and living in an apartment, however. To be on the upper spectrum of the lower middle-class classification in Denver, a two-income household income equates to approximately $47,600 per year, per person. When looking at this list of what is considered the lower middle-class, other cities such as Arlington, VA, San Fransisco, CA, and San Jose, CA are on the very top of the list with a minimum household income of $90,000 would be needed to fall into the lower middle-class category.

Earlier this week, the state House voted 52-12 for a bipartisan measure that would require people convicted of aggravated cruelty to a law enforcement animal to also pay a minimum fine of $2,000 and reimburse an agency for the cost of caring for the animal or replacing it. The crime is already punishable with a prison sentence of up to six years. A nonpartisan state analysis found seven cases in the past three years where people were convicted of cruelty to a service or police animal. Two other states also pushed forward bills this week. In Kansas, the Republican-controlled House voted nearly unanimously to pass a bill sponsored by its top leader to allow judges to sentence first-time offenders to five years in prison and mandate a fine of at least $10,000 for killing dogs used by police, arson investigators, game wardens or search and rescue teams, and for killing police horses. Those crimes already are felonies, but the current maximum prison sentence is one year; the maximum fine is $5,000, and the law does not specifically cover horses. And Monday, the GOP-controlled Missouri House gave its initial approval to legislation that would increase the penalties for harming dogs and horses used by law enforcement, with a final vote expected next week. The bill increases the potential prison sentence for severely injuring or killing an animal from the current maximum of four years, to up to seven years. Similar bills have been filed this year in Democratic-led Hawaii and in GOP-leaning South Carolina and West Virginia. In South Carolina, GOP Gov. Henry McMaster included Rico, a police dog who was fatally shot last year, in his tribute to fallen police, firefighters and paramedics during his State of the State address, after attending the dog\'s funeral in October. “When Rico had his funeral, I’ve never seen so many people at the police academy. There wasn’t a dry eye in the place,” McMaster said, after becoming a little emotional when he paused at Rico\'s name. But in Missouri, Black lawmakers have raised concerns about the legislation, suggesting it could be too broadly applied. “Historically, police animals have been used to affect and, quite frankly, harass marginalized communities,” Democratic Rep. LaKeySha Bosley of St. Louis said during Monday’s debate. A final vote in the Missouri House will determine whether the bill goes to the Senate. The measures in Colorado and Kansas went to their senates. During Colorado’s House debate Monday, Republican Rep. Ryan Armagost stood beside Majority Leader Monica Duran, a Denver-area Democrat, to promote their bill. “It is a huge hit on every agency to lose an animal that’s part of their team. So, I encourage everyone to get behind this, support this, protect those that protect us,"" Armagost said. The first-term representative spent 10 years as a Larimer County Sheriff’s deputy. The House vote split the chamber’s Black Caucus members, with all but two voting against the bill. All of the 12 no votes on the measure came from Democrats. The federal government and other states have also recently acted on the issue. Under a 2000 federal law, a person who kills a police dog can be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison. In 2019, the possible penalty in Florida increased from up to five years in prison to up to 15 years. Tennessee increased its penalties in 2022, and Kentucky did so last year. Supporters of the tougher penalties argue that the animals cost thousands of dollars to obtain and train, are vital to protecting the public and are like family to the officers who work with them. In a Kansas House committee hearing earlier this month, Tyler Brooks, a sheriff\'s deputy in the Wichita area, paid tribute to Bane, an 8-year-old dog who died in November. “It’s kind of funny to me that this very large dog who frequently broke things and knocked everything over during a training session would be the one that would be the one that would break my 7-year-old autistic son of his crippling fear of dogs,” Brooks told the committee. Authorities say a suspect in a domestic violence case took refuge in a storm drain and strangled Bane when a deputy sent the dog in to flush them out. The dog\'s death inspired the Kansas measure, and House Speaker Dan Hawkins immediately dubbed it “Bane\'s Law” after Wednesday\'s vote. Hawkins is a Wichita Republican who is sponsoring the bill along with the House Corrections and Juvenile Justice Committee\'s chair. But injuries caused by police dogs have also made headlines. In rural Ohio in July 2023, a police dog bit a Black truck driver severely enough that he needed hospital treatment after the man was on his knees with his hands in the air. The Salt Lake City police department suspended its dog apprehension program in 2020 after a Black man was bitten and an audit found 27 dog bite cases during the previous two years. And the same year, a Black man in Lafayette, Indiana, was placed in a medically induced coma after police dogs mauled him as he was arrested in a battery case. During Tuesday’s debate in the Kansas House, Democratic Rep. Ford Carr, of Wichita, one of six Black members, mentioned the Ohio case and recalled how during the Civil Rights Movement, authorities turned dogs on peaceful Black protesters. Carr also suggested the Wichita suspect was defending himself. “I don\'t think that there\'s any one of us here who would sit idly by and let an animal maul you without fighting back,"" Carr said. ___ Lieb reported from Jefferson City, Missouri.

Four people familiar with the matter authenticated a series of correspondence first described in a report published on Thursday by the New York Times. On Feb. 7, Ed Siskel and Bob Bauer — attorneys to the president — wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland, complaining that details in the report about the president’s recollections during an interview with investigators “openly, obviously and blatantly violate department policy and practice,” the letters show. Bradley Weinsheimer, a senior Justice Department official, responded the following day that the “identified language is neither gratuitous nor unduly prejudicial because it is not offered to criticize or demean the President; rather, it is offered to explain Special Counsel Hur’s conclusions about the President’s state of mind in possessing and retaining classified information.” The special counsel’s 388-page report ultimately included damning characterizations of the president’s mental acuity, calling him an “elderly man with a poor memory,” who could not remember when he finished his term as vice president or when his son, Beau, died. “We conclude that no criminal charges are warranted in this matter,” said Hur’s report. “We would conclude the same even if there was no policy against charging a sitting president.” This was despite the fact that the special counsel “uncovered evidence that President Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified information after his vice presidency when he was a private citizen,” the report said. Critics of the president pounced on those proclamations to score political points, calling the special counsel’s findings further evidence that Biden is unfit for office. Americans overwhelmingly view Biden as being too old to serve another term, according to a recent ABC News/Ipsos poll. After the release of Hur’s report, Siskel and Bauer responded to Weinsheimer’s letter, “We fundamentally disagree with your assessment that the comments contained in Special Counsel Hur’s report were consistent with Department policy and practice,” they wrote. “They surely were not.” Biden himself railed against details in the report. Speaking to reporters at the White House the night of its release, Biden said, “I know what the hell I’m doing.” Hur is scheduled to testify about the report to Congress on March 12, ABC News reported Thursday. It comes after House Republicans requested his testimony earlier this week, in addition to requests for audio recordings and transcripts related to Hur’s probe. Copyright © 2024, ABC Audio.
