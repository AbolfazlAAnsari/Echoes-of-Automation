Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 12:31 pm Serving Sun Valley, Ketchum, Hailey, Bellevue and Carey June 1, 2024 Jervois USA, a subsidiary of Australian miner Jervois Global, holds mineral rights on the confluence of the Little Deer Creek and south fork of Big Deer Creek drainages in the rugged Salmon River Mountains, about a two-hour drive from Salmon on switchback roads. With a recent $15 million infusion in hand from the U.S. Department of Defense, Salmon, Idaho-based mining company Jervois Mining USA—a subsidiary of Australian mining company Jervois Global—will start exploratory drilling for cobalt on the Salmon-Challis National Forest next week. This marks a major step-up in activity for the company, which wound down operations in late March amid falling cobalt prices. In early October 2022—a time when cobalt prices were still roughly $40 per pound, according to S&P Global—Jervois Mining USA cut the ribbon on its Idaho Cobalt Operations facility, a 200-acre mining campus built on a plateau in the Salmon River Mountains. The site, located about three miles east of the Frank-Church Wilderness, consists of a wastewater treatment plant, a mine tailings storage facility, several ore hauling roads, and a processing mill. Two portals to the west of the plateau lead to two tunnels that angle slightly upwards into the “Ram” cobalt deposit. The “Ram” and adjacent “Sunshine” cobalt deposits belong to the Idaho Cobalt Belt, a 40-mile-long band of mineral deposits containing cobalt, copper, gold and other metals. The cobalt—present here at high enough concentrations to make it the belt’s primary metal—was deposited by underwater volcanos about 1.6 billion years ago on what used to be an ancient sea floor. According to Jervois, the deposits sit on a reserve amounting to 4 million tons of ore with a cobalt concentration of 0.5%, which is higher than the average cobalt ore grade of 0.1%. ""Cobalt is a huge part of our daily lives."" Matt Lengerich Mine Manager In late 2022, the company expected to see its first domestic cobalt ore shipment by early 2023. After that point, it hoped to produce some 16,890 tons of cobalt through 2031—enough to power up to 7 million electric vehicles. What Jervois didn’t foresee was a global crash in cobalt prices. The company let go of 90% of its 300 employees in March and whittled down its staff to a core drill crew, geologists, and consultants, according to mine manager Matt Lengerich. On March 28, Jervois announced that it was suspending operations due to historically low cobalt prices of just $15 per pound. “All construction activity was halted, and we maintained a small fit-for-purpose crew on site,” Lengerich said. “We did our best to limit our impacts to the employees that were leaving, helping them as much as possible with outplacement services and moving onto a different role if that’s what they were interested in. “We went from approximately 300 people on site to about 30. Those that we could retain were retained, but unfortunately we did have to let a large number of contractors go.” Lengerich attributed the crash in prices to the supply of refined cobalt outpacing demand. “What you’re really seeing is the impact of China controlling a significant portion of the refined cobalt market, over 80%, and the fact that cobalt is produced as a byproduct, mostly from copper and nickel,” he said. “Still, we expect that in the medium term, cobalt prices will remain strong and that there will be more of a need for cobalt than there is today.” Now, Jervois’ focus has pivoted to mining cobalt for aerospace and weapons manufacturing, said Lengerich. The company’s $15 million agreement with the U.S. government will reimburse Jervois using money from the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act passed by Congress this year. “Cobalt is commonly used in commercial and military applications, jet engines. We absolutely believe and understand its need for defense,” he said. Lengerich said the grant agreement has multiple main parts. First, it will allow Jervois to take stock of the cobalt resources on its ICO Ram campus, which it plans to return to for mining when cobalt prices recover. Next, the grant will support exploratory drilling on the Sunshine deposit, a short distance away from the ICO campus. “Sunshine was previously drilled in the 1990s but we need to drill that further to classify that under modern resource standards. With the Ram deposit, we will actually be looking to demonstrate that the deposit continues underground as we expect it does,” Lengerich said. To minimize impact, crews will “carefully select where those drill pads are located, try to get as many holes off of that drill pad as we can, and limit that footprint we have on site in the way that we operate,” he said. After drilling costs are incurred, the company can request reimbursement. “We are quite excited about working closely with the [Department of Defense] on this and will be keeping them regularly updated,” Lengerich said. Other drilling projects occurring around Jervois’ Ram mineral claim include the Bonanza Helicopter-Assisted Drilling project, launched in 2020 by Vancouver, Canada-based company Battery Mineral Resources Corp, and the Iron Creek Exploration Drilling and Trenching project, authorized by the Forest Service in 2017. The latter is being conducted by $52 million Ontario-based company Electra Battery Materials. Forest Service documents show that the Sunshine drilling exploration project was authorized on July 28, 2023, by District Ranger Bobbi Filbert, who wrote in her decision that it would not have a “significant” negative impact on the environment and therefore would be exempt from the lengthy federal review process. In her decision, Filibert stated that drilling “would have negligible effects at most” to endangered white bark pine trees in the area. According to Jervois’ plan of operations submitted to the Forest Service, crews will bulldoze the ground and construct seven drilling platforms about the size of a typical garage door just west of the Blackbird mine site. From these platforms, crews will use diamond-core rigs mounted on trucks to drill up to three holes a maximum of 2,000 feet deep at each of seven drill sites. “The more information you can get about a deposit, the more effective you can be in mining. Exploration (drilling) says, ‘I believe the deposit continues past where I drilled, I’m going to drill in areas that have not been drilled before to demonstrate that the deposit continues,’” Lengerich said. Exploratory drilling will last “up to 24 hours per day, 7 days per week” through mid-November before restarting again in June 2024. Lengerich said holes will be several hundred feet to upwards of 1,000 or more feet deep. “It just depends on where we intersect the deposit,” he said. After drilling, crews will plug drill holes with cement and bentonite clay to “prevent cross-contamination of aquifers.” “Water from drilling will not be allowed to discharge to surface waters, ephemeral or intermittent drainages. Most of the water will be recirculated to the drill rig to be reused,” Jervois stated. “All motorized equipment will have working mufflers to minimize noise and spark arresters to minimize potential ignition of a wildland fire.” Exploratory drilling will last ""up to 24 hours per day, 7 days per week"" through mid-November before restarting again in June 2024. Lengerich said the next part of the federal grant agreement will allow Jervois to conduct its own research on the feasibility of building a cobalt refinery in the U.S.—a “critical” first step in growing a domestic cobalt supply chain independent of China, Russia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to a press release from the Defense Department. “It would answer questions like where would it be located, what is the cost to operate, what is the cost to build.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 12:31 pm Serving Sun Valley, Ketchum, Hailey, Bellevue and Carey June 1, 2024 The proposed Rivian charging station would resemble a small gas station, with credit card readers and pumps. Soon, owners of Rivian electric SUVs and pickup trucks should be able to charge their vehicles in Hailey. The Hailey Planning and Zoning Commission on Monday, Dec. 18, approved a conditional-use permit application allowing Rivian Automotive to build six “super charging” stalls at 207 North Main Street in downtown Hailey. Pending final design approval next month, Hailey will become Idaho’s first city to host a Rivian-specific charging station. With a conditional-use permit now in hand, the company is due to come back to the P&Z on Jan. 16 for final approval of its streetlight design and landscaping design plans. Rivian, a high-end electric vehicle maker based in Irvine, Calif., currently offers the “R1S,” a seven-person SUV, and the “R1T,” a five-person pickup truck, as well as an electric delivery van, the “EDV.” All three vehicles hit the market towards the end of 2021, and start at around $75,000. Each can travel up to about 400 miles on a full charge, rivaling Telsa models. The automaker is planning to install three power cabinets and six 6-foot-tall charging posts on what is now an undeveloped gravel lot north of Sturtevants. The charging site will be accessed from the alleyway off East Galena Street and drivers would exit via Carbonate Street, Rivian spokeswoman Chelsea Williams said. Williams said the site will have enough room for R1T or R1S models towing trailers. “One of the most requested features at our charging sites has been the (space) to be able to charge, get on your way, and not have to unhitch your trailer,” she said. Rivian will lease the land for the next 10 years from Bellevue-based Good Dirt LLC, and has plans to improve the landscaping with rabbitbrush, a drought-tolerant member of the ragweed family, Williams said. She noted that DC (direct-current) fast chargers will have an output of up to 300kW, meaning Rivian drivers could add up to 140 miles of range in 20 minutes. Power will be sourced from two existing power poles in the alleyway, she said. Currently, Rivian owners in the Wood River Valley must charge their cars with home wall chargers or portable chargers. The site has already been approved by Idaho Power, Williams said. “We had to submit each site that we were considering to (Idaho Power) and understand what the cost would be to upgrade the distribution, and make sure that was achievable for Rivian,” she said. “That’s how we landed at this site.” Design plans presented by Rivian included street lights with a brightness of over 8,000 lumens each. But according to a staff report by Hailey City Planner Ashley Dyer, this is against Hailey city code, which allows a maximum of only 2,400 lumens under its dark sky ordinance. Rivian has since agreed to “redo” its lighting plan, Williams said, and will return with that next month. Dyer also noted in her staff report that the station will benefit local Rivian owners and give a boost to “surrounding businesses.” “Vehicle traffic will increase, but like with all electric vehicles, they will produce little-to-no sounds from their electromagnetic motors. Similarly, they produce no fumes or odors,” Dyer stated. Currently, Rivian owners in the Wood River Valley must charge their cars with home wall chargers or portable chargers. “Adventure” charging stations with higher capacity DC fast chargers (equivalent to Telsa’s “Supercharger” stations) or Waypoints stations (equivalent to Tesla’s “Destination” stations and similar to home-charging stations) are also available in several cities, but not in Idaho. Rivian is, however, in the process of installing thousands of “Waypoints” and “Adventure” charging stations across the country, according to its website. The nearest “Adventure” station is in Spokane, Wash., and the nearest “Waypoints” station is in Lander, Wyoming. In comparison, the nearest Tesla “Supercharger” station is located at the Twin Falls Visitor Center. Tesla’s shorter-range “Destination” charging stations can be found outside the Sun Valley Lodge, Knob Hill Inn, Silver Creek Hotel, and Sun Valley Auto Club. Williams explained that by 2025, all Rivian SUVs and trucks are anticipated to have Tesla-compatible charging ports. And, next summer, Rivian hopes to roll out adapters allowing previous version owners to connect to Tesla’s Supercharger network, she said. “Rivian has planned to adapt the NACS plug, which has become industry standard,” she said. “So, regardless if you have a vehicle with a CCS1 port or NACS port you will be able to charge with an adaptor.” Hailey resident Elizabeth Jeffrey applauded the proposal after Williams’ presentation on Dec. 18. “I’m really glad this is close to the core of downtown.

Our experience is most local EV owners will quickly install their own Level 2 chargers at home, because that is by far the cheapest and most convenient way to charge. But for new EV owners and visitors, Rivian\'s charging station will be a boon. And thank goodness - drought tolerant landscaping! "" will make Hailey even more desirable as a stopping point for visitors to the valley."". I knew there was a reason to visit Hailey.

and retiring ISU President Kevin Satterlee, at right. A top university administrator from Utah is the new leader of Idaho State University. Robert Wagner, executive vice president and chief operating officer at Utah State University, was named ISU’s 14th president by the Idaho State Board of Education at a Thursday afternoon meeting on the Pocatello campus. He succeeds Kevin Satterlee, who’s retiring after more than five years as ISU’s president. Wagner will officially take the helm at ISU on Jan. 29, 2024. His initial contract is for 30 months with an annual salary of $420,000. The State Board of Education on Thursday appointed Brian Sagendorf, ISU’s vice president of operations, to serve as ISU’s acting president Jan. 1 through Jan. 28. Satterlee’s last day at ISU is Dec. 31. Wagner addressed an audience of about 50 people, mostly ISU officials and employees, at Thursday afternoon’s announcement ceremony at the ISU Alumni Center. Wagner spent time expressing thanks to members of the State Board of Education, board staff members and the presidential search committee. Wagner also conveyed gratitude toward Satterlee and his “outstanding leadership and vision directing ISU for over five years with values that are readily apparent (such as) trust, compassion, stability and hope with a strong culture of Bengal pride.” Wagner then paid a special tribute to his family who were in attendance, reflecting on their fortitude during his many years at USU and their resilience as he earned his bachelors, master’s and doctorate degrees. “My own experiences as a student instilled in me compassion for every student who has embarked on the arduous, demanding and rewarding journey of pursuing a college degree,” Wagner said. “I feel honored to have witnessed the grit and success of many students who achieved noble goals while conquering individual unique difficulties. One of my challenges was being a non-traditional student, balancing family and work in pursuit of education and opportunity.” Wagner remarked that his appointment as ISU president coincided with the winter solstice on Dec. 21. During his speech at the Alumni Center, he compared how this time of the year represents a turning point and that the days following mid-winter grow longer and brighter. “Idaho State University has been and is growing noticeably brighter and I have every expectation we will continue to grow brighter and brighter moving forward,” Wagner said. “There is something special about this institution. To the faculty, staff and alumni of all of Idaho State University’s campuses across this great state and even reaching Alaska, and to the diverse and vibrant populations and people whose history makes our collaborations richer and more meaningful, I pledge to you my unwavering support and dedication to this great institution and to our students. You are why we are here. ISU will continue to be a student centric university. (We will) find innovative ways of supporting students and providing the highest caliber of education with a focus on affordability, relevance, and impact. I’m so happy to be part of an undeniably special university and I will work with you all to make it even more extraordinary as the days grow brighter into the future. We will make an impact.” When asked what message he would want to send to ISU’s faculty, Wagner said: “First of all, the faculty of this institution are foundational to what we do from a teaching perspective. Research, working with our students, our undergraduate and graduate students, and faculty are incredibly important. I’ve spent my career not only as a faculty member but working with faculty. I’ve been part of a faculty senate for many years. I appreciate the value of shared governance. That’s important and that’s something that will continue here at Idaho State University and will be a focus. I will seek to understand their needs and look forward to working with them.” Regarding ISU athletics, Wagner wants to see a continuation of the current momentum while ensuring that student athletes receive the support they require. “The institution is seeing great success,” Wagner said about ISU. “I want to focus on the needs of our student athletes, making sure they’re getting the academic and life support that they need. As an institution, those student athletes are incredibly important to us not only to our athletic teams and our Bengal pride and spirit, but the great opportunities for them from an educational perspective. We want to focus on our student athletes, focus on their success on the field, on the court, and in the classroom.” State board member Cindy Siddoway, the search committee’s co-chair and an ISU alumna, said she’s optimistic about ISU’s future with Wagner at the helm. “Dr. Wagner is a very sincere person,” Siddoway said. “He cares deeply about ISU and its campus community. He’ll work hard to establish strong relationships with alumni and community leaders, and he will build on ISU’s recent momentum and be an outstanding leader and advocate for higher education in Idaho.” Wagner’s previous positions at USU in Logan, Utah, include vice president of academic and instructional services, executive vice provost and dean of academic and instruction services, and vice provost of regional campuses and distance education.

Downs, NuScale Senior Reactor Operator, speaks to audience members about NuScale’s small modular reactor at the Idaho Falls Power Energy Center on Thursday, Aug. 15, 2019. This year was one of triumph and setbacks, tragedy, political intrigue and challenges. Each year the Post Register\'s newsroom chooses the year\'s most important news stories to look back on as the new year approaches. While the list is subjective, there\'s no denying the 10 articles\' topics highlighted below made an impact with readers in 2023. Among the triumphs, the long-awaited reopening of Funland at Tautphaus Park. In the category of setbacks, a court\'s ruling that an Idaho Falls School District 91 levy election was invalid and the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems / NuScale joint decision to end the Carbon-Free Power Project topped the list. Eastern Idaho saw justice served when convicted murderer Lori Vallow was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences for the deaths of her children, J.J. Vallow and Tylee Ryan, as well as Tammy Daybell, the former wife of her accused co-conspirator and husband Chad Daybell. It also saw justice denied, again, when Christopher Tapp, who spent most of his adulthood in prison for crimes he didn\'t commit, died in a freak accident just a few years after he\'d finally been exonerated. In terms of political intrigue, the Bonneville County Republican Party as well as its hard-right allies in the state party didn\'t disappoint. The state party forced out longtime national committeeman Damond Watkins and local legislative district committees conducted investigations of all six Idaho Falls-area legislators for perceived violations of state party rules. Below are the Post Register\'s top 10 articles, which are not ranked. At its origination, the plan to build a series of small-modular reactors at Idaho National Laboratory\'s desert site west of Idaho Falls was hailed as a game changer in the race to move the country and the world away from fossil-fuel-generated power. The Carbon-Free Power Project, which had been in the works for more than a decade, planned to build 12 small-modular nuclear reactors on the DOE’s desert site west of Idaho Falls that would provide research power to the lab and power to Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems members, including Idaho Falls. A 2016 Idaho Department of Labor report estimated construction of the project would create or sustain nearly 13,000 jobs in the local economy with average wages estimated at $58,000 to $83,000 (in today\'s dollars). But the United States\' lengthy process for authorizing such projects and rising costs from supply chain issues and inflation caused the estimated costs to rise from an estimated $2.8 billion in 2016 to $9.3 billion by January. In November, UAMPS and NuScale Power Corporation announced they had mutually agreed to terminate the project. Before the project was shelved, it recorded several milestones that no other small-modular reactor project had achieved. Chris Tapp receives a kiss from his mother Vera after Judge Alan Stephens vacated Tapp’s murder conviction during a recent hearing at the Bonn… Tapp never received justice for a life derailed by conviction and prison sentence for crimes he didn\'t commit. Tapp spent more than two decades in prison for the 1996 rape and murder of Angie Dodge in Idaho Falls. After a yearslong legal battle, Tapp was released from prison on March 22, 2017, and was exonerated on July 17, 2019, after Dodge\'s actual killer Brian Dripps confessed to committing the crimes alone. Tapp and Dripps did not know each other. Out of prison Tapp spent time with his mother Vera, who had sacrificed so much to try to get him freed. He also married. And he sued the city of Idaho Falls for his wrongful imprisonment, eventually reaching an $11.7 million settlement in October 2020 while also receiving an official letter of apology from the city. But his post-prison life was short. Tapp died Nov. 5, 2023, following a freak accident in Las Vegas. He was 47. “I’ve been thinking about how much time the state took away from him and it turns out he didn’t have that much time,” former Post Register reporter Bryan Clark said after learning of Tapp\'s death. “It’s just heartbreaking."" Randall lived a vibrant life filled with adventure, art and love. But her life and the lives of her infant son, Zeke Best, and her unborn child ended at the hands of Randall\'s husband, Jeremy Best. Randall was killed at the couple\'s Victor home on Nov. 30. Zeke died sometime between Nov. 30 and Dec. 4. Randall Zeke Gregory Best Best, who reportedly was suffering some sort of mental breakdown at the time of the murders, is charged with three counts of first-degree murder. He is scheduled for arraignment Jan. 3. Randall is remembered as a loving mom to Zeke but also for her adventurous spirit, her love of animals and her passion for art with interests ranging from photography to silversmithing. ""She was an avid and skillful snowboarder, trail rider, and a licensed boat captain, spending every season out in the fierce beauty of the rugged Idaho wilderness,"" her obituary read. Damond Watkins driving with Mitt Romney in Idaho Falls in 2018 on their way to a political event. Watkins, a well-known eastern Idaho politico who served more than a decade as the state\'s national Republican committeeman, was unceremoniously forced out of his longtime role during the Idaho GOP Convention in June. Watkins said he resigned under duress, with Idaho GOP Chairwoman Dorothy Moon threatening to release damning information about him and his family. Watkins later tried to rescind his resignation, which was sent by text from his car as he drove from Challis, the site of the convention, back to Idaho Falls. Two former state Republican chairmen, Trent Clark and Tom Luna, attempted unsuccessfully to get the National Republican Party to intervene on Watkins\' behalf. The party\'s national leaders ruled that Watkins\' resignation was valid and would not be overturned. Moon said Watkins\' resignation came because he and his family had moved to North Carolina and that Watkins had missed multiple state GOP meetings. The effort to remove Watkins from his national committeeman role had started formally in September 2022 with a petition written by Bonneville County GOP State Committeeman Bryan Smith. In a special July 29 election, Smith, a former Idaho Freedom Foundation board member, was elected to fill the vacant national committee seat. He was the only candidate nominated. The former Jefferson County prosecutor and former city attorney for Ririe and Roberts pleaded not guilty in district court today. Former Jefferson County Prosecutor Robin Dunn, who later served as city attorney for both Ririe and Roberts, was arrested in February with 60 fentanyl pills, eight Xanax pills and four alprazolam pills on his person. Dunn had been Jefferson County\'s prosecutor for more than 34 years and had been the longest-serving sitting county prosecutor in the state. But he had long courted controversy, having been accused of abusing his authority, refusing to represent Jefferson County in a federal lawsuit, ""double dipping."" He was investigated by the Idaho Attorney General\'s Office in 2014. Dunn initially was charged with felony possession of a controlled substance, punishable with up to seven years in prison. He also faces three misdemeanor charges for possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of a controlled substance, and resisting arrest. Dunn was indicted by a federal grand jury in September, facing new charges of one count of conspiracy to distribute fentanyl and methamphetamine, two counts of possession with the intent to distribute and one count of distribution of methamphetamine. Dunn is scheduled for his trial at 1:30 p.m. on May 20 at the United States Courthouse in Pocatello. Panelists Mallory Johnson, Bonneville County Sheriff Samuel Hulse, Idaho Falls Fire Department Deputy Chief Jon Perry and Michelle Smoley, of … In June, law enforcement seized $900,000 worth of fentanyl pills from a Bonneville County man, the state\'s largest bust for fentanyl pills to date. Jason Hurley, 43, was pulled over for a traffic stop June 27. A Bonneville County Sheriff\'s Office K-9 officer was deployed in the stop. The K-9 indicated the presence of an illegal substance in the vehicle. After officers searched Hurley\'s vehicle, they found drug paraphernalia, a loaded 9 mm handgun, a fanny pack with several thousands of dollars, bags with a white crystalline substance appearing to be methamphetamine, a small bag containing a brown tar substance appearing to be heroin, and two other small bags containing two different types of pills. In a joint effort, Idaho Falls Police and the sheriff\'s department conducted search warrants of Hurley\'s residence and storage units in Chubbuck and Idaho Falls. In total, from all of the searches from the vehicle, the residence and storage units, a total of approximately 73,000 counterfeit fentanyl ""dirty 30"" pills, 20 grams methamphetamine, 9.5 grams marijuana, 30 suboxone strips, $40,572 in cash, five firearms, Louis Vuitton shoes and a Louis Vuitton bag were seized. The fentanyl epidemic strained local law enforcement in 2023. Bonneville County Sheriff Samuel Hulse was among lawmen'}]"

Etienne, Patrick Hatzenbuehler, Brett Wilder, Joseph Sagers and Tyler Hand. (PHOTO: courtesy of University of Idaho) Marc Lutz//December 21, 2023// University of Idaho economists published a report detailing the agricultural commodities that cropped up in the state this past year. Four grew taller than others. Sugar beets, cattle and calves, barley and the state’s most-known crop, potatoes, all brought in record revenues, the report, titled “The Financial Condition of Idaho Agriculture: 2023,” found. According to the report, which was authored by economists Brett Wilder and Xiaoxue “Rita” Du, total cash receipts for ag came in at $11.15 billion, down 1% from the record high in 2022. Sugar beets were up by 25%, cattle and calves up 18%, barley up by 17% and potatoes up by 14%. “We’ve had back-to-back excellent years to be in Idaho agriculture,” Wilder said. “We’ve had all-time record highs in four commodity groups.” He went on to point out that dairy, which represents nearly one-third of the state’s total ag cash receipts, dropped 18%, with sales at $3.5 billion. Idaho still ranks third in the nation for dairy production, the report stated. Though those four commodities had a better year, overall farm profits will come in 11% lower for the year, totaling $3.7 billion. “It’s a very good number,” Wilder pointed out. “We’re still near all-time highs. We’re down 11% year over year, but the U.S. is down 17%, so we’re still outperforming the rest of the country. Farmers and ranchers did well in 2023.” The report showed farmers’ expenses increased due to higher interest rates, and government subsidies also decreased, grazing away at profits. Wilder predicted a successful 2024 for both dairy and beef. The U.S. has the lowest prices for dairy, which could potentially give exports a boost. And beef could be bolstered by tight inventory and high demand. “If you own cows today and don’t have to go buy calves at the prices that are being asked, it’s a fun time to be in the beef industry,” he said. However, economists pointed out that despite most expenses holding steady or declining and increasing some, cash receipts could still be down in 2024. “My expectation in 2024 is we should be down below $11 billion but still above $10 billion,” Wilder said, “unless something catastrophic happens.” Sugar beets, cattle and calves, barley and the state’s most-known crop, potatoes, all brought in record revenues, the report, titled “The Financial Condition of Idaho Agriculture: 2023,” found.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 1:56 pm MOSCOW — Valerie Mesenbrink never tires of seeing the confidence young men gain just by putting on a suit. Maybe it goes back even further, but this legacy of Monson fathers passing basketballs down to their sons at least traces back to Oscar “Swede” Monson, who coached at Menahga (Minn.) High School before World War II. Idaho is unique in that state law requires openness in government, both in meetings and records requests. MOSCOW — Valerie Mesenbrink never tires of seeing the confidence young men gain just by putting on a suit. Idaho quarterback Gevani McCoy slings a pass during practice Thursday at the Kibbie Dome in Moscow. The Idaho football team has completed seven of its spring practices so far. The Vandals have five more practices until their annual black and gold spring game at 6 p.m. April 28 at the Kibbie Dome. Here’s what we’ve learned through the first two weeks of Idaho’s spring camp: The defense is improving One thing Idaho fans should be excited about is that the defense, more often than not, is coming out on top during team drills. Idaho’s defense finished second against the run and third against the pass in the Big Sky Conference last season. But the most impressive stat was its turnover numbers, finishing with a Big Sky-high 23 takeaways. Following a year when the Vandals finished in the top 5 in nearly every defensive category in the Big Sky while losing guys such as defensive lineman Leo Tamba and linebacker Fa’avae Fa’avae, expectations for 2023 were lowered just a bit. But the returners are more comfortable in the second year of defensive coordinator Rob Aurich’s system, and the newcomers are adapting, especially in the run game. Much like last year, the secondary and defensive line were looking like potential weaknesses in the offseason, but both groups have had steady competition in the spring. The secondary is in need of a man to play opposite Oregon State transfer Marcus Harris at the cornerback position. Before the spring, the options appeared slim, but the battle between redshirt freshman Ormanie Arnold and true freshman Dwayne McDougle has been one of the best all camp. The two California natives have been doing their best firefighter impression — they’ve been climbing ladders to grab interceptions during jump ball drills. Both Arnold and McDougle have received playing time with the starters and have shown why they deserve a chance to be on the field come August. Another group that seemed bleak entering the offseason was the defensive line. But the Vandals sack leader, Kemari Bailey, has looked the part of a starting edge rusher. Bailey was going to be a standout regardless, but what’s been impressive has been the play of two guys on the interior, Jahkari Larmond and Zach Krotzer. Larmond brings a lot of size to the Vandals’ defensive line, considering he weighs 30 pounds more than the average refrigerator. He’s been a force in the run defense thus far and is a freak athlete. He’s been able to use his hands to get into the backfield as well as to apply pressure. The spot opposite of Larmond seems to be a bit of a battle as of now, but Krotzer, a Shadle Park graduate out of Spokane, has slowly been working his way through the ranks. He earned a battle axe award during the April 11 practice for his play. The best of the best Idaho’s strength on defense lies with the linebackers, and leading the way is redshirt senior Paul Moala. Moala has been all business this spring and has made at least one play during each practice that’s made the sidelines erupt. Last season, Moala had 61 tackles, seven tackles for loss, four interceptions and two sacks. This year, with the loss of Fa’avae, he’ll move to middle linebacker, and all his numbers should increase. Moala is almost a shoo-in for a captain spot this year, but he should be in line for something more, such as a first-team All-Big Sky nod or an end-of-the-year defensive player of the year award. Moala isn’t the only linebacker making noise, Tre Thomas, a South Dakota transfer, has adapted to Idaho’s defense at a rapid pace. This doesn’t come as much of a surprise since he’s been coached by Aurich before at their old school. The Vandals have other linebackers who are currently practicing with the twos and threes who have made their mark as well. Freshman Jaxton Eck and sophomore Jake Kindel have made the most of their snaps. The linebacker talent will get even deeper during the fall and summer camps once true freshmen Zach Johnson and Auburn, Wash., native Xe’ree Alexander arrive. On offense, the strength comes from returning Jerry Rice Award winner Gevani McCoy at quarterback. It definitely doesn’t hurt that McCoy is throwing to possibly the best receiver duo in the Football Championship Subdivision in Jermaine Jackson and Hayden Hatten. That’s not even mentioning guys like Alex Moore, Jordan Dwyer, Michael Graves and Terez Traynor, who should all be in the mix. The biggest improvement for McCoy has been the chemistry that he’s built with all of his targets. McCoy had an impressive deep ball last year that was almost automatic because he knew where his guy was going to be before he’d get there, and that’s only improved. Several times during camp — whether it’s Dwyer, Hatten or Jackson — McCoy has thrown a vertical pass that’s looked overthrown but was pace-for-pace for his receiver. These things could be problems For the first time in a long time, it appears Idaho has more strengths than weaknesses. There aren’t as many holes that need to be filled heading into 2023. While that’s a good thing, there are still some weaknesses. Granted, they aren’t as glaring as they’ve been in the past, but they’re weaknesses nonetheless, starting with the offensive line. The offensive line has improved in pass protection, which is a big step forward considering last year’s group let up 27 sacks. But in the run game, it has been a struggle for them to open up holes against their own guys. The big boys up front haven’t been able to get much, if any, push, which has resulted in a lot of runs for either negative yardage or no yardage. The other big weakness for the Vandals, at least for now, goes hand-in-hand with the offensive line — the running backs. Anthony Woods looks like he has a better grasp on the offense and has been a major standout so far. It’s been everyone else that’s been a bit shaky. Senior Nick Romano has filled in as the No. 2 back behind Woods and hasn’t done much to solidify that spot. He’s improved little parts of his game like catching the ball and pass protection, but as a runner, he doesn’t seem like a viable option so far. Luckily, the Vandals have three true freshman runners who are going to enter the fray come summer and fall camp and they should have an opportunity to compete and win a spot in Idaho’s rotation.

Women, he told his two female co-anchors, were really in their prime “in her 20s, 30s and maybe her 40s.” When co-host Poppy Harlow, who is 40, objected, he said: “Don’t shoot the messenger, I’m just saying what the facts are.” He was given sensitivity training and returned to air. “He was carrying a lot of public baggage,” said Frank Sesno, former CNN White House correspondent and bureau chief and currently director of strategic initiatives at George Washington University. Martin said a recent Variety magazine investigation which revealed stories of Lemon being misogynistic in the late 2000s while working at CNN in Atlanta was a sign that people inside CNN were actively working against him. Tony Harris, a former CNN anchor now doing work at the History Channel, said he thought Lemon’s future at CNN was doomed when he lost his prime-time spot last fall and was placed in mornings, a time slot CNN has struggled with for decades. “They undermined him,” Harris said. “I get that Don can be a polarizing figure, but that was a direction CNN endorsed for a good period of time.” (In fact, former CNN chief Jeff Zucker was a huge Lemon cheerleader and specifically moved him from Atlanta to New York in 2013 to be a more prominent figure on the network.) In a tweet, CNN called Lemon’s account “inaccurate.” The network said he was given an opportunity to meet with management but “instead released a statement on Twitter.” The New York Times, citing an unnamed source inside CNN, said CNN discovered some guests didn’t want to appear with Lemon and his popularity had fallen with CNN viewers since the Haley brouhaha. As for Carlson, he was a player in the Dominion case, his private correspondence not matching up with what he was saying on air. Emails and texts collected from Fox executives and anchors, including Carlson, showed they did not believe many of the election fraud allegations that were being presented on the network as well as conspiracies about Dominion’s voting machines that proved to be false. He clearly didn’t anticipate what was going to happen on Friday. When he signed off on what would be his final show, he simply said, “We’ll be back Monday… see you then.” Carlson, 53, has worked at all three major cable news networks. He was a commentator with CNN from 2000 to 2005. He was part of MSNBC from 2005 to 2008. He hosted “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Fox News from 2016 until this past Friday. “This is an earthquake at Fox News,” said Sesno, who was going to be an expert witness for Dominion before the case was settled. “But what it means and what damage it really creates, we don’t know yet.” Fox News has survived previous high-profile prime-time departures including those by Bill O’Reilly and Megyn Kelly. Carlson actually took over the time slot in 2017 from O’Reilly, who was accused of sexual harassment by multiple former Fox employees, allegations O’Reilly denied at the time. He soon became Fox’s highest-rated host. But Fox is facing shareholder lawsuits and another lawsuit from a Dominion Voting rival Smartmatic, which is seeking $2.7 billion in damages. CNN, in the meantime, over the past year has been adjusting to new management, weaker ratings and a primetime lineup in flux. The network fired Chris Cuomo a year ago for ethical issues related to his interaction with his brother and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and new CNN boss Chris Licht last fall moved Lemon to mornings before letting him go Monday. MSNBC now only has its biggest star Rachel Maddow one evening a week. “There’s a larger existential threat to cable news with so much cord cutting and polarization and a very demanding transient audience,” Sesno said. Fox News primetime ratings during the first quarter were down 18% year over year. MSNBC’s ratings fell 8%. But CNN’s dropped a whopping 34% in primetime and its 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. slots remain open. CNN’s morning show lasted six months and Lemon’s co hosts Harlow and Kaitlan Collins will remain, CNN said. Ratings have been modest and lag far behind those at Fox and MSNBC. For Warner Bros. Discovery, CNN remains a very profitable division, though profits will certainly be lower this year than last. For News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch, Fox News has also been a consistent financial cash machine and internally, management has fretted about “changing behavior and changing direction that could jeopardize its bottom line,” Sesno noted. He recalls working with Carlson two decades ago. “He was always a very smart, talented person with a distinctive voice,” Sesno said. “Unfortunately, that voice has been directed in some very ugly, intolerant and uninformed ways in recent years.” Local journalism is essential.

Ford and Aurich will both receive a hefty pay raise at their new location. The seven departing players should also see a wage increase by getting paid through their Name Image and Likeness (NIL). Since the Vandals 30-22 loss to Albany in the quarterfinals of the Football Championship Subdivision playoffs on Dec. 9, they’ve lost two starting corners (Marcus Harris, Ormanie Arnold), a starting safety (Murvin Kenion), their third-leading receiver in Terez Traynor, their starting quarterback Gevani McCoy, their leading rusher Anthony Woods and starting right guard Tigana Cisse. “I expected that we’d have some movement for sure,” Idaho football coach Jason Eck said. “That’s the way it is. I don’t know if anybody was extremely shocked. Most of the players entered the portal early, and a few of them are trickling in now. We encouraged them that if they wanted to go in, they would go in earlier instead of later.” Idaho’s two corners, Harris (California) and Arnold (Cincinnati) have already found new homes, and Arnold’s jump from the Big Sky to the Big 12 came as a shock. The redshirt freshman finished with 33 tackles, two interceptions and five pass breakups. “I think everything has a market rate,” Eck said. “He’s going to get $150,000 to go (to Cincinnati), and we recommended that for him. ... I was surprised that was the rate for a guy who wasn’t all-conference and didn’t even get enough votes to be an honorable mention. I think he is a very good football player, and we’re just going to have to navigate this whole new world with the transfer portal and NIL. Money seems to have been the leading factor.” Although the almighty dollar has gutted his team nonstop the last two weeks, Eck doesn’t hold any animosity for his former players chasing a check. “I want to support them so they can make life-changing money,” he said. “A lot of these guys aren’t guaranteed draft picks, so if they can make multi-thousands of dollars now, it’s a good opportunity.” Eck, a perennial glass-half-full kind of guy, looks at this movement as leverage for future recruits. For example, Arnold had no offers prior to UI, but now he’s getting paid big bucks to play in the Big 12. The same applies to running back Woods, who only had two offers out of high school. After two years at Idaho, the Palmdale, Calif., native now has offers from Arkansas, Houston and Utah. “We helped develop these guys to get to that stage,” Eck said. “They weren’t turning down (those types of) opportunities when they got here. That speaks volumes about the development of our program and how we help our guys improve their game.” UI will be dabbling a bit in the transfer portal, but its approach won’t change. The Vandals will only look to address positions of need, which as of now are wide receiver and cornerback. “We will target some guys the first week of January, right when school starts,” Eck said. “We want to build a majority through high school players. … We’re not going to force the portal. Corner is a little bit of a need when you lose Marcus and Ormanie. Receiver is a need when you lose two guys to graduation and the third-leading guy to the transfer portal.” Outside of the portal, Eck is hoping those with ample game experience will step up and help the secondary flourish, such as junior safeties Tommy McCormick and Kyrin Beachem. He also mentioned guys like freshmen Dwayne McDougle and Andrew Marshall, who saw the field quite a bit in 2023. Other players, such as freshmen Hayden John and Drew Faulkner, who didn’t see the field much last season, will have an opportunity to climb the depth chart as well. The Vandals won’t be searching for a new quarterback or running back through the portal, however. Idaho has a lot of faith in sophomore quarterback Jack Layne. “Our best offensive game last year was the game he started,” Eck said. “We didn’t score over 50 points in any other game this season. I have a lot of confidence in him, and Jack Wager is a really good player too.” Idaho is also pretty set with its running backs, as junior Eli Cummings is set to return to the field in ’24. Cummings had 599 all-purpose yards in ’22 and will be backed up by freshmen Deshaun Buchanan, Art Williams and Carlos Matheney. “We expect him (Cummings) back, and I expect him to have a tremendous role,” Eck said. “I thought (Deshaun) Buchanan looked good in practice as well. We just have to keep getting better and developing guys.” As for the staff, Eck is looking for someone he trusts to coordinate the defense. He didn’t rule out the possibility of elevating someone on the current staff. The top priority as of now seems to be the RB coach. “As for who will be coordinating on defense, it could be one of our current coaches,” Eck said. “I don’t want drastic schematic changes. As for the running back hire, coach Ford wore a couple of hats, so that will be the top priority.” Pixley may be contacted at (208) 848-2290, tpixley@lmtribune.com or on Twitter @TreebTalks. Success!

restart” of the molybdenum mine near Clayton. That controlled restart is underway as directors of Centerra Gold, the mine’s owner, consider what’s next at the mine, people who attended Sept. 14 informational meetings in Challis were told. Bj Bryant, manager of mill operations and technical services at Thompson Creek, spoke at the four community meetings, giving a rough outline of what may occur at the mine, discussing potential hurdles, identifying issues that mattered to people at the meetings and answering questions. Bryant often repeated his statements that the board of directors has not made a decision about the mine’s future and that there is no approved mine plan. Thompson Creek has a permitted area where mining can take place, but not much can occur without an approved mine plan, he said. It’s expected that the Centerra board will issue a decision about whether to resume full-scale mining by the end of the first quarter of 2024, Bryant said. The process will be that the board makes its decision, then they notify the two top bosses and then issue a public release about the decision, he said. It’s possible people at the meeting will know the decision before he does because of that public release, Bryant said. The new employees being hired now are needed to help weld on shovels and trucks at the mine that have long sat idle. Beginning next month, plans call for working seven days a week and some mining will resume, mostly removing overburden, Bryant said. Blasting will also take place, but not daily. No new equipment will arrive between now and the end of March, Bryant said. “We’re fixing what we have to use until” the Centerra board renders a decision. “All the equipment has been evaluated and we should be able to do what we need” with the equipment already on site, he said. If mining is to resume on a large scale, Bryant said it would take 18 months from the decision date to having any product ready to mill. “And we need every bit of that to get the mill ready,” he said. A tentative target date for the mill feed to operate is 2027, he said. “That could change,” Bryant said. “Earlier or later.” If that’s the case, the mine would by then have between 350 and 400 employees, he said, which is about the same number of employees when the mine shut down. If the mine fully reopens, there is no need for a lot of new construction, Bryant said. Rather, a lot of refurbishments and upgrades are necessary. The most recent mine plan called for a mine life of 13 years, but that number may no longer be accurate, Bryant said. A new mine plan would identify the expected life of the mine. In addition to actual number of years of mining, he noted that it would take between one and three years to prepare for full-scale mining and about two years of reclamation follows the mine closure. Two employees from the Helena, Montana, office of Newfields, an environmental, engineering and construction management consulting ﬁrm, participated in the Challis meetings. The firm has been hired to contribute to a feasibility study for Centerra Gold. The consultants are looking at such issues as housing, both for short-term construction workers and long-term mine employees, worker retention and worker attraction. “Labor and housing aspects are our focus,” Annaliese Miller of Newfields said. “We realize there are other factors,” including service industries and infrastructure in the community. If 300 or more people are hired to work at the mine, it’s expected that some will be people who live in and near Challis already, some will be people who move here and some will essentially fly in and out for work, but continue to live somewhere else, Miller said. Bryant pointed out that when the mine was at full capacity, before it was put on care and maintenance in December 2014, about 30 percent of the employees commuted from outside Challis. He thinks a similar percentage would do so again if the mine ramps back up. The idea is to keep “a really good workforce at the mine,” Richard Leferink of Newfields said. Several of the 18 people who attended an afternoon session asked about housing, pointing out the shortage of existing housing in Custer County and the difficulties in hiring contractors to build new houses or apartments. Miller said a review of existing residential lots owned by the mining company is underway. Some of that property might be developed for temporary housing and some for long-term housing, she said. Bryant said mine officials have talked about offering some of the platted land now owned by the mine as a signing bonus to lure employees to Challis. They’d get the lot as a perk and be responsible for getting their own house built, he said. “We’re looking at the types of packages we need to be competitive and retain workers,” Miller said. “There is a lot of competition, but you have some things that are attractive.” Her firm is also looking at RV and trailer park options, as well as motels, for housing. She said her team has already spoken to the owners of the Red Rock Lodge in Challis about possible additions or renovations to the property. And, she said, “maybe another hotel will come in.” Thompson Creek doesn’t want to be the property developers and builders for any new housing, Miller said, but all options are on the table. In the 1980s, when the mine was owned by Cyprus, that firm developed two subdivisions in Challis to provide workforce housing. One housing option is a man camp for the 55 to 60 expected workers who choose not to move to Challis, Bryant said. That is no one’s preferred option, he said, but it’s on the table. Bottom line, Miller said, is “we need to be able to provide more options for people to live here. And that might be challenging.” Log In We welcome comments, however there are some guidelines: Keep it Clean: Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexual language.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': ""On the banks of the Oneida Narrows reservoir on the Bear River in Franklin County, visitors to Maple Grove Hot Springs relax in natural hot springs fed by ancient waters laden with nourishing minerals, surrounded by a serene, natural landscape that feels far from civilization. Since taking it over in 2019 and investing his own capital to renovate and revitalize the property, Jordan Menzel has faced challenges with the business, including the COVID-19 pandemic that hit less than a year after its grand reopening. Things have stabilized and even begun to thrive over the past few years as Maple Grove has added new soaking pools, camping areas, overnight lodging and other amenities, but now the property is facing a new potential threat. PacifiCorp, the owner and operator of the Oneida Narrows dam and hydroelectric generating facility, is in the process of studying and planning a second dam to create a reservoir just downstream from the existing dam as a way to provide more electricity to a growing population. The “pumped-storage” project would create a new reservoir on the western hillside above the narrows. Water would be pumped uphill and stored in the reservoir during times of low electric demand, then released as needed during times of peak demand, especially during the hottest times of the summer season. PacifiCorp estimates the new project would generate up to 200 megawatts of power — enough to supply roughly 150,000 homes — as the water tumbles downhill through generating turbines. If the pumped-storage project comes to fruition, PacifiCorp estimates the water level could fluctuate as much as six feet over the course of a single day as water is pumped from the existing Narrows reservoir uphill to the new reservoir. While providing a reliable source of power, such rapid movement could also create significant disruptions to the local ecosystem and have major impacts on water access to the people who come to recreate. PacifiCorp spokesperson Dave Eskelsen said the company is in the process of studying all of those potential impacts as it goes through the lengthy process required by federal law anytime a new dam is proposed along a public waterway. “We’re talking multiple years to bring this project to reality, and it’s important to know this first-stage consultation document does not represent a decision to build this project,” Eskelsen said. “It’s primarily the kinds of things we’re going to need to do to determine the cost and look at that in the context of other resource planning. Is this a good choice for customers? That’s the yardstick by which we are regulated.” PacifiCorp is also in the midst of developing a pumped-storage project on the northeast shore of Bear Lake, and is studying a similar project near Cutler Dam on the border of Box Elder and Cache counties in Utah. But the Oneida proposal is raising eyebrows because of its potential impact on a popular public recreation area that offers one of the few publicly accessible recreation points on the Bear River. Scores of people on inner tubes and other watercraft flock to the cool waters to beat the summer heat. The reservoir, along with the pools and riffles on the river below the dam, are home to rainbow trout and other fish species prized by local anglers, and the surrounding terrain has long been frequented by upland and big-game hunters. While any new dam is years away, the opportunity for the public to weigh in is happening now, and the initial comment window will close the day after Christmas. Meanwhile at Maple Grove, Menzel said the impacts are already being felt. During a September engineering test in which PacifiCorp drew down water from the existing dam to simulate what would happen during a typical pumping phase, the source pond for the hot springs dropped so far that the pond nearly dried up, forcing the springs to temporarily close until a crew could be hired to come in and shore it up at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars. If the dam project is approved, Menzel said it’s uncertain whether the springs will be able to continue to supply the natural hot water that allows the business to exist. “For us that was an interesting signal,” Menzel said. “It feels like the canary in the mine.” While he’s concerned about the damage a new dam to could do to Maple Grove, Menzel said his primary motivation for opposing the project is part of a bigger-picture view. “My orientation, first and foremost on this, is to the waterways in this canyon,” he said. “In Preston and the Franklin County community, if you have grown up fishing, camping, recreating and accessing the narrows, this pump storage facility is going to disrupt what that looks like indefinitely.” As the deadline for the public to provide comments on the new dam proposal draws near, Menzel has been busy organizing a grassroots effort in opposition to the dam. Among other efforts, Maple Grove has been working to disseminate information on how members of the public can let their voices be heard, and is circulating a petition to gather signatures from people who oppose the project. “We have a voice in what happens,” Menzel said. “If people don’t let their voices be heard, PacifiCorp will not feel that responsibility and pressure.” Eskelsen said the company is taking all of the potential impacts into account — not just the environmental costs, but the ramifications for recreational opportunities as well. “Public input has significant weight,” he said. “It is the company’s responsibility to demonstrate that this is in the public interest.” The utility has had its eye on about a dozen sites around the western U.S. as possible locations for pumped-storage projects. The Oneida site is among the most attractive options “because it’s a project we already own and it has the elevated terrain you need,” Eskelsen said. Pumped-storage technology is attractive to utilities and energy users because not only is it a renewable resource, but having that energy stored and ready to produce on short notice to meet peaks in demand is an ongoing challenge in the mass production and dissemination of electricity. Having a resource that can be tapped instantly like that is becoming increasingly important, Eskelsen said, as utilities are shifting their production away from traditionally reliable fossil-fuel sources to renewables like wind and solar power, which generate plenty of power at certain times but don’t always provide the same around-the-clock reliability. Menzel recognizes the need for more energy generation, but said he also believes there might be other ways to go about it that won’t have such profound impacts on the Bear River, which is the largest source of freshwater for the Great Salt lake and is already under siege from the rapidly growing demand for water in Utah. “I’m not arguing against pump storage as tool for renewable energy storage, but this section of the Bear River has other obligations to the public that should rule it out given the sensitivity of every drop in that river,” he said.

And it actually leverages well known business models to conduct criminal activity.” This massive data breach has been underway for the last couple of months, affecting 3,000 U.S organizations and 8,000 global organizations, according to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CSA). The list of targeted businesses and major companies include everything from US banks like First National Bankers Bank, to oil giants like Shell and the well-known educational nonprofit National Student Clearinghouse. The US Department of Energy, Shutterfly.com, American Airlines, Warner Bros and even the University of Idaho systems have been attacked. Boise State University was targeted as well, and students and faculty were notified in an email sent out July 14, 2023, at 4:14 p.m. National Student Clearinghouse alerted Boise State of the breach through MOVEit Transfer, the system they use for filing information, according to the email sent out by the Registrar Office. “Boise State learned that personally identifiable information about some students was compromised as a result of the worldwide data breach,” the email stated. The good news is that Boise State systems are not at risk, just the information linked to the third party MOVEit Transfer software. Regardless, Boise State is in contact with the Idaho State Board of Education to oversee the situation as it progresses. The landing page Boise State provided for updates said, “We believe some students and employees will receive letters in the mail advising that information you shared with Boise State and our vendors may have been compromised.” Director of Media Relations, Mike Sharp, told The Arbiter in an email, “Boise State University was notified by the National Student Clearinghouse that July’s data breach affected sensitive information of three unenrolled Boise State students.” Clearinghouse will contact the impacted students and information such as names, email addresses, etc. of other students may have been exposed as well. “Boise State University continues to work with the Clearinghouse as they address their response to the MoveIt breach. A campus update is forthcoming,” Sharp wrote. So what exactly happened? CLOP’s strategy of cybercrime is tied to ransomware, a type of malware that blocks a web system and demands money in return to reboot up the system, remove a virus or a bug, or return stolen information. It’s blackmailing, and CLOP has been around the block a few times when it comes to demanding money in return for recovering company information. CLOP historically will discover a zero-day flaw in a system, exploit that flaw, extract data and then send a ransom note to whatever company they target. In ransom notes, CLOP threatens to publish or sell all vulnerable information on the black market if their victims do not comply. Viruses and phishing scams emerged in the 1990’s alongside a new virtual reality. Since the beginning of the internet, cybercrime has existed, not for an era, but for thirty years give or take. It’s no secret that even sharing information on social media platforms is taking a calculated risk. Accounts can be hacked into from Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook and more. People can fake profile identities, scam users, engage in sextortion and commit other cyber crimes on social media, like trafficking, dm phishing and catfishing. “I think the important thing to keep in mind is that these platforms are collecting information, they are receiving information from you that could be inappropriately leveraged,” Vasko said. Living in a digital universe means that there will always be the danger of the dark web, malware, hackers and cybercrime. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

to the traffic flow between Emmett and the Treasure Valley. The drop-in at Emmett High drew over 400 people to see, hear, and ask questions of ITD representatives and officials from the City of Emmett and Gem County. Most of those attending focused their attention on a layout of maps in the center of the High School atrium that detailed different segments of the 16 miles stretching of SH-16 from SH-44 to the intersection with SH-52 at Washington Avenue in Emmett. The meeting was the second public meeting last week to provide residents from both ends of the busily traveled highway a look at what work has been done to this point and what the process is before construction can begin in future years. A meeting in Eagle on Dec. 4 mirrored the Emmett meeting. “State Highway 16 is a key transportation corridor in the central Treasure Valley,” said ITD Project Manager Mark Wasdahl. “This environmental document is the next important step toward addressing long-term safety and traffic capacity. We are asking for the community’s feedback at several points in this process.” ITD began the process in June, building on a previous environmental assessment first completed in 2004. Since then they have been reevaluating traffic flows and patterns, access controls, safety studies, and resource assessments. The progress they have made on that study was what was on display in Emmett last week. The mapping of the entire length of the assessment area included specific suggested alternatives at different segments of the route where current or pending projects could or would make an impact on future traffic flow. ITD points to changes since the 2004 study, particularly population growth, an increase in traffic and development, and an increase in crashes and the severity of crashes as the factors requiring an update and reassessment process. The plans discussed nearly two decades ago were used as a basis to begin the discussion of design options as new data was integrated into the process. With construction underway on a connection of SH-16 from its current terminus at SH-20/26 to a new exchange at I-84, ITD is keenly aware of impacts that may have on the northern end of SH-16. In 2005 ITD’s completed assessment received Federal approval to: Each of those elements are included in the current discussion as well, though some alternatives have already been ruled out due to changes in conditions since 2005. Development since 2005, particularly at the southern end of the assessment area, and the marked increase in accidents along the corridor have influenced some of those decisions. ITD data shows that between 2007-2011 there were 152 crashes on SH-16. Between 2017-2021 there were 288 crashes, The northern end of the assessment area appeared to be of greatest interest to those in attendance at the Emmett meeting. What plans are being contemplated to improve the safety and flow of traffic on the Freezeout grade, and how would that impact the current access points at the bottom of the grade? The grade issue is perhaps the biggest engineering obstacle to be considered in the plan. Most actual engineering will not begin until this environmental assessment has been completed — likely the summer of 2025. Widening the Freezeout grade to four lanes — divided or undivided — will require considerable fill at several locations. That fill would have to be of a structural material to be hauled in as the sandy composition of the immediate hillsides are unlikely to provide a sustainable base for a widened roadbed. The total expanded width needed will be determined by the choice of lane plans. Some local officials proposed a three-lane design — two lanes up and a single lane down — as a perhaps most cost-effective way to facilitate a quicker solution. Those remarks directly related to the significant growth in heavy truck traffic going up the grade each day, a factor in slowdowns and traffic backups. Cherry Lane Access Preliminary design plans presented by ITD at the meeting and in its online material, offer two suggested ways to handle the Cherry Lane access at SH-16. One modification would be to go ahead with a full interchange as appeared in the 2005 plans. The second modification alternative referred to in ITD illustrations as Modification 1, would call for an at-grade intersection of Cherry and SH-16 but will restrict access to right turn in and out at Cherry Lane. A local access road underpass south of Cherry Lane would be added with the widening of the Freeze Out grade, Many of those in attendance at the Emmett meeting expressed surprise at the illustration of a large subdivision on the east side of SH-16 at Cherry Lane. ITD said that the underlying subdivision map was for illustrative purposes and though freshly drawn, it was based on a proposal in place in 2004. Despite the concerns voiced at the meeting, there is no currently approved subdivision on that property. “There was a proposed subdivision back in 2006 when it was annexed into the City of Emmett back then,” explained Jennifer Kharll, Planning Director for Gem County. “When the Little’s (David and Adam) took ownership they de-annexed the property to run cattle on the land.

I have had no direct conversations with ITD to this point.” Substation to Mill Road Design plans for SH-16 from Substation to Washington Avenue calls for four lanes with center turn lane and/or painted median. While this assessment process does not include the segment of SH-52 to goes west from Washington Avenue, ITD officials have confirmed that they are currently moving forward for a possible installation of a signal light at SH-52 and Mill Road, pending funding in next fiscal year. Community Input Sought “We have looked forward to sharing the range of modified improvement plans with the communities and receiving their feedback,” said Wasdahl. “The community input is very important to the reevaluation process and will help us moving forward.” ITD is continuing to seek community input, through December 21. You can access the interactive maps and take a tour of each section of the highway corridor at https://tinyurl.com/2p84s6yh. There is an access point in the later portion of this presentation that allows the viewer to log their comments concerning each specific segment. ITD is also taking emails regarding the project at this point at sh16@itd.idaho.gov. Only comments placed in person at the public meetings, input online or provided through email will be included in the official records of the assessment process.
