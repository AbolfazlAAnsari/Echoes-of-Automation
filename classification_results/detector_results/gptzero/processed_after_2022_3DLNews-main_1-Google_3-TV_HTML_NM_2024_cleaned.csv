It didn\'t stop Cowboys team owner Jerry Jones from stealing the show in Mobile, however. When speaking with the media on Tuesday, Jones was asked about the Cowboys\' state of mind heading into 2024 after a third straight early playoff exit followed an impressive 12-win regular season. “I think we’ll push the hell out of it,” Jones said. “We’ll be going all in. … I would say that you will see us this coming year not building for the future. That’s the best way I know how to say it. That ought to answer a lot of questions.” Clutchpoints The comment from the 81-year-old would seem to signal that he is pushing all of his proverbial chips to the middle of the table as the Cowboys hope to capture their sixth Super Bowl in franchise history. But ... it isn\'t just the statement of intention from Jones that makes this quote a headline, as - if true - it also signals a drastic shift in mindset. It was at this time last year, at the Senior Bowl ahead of the Philadelphia Eagles\' appearance in their second time Super Bowl in just the last six years, that Jones publicly scoffed at the idea of going ""all in."" “I’m real hesitant to bet it all for a year,” Jones said. “There’s a lot of things that can happen for that year. … A couple of teams [Eagles and Rams] that have had some real success putting it all out there and paying for it later. Don’t think that doesn’t pop in my head and get my eye, as far as doing it, and I know how to do that.” So what changed? One of two ideas worth examining ... One - Maybe it\'s Timing. Jones has addressed his mortality - he actually did so in a season-ending team meeting with players - and with the Cowboys having not played in a Super Bowl in 29 years, he remains intent on capturing another Lombardi Trophy. So ... bring on the modern-day Deion Sanders signing and the modern-day Charles Haley trade? Ummm, maybe. Two - Maybe it\'s Baloney. Indeed, when we review what Jerry thinks ""all in\'\' means, we wonder if it\'s nothing more than a marketing ploy (read here) ... or even that he doesn\'t recognize what the public interprets that phrase as meaning. (Example: He\'s making it sound like a Dak Prescott extension is ""all in,\'\' when in fact as planned its simply business as usual and standard operating procedure.) Related: Dak Prescott New Contract: Does Jerry Not Understand the Cap? Going ""all in"" is seemingly a smart choice for the Cowboys. ... and it\'s a crowd-pleasing concept, too. ""Push the hell out of it\'\' will be fun to chronicle - just as soon as it actually becomes something more than an empty promise.'}]"

A court filing Friday disclosed that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is involved in a ""personal relationship"" with a special prosecutor she hired for the Georgia election interference case against former President Donald Trump, but she argues there are no grounds to dismiss the case or to remove her from the prosecution. Willis hired special prosecutor Nathan Wade in November 2021 to assist her investigation into whether Trump and others broke any laws as they tried to overturn his loss in the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. Since Trump and 18 others were indicted in August, Wade has led the team of lawyers Willis assembled to prosecute the case. Wade said in an affidavit attached to the filing that he and Willis developed a personal relationship in 2022 but there was no relationship prior to his appointment as special prosecutor. Wade said that he has no financial interest in the outcome of the case and that no money paid to him in his role as special prosecutor has been shared with Willis. ""The District Attorney received no funds or personal financial gain from my position as Special Prosecutor,"" he said. The Friday filing by Willis\' team came in response to a motion filed last month by defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant, who represents Trump co-defendant Michael Roman. The motion alleged that Willis and Wade were in an inappropriate romantic relationship that created a conflict of interest. The defense filing seeks to dismiss the case and to have Willis and Wade and their offices barred from further prosecuting the case. Trump and at least one other co-defendant, Georgia attorney Robert Cheeley, have filed motions to join Roman\'s effort to dismiss the indictment and remove Willis, a Democrat, from the case. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who\'s presiding over the election case, has set a Feb. 15 hearing on Roman\'s motion. Willis and Wade are among a dozen witnesses Merchant has subpoenaed to testify at that hearing.

""And he has responded with a grace and warm heart that anyone who knows President Biden would expect."" Austin\'s unannounced hospitalization, which was not disclosed to the media or Biden and other senior administration officials for days, raised major questions about transparency and communications within the Biden administration. Republicans have been highly critical of how the Pentagon handled Austin’s illness and the House Armed Services Committee has called on the defense secretary to testify about the failure to notify key government leaders.

Austin last took questions from the media more than one month ago on Dec. 20 when he visited the USS Gerald R. Ford, an aircraft carrier operating in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Two days later after returning to the United States, Austin underwent surgery to treat prostate cancer, a procedure which required general anesthesia and an overnight stay. His surgery and hospital stay, as well as his diagnosis with prostate cancer in early-December, was not revealed to the president and to senior administration officials until after the New Year when he was hospitalized a second time for complications from the surgery. Video above: Lloyd Austin says he\'s \'still recovering\' Austin remained in the hospital for two weeks, leaving on Jan. 15. He then worked from home until this past Monday, when he returned to the Pentagon for a bilateral meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. At the time, Austin said, ""I feel good and recovering well, but still recovering."" Biden acknowledged earlier this month that Austin’s failure to notify him about his hospitalization was a lapse in judgment. Austin’s chief of staff, Kelly Magsamen, directed a 30-day review of the Pentagon’s processes and procedures for notifying senior national security leaders and the White House when the Defense secretary needs to transfer authorities to the deputy secretary, which was required during Austin’s hospitalization. The Defense Department Inspector General launched a separate investigation of whether the Pentagon had the appropriate policies in places to ensure an effective transfer or power and duties.

BOTELHO | The National Desk TOPICS: A convicted killer who escaped a Pennsylvania prison last summer and was on the run for two weeks was in court Friday. Danilo Cavalcante appeared before a judge for a preliminary hearing on escape charges, according to court records. Footage from KYW shows authorities escorting Cavalcante to inside Magisterial District Court. He is wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, and his long, curly hair covers his face. He looks down as he makes his way to the building and doesn\'t speak when reporters ask him questions. ""Will you escape again?"" one reporter shouts at him. NBC 10 Philadelphia reported that residents who said they saw Cavalcante on their property or in their homes while he was at large took the witness stand. ""One homeowner said he learned weeks after his interaction with Cavalcante that the escapee stole his daughter\'s sleeping bag from his home,"" according to the media outlet. ""Another homeowner said he fired four shots at Cavalcante after the escapee stole a gun from his garage. A translator was on hand speaking to Cavalcante -- who speaks Portuguese."" Cavalcante made his way out of the Chester County Prison by crab walking between two walls on August 31. Video shows his escape. Cavalcante eluded police for 14 days, surviving on stolen watermelons and stream water. He told investigators he hid his feces under leaves and brush to evade them. He was taken into custody on September 13 with help from multiple agencies, including police K-9 Yoda, a 4-year-old Belgian Malinois from the El Paso Border Patrol Tactical Team. The police dog sniffed Cavalcante out then chased him down as he tried to crawl away from authorities. Pennsylvania State Police Lt. George Bivens said the police dog bit Cavalcante, with the convict suffering a minor bite wound to his head. An image showed blood covering Cavalcante\'s face as authorities led him away from the scene. Since his escape, the Chester County jail board unanimously approved plans to fully enclose the exercise yards at the facility. The project is expected to cost $2.5 million to $3.5 million and could take as long as nine months to complete. The redesign plan calls for fully enclosed exercise yards, with 18-foot-high masonry walls to replace fencing, and the removal of shed roofs that could inmates could scale. The plan also calls for removing basketball hoops. Plus, inmate uniforms will soon be brightly colored so they are easier to spot in an escape attempt. Cavalcante was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend, Deborah Brandao, in front of her children in 2021. At the time of his escape, he was awaiting transfer to a state prison to serve a life sentence. _____ EDITOR\'S NOTE: The Associated Press contributed to this report.'}]"

New guidance from court officials suggests a verdict in the civil fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James against Donald Trump could come any time in the next few weeks. ""It\'s looking like early to mid-February, as a rough estimate, and subject to modifications,"" said Al Baker, a spokesperson for the Office of Court Administration. Judge Arthur Engoron is poised to issue a written ruling on fraud claims against Trump and his co-defendants, which includes his adult sons and his company. The attorney general has said Trump and his company should pay $370 million in disgorgement for their ill-gotten gains. Engoron said at closing arguments for the bench trial that he\'d aim to file his ruling on the public docket by Jan. 31, but warned the parties that wasn’t a firm deadline. Last Friday, the court-appointed monitor overseeing the Trump Organization\'s business activities filed a report flagging errors and inconsistencies in financial disclosures that Trump’s company submitted to third parties. The monitor warned that the issues may continue if they go unaddressed. ""My observations suggest misstatements and errors may continue to occur, which could result in incorrect or inaccurate reporting of financial information to third parties,"" Judge Barbara Jones wrote. In a letter response filed Monday, Trump’s attorney said the monitor\'s latest report contains factual inaccuracies and is ""misleading and disingenuous."" ""The January 26 Report, issued mere days before an expected decision, has only two obvious purposes: (1) ensure the Monitor continues to receive exorbitant fees (in excess of $2.6 million to date); and (2) fill the gaping hole in the Attorney General’s case, namely, that there is no basis to support continued oversight,"" the response stated. Engoron has already ruled that Trump has engaged in fraud and ordered the dissolution of his business empire, an action that is on hold pending Trump\'s appeal. The judge canceled business certificates for many of Trump\'s entities in New York, including the Trump Organization – a sprawling entity comprised of 500 limited liability companies. Engoron also called for a receiver to oversee the dissolution of the entities, which include buildings such as Trump Tower, 40 Wall Street and the Seven Springs family compound in Westchester County, New York. His upcoming ruling will address six additional claims including conspiracy, issuing false financial statements, falsifying business records and insurance fraud. The former president has cast the case as a political witch hunt. Legally, Trump and his team argue that there’s no proof of an intent to defraud and that lenders were obligated to conduct their own due diligence, regardless of the valuations the Trump Organization supplied. And they say companies like Deutsche Bank wanted to do business with the Trump Organization and went into the deals with open eyes. CNN’s Dan Berman contributed to this report.
