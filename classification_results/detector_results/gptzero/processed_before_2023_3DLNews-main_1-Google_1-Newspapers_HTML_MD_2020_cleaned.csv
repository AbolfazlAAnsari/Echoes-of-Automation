email newsletters Baltimore Sun eNewspaper Trending: If the American people had to endure 90 minutes of cross-talk and interruptions last month at the first presidential debate, the alternative — clashing, simultaneous town hall events on Thursday with President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden — was not much of an improvement.Trump tested positive for the coronavirus after the first debate and, citing safety, the presidential debate commission declared that the second debate, scheduled for Oct 15, would have to be virtual. Trump refused, so Biden scheduled a town hall on ABC. Trump then scheduled his own on NBC — at the exact same time.“I figured, what the hell, we’ve got a free hour of television,” the president said at a rally in North Carolina earlier on Thursday.It’s an open question whether Trump’s gambit of trying to push Biden off the stage worked to his advantage. Biden’s whole campaign strategy has been to fly at a low altitude toward victory. Trump might have made that easier with a rambunctious performance compared with Biden’s — which one of Trump’s advisers likened to “watching an episode of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,” suggesting that a similarity to the beloved Fred Rogers was a bad thing.Here are six takeaways from the night’s dueling town halls.Trump stomped on his own message with his refusal to denounce QAnon.After Trump went through days of headlines and headaches as a result of his refusal to condemn white supremacy during the first presidential debate, he was ready on Thursday to offer a hedge-free denunciation. “I denounce white supremacy, OK?” he said to the moderator, Savannah Guthrie, almost before she had finished her question.The rare forcefulness on the topic made Trump’s mealy-mouthed refusal, minutes later, to disavow the false QAnon conspiracy theory all the more stark. “I just don’t know about QAnon,” Trump claimed, despite having amplified a discredited claim by the theory’s proponents just days ago.Guthrie swiftly walked through how the far-right movement falsely claims Democrats are a satanic cult that practices pedophilia. “Can you just once and for all state that is completely not true and disavow QAnon in its entirety?” she pressed.“I do know they are very much against pedophilia — they fight it very hard,” Trump said. Later, he repeated that line, almost with encouragement: “What I do hear about it is they are very strongly against pedophilia. I agree with that. I do agree with that.”Trump has long been wary of speaking ill of supporters, and believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory are among his most ardent backers. “I understand they like me very much,” he said over the summer, after noting that they “love our country.”Guthrie might have delivered the most memorable line of the night when she quizzed Trump about a recent retweet of a discredited conspiracy theory that Biden had orchestrated actions to have SEAL Team 6, one of the country’s elite military units, killed to cover up the supposedly faked death of Osama bin Laden. Trump said with a shrug, “I’ll put it out there.”“I don’t get that,” Guthrie replied. “You’re the president. You’re not, like, someone’s crazy uncle.”Biden suggested making masks and vaccines mandatory.The question of how to manage a pandemic that has overwhelmed the nation over the past six months is almost certainly the starkest difference between Biden and Trump, and that was clear in their town halls.Trump minimized the danger of the virus, despite having been hospitalized after falling ill with it. He has poked fun at Biden for wearing a mask and has resisted the idea of making masks mandatory. Trump has theatrically removed his mask at his campaign rallies; Biden disclosed that before walking onstage, he had been wearing two masks, a preventive measure that some doctors say is effective.Biden said that he himself would take a vaccine by the end of the year, and would urge other Americans to do so, “if the body of scientists say that this is what is ready to be done and it’s been tested.”He also said he might support making vaccines mandatory — but acknowledged that such a measure would be difficult to enforce. “You can’t say everyone has to do this, but it’s like you can’t mandate a mask,” he said.With that, Biden was walking onto tricky terrain. There is a long history of resistance to mandates in this country; think Obamacare and the individual mandate. And a significant number of Americans have resisted taking vaccines in the past; one of the big questions is how many Americans will take a coronavirus vaccine once it is developed, mandate or not.“It is thorny,” said Bill Carrick, a Democratic political consultant. “But he was realistic. People have to have confidence in a vaccine. So you can’t play games like Trump.”Biden also said he expected Trump to take a COVID-19 test before their next debate on Oct. 22, in accordance with the rules set down by the presidential debate commission. “Before I came up here, I took another test,” he said. “I’ve been taking it every day.”He said he would not have come to the town hall if he had tested positive. “I didn’t want to come here and not expose anybody,” he said. “And I just think it’s just decency to be able to determine whether or not you are you’re clear.”Trump clung to an unpopular posture on masks and the pandemic.Masks are politically popular. They are embraced as a public health necessity by experts and a broad cross-section of the American public. One of Trump’s own advisers, Chris Christie, said Thursday he had been “wrong” not to wear a mask at the White House. But Trump, despite having recently contracted the coronavirus and requiring hospitalization for it, still cannot bring himself to arrive at a full-throated embrace of mask-wearing.“I’m OK with masks — I tell people, ‘Wear masks,'” he said. But he couldn’t resist an addendum. “Just the other day,” he said, he had seen a study that showed that people using masks were still contracting the virus.He tried to twist the position of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s foremost infectious disease expert, on masks.

marched. From Rodney Square to Wilmington Police headquarters, down across the Christina River and onto Interstate 95, protesters chanted, ""No justice, no peace."" Some carried signs with George Floyd\'s name. Others donned t-shirts with the 46-year-old\'s last words: ""I can\'t breathe."" Still more waved flags and beat drums and screamed in protest, tired of black men and women dying at the hands of police. On Saturday, as the late spring sun beat down on Wilmington, protesters took to city streets to demand justice for Floyd, the handcuffed black man who begged for his life as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes on Monday. The march, which was organized by Food Not Bombs Wilmington and the city\'s Black Lives Matter movement, was one of dozens across the country this week protesting Floyd\'s death. Though the four Minneapolis officers involved were fired almost immediately after video of Floyd\'s death surfaced on social media and prosecutors charged Officer Derek Chauvin, the man who knelt on Floyd\'s neck, with manslaughter and third degree murder, protestors say it\'s not enough — that more has to be done for Floyd. NATIONWIDE PROTESTS: George Floyd protests continue nationwide as hundreds arrested, cities begin issuing curfews In the days since the man\'s death, many rallies across the nation have turned violent, with protesters looting stores and setting cars ablaze. In nearby Philadelphia, hundreds of protesters gathered at City Hall and knelt in silence before marching to the Museum of Art, where other protesters had gathered. At at least one police vehicle caught on fire. But Wilmington\'s protest, which drew more than 1,000 people at its height, remained mostly peaceful Saturday afternoon — something organizers and attendees said they had hoped for. FLOYD PROTESTS: \'There are anarchists\': Minnesota officials say \'outside agitators\' are hijacking peaceful protests It also drew people of all ages, genders and color, proof that ""this is not just a black thing anymore,"" said 21-year-old Jazmine Church, who marched with friends and family. ""This has been going on for years — it\'s not like this is new,"" Church said. ""I\'ve been around to see these senseless killings happen, so it\'s good to see everybody participating, everyone upset. It\'s time for them to stop."" For decades, communities of color have demanded an end to the racism they say they experience on a day-to-day basis. Time and time again, they\'ve said they are tired of their men and women being targeted or killed by police, and are fed up with using social media hashtags to remember victims such as Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner and Breonna Taylor. Floyd\'s death, the most recent incident in a week of already-increased racial tensions, brought those frustrations to a head, which was made evident Saturday as Wilmington protesters confronted police at various points during their march. Outside Wilmington Police headquarters, one woman destroyed the department\'s wooden sign, and another protester smashed the windshield of a patrol car. Some shouted ""f--- the police,"" and others yelled in officers\' faces. But the officers took it in stride, telling protesters that they, too, were outraged by Floyd\'s death. MORE PROTESTS: George Floyd protest updates: Minnesota officials blame outside agitators for violence, volunteers help as grocery stores close ""That incident that happened out in Minneapolis, goddamnit, that set us back 20 or 30 years,"" Wilmington Police Chief Robert Tracy said. ""It opened up a lot of wounds and rightfully so, and you know what? We got to let people express that anger. ""But we got to make sure they do it peacefully. We can\'t be having people throw rocks at buildings, and that\'s what I\'m trying to prevent."" Though protesters grew more rowdy as the day wore on, they remained largely peaceful during afternoon hours, even when confronting Delaware State Police on I-95. Troopers had set up a fleet of patrol vehicles to block off the highway north of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard on-ramp. The troopers held long guns, which protesters decried as unnecessary. Why were they armed, when the protesters were not?, many said. ""Am I supposed to be afraid of you?"" one woman yelled. The crowd stirred, breaking into chants at times and airing grievances to the troopers at others. Then, in a moment of truce, the confrontation was over. The troopers agreed to store their weapons in the patrol cars. The crowd broke out into applause. Almost in unison, they turned and marched off the highway, back into the city\'s downtown. As the crowd dispersed from the interstate, Kiyoko Barbour sat along the curb with a friend. She said she attended the demonstration because she fears her son, as a young black person, lives in danger from others in the city and the police. While George Floyd’s death sparked Saturday’s action, such situations happen across the country, she said, and have been replayed for generations. “It’s terrible to raise black kids in America because you’re scared every day,” Barbour said as she began to weep. Wilmington resident Bertrand Morales echoed Barbour. Walking just behind the crowd that had moved from the highway and was heading to Market Street, he looked around. As he took in the scene — his first protest — he commiserated with his fellow ralliers. ""A lot of people are fed up, and this is what it\'s come to,"" Morales said.

To say, “I graduated from high school in 2020,” holds a lot more meaning than we might have thought it would. For those of us who wear that badge, it means an orchestra of mixed emotions, and with good reason: As graduating seniors, we expected the nine months between college application deadlines and the first day of college to be smooth sailing. And suffice it to say, we were royally ripped off. If a rosy nine months were an iPhone 11, we got a hand-me-down flip phone. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic buried basic social interaction and forced some of us to accept that a 12-word message was a sufficient goodbye for a 12-year experience. It would be easy to stop here and say that the missed traditions of senior year ruined what otherwise would have been an exciting year. Sure, when I envisioned graduation pictures, I did not expect them to be horribly lit and make me look like my four years were spent in solitary confinement. But what quarantine has proven is that the absence of prom and graduation pales in comparison to the psychological and social impacts of the pandemic. At many points during the pandemic, I have found myself asking, “How the heck is it [insert month between May and August] already?!” As March has drifted into the past, keeping track of time has turned into something of a hobby. My friends and I would often plan to do something together virtually, go silent for what felt like a couple days and find ourselves in another month. Email responses would be sluggish, and some text messages would get completely lost in the cloud of lockdown. This relationship with time has inevitably begotten chronophobia (a fear of lost time). When last week and last month increasingly feel like the same thing, it becomes more difficult to discern memories from the blur of quarantine. No selfies, no group pictures, nothing to highlight the past six months. And while there hasn’t necessarily been much to photograph, it is still bizarre — and slightly terrifying — to know that so much time has passed. What has also arisen over the course of the lockdown is a sense of paranoia. When the pandemic emerged, COVID-19 was only an abstraction; in January, there were almost no reported cases in the U.S., and even by late February, the numbers were not high enough to cause much alarm in my hometown. In March, when cases began to soar in New York, I expected to get a better understanding of the nature of the disease. And while the broad range of symptoms and health outcomes did become more concrete, COVID-19 also became more complicated and elusive... Infection can be fatal but only for the elderly and immunocompromised. Wait, no. Those above 50 are also at high risk. Sorry, teens and millennials are actually also at risk. COVID-19 doesn’t aerosolize. Actually, maybe it can; don’t wear a gaiter. COVID-19 spreads through surfaces, or maybe it doesn’t. The uncertainty that enveloped the disease also began to influence my actions outside the home. Was I too close to that person when we were talking? Is it safe to eat here? Whether the concerns were justified or not, the whirlwind of conflicting reports made it harder to grasp how careful I had to be — and whom my actions could hurt. Most of all, the pandemic has made it impossible to escape the gravity of current events; news stories that were once pushed aside in the chaos of normalcy are now front-and-center, from the graphic violence against Jacob Blake and George Floyd to the California wildfires. Put simply, the pandemic has exacerbated the persistent racial and socioeconomic disparities in American society, and quarantine has finally forced us to acknowledge them. These personal observations are part of a broader trend for our generation. The past six months have seen an especially pronounced rise in anxiety and depression among high school and college students, and the many acts of racial injustice documented during the pandemic have mobilized thousands of teenagers to lead the Black Lives Matter movement. In hindsight, therefore, subpar graduation photos aren’t much to complain about. As we attempt to return to normalcy, it’s these social issues that must continue to take the front stage, and it’s our generation that must be at the helm. So what will saying, “I graduated from high school in 2020,” really mean for us? Maybe it will mean that instead of prom, our graduating class gets to participate in a campaign to normalize discussions about mental health or a concerted effort to dismantle systemic racism. Maybe it will mean that we graduated at a tipping point. Correction: The original version of this piece suggested that Jacob Blake died; he is alive. The News-Letter regrets this error.

Chef Bryan Voltaggio stands in front of his new downtown restaurant, Thacher & Rye, in the former Volt location on North Market Street. Last Friday, the old Brownstone that once housed Volt restaurant on North Market Street was full again — or as full as it could be with coronavirus restrictions. With anxious taste buds at his call, Bryan Voltaggio was right back where he belonged, managing the symphony orchestra that is his kitchen, where roughly a dozen cooks work in close concert with one another to provide a maximum dining experience for their customers.

Follow Greg Swatek on Twitter: @greg_swatek What: Grand opening of Thacher & Rye When: Begins 3 p.m., open house from 4-5 p.m.; Thursday, Oct. 15 Where: 228 N. Market St., Frederick More info: A formal, celebratory affair that is open to everyone, no reservations required. The open house from 4 to 5 p.m. is for self-guided tours of the restaurant. There will be complimentary small plates, featuring items from the menu, as well as cocktails, and wine and beer available to purchase. The dress will be casual, and masks will be required. A ribbon cutting is planned, and owner Bryan Voltaggio and Frederick Mayor Michael O\'Connor are scheduled to speak. Family Meal, a favorite in the Frederick restaurant scene, never reopened its doors after closing in March due to the effects of the coronavir… Not sure how the future of Family Meal is “uncertain” when there was a Liquor Board hearing scheduled for this week for “Born & Raised” at the Family Meal location. I get that the focus of the article was Thatcher & Rye, but I assume checking out public hearing notices is a standard part of the reporting process.

I liked Range, Family Meal, & Volt. The food was always top notch & the service matched. Undoubtedly, I will try out Thatcher & Rye, you should too. I like Mr. Voltaggio’s restaurants.

MrSniper put his name in and you will see all the cases against him. Plus he will not be honoring the Volt and Family Meal gift cards since Family meal is changing names as well.

Why would the FNP give this guy all this space after he continually goes out of business? His food is ok and pricey for what you get. Ask anybody. There are many other restaurants that deserve to be reviewed than this. Really?? Why would the FNP give this guy all this space after he continually goes out of business?

It\'s a Grand Opening of a new restaurant, of course they are covering it, sheesh. It\'s a Grand Opening of a new restaurant, of course they are covering it, sheesh. The restaurant business is a tough business, especially at this time JerryR. Sixty percent of restaurants don\'t make it past their first year and 80 percent go out of business within five years, and that was pre-CoViD. Bryan Voltaggio has exceeded that survival rate, and the loss of Volt was directly related to the pandemic. Granted, his food is ""pricey"" and sometimes strange, but it has always been good. As Deb says, Voltaggio is a celebrity chef (how many times have we seen him on TV?), so him opening a new restaurant that is designed around the CoViD restrictions is a tourist attraction. Good on him. The restaurant business is a tough business, especially at this time JerryR.
