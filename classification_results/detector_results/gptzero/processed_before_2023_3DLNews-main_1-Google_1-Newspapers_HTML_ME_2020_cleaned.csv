MidcoastWednesday, June 16, 2021 Butter Up Cakes, all-gluten-free bakery, cafe, brews and ciders opens in DamariscottaThursday, January 14, 2021 ROCKPORT — Carving wooden life size sculptures of sports figures has been a passion for Rockport artist Jon Moro, who recently departed from sports figures to crafting a life size sculpture of two Biblical figures. They were unveiled Oct. 17 at Barnswallow Books, in Rockport Village. “I’m fascinated by the challenge of creating a sense of movement, and emotion from a still, inanimate object,” Moro said, on his website. “A meaningful sculpture has power, presence and humanity, and generates its own unique narrative.” It was not until he was 20 years old that Moro began to think of himself as an artist. “I had pursued a more academic track in high school, always enjoying projects that involved a poster or drawing, but didn't have time in my schedule for an elective art class,” he said. “After two years in college as an English major, I took a break from school. At that point I started working with wood, making all kinds of sculptural creations. Although the pieces were very rough and sometimes incomplete, something clicked inside of me that said, ‘I can do this!’ Within a few years I started taking art classes. My first class was an adult education oil painting class — I took it four times!” From there, Moro began working at Home Depot, which he said provided even more inspiration for his art pieces, and began to take a few classes per semester at the University of Maine at Augusta. Moro, the head boys basketball coach of the varsity team at Camden Hills Regional High School, is inspired by history, athletics, and themes of trial, struggle and triumph that encompass the human experience, according to his artist biography. His sculptural work, the biography reads, focuses primarily on humans in motion, from figures to life-size pieces, and each is carved and shaped from wood. Wood his chosen medium to work with as he describes it as warm, familiar, organic and ultimately alive — “perfect for conducting memories,” as opposed to plastic, or cold-to-the-touch metal. “There is always something below the surface of a piece of wood,” he said. “Grain is individual, and yet marks every species distinctively. Our eyes see shape, but we also see the grain. Grain is a life lived. It is a surface with a past. Every piece is the result of a collaboration. The life of the wood, and the shape the sculptor gives it. It is a unique connection between artist and medium, past and present, something crafted, yet something living.” Moro has crafted several sports figures into life size sculptures, including basketball hall of fame inductees Kevin Garnett and Julius Erving, baseball hall of fame inductee Yogi Berra, hockey hall of fame inductee Paul Kariya, and professional baseball player Nomar Garciaparra. He also created a sculpture, “The Crossover,” that is on display at the National Collegiate Athletics Association Hall of Champions museum in Indianapolis, Indiana, which received an award from the NCAA for the art piece. Asked to identify his favorite piece, Moro at first compared the question to asking a parent to pick their favorite child, before conceding his most recent piece, David and Goliath in this moment, is always his favorite. “However I think my Kevin Garnett piece was very successful, as well,” he added. “It really reflected his personality, his size, and had a spiritual element to it.” Moro can usually complete a life size sculpture within 12 months, if he has uninterrupted time to work on the piece. David and Goliath took three years, however, to craft amid various commission pieces Moro was hired to create, and its finish was actually boosted thanks to the pandemic. “My major ‘push’ happened in the spring after Camden Hills [Regional High School] went to remote learning,” said Moro, who is also an ed tech at the high school. “I worked for seven months straight, and that was exactly what I needed to maintain momentum and finish the pieces. It’s a long process. But I do feel that time was my secret weapon; nothing about David and Goliath was impulsive.” Along the way of creating his David and Goliath piece, there were many creative problems for Moro to solve: armor, colors of clothing, how David and Goliath interact with each other. “There were also practical problems: how to secure and stabilize the sculptures, how to move them, how to make sure the pieces were solidly constructed,” Moro said. “The duration of the project allowed the best ideas to come to the surface.” The idea of sculpting life size sculptures of David and Goliath came to Moro fairly quickly, recalled, and the first step was to gather as many reference images as possible through Google Images and other research. “I looked up hundreds of illustrations depicting the battle, and every sculpture I could find that had already been done,” stated Moro. “It was just a wide open, brain-storming session.” After much research, Moro narrowed down his options to a few concepts he liked most and realized he was keen on showing the two fully engaged in battle, opposed to remaining static and simply looking at each other. “I found a ‘look’ that I wanted the piece to have, as well as distinctive weaponry and clothing,” said Moro. “Now that I had a plan, I started getting really specific with the images I wanted for reference.

Appearances can be deceiving. Having a growth mindset where anything is possible can unleash our creativity and give us victory.” Moro’s advice for young artists is to be dedicated to the craft, while still enjoying the journey. “Be in it for the long run,” he said. “Don’t compare yourself to other artists who have been working at their craft for decades. Any point of development is a good point, as long as you are enjoying it. I had an art teacher say to my class one day, ‘good art is not about your first piece… it’s not about your first five pieces… it’s about your first 50 pieces. And then it’s about the next 50 after that.’ You have to put in the work.” Enjoy the journey of personal growth as an artist, Moro said. “It’s not always glamorous, but growing as an artist should be fun,” he said. “Just because your creation doesn’t look like Michelangelo’s work at age 22, doesn’t mean that you can’t dramatically improve your craft over time.

Zmistowski has experience in politics, after working for Congressman Bruce Poliquin when she was 16. She then went on to work for Sen. Collins for two years while she attended UMaine. She spent the last summer organizing and running a special election campaign for Republican KC Hughes in Cumberland and Gray, Maine. She has also interned with the Maine GOP and Trump Victory, traveling across the state to inform people of Republican values. She noted that, through strong leadership and community engagement, she has seen a positive community reaction to the new executive members of the group. “Generally speaking, I feel our new group has been exceptionally well-received on campus, especially by other political groups,” Zmistowski said. “We’re finally all able to work collaboratively to get kids on campus more politically involved and begin engaging others respectfully on our differing viewpoints.” Published in Campus & Community News and News More posts from Leela Stockley UMaine's Student Newspaper since 1875.""}]"

A baby boy was born Wednesday, June 24, at Waldo County General Hospital with roots that stretch back to Joshua Chamberlain, a Civil War hero and decorated Union officer, who reached the rank of brigadier general. Chamberlain also served as Maine governor for four sequential one-year terms. Chamberlain Michael Frangoulis-Easton weighed 7 pounds, 1 ounce, and stretched 20 inches long, according to his grandmother, Kristin Frangoulis. He was named after and in honor of his famous ancestor, said George Frangoulis, the baby’s grandfather. Anastasia Frangoulis, the baby’s mother, was also born at Waldo County General Hospital on Christmas Day, 1986. At that time, The Republican Journal published a photograph of Kristin holding her new baby in a Christmas stocking. Kristin said her daughter had a difficult birth, ending up with a visit to the emergency room for an unexpected Cesarean section. “He has a huge head,” Kristin said of baby Chamberlain. “It runs in the family.” The baby’s father, Kristin added, is in military training right now and Anastasia is attending graduate school at Savannah College of Art and Design. The connection to Joshua Chamberlain comes from Kristin\'s side of the family — people she calls old-time Mainers, before Maine was a state. ""We are a mixed bag,"" she said. ""Maternal grandparents were Chamberlains — and they were all intermarried."" Joshua Chamberlain was born in 1828 in Brewer, and attended Bowdoin College in 1848 in Brunswick. After graduating from Bowdoin, he studied for three years at Bangor Theological Seminary, later switching gears and taking a teaching position at Bowdoin, where he was during the years leading up to the Civil War. According to Kristin, when the war came around, he asked for a leave from the college, but was refused. On Aug. 8, 1862, Chamberlain was appointed lieutenant colonel, second in command of the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He is known for fighting heroically in the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863 and was given the highest military award, the Medal of Honor, in 1893 for “conspicuous gallantry.” According to a biography by Charles Calhoun, he was “wounded six times — once, almost fatally — and had six horses shot from under him.” By the end of the war, he had risen to the rank of brigadier general and was tapped by Ulysses S. Grant to accept the weapons surrendered by the defeated Confederate troops at Appomattox. After the war, Chamberlain returned to Maine and was elected Maine’s 32nd governor, a post he held until 1870. During his tenure as governor, he encouraged the state to ratify the 14th Amendment, which made all freedmen and -women citizens of the United States. In 1871, he became president of Bowdoin College. Chamberlain died Feb. 24, 1914, in Portland, at the age of 85 from complications related to a severe wound he received in the Second Battle of Petersburg, Virginia. Success!

Maine's Community Newspaper Editor Gorham has undergone many changes in the last quarter century. Over the past 25 years, the Gorham Times has consistently been there to document those changes while continuing to bring “the news to all of Gorham.” The population of Gorham grew from 11,856 in 1990 to 16,381 in 2010. The current estimated population is 17,651 but is thought to be higher based on the number of registered voters (14,485). Laurie Nordfors, Town Clerk, believes the 2020 census will surely reflect more growth. In speaking with Abe Dailey, a data analyst with Greater Portland Council of Governments, about Gorham being one of the fastest growing towns in Maine, he shared, “A better way to identify the fastest growing town may be to look at the share of the total population growth in Maine since 2010. If you look at this measure Gorham has the second highest share of population growth in Maine since 2010, behind Windham. Gorham’s share of the state’s population growth exceeds that of Scarborough, Westbrook, and Saco, too.” School enrollment was 2,456 in 1995 and is anticipated to be 2,832 for the 2020-21 school year. The new Gorham Middle School opened in 2003 and Great Falls Elementary School opened in 2011. While GHS was renovated and expanded in the 1990s, a committee was formed more recently to review possible options for additional renovations to meet increases in enrollment. USM continues to be a valuable resource for our community. First opening in 1878 as the Gorham Normal School, the university annually hosts community events such as Gorham Night and a Halloween Party. USM also partners with GHS students, among others, for athletic events and online classes. Originally proposed in 1999, a new $5 million public safety building was unveiled in 2016. The complex now houses the fire station and a new 10,000-square-foot police station. The municipal offices moved into the former Shaw Junior High School on South Street in 2006. Baxter Library added a 10,000-square feet addition in 2003 and remains a fixture in the community. Traffic concerns and subsequent studies were documented in several of our earliest publications and date back as far as the 1989-1993 MDOT Route 25 Corridor Study. The Bernard Rines Bypass went out to bid in 2007 and was completed in 2008, improving traffic flow by allowing commuters to avoid the center of Gorham. In reference to land and new construction, Dailey said, “The average cost of land per acre in Portland ($263,300 per acre) is about five times the cost of the average acre in Gorham ($59,100). This trend in land prices means that for the average family in this region a home is much more affordable in a place like Gorham, Standish, or Windham.” A total of 146 subdivisions were approved (although not necessarily built) between 1996 and 2014. Between 2016 and present day, 30 new subdivisions have been approved consisting of 323 dwelling units. On the commercial side, 51 projects were approved, illustrating the upward trend in commercial activity which is beneficial to Gorham’s tax base. Housing sales for Gorham in 1997 (the first year records can be found) totaled 84. In 2019, the total was 311 homes. Non-profit organizations like the Gorham Business Exchange and the Gorham Village Alliance work together with Gorham’s Department of Community Development to support local business growth and enhance the community we live in. In the last five years, the town has been transformed. On Main Street alone, the demolition of the old Mobil station made way for a new shopping complex which now houses Aroma Joe’s, Subway, 9Round, and Nail Xperts. MK Kitchen fills the space at 2 School St offering residents fine dining close to home. The Blue Pig Diner revamped the old Centre of Movement dance studio at 19 State St, and Erin Flett moved her manufacturing/textile business to 2 Main St. Upcycle Maine Home Furnishings moved into 18 South Street while Amato’s and Gorham House of Pizza continue to anchor the Village intersection. The property at 18 Elm Street was razed in 2018 and a new building was constructed for Carter’s Green Market. CBD American Shaman occupies the second commercial unit. Station Square now fills the corner at 7 Railroad Drive and includes a bowling alley, a restaurant, and a wine bar as well as housing units. Hannaford Supermarket had a facelift in 2018-2019. Sebago Brewing built its new headquarters on Lower Main Street in 2018 to offer the public a tasting room and restaurant. Its old location in the Gorham Industrial Park was immediately occupied by Portland-based Lone Pine Brewing. Angelo’s Pizza renovated the space formerly occupied by Tots to Teens at 474 Main St. in 2019. Also in 2019, Harvey Performance broke ground on its new manufacturing plant at 49 Raceway Drive, home of the 62-acre former racetrack. Harvey became the first project at the sprawling site, owned by Shawn Moody’s company, and is expected to help boost the town’s tax base. With the town’s original industrial park almost at capacity and the Olde Canal Business Park located off of Mosher Road quickly filling, the Gorham community recently approved a referendum to purchase 141 acres of land from the M.P. Rines Trust. Located along Libby and Cobb Road and abutting the current industrial park, the new project will allow the Town to attract more businesses to further ease the tax burden on residents. Recreationally, Gorham is leading the way with access to public trails. As part of the Presumpscot Regional Land Trust, residents have their pick of walking trails in Gorham and surrounding communities. In 2005, Shaw Brothers Construction gave the Town of Gorham and its citizens Shaw Park, a 7.5-acre community park on the Presumpscot River. The walking and biking trails at Shaw Cherry Hill Farm opened to the public in 2019. Gorham boasts numerous bike trails and a pump track generously cared for by volunteers from the Gorham Conservation Committee, Portland NEMBA, and the local community.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': ""Officer Michael McFadden IV of the Belfast Police Department. Michael McFadden IV is the third generation in his family to serve in the Belfast Police Department. He was preceded by his father, former Chief Michael McFadden III, and grandfather, Michael McFadden II. Much like his father, the younger McFadden was unsure about becoming a police officer when he was growing up, but a couple of years after high school it was the profession he found himself gravitating toward, he said. The elder McFadden retired from the department last year after spending eight years as chief. Before that he worked for about 11 years as an investigator, moving between state, county and city departments. The son said it was never expected of him to go into law enforcement growing up. His father agreed, saying he actually hoped his son would go into a profession with more rewards and recognition for hard work and less drama. But the former chief is proud of his son and recognizes a lot of important qualities in him that are necessary for a police officer, he said. His son always preferred to work for what he had, rather than have things given to him. “He’s not going to fail for a lack of effort,” he said. The younger McFadden graduated from Belfast Area High School in 2014, where he played football, Mike said. During that time he also worked at Alexia’s Pizza and taught children to play soccer at the Waldo County YMCA during the school year, his father said. He applied for a work permit before he was 16, so he used to ride his bike to and from each location before he received his license. The elder McFadden described his son as very personable and able to make friends easily. He expects the new officer will most enjoy the friendships and bonds he will make during his career. The former chief said he will never forget the people he worked with, especially as a patrol officer. The son occasionally encounters people who knew his father or grandfather when they served in the department, he said. They mostly tell him good stories about his family. “I think it’s nice for the community to know there is a McFadden out there, I guess.” Grandfather Mike II moved his family to the area in 1976 from Stratford, Connecticut, the former chief said. Three days after moving to the town of Waldo, and before the moving boxes were even unpacked, he was asked to join the sheriff’s department. He served in the sheriff’s department before being recruited by Belfast to be an investigator. He had started his career in Connecticut, graduating at the top of his class from the Police Academy. He spent 25 years in the business before his death from cancer cut his career short at 47. Mike IV never had the chance to know his grandfather, but has heard stories about what a hard worker he was. As a new officer, he is still settling into the job. He does not have a plan about where he wants to take his career; rather he is going to see what opportunities present themselves and where they lead him. He said he hopes the excitement he feels now as a new officer never goes away and the job never gets boring. His father said he had been fortunate to have a career that always progressed and was never stagnant. The former chief hopes people do not give his son any more or less scrutiny than any other officer because of his name, he said. The family he comes from is less important than the work he is capable of. “Who he is in terms of a third-generation police officer at the Belfast Police Department is significantly less important than his ability to do a good job and treat the public fairly,” the father said.
