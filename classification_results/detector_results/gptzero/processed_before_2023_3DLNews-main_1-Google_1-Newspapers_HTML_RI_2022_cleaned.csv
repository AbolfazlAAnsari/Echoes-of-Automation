(Pope Benedict XVI) During this time of “Eucharistic Revival” that the Bishops of the United States have asked us to observe, it’s good for us to consider the richness of the Holy Eucharist. For indeed the Eucharist is like a diamond with many facets. Hold it up to the light, and each facet reflects light and shines on its own. But taken together, they form a very valuable gem.So what are the “facets” of the Eucharist? Well, first the Eucharist is the Sacrifice of Jesus on the Cross when he shed his blood for the forgiveness of sins and the redemption of the human race. The Eucharist is a meal, instituted at the Last Supper, in which we eat the Body of Blood of Christ and thus become what we have received. The Eucharist is the comforting presence of Christ with us, his people, as we continue our earthly pilgrimage. And the Eucharist is a proud proclamation of our faith, a source and sign of our unity with the Church, the Body of Christ.But the Eucharist isn’t just about ourselves, it’s also about reaching out to others in charity and generosity. Whenever we attend Holy Mass and receive the Eucharist, whenever we adore Christ present in the Blessed Sacrament, it should awaken our senses to be more aware of and more responsive to our brothers and sisters in need. And this is important, for as Pope Benedict said, a Eucharist that doesn’t result in the “concrete practice of love” is broken, is incomplete.And so the Eucharist moves us beyond our self-imposed walls and sensitizes us to the abject poverty and suffering of our brothers and sisters around the world. The Eucharist helps us respond to the needs of folks in our own community – the poor, the hungry, the homeless, the addicted, the abused, the lonely and the incarcerated – that we tend to ignore. The Eucharist encourages us to be patient with our troublesome relatives and friends who carry anxieties and difficulties of their own. And the Eucharist gives us strength to forgive others who have offended us; to throw off the burden of bitterness that has weighed us down.In all of these ways, the Eucharist calls us to a “practical love” that helps the image of Christ grow within us each day. Something to think about: Does your attendance at Mass and reception of Holy Communion really help you to be a better, more charitable Catholic?

But U.S. cybersecurity experts say such a response could include a range of options ranging from bolstering America’s cybersecurity safety net to launching top-secret offensive cyberweapons against Russian targets including its own critical infrastructure. Some of those responses are already underway. On Thursday, administration officials stepped up their campaign to implement a “shields up” effort to protect key parts of U.S. critical infrastructure – such as pipelines, banks, commercial aviation and hospitals – from potential Russian cyberattacks linked to its invasion of Ukraine, top U.S. security officials say. The Department of Homeland Security continued to monitor the situation through its Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which reported no major intrusions. Other coordinating foreign intelligence and domestic cybersecurity agencies were also working overtime, reaching out to energy providers and other critical infrastructure sectors to bolster their digital defenses, said Danielle Jablanski, a cybersecurity strategist specializing in operational technology at Nozomi Networks. ""Our intelligence community has done a remarkable job so far to identify credible threats coming from Russia for the crisis at hand,"" Jablanski said. ""We should continue to trust them to do the same in identifying the potential for incoming cyber-attacks."" On the domestic side, Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm sent a letter to U.S. energy and power companies on Thursday that ""established cohesion, points of contact, and a measured amount of urgency to prepare our communities,"" Jablanski said. Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, said at a White House briefing last Friday that Russia was behind last week’s widespread cyberattacks on Ukrainian banks and military websites, suggesting it was part of a broader digital offensive that could be a prelude to a full-scale military invasion. Neuberger and top Department of Homeland Security official Jen Easterly warned that while Russia is focusing intensively on Ukraine right now, it has a long track record of launching cyber operations that extend far beyond its borders at times even when it is focusing most of its energy on another target. “While there are currently no specific or credible cyberthreats to the homeland, the U.S. government has been preparing for potential geopolitical contingencies since before Thanksgiving,” Neuberger said. Easterly, director of DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), described similar U.S. efforts to sound the alarm and prepare the nation for an electronic attack. \' Speaking at an Aspen Institute Cyber Threats forum, Easterly said the White House has spent the past several months coordinating an extensive outreach effort with local, state and federal agencies and the private sector to secure their cybernetworks. “We all recognize that threats to our digital infrastructure are, of course, not bound by national borders,” Easterly said, citing a 2017 Russian cyberattack on Ukraine that ended up causing billions of dollars in damage to private companies around the world. Border buildup: Is Russia going to invade Ukraine? Satellite images show the latest Russian troop movements “Our critical infrastructure is integrated into a larger global cyber ecosystem, which means that we all need to be ready, or as I like to say, shields up,” Easterly said. “So given the rising tensions and the potential invasion of Ukraine by Russia, we\'ve actually been leaning forward to inform our industry partners of potential threats.” What kind of offensive cyberoperations – if any – are being contemplated by the Biden administration is unclear. Although the U.S. has launched some offensive cyberattacks in the past, they have been among the most closely held secrets in the U.S. military arsenal. The Bush administration is believed to have used such offensive cyberweapons, including Stuxnet and other malicious computer viruses against Iran to stop its clandestine nuclear weapons program. Under the Obama and Trump administrations, the U.S. made a significant shift toward taking a more aggressive stance when it came to conducting offensive cyberoperations to defend itself and to achieve strategic and tactical objectives. But some experts cautioned that Biden’s threat, and any action taken in cyberspace to back it up, could result in unforeseen or unintended consequences. “The most well-informed intelligence professionals and war planners still do not know what escalation looks like in an unprecedented exchange of cyber warfare,” said Jablanski. “Any cyber operation to counter Russian military aggression in Ukraine that wants to avoid encouraging Putin to take more drastic steps cannot threaten the lives and safety of innocent civilians,” she told USA TODAY. “Cyber weapons might include zero day exploits and the potential to impose high costs on an adversary, but they also potentially lead to unintended consequences which might not be justifiable if unprovoked.” Easterly said CISA has been leading a national campaign starting in late 2021 to ensure that senior leaders and network defenders were prepared to manage such a threat. That has included outreach, technical assistance and classified and unclassified briefings to the private sector and state and local officials. More: A Russian invasion could reach farther than Ukraine. How a cyberattack could affect you. On Friday evening, CISA circulated a new document among infrastructure owners and operators with guidance on how to identify and mitigate the risks of possible Russian cyberattacks and related influence operations. “Recently observed foreign influence operations abroad demonstrate that foreign governments and actors can quickly employ sophisticated influence techniques to target American audiences with the goal of disrupting U.S. critical infrastructure and undermining U.S. interests,” the document said. The problem is that U.S. cybersecurity officials essentially have their hands tied when it comes to forcing key sectors of critical infrastructure to take steps to protect their computer networks, experts say. “As many of you know, the government doesn\'t own or operate critical infrastructure that provides critical services to our citizens. For example, our water and power systems,” Neuberger said. Thanks to lobbying and regulation-averse lawmakers in Congress, many of these critical infrastructure sectors can – and have – ignored repeated U.S. government requests to upgrade their security systems, said Michael Hamilton, founder of the security firm Critical Insight and former chief information security officer for the city of Seattle. As a result, many of them lag far behind where they need to be when it comes to protecting their services and the Americans who use them from criminal hackers and state-sponsored adversaries like Russia and China, Hamilton said. Neuberger acknowledged that shortcoming during the White House briefing Friday but said the Biden administration has taken urgent steps over the past year to build a safety network – especially for power, telecommunications and water companies because they so directly affect peoples’ lives. More: Cyberattacks and disinformation are everyday tactics for Putin\'s Russia. Is that the future of war? In all, there are 16 officially designated sectors of U.S. critical infrastructure, whose assets, systems, and networks – physical and virtual – are considered so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on U.S. national security, economic security or public health and safety. That includes chemical manufacturers, water and sewer systems, communications companies, dams and nuclear plants, defense contractors, banks, energy firms and food and agricultural industries. Most of these sectors have “digitized quickly, and we need to catch up” in making them less vulnerable to a cyberattack, Neuberger said. As the threat of a Russian invasion loomed, U.S. officials at the Department of Energy recently were directed to share with power companies all of the technical nuts and bolts of what kinds of electronic intrusions Russia might launch, she said, based on prior attacks against Ukrainian power grids. At least twice since 2015, Russian military hackers have knocked out power and electricity to wide swaths of Ukraine, leaving up to half a million people to freeze in the dead of winter. The Transportation Security Administration has begun requiring companies overseeing gas and oil pipelines to put in place defenses against cyberattacks, Neuberger said. Russia-based hackers with possible ties to the government are widely believed to have been behind last year’s ransomware attack against the Colonial Pipeline, which caused a gas panic and huge lines at the pump for days. TSA has issued directives that require oil and gas pipelines to report any and all cyber incidents, to conduct vulnerability assessments and to update their incident response plans. “TSA is now working to expand that to both the aviation and railroad sectors,” Neuberger said. And in recent days, the Department of Homeland Security and FBI have issued numerous warnings to other key U.S. sectors that could be targeted, including financial institutions and defense contractors. Another warning was sent to utility companies and nuclear plants, she said.

It’s a story of a young man who wanted to leave his country to immigrate to the United States to make a better life for his family. It’s a story of someone who did everything right, from the moment he visited the U.S. Embassy in his native Dominican Republic to get a visa, to the proud time that he was sworn in as a resident of the United States, to the time in the near future when he will welcome his wife and son, who currently live in Santiago, Dominican Republic, to come here to live as a family. In this day of vicious debate surrounding immigration policy and the high-sounding rhetoric on both sides of the issue, it is heart-warming to hear stories of how it can work by following the rules and ultimately celebrating the success of hard work and belief in a dream. To say Ramon Taveras is a character, is an understatement. Born in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, he came to this country, worked two jobs (parking cars and cleaning buildings) for as many hours as he could get to move ahead, until he ultimately got his first big break when the late George Germon, founder and co-owner of the nationally known Al Forno Restaurant in Providence spotted him parking cars and asked him if he wanted to learn how to cook. Not hesitating for a moment, Ramon accepted the offer and was positioned initially at the salad station, where George wanted him to start, but added that after that he “could learn everything else.” Having no prior culinary experience, he was eager to learn the ins and outs of the restaurant business, particularly at one of Rhode Island’s premier restaurants. In the three and a half years working there, he had a doctoral course in all aspects of the inner and outer operations of fine dining, with a clientele that was demanding and particular. Asked what the signature dishes were at Al Forno, he said “Dirty steak (a steak with a special sauce) and pizza,” which just about anyone who ever ate there would agree with. But Al Forno did it like no one else, in a very upscale style and presentation. Ramon ultimately left Al Forno to join the Café Fresco group of restaurants, starting as line cook at the East Greenwich location. When the position of head chef became available at their then newest location – DiVine Italian Bistro on West Shore Road in Warwick about 16 years ago – he jumped at the chance to show his skills and became the head chef. He has been there ever since. If you have never been to DiVine, you are missing great food and entertainment. Not entertainment in the form of a band or a juggler or dancing bears, but in the form of Ramon and his banter with the customers who fight to get a seat to eat at the bar, rather than the tables, so they can see Ramon and staff work their magic at the open kitchen. As mentioned, Ramon is a character. Sometimes he kids with the customers that he is out of this dish or that dish or has some funny back and forth concerning local events or news stories. Regulars David and Kathy Roche who live in Warwick Neck are happy to talk about their DiVine experience. Kathy puts it this way: “having dinner at DiVine with Ramon in the kitchen is like having a five-star meal combined with a comedy show thanks to his quick-witted humor. He’s not only a great chef but a better person.” The dishes that he prepares vary, but the basic menu is Italian-American fare with signature dishes like pork chops, pasta jambalaya and of course the terrific pizza which is similar to the thousands he helped make at Al Forno. Still the hard-working guy he was when he came to the country, Ramon works seven days a week (he takes every other Sunday off). It’s a busy schedule as DiVine is open Sunday to Thursday from 5 to 9 and Friday and Saturday from 5 to 10. Many regulars vie for the “kitchen view” at the bar, along with tables scattered in the relatively small dining space, which is how they designed it. Ramon “knows them (the regulars) like family.” He said “we have great people and great customers – myself included (with a laugh).” “Everyone fights for a bar seat and I get to torture them!” He continued “they get to see me cook their dishes and they love it! I also have a great boss who lets me do what I want.” Which leads me to the “other” part of the story. If you have ever been to the Dominican Republic, you would probably know that their unofficial “national dish” is Sancocho. It’s a stew comprised of vegetables, different kinds of meat, potatoes, cilantro, hot sauce and special spices usually served with white rice and avocado slices. It is to die for. Not being shy, your humble correspondent has no problem torturing Ramon to make the special dish once and awhile. When he does, I bust through to the garage door to get to DiVine. Now other people are requesting it as well, which might ultimately lead to it being placed on the menu. But one thing is for sure. The customers and his fellow workers love Ramon. Stephen Burgess, a bartender at DiVine and other sister properties for over three years and who prior to that worked as a bartender and beverage manager at Warwick Country Club said it this way: “Customers love him. I have never seen a better relationship than the one he has with the customers in any restaurant that I’ve ever worked in.” Ramon Taveras is what’s right about our immigration system. He did everything the right way, worked hard and is now enjoying the fruits of all that hard work. God willing, he will soon be joined by wife Rosanna and son Noah as soon as their visa’s clear. Rhode Island is a better place because of people like him.

third highest vote count in the Hometown Heroes Police K-9 $15,000 Grant Giveaway. COVENTRY — Thanks to an outpouring of support, $5,000 worth of K-9 equipment will be given to one very good boy who’s been working hard to keep Coventry safe. “This is huge,” Officer Brandon Sullivan said Wednesday of himself and K-9 Nixo, Coventry’s newest police dog, being named recipients of the nationwide Hometown Heroes Police K-9 $15,000 Grant Giveaway. Coventry was the only Rhode Island police department to enter the online contest, and is one of three departments to share the grant from The Hometown Foundation, a Connecticut-based nonprofit. Officer Robert Ungurean and K-9 Ronin of the Upper Southampton Township Police Department in Pennsylvania earned the most votes, with 5,182; in second place, with 4,761 votes, was Officer Gage Cvijic and K-9 Wes of the Lower Paxton Township Police Department in Pennsylvania. Sullivan and Nixo nabbed the third spot, with 4,068 votes. The way that the community rallied around Coventry's K-9 unit was “incredible,” said Sullivan, Nixo’s handler. “With budgets being tight, it’s hard,” he said. “Pretty much everything — the training, the equipment — that he gets is through donation, so the fact that we were able to raise all those votes is huge.” Voters were able to cast one vote for free, and could pay $1 for each vote after that. Sullivan and Nixo had been behind last Monday, but 1,500 last-minute votes from Coventry resident Todd Knapp, who had already given 500 votes, brought the department into third place. “I actually went to bed thinking we were going to lose,” Sullivan said. “I woke up, because Nixo was making a bunch of noise, at 3:30 in the morning and was extremely surprised.” The grant will fund equipment like bite suits and sleeves that Sullivan said should last Nixo, a nearly two-year-old Dutch Shepherd, for at least a couple “A lot of dogs don’t really get the opportunity to train with some of this stuff,” Sullivan said, adding that having constant access to their own equipment means he and Nixo can continually train. “It’s going to be incredible for his development.” Along with all that new equipment, Nixo will also soon be outfitted in a bullet- and stab-protective vest, thanks to a donation from the Massachusetts-based nonprofit Vested Interested in K9s. Nixo, a dual-purpose K-9 and the Coventry Police Department’s third dog, was partnered with Sullivan last August, and the two finished K-9 school in mid-January. Nixo is certified in narcotics, able to detect a variety of different drugs, by the North American Police Work Dog Association, and has been trained in patrol work. In his first couple of months on the job, Nixo has already assisted in making several arrests. The K-9 was tasked during one investigation with searching several vehicles, and in one of them he located cocaine beneath the back cushion. “We’ve already had a couple good narcotic grabs on motor vehicle stops,” Sullivan added. But Nixo is more than just Sullivan's colleague. Since welcoming Nixo into his home, Sullivan said, he and his furry partner have become “extremely close.” “I’m with him 24/7,” Sullivan said. “He’s got separation anxiety, but so do I. We’re together nonstop.” kgravelle@ricentral.com Log In Keep it Clean. Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexually-oriented language. PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR CAPS LOCK. Don't Threaten.

(Photo by John E. Corbett/courtesy the Preservation Society of Newport County) The opulent Gold Room of Newport’s historic Marble House provided the perfect setting for “Downton Abbey” creator Julian Fellowes to regale reporters at a press conference July 26 with stories about the real-life characters and historical events that inspired his latest series, “The Gilded Age,” filmed partly in Newport. Fellowes also appeared at The Breakers for “An Evening with Lord Fellowes,” where he accepted the Antiquarian Award from the Preservation Society of Newport County. He told the group at Marble House that he’d never been to Newport prior to scouting the mansions as possible locations for “The Gilded Age” two years ago. “I’d read about the Gilded Age, of course, but I had never been here. The Gilded Age is in the town . . . In New York, there’s not the same sense of being in a Gilded Age town. We use Newport not only for Newport, but also for the palaces of New York, because they used the same designers and architects.” Flanked by Preservation Society of Newport County CEO Trudy Coxe and Rhode Island Film and Television Office executive director Steven Feinberg, Fellowes said he was inspired by Marble House, completed in 1892, because it was the home of the powerhouse socialité, Alva Vanderbilt, the model for the show’s character, Bertha Russell, played by Carrie Coon. “Bertha is completely Alva. Marble House was the creation of Alva Vanderbilt and the acme of the whole idea of the Gilded Age. She was an extraordinary character,” said Fellowes. “Her first imperative was to get money, and when she met William K. Vanderbilt, she married him. I don’t think he knew what hit him . . . Nowadays, she’d be an American ambassador to the U.N. or something, but that wasn’t available to her. So, she moved to the stage that was society and dominated it. “George [Russell, Bertha’s husband] isn’t really Willie K. He didn’t make his own money; it was all inherited. He was not a dynamic businessman.” Instead, George, a railroad tycoon played by Morgan Spector, is based on Jay Gould, “one of the most ruthless of the robber barons,” said Fellowes. Set in New York and Newport in the 1880s, “The Gilded Age” debuted in January on HBO and was a hit with viewers. Season two is now in production and will premiere in 2023. Audiences can expect to see more of Newport in the new season. Broadway star Laura Benanti has been added to a cast already stocked with Tony Award winners. She’ll play Susan Blane, a recently widowed socialite who moves to Newport and begins renovations on her home. Newport mansions, including Marble House, The Breakers and Rosecliff, served as settings in season one with their lavish interiors and exteriors also standing in for the characters’ Fifth Avenue homes. Fellowes said his personal favorite mansion is The Elms, and its bedrooms and servants’ kitchen were featured prominently in many scenes. “My house is the Elms, no doubt about that,” said Fellowes. “I love everything about it; the entrance, the rooms, the dining room, the terrace garden, the ballroom is the prettiest in the town. The servants went on strike once; they all marched out because they didn’t have enough time off. I love that!” When Coxe quipped that this might be a potential storyline, Fellowes replied, “Don’t tempt me!” before revealing that he was under strict orders from HBO not to reveal any of the plots in season two. But Fellowes still found plenty to talk about. An Emmy and Oscar winner and the author of several novels, Fellowes said despite the historical characters and events in “The Gilded Age,” he prefers the freedom of fiction. “At one time in my life, I entertained a series about the Vanderbilts, but I feel if you have real characters, you must make them say what they really said and do what they would have done,” he said. “That is limiting. With fiction, you can take events from anyone’s life and make them happen . . . One has a duty to be true. I do have real characters in Mrs. Astor, Ward McAllister, Stanford White . . . But you need principals who are not real so you have that freedom.” “The Gilded Age” storyline about writer Peggy Scott (Denée Benton) and her family is also rooted in historical fact. Fellowes credited his cowriter Sonja Warfield and historian Erica Dunbar for helping to shape this and other plot lines. “I already had the Scott family [in the story] since ‘The Gilded Age’ was a long time in gestation. I was very keen on two elements: I did not want it to look like an English period drama; I wanted it to look American and an African-American story gave me that,” he said. At first, Fellowes wasn’t sure how a storyline about Black Americans fit into “The Gilded Age.” Then he discovered the book, “Black Gotham,” by Carla Peterson, about Black upper-middle class families in Brooklyn in the second half of the 19th century who’d created wealth by starting drug store chains. Peterson’s own family had started such a chain, said Fellowes. “So, I lifted that for [Peggy’s father] Arthur Scott, because I knew critics would say, ‘Oh, come on,’ and I wanted to have an ironclad basis for the story. And historians did say it was right. It’s a difficult balance, of course. There was racism everywhere you looked and I did not want to be sentimental.” As they await the second season, fans of “The Gilded Age” may get their fix with the Preservation Society’s new tour, “Inside the Gilded Age,” which will take a limited number of visitors through the mansions featured in the series. Fellowes also appeared at The Breakers for “An Evening with Lord Fellowes,” where he accepted the Antiquarian Award from the Preservation Society of Newport County. He told the group at Marble House that he’d never been to Newport prior to scouting the mansions as possible locations for “The Gilded Age” two years ago. “I’d read about the Gilded Age, of course, but I had never been here. The Gilded Age is in the town . . . In New York, there’s not the same sense of being in a Gilded Age town. We use Newport not only for Newport, but also for the palaces of New York, because they used the same designers and architects.” Flanked by Preservation Society of Newport County CEO Trudy Coxe and Rhode Island Film and Television Office executive director Steven Feinberg, Fellowes said he was inspired by Marble House, completed in 1892, because it was the home of the powerhouse socialité, Alva Vanderbilt, the model for the show’s character, Bertha Russell, played by Carrie Coon. “Bertha is completely Alva. Marble House was the creation of Alva Vanderbilt and the acme of the whole idea of the Gilded Age. She was an extraordinary character,” said Fellowes. “Her first imperative was to get money, and when she met William K. Vanderbilt, she married him. I don’t think he knew what hit him . . . Nowadays, she’d be an American ambassador to the U.N. or something, but that wasn’t available to her. So, she moved to the stage that was society and dominated it. “George [Russell, Bertha’s husband] isn’t really Willie K. He didn’t make his own money; it was all inherited. He was not a dynamic businessman.” Instead, George, a railroad tycoon played by Morgan Spector, is based on Jay Gould, “one of the most ruthless of the robber barons,” said Fellowes. Set in New York and Newport in the 1880s, “The Gilded Age” debuted in January on HBO and was a hit with viewers. Season two is now in production and will premiere in 2023. Audiences can expect to see more of Newport in the new season. Broadway star Laura Benanti has been added to a cast already stocked with Tony Award winners.

I couldn’t have done it without the support of my family, friends, and fans. I highly recommend any actor or model who wishes to pursue the entertainment business as a full-time career get all the experience they can in their home state and region first before moving to a larger market. To me, Rhode Island was a great place to grow up, and since it is close in proximity to Boston and New York City, I would seek out job opportunities and drive an average 2,000 miles a month to work gigs up and down the East Coast. There were times I would drive from RI, have a gig or audition in NYC, then drive to Boston to work another gig, and finally end the night back at home in Rhode Island. There is definitely a lot of opportunity in the state, and surrounding areas, to start your career. The first time I set foot on a movie set was Dan in Real Life, which was filmed in Providence. It just felt like magic to me. I was fascinated by all of the cast and crew working together to create something special for others. Rhode Island was a great place for me to start my career because at the time we had a film tax incentive, which allowed major films and TV shows tax breaks to film in our state. I enjoy trap shooting because that also means I get to spend time with my brother, Dan, and my uncles at the gun clubs whenever I am back home visiting from Los Angeles where I currently live. My favorite places to shop, eat, and play in Providence include Hemenway’s, especially when there is a WaterFire going on, followed by bar hopping along the river. No trip to Providence is ever complete without a trip to Pastiche Fine Desserts or a walk down Thayer Street. Most people have no idea how close they really are to achieving their dreams, and this is why you must never give up!
