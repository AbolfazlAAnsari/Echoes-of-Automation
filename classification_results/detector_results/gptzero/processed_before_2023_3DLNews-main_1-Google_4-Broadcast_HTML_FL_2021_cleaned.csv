updates and other important health news. A pill that could potentially treat COVID-19 is a ""game-changer,"" but experts are emphasizing that it\'s not an alternative to vaccinations — which remain the most effective path to ending the coronavirus pandemic if enough people get their shots. Yet, the average number of people getting vaccinated — at 270,531 per day— is the lowest it\'s been since Aug. 15, according to Friday\'s data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A little over 65% of the eligible population is fully vaccinated, the data shows. At the same time, the U.S. hit a grim milestone Friday by surpassing 700,000 deaths from COVID-19, according to Johns Hopkins University\'s data. The U.S. tops the world for COVID-19 deaths, followed by Brazil with nearly 600,000 fatalities, according to the data. The news from Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics on Friday that they created an antiviral pill that can reduce COVID-19 hospitalization and death by 50% was hailed by health experts, although they cautioned it wasn\'t a replacement for vaccinations. ""This can be used in conjunction with the vaccine. And it\'s not an alternative to vaccination. We still have to try to get more people vaccinated,"" Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, told CNN on Friday. Gottlieb acknowledged that the antiviral medicine could be effective for those who choose not to get vaccinated as well as those who catch the virus while fully vaccinated. ""This is the most impactful result that I remember seeing of an orally available drug in the treatment of a respiratory pathogen, perhaps ever,"" Gottlieb told CNN. ""I think getting an oral pill that can inhibit viral replication — that can inhibit this virus — is going to be a real game-changer."" Merck said Friday it will seek FDA emergency use authorization for its molnupiravir medication ""as soon as possible."" If permitted, it would become the first oral medicine that fights viral infection for COVID-19. ""If approved, I think the right way to think about this is this is a potential additional tool in our toolbox to protect people from the worst outcomes of COVID,"" White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients said Friday. Zients echoed Gottlieb\'s stance on vaccination, underscoring inoculation remains ""far and away our best tool against COVID-19"" because the shots can prevent people from getting infected in the first place. ""And we want to prevent infections, not just wait to treat them once they happen,"" Zients said. Meanwhile, Louisiana reported Friday that a child at or under the age of four died from COVID-19. It was the state\'s 17th pediatric death from the virus. ""We owe it to ourselves, our children and everyone around us to take advantage of the best protection we have, and that is the vaccine and wearing a mask,"" Louisiana State Health Officer Dr. Joseph Kanter said. Th delta variant of the coronavirus has made child infections much more common than during the onset of the pandemic. Americans who received the Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines can expect to hear next steps for booster shots this month. The FDA will meet with its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee on Oct. 14 and 15 to discuss those boosters for those vaccines, which have only been authorized for emergency use in those 18 and older. The committee will also consider data on ""mix and match"" use of boosters, the agency said Friday. Only Pfizer\'s COVID-19 two-dose vaccine has been fully approved by the FDA for people 12 and older. Pfizer\'s booster shot is authorized for emergency use in people 65 and older, people at high risk of severe disease and people whose jobs put them at risk of infection. More than 4.03 million people have received an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine — or booster — since Aug. 13. Am I fully vaccinated without a COVID-19 vaccine booster? The FDA vaccine committee is also slated to discuss Pfizer\'s COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 to 11 on Oct. 26. Pfizer has started submitting data about this age group to the agency but has not yet formally requested emergency use authorization. The committee of independent advisers typically discusses and makes recommendations to the FDA on vaccine authorizations and approvals. Then, the agency makes the final decision. As federal health officials consider booster shots, vaccine mandates are being implemented more widely — and some are not happy with the move. On Friday, American Airlines told its U.S. workers that they must follow the Biden administration\'s requirement to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The airline noted that its business with the federal government means it will be covered under the mandate but fell short of saying when the requirement takes effect. Religious and disability-related exemptions will be available, but there will be no ""provision of a regular testing alternative,"" the airline said. ""While we are still working through the details of the federal requirements, it is clear that team members who choose to remain unvaccinated will not be able to work at American Airlines,"" according to a memo CNN obtained from the airline management sent to employees. Meanwhile, Ochsner Health in Louisiana said it will charge employees enrolled in their upcoming 2022 health care benefits a fee for spouses and domestic partners who are not vaccinated against COVID-19. ""This is not a mandate as non-employed spouses and domestic partners can choose to select a health plan outside of Ochsner Health offerings. As with our employee vaccination policy, spouses and domestic partners with medical and religious objections will be able to file exemption requests,"" Ochsner Health President and CEO Warner Thomas said in a statement this week.

(Gray News) - An Illinois family is sending a message to the unvaccinated through their loved one’s obituary. It says the 66-year-old woman was vaccinated for COVID-19 but still got infected and died because others refused the shots. Candace “Candy” Ayers, 66, died from COVID-19 at an Illinois hospital Sept. 3, more than a month after she was diagnosed with the virus in late July despite being fully vaccinated, The State Journal-Register reports. Her husband, Terry Ayers, and two adult children were heartbroken by her loss – but also angry. They used Candace Ayers’ obituary to call out those who haven’t been vaccinated for COVID-19. “She was preceded in death by more than 4,531,799 others infected with COVID-19. She was vaccinated but was infected by others who chose not to be. The cost was her life,” the obituary read. Candace Ayers’ 36-year-old son, Marc Ayers, says he wants those who are unvaccinated to realize that their decision is taking a toll on others. “This whole thing is so preventable,” he told the Journal-Register. “People have politicized this and made it about politics. These are the people who have perpetuated the cycle of pain for our family and so many others.” Candace Ayers was fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in the spring. Her family believes she caught the virus on a four-day trip to Mississippi in mid-July to visit a friend who lost her husband to COVID-19, according to the Journal-Register. Mississippi had one of the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the nation over the summer, but Candace Ayers’ family and doctor thought she would be safe because she herself was vaccinated. Both Candace Ayers and her husband caught the virus. He developed only mild symptoms and recovered, but she ended up hospitalized for a month, the last three weeks on a ventilator. Her family told the Journal-Register she had rheumatoid arthritis and believe it put her at a higher risk of complications from COVID-19. Candace Ayers’ family made the hard decision to remove her from the ventilator due to the severe, irreversible lung damage from COVID-19.

But she said it took a lot to get to this moment. â\x80\x9cI had never seen a grin that big on my son\'s face. He couldn\'t believe he was finally going to get the puberty blockers to help him.

""Before my daughter transitioned socially, she was sad, depressed, anxious.

Krause\'s bill was scheduled for a public hearing at the House Committee on Public Health Wednesday. He said he believes such life-changing procedures require more vetting. Krause also noted that there are a number of policies in Texas preventing those under the age of 18 from taking certain actions. â\x80\x9cWe just feel like it\'s good public policy that kids shouldn\'t even have the option to do that before they become an adult. If they want to make that decision then, that\'s great. It\'s not about trusting the parents one way or the other. It\'s about good public policy for Texas,â\x80\x9d he said. Separately, the Texas Senate advanced a bill that would limit transgender sports participation, despite the NCAA warning lawmakers against it this week. â\x80\x8bTexas is among 30 states weighing bills to ban transgender girls or women from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity.

Rodriguez\'s son Greyson is heading off to an LGTBQ-friendly campus in the fall to study nursing. Rodriguez said he was partly inspired by the medical team that has supported him all these years and become like family. â\x80\x9cIf we hadn\'t had gender-affirming care these past few years, I would probably be telling you about how I lost my son,â\x80\x9d she said.'}]"

'President Biden\'s press secretary Jen Psaki said on Sunday that she has tested positive for COVID-19, the highest-ranking White House official to have publicly revealed a case in this administration. Psaki, who is fully vaccinated, said she has experienced only mild symptoms. In a statement, she said she had not had contact with senior White House officials since Wednesday — four days before she tested positive — and last saw Biden on Tuesday, when they were wearing masks and were more than six feet apart from each other, outdoors. ""I am disclosing today\'s positive test out of an abundance of transparency,"" Psaki said in a statement. She said she will quarantine for at least ten days and won\'t return to the White House until receiving a negative rapid test. The White House had announced early on Thursday morning that Psaki would not be traveling with Biden to the G-20 summit in Rome due to a family emergency. That emergency, she said on Sunday, was that members of her household had tested positive for COVID-19. ""Since then, I have quarantined and tested negative (via PCR) for COVID on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. However, today, I tested positive for COVID,"" Psaki said. She said her symptoms are mild enough to continue working at home. Psaki is not the first White House press secretary to get COVID. During the Trump administration, before vaccines were available, her predecessor Kayleigh McEnany tested positive, as did the president, first lady, and many White House officials and aides. The Biden White House has been very cautious of the virus, requiring masks indoors except for a brief period this spring.
