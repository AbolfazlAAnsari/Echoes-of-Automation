While at the summit Beardsley spoke with NATO volunteer, Rima Olberkyte, who grew up in Lithuania when it was under Soviet rule. Olberkyte directly related to the Ukrainian struggle and expressed the importance of keeping Lithuania prosperous. We also hear from Ishaan Tharoor, the foreign Affairs columnist at the Washington Post. He’s also the anchor of Today's WorldView, the Post's daily column and newsletter on global politics.
