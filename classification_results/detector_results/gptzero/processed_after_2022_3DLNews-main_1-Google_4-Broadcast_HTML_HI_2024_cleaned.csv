As one of three deputy chiefs of staff, Tomasini will add a new portfolio of responsibilities, including oversight of the president’s schedule, White House personnel and operations on the 18-acre campus, senior White House aides said. Steve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, said Tomasini has insight into what Biden needs and how it can be delivered inside the White House. “She’s a huge talent,” he said in an interview. “Amongst us all, I really do think she’s indispensable here to how we function inside the White House.” Others cited skills Tomasini learned in a different arena. The 2002 graduate of Boston University was co-captain of the women’s basketball team. “She’s got the mentality of a female athlete: confidence, poise, command and competitiveness, but a team player,” said Susan Rice, who served more than two years as Biden’s top domestic policy adviser. NCAA President Charlie Baker, a former Massachusetts governor, recalled Tomasini working with his gubernatorial staff on a transportation and economic development project. “There is no better human development program in America than college sports,” said Baker, a Republican.

The yearlong investigation centered on the improper retention of classified documents by Biden from his time as a U.S. senator and as vice president. Sensitive records were found at his Delaware home and at a private office that he used in between his service in the Obama administration and becoming president. The resolution of the investigation arrives in a pivotal year for the president as he pursues reelection in a deeply polarized political time.

Trump and other Republicans are likely to challenge the legitimacy of the investigation by noting that it was launched by the Biden Justice Department. But Garland sought to insulate the department from claims of bias and conflicts of interest by last year appointing Hur, a former U.S. attorney for Maryland during the Trump administration, to handle the Biden investigation and by naming a different special counsel, Jack Smith, to oversee investigations into Trump. While the Trump investigation resulted in dozens of felony charges against the ex-president last year, the outcome of the Biden probe is expected to be different.

Even so, the White House’s response to the discovery of classified documents early last year was delayed and incomplete. The White House did not disclose the Justice Department’s investigation until January 2023, when it acknowledged the discovery two months earlier of a “small number” of classified documents by Biden lawyers as they closed an office at the Penn Biden Center, a think tank affiliated with the Ivy League school.

LEILA FADEL, HOST: Colorado's Supreme Court disqualified him based on a clause in the Constitution. It says a former official may not return to office after engaging in insurrection or rebellion. Trump gave a speech to supporters, who then stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The case turns on many questions, like whether that attack counts as insurrection and who gets to decide if the rule applies to Trump. INSKEEP: The case does have implications for other states, so NPR's Carrie Johnson is following it. Hi there, Carrie. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: OK, so what is the law here? JOHNSON: The key law is Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which was passed after the Civil War to try to keep Confederates out of government. This provision says anyone who swore an oath to the Constitution and went on to engage in insurrection is disqualified from public office unless two-thirds of Congress votes to grant that person amnesty. It's never been applied to a former president, and it's only been applied about eight times since the 1860s. I talked with Jason Murray, a lawyer who will argue the case today for the Colorado voters, and he says this part of the Constitution remains relevant. Here's more of what Murray had to say. JASON MURRAY: The reason why this case is unprecedented is because Donald Trump's behavior is unprecedented. No other American president has refused to peacefully hand over the reins of power after losing an election. INSKEEP: Which is true and does answer one concern, which is why is this amendment being cited now when it's so rarely - or this provision of it so rarely been cited in the past? What is former President Trump's response? JOHNSON: Donald Trump is making a bunch of arguments. First, he says the president is actually not an officer of the United States because he says presidents are elected and not appointed. And so he says that part of the 14th Amendment should not apply to him. Trump also says he did not engage in an insurrection on January 6. He's also making the case that barring him from the ballot will open the floodgates. Scott Gessler is one of Trump's lawyers. He says there's going to be a constant stream of litigation if the Supreme Court allows these doors to open. SCOTT GESSLER: And it's not going to stop. You're going to see attacks on President Biden. You're going to see attacks on Kamala Harris - Vice President Harris. You're going to see attacks on senators and representatives, other people, trying to prevent them from being on the ballot. JOHNSON: And if Scott Gessler sounds a little scratchy there, it's because I caught him at the airport where he traveled to defend Trump on another ballot disqualification issue in Illinois. INSKEEP: Because there are plenty of cases going on. I'm trying to think this through from the Supreme Court's point of view, though. Chief Justice John Roberts has tried, when possible, to make the court seem a little less political, to keep out of political controversies where possible, to give narrow rulings where possible. And now we have this gigantic question of whether a former president of the United States should be on the presidential ballot, possibly in multiple states. What are the court's options here? JOHNSON: This is a hard one. You know, the court is now at the center of a presidential election, just like it was in 2000 when it stopped the Florida recount and handed the White House to George W. Bush. But in this case, the justices have a few options. They could decide to disqualify Trump, just like the Colorado Supreme Court did. Depending on how they rule, it could have a cascading effect in other states at the primary and the general election level. They could decide this is a political question, Steve - one for Congress and voters to answer, not the courts. Or they could side with Trump and dozens of other Republicans in Congress and keep Trump on the ballot. It's kind of hard to predict what the justices might do here. INSKEEP: So when do they rule, however they may rule? JOHNSON: Well, the court's been moving pretty quickly. Experts want them to issue a definitive ruling soon, before many more voters go to the polls on Super Tuesday in early March. INSKEEP: NPR's Carrie Johnson, thanks so much. JOHNSON: My pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: The United States asserts that it gained a measure of justice for an attack that killed three U.S. soldiers. INSKEEP: A U.S. airstrike in Iraq killed a leader of a militia whose group the United States blamed for an attack on an American base. This is all part of a multinational conflict. Grab your maps. The Americans were killed at a base in Jordan. The militia leader was killed in Iraq. He was part of a group that's linked to Iran, which in turn has vowed to respond to the Israel-Hamas war. Numerous armed groups have opened fire throughout the region, and the latest incident led to a dayslong U.S. response. FADEL: NPR's Jane Arraf joins us now from Baghdad to talk about all this. Hi, Jane. JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: Hi, Leila. FADEL: So what do we know about who was killed in this strike? ARRAF: Well, the militia Kataib Hezbollah has confirmed it was one of its commanders. He was called Abu Baqir Al-Saadi. And an Interior Ministry official says he was head of logistics for the Iran-backed group. The U.S., in confirming the strike, said Al-Saadi had been directly involved in attacks on U.S. forces. A bit of confusion still here because initial reports from the Interior Ministry said three people were killed, and it's still not clear whether that was the case and whether there were other militia figures. This was a targeted strike, Leila, using an adapted Hellfire missile with a nonexplosive warhead - the kind used by the U.S. for counterterrorism operations in crowded areas, which this, indeed, was. The vehicle burst into flames on impact of the airstrike. Everyone in the car was killed, but there were no other casualties reported. FADEL: So a targeted strike in Baghdad by the U.S. - pretty dramatic. What's the mood in the capital this morning? ARRAF: Yeah. Apprehension, really, and fear and waiting for what comes next. FADEL: Yeah. ARRAF: And there are really not a lot of good scenarios here. It's a workday here, so people, in fact, did go to work. Shops are opening. Seems relatively normal. But this afternoon is the funeral ceremony in Baghdad for the commander who was killed. Some of the Iran-backed groups have called for protesters to gather near the U.S. Embassy, and in the past, those gatherings have sometimes turned violent. And some members of the anti-U.S. resistance, that coalition that Kataib Hezbollah belong to, have called for new attacks against the United States. The Iraqi Hezbollah itself halted attacks in deference to the Iraqi government recently, but it could very well announce a resumption, and that would signal a new wave of attacks from both sides. FADEL: So it's possible that this escalates. I mean, let's talk about the wider repercussions, though, here. I mean, the U.S. and Iraq recently started talks on the future of American forces in that country. Does this killing impact those talks? ARRAF: I think it almost certainly does. An Iraqi military spokesman, Yehia Rasool (ph), said these latest attacks were increasing pressure on the Iraqi government to essentially expel U.S. forces. Now, this wouldn't be an overnight process. It would be the result of talks and negotiations, as the U.S. is still an essential security partner. But after withdrawing after its invasion of Iraq and the occupation, troops came back here in 2014 to fight ISIS... FADEL: Right. ARRAF: ...At the invitation of the Iraqi government. The U.S. views these recent attacks that it's launched as a response to being attacked by militias. But there's increasing anger in Parliament, in the streets, in the halls of government, even, at violations of Iraqi sovereignty. And just really quickly, 'cause this is a complicated but important part, these militias that are attacking and being attacked by the U.S. - they actually have brigades that are part of Iraqi government security forces. FADEL: NPR's Jane Arraf in Baghdad. Thank you, Jane. ARRAF: Thank you, Leila. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: Pakistanis are headed to the polls today, and it's quite an endeavor. INSKEEP: Yeah. This is one of the most populous nations on Earth, so here are some of the numbers. Tens of millions of people will be eligible to vote at more than 90,000 polling stations, guarded by more than 700,000 police officers and soldiers, who are needed because dozens of people have been killed""}]"
