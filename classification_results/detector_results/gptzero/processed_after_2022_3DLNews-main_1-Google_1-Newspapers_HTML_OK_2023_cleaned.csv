Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:07 am Edmond, Oklahoma Joel Randell’s hands move freely on soft oil-based clay, delving into its surface as if to unlock a moment in time.Oklahoma’s centennial year soon will be enriched by his artistic flair. Randell’s bust of Wilbur Joe “Bullet” Rogan will be added to the collection of five other Oklahoma baseball players’ busts at Bricktown Ballpark. The Edmond artist’s bust of Rogan also is an official state centennial project.Rogan’s likeness soon will be taken to a foundry, covered in bronze and unveiled at the Bricktown Ballpark sometime in July.“I want to capture his sense of confidence,” Randell said.He found only a few photographs to work with of the right-handed pitcher. Rogan’s bust conveys the smiling, positive attitude that Randell noticed in the black and white photos.“His head is slightly tilted up, kind of continuing on that theme of boldness and confidence,” Randell said. “He was a fantastic ball player.”Born in Oklahoma City, Rogan was a pitcher in the Negro Leagues from 1917 to 1938, according to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1998 for having won more games than any other pitcher in Negro League history.But Rogan didn’t live to accept the honor; he died 31 years earlier in Kansas City at age 73.Rogan’s facial character and charm made an interesting character study, Randell said. Folds in Rogan’s Kansas City Monarchs shirt add to the sculpture’s realistic style.“I do a lot of sculpting with tools in the eyelids,” Randell said.“It’s an intensive process, especially when you get into the eye area, because that’s really where rubber hits the road in terms of a person’s identity.”In 2002, he was commissioned to design a bronze monument to honor Tuskegee Airman Charles B. Hall at the Charles B. Hall Memorial Air Park at Tinker Air Force Base.He has nearly completed the sculpture. Randell is working on the arms of the statue while ensuring the body is anatomically correct.Beneath the clay folds are a network of copper pipes, chicken wire and foam to secure a skeletal frame. But it’s in adding of fine details that Randell said is the most fun.“I want to see a piece that really gets into those details, where you can look at the piece all over from 360 degrees,” he said.(Features Editor James Coburn may be reached via e-mail at jcoburn@edmondsun.com.)

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:18 am The Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board meets Oct. 9, 2023, at the Oklahoma History Center where it voted 3-2 to approve a contract to found the first religious charter school in the nation. Attorney General Gentner Drummond sued the board on Friday to overturn the contract. OKLAHOMA CITY — Attorney General Gentner Drummond has asked the Oklahoma Supreme Court to overturn the state’s approval of the first religious charter school in the nation. Drummond filed a lawsuit on Friday with the Court against the Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board. He urged justices to intercede as the Catholic virtual charter school prepares to open next year. The attorney general said members of the board violated their oaths to uphold the state and U.S. constitutions when they signed off on a charter contract to establish St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School. “The board members who approved this contract have violated the religious liberty of every Oklahoman by forcing us to fund the teachings of a specific religious sect with our tax dollars,” Drummond said in a statement. Board members voted 3-2 in favor of the contract during an Oct. 9 meeting. Their attorney, designated to handle media inquiries, did not return a request for comment before publication Friday. The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa have said the school, though open to students of all backgrounds and faiths, will teach and operate in accordance with Catholic doctrine. Drummond contended St. Isidore of Seville could open a floodgate of other religious groups seeking public education funds. “Because of the legal precedent created by the Board’s actions, tomorrow we may be forced to fund radical Muslim teachings like Sharia law,” he said. “In fact, Governor Stitt has already indicated that he would welcome a Muslim charter school funded by our tax dollars. That is a gross violation of our religious liberty.” Gov. Kevin Stitt has been an ardent supporter of the Catholic charter school. He called the lawsuit a “political stunt.” Stitt said Drummond’s comment on the possibility of a Muslim charter school is “discriminatory and ignorant.” “AG Drummond seems to lack any firm grasp on the constitutional principle of religious freedom and masks his disdain for the Catholics’ pursuit by obsessing over non-existent schools that don’t neatly align with his religious preference,” Stitt said in a statement. St. Isidore of Seville’s governing board hopes the lawsuit will resolve quickly so the school can focus on opening its doors, the board said in a statement shared by one of its members, Brett Farley. The Catholic school board called the lawsuit a baseless attempt to enforce religious discrimination. “Attorney General Drummond’s lawsuit employs the language of fear and discrimination, twists the law of religious liberty beyond recognition, and ignores the very real successes of faith-based schools in our country,” the board stated. “Sadly, he also attempts to pit people of different faiths against each other. Religious freedom for all is a cornerstone of our society.” Drummond’s lawsuit contends spending taxpayer dollars on a religious charter school would violate state and federal law, which prohibit public schools from promoting a particular religion. Such a violation could prompt the federal government to withhold the $1 billion it provides to Oklahoma schools, he said. St. Isidore of Seville already faces another legal challenge in Oklahoma County District Court. A group of parents, faith leaders and public education advocates filed a separate lawsuit in July against the school, the Statewide Virtual Charter School Board, the Oklahoma State Department of Education and state Superintendent Ryan Walters. Leading the case are attorneys from Americans United for Separation of Church and State, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Education Law Center and the Freedom From Religion Foundation. “We applaud Attorney General Drummond for his efforts to protect church-state separation and public education in Oklahoma,” the organizations said in a joint statement Friday. “The law is clear: Charter schools are public schools that must be secular and serve all students.” The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools also voiced its support for Drummond’s case and said it “vehemently opposes” St. Isidore of Seville’s approval.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:07 am Edmond, Oklahoma As Edmond’s Greyson Chance sang the lyrics to Lady Gaga’s “Paparazzi” on Thursday’s “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” he was actually describing what has happened to him in the past two days. Little did he know when he first sang the song at a school event that it would be a prediction of what was to come for this young man with a beautiful smile and a ton of talent. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxDlC7YV5is A line from the song, “It’s so magical, we’ll be fantastical,” pretty much says it all for 12-year-old Greyson, a sixth-grade student at Cheyenne Middle School. Earlier in the week Chance received a text message during his math class from his mother telling him the producers of “Ellen” had invited him to come on the show. “”I said, ‘No, they didn’t,’” Chance told Ellen during the broadcast that aired this morning. When he got home from school his mother told him to pack. “And here I am,” Chance said. He and his mother flew to California for the taping of the show Wednesday and arrived home at 2 a.m. Thursday morning. Chance told Ellen and the audience he has been taking piano lessons for three years but has never taken voice lessons. He sang Lady Gaga’s “Paparazzi” on the show, the same song he sang during a local performance two weeks ago. “My No. 1 inspiration is Lady Gaga,” Chance said. He said he loves her individuality and the way she can harness that. “It takes amazing talent. “It makes me want to dance, kind of like, Ellen,” he said jokingly to DeGeneres. During the interview with DeGeneres, Chance got to speak with his inspiration, “Miss Gaga,” on the telephone. “Keep following your dreams,” Lady Gaga told him. “Stay away from girls and be focused,” she instructed him. “You have already won over everyone’s hearts,” Lady Gaga said. “Don’t be nervous.

Although it was Greyson’s idea to put the video on YouTube, it was his sister, Alexa, a sophomore at Santa Fe High School, and his older brother, Tanner, a student at the University of Oklahoma, who came up with the idea to send the video to Ellen DeGeneres.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:17 am Lulu Goodfox, the 2023 Osage Nation Princess, was recognized at the Stillwater Public School Board of Education meeting Tuesday. Osage Nation Princess Lulu Goodfox was recognized at the Stillwater Public Schools Board of Education regular meeting on Tuesday. Lulu is a sophomore at Stillwater High School, and is both Osage and Pawnee. She is involved with both tribal cultures. Rusty Atkins, the district’s Indian Education Coordinator introduced Goodfox to the board, and recognized the accomplishments she has made during her tenure as Osage Nation Princess. “It’s my privilege to support and acknowledge a young lady in our school system,” Atkins said. “She’s been a part of the family for a long time, and current Osage Princess. It’s a huge honor to have her here.” Goodfox was chosen as Osage Princess in April. The Osage Nation has chosen a princess every year since 1941. “To be chosen princess is a special thing,” Atkins said. “It’s not just something that you fill out a form, and then all of a sudden you put it in and they vote on you. It’s a little more in depth.” Many things factor into the process of choosing an Osage Princess, including culture, school and community involvement. This is because the princess is a representative of the tribe. “In our Native culture, our ancestors and our elders in our tribe pay attention to what’s going on when the kids are born,” Atkins said. “The way they’re raised, the way they handle themselves in public, the way they handle themselves in the cultural activities. This is the example that they’re looking at.” Atkins said that Goodfox and her family had to put in hard work behind the scenes, which included school and cultural involvement. “She does all of it,” Atkins said. “She has good grades. She participates in school, she participates with her tribes, both of them. She is an ambassador for not only our Native people, but also for Stillwater Public Schools.” Atkins presented Goodfox with a shawl as part of her achievements in the Native American community. Goodfox then introduced herself in Osage and then addressed the administration, staff and school board, thanking them for her recognition. “This past couple of months have been super hectic and surreal for me as I have gotten to attend the New York and L.A. premieres of Killers of the Flower Moon,” Goodfox said. “I’m so grateful for how understanding and supportive the high school administration has been about my current role as ambassador of the Osage Nation. As I travel and attend different events, I represent Stillwater and Stillwater Public Schools.” Goodfox reflected on her time attending schools within the district. “I grew up here and I am a proud Skyline Cub,” she said. “And now a sophomore.” Goodfox thanked her Native American teachers who served important roles in her life and guided her along the way. “I want to thank and also recognize the Native teachers who hold a special place in my heart from my time at Skyline, with Ms. Wilson as my very first teacher in Pre-K, to now, Coach A. at the high school,” she said. “Lastly, I want to thank the Indian Education program and Coach A. for everything it provides for native students.” Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:07 am Edmond, Oklahoma Representatives from Boeing presented a check for $100,000 to support the Oklahoma Aviation Academy to the Norman Public Schools Board of Education and district. The Norman Public Schools Board of Education welcomed Boeing at its monthly meeting, which presented a check for $100,000 that will be invested in the Oklahoma Aviation Academy. Terry Adams, OAA director, said this is the second year that Boeing has sponsored the academy at that amount. The money will go toward labs, field trips, mentorships, internships, extracurriculars and other needed projects. “OAA was designed to be a hands-on immersive experience of aviation and aerospace,” Adams said. “We do that through labs [and providing] experiences in different industries that are surrounded by aviation and aerospace.” Currently, 165 students are enrolled at the academy, 50 of which, or 30%, are female. Adams said the academy takes an interest in providing instruction that highlights the accomplishments of women and people of color in aviation. This kind of instruction is intended to inspire underrepresented people in the industry to become leaders. In March, the academy invited Gigi Coleman, the niece of Bessie Coleman, the first African American and Native American woman to earn her international pilot’s license. Alex Capellupo, program director at Boeing, described her experience as a young girl who excelled in mathematics. Despite her high math scores in middle school, high school and college, she said she felt pressure to study a non-STEM field because math wasn’t feminine enough. “Would I have been a rocket scientist? A data scientist? A pilot? I’m not sure, but it is very exciting to know that OAA is offering students those opportunities and connecting them with pathways to meet industry professionals and see what life could be like if they go into the STEM fields.” In 2022, the National Center for Education Statistics released information that Oklahoma students fell 10 points below the national average. In Oklahoma, only 16% of eighth graders are proficient in math and science, compared to 26% in the country. “What really stood out to me was the focus and excitement on aerospace and aviation at this academy in STEM,” she said. “In addition, I’m impressed how Oklahoma Aviation Academy is taking a different approach to learning with their labs, field trips and partnering with experts in the industry.” She said Boeing is taking a special interest in the academy because the OAA will eventually lead its students to jobs in the aerospace industry. “I have personally never seen anything like this in the country,” she said. “That’s why Boeing is very interested in this.” Nick Migliorino, district superintendent, said he is hoping to reel in 700 students in the next four years. “Aviation is not just flying airplanes,” Migliorino said. “Every industry [that you would find in an airport] is represented, and that’s what we are so excited about, but primarily the STEM areas.” Migliorino said he expects the district to foster this relationship with Boeing for many years in the future. “At the end of the day, it’s about providing opportunities for our students, our young men and young women, who have a vision,” Migliorino said.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:07 am In this combination of photos, President Joe Biden speaks on Aug. 10, 2023, in Salt Lake City, left, and former President Donald Trump speaks on June 13, 2023, in Bedminster, N.J. (AP Photo) When Americans vote for the next president in November, they will in no small part be influenced by a barrage of major developments in 2023 that have set the stage for one of the most extraordinary races in U.S. history. With no Republican contenders having gained substantial ground against Donald Trump, the former president appears poised to win the nomination and become only the second ex-president to appear on the ballot under the same party. Most races end up as referendums on the incumbent president seeking reelection, according to Darrell West, the senior fellow of governance studies at the Brookings Institute, a center-right think tank. That’s likely to be doubly true in 2024, he argued. “It is a rare event when you basically have two incumbents on the ballot at the same time,” he said. “It’s unusual to have two people that served as president possibly facing off in the General Election, and that means it becomes a referendum not just on (Joe) Biden, but on Trump.” The impacts of inflation, abortion, border security and the wars in Ukraine and Gaza are all already having ripple effects across the campaigns of both Trump and Biden. Here’s a look at how those issues could play out for each candidate. Three-quarters of Americans say the economy is the biggest issue heading into next year’s election, according to a December poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. With unemployment rates at historic lows and inflation down substantially since its pandemic-era peak at 9.1% in June 2022, most economists agree the U.S. economy has made a surprisingly robust comeback. That’s good news for Biden — if he can sell it on the campaign trail, argued West. “He has to talk about there being a good economy, all the infrastructure investments that he is making and policies that have helped the general public,” he said. So far, Americans aren’t buying it. Nearly 70% of U.S. residents say the economy is getting worse, not better, according to a Suffolk University Sawyer Business School/USA TODAY poll from September. That’s because even with inflation cooling, prices remain much higher compared to before the pandemic and continue to pinch people’s pocketbooks, according to John Mark Hansen, chair of the political science department at the University of Chicago. “I think a big part of people’s complaints right now comes from experiencing the greatest inflation since the 1990s,” he said. “As that recedes into the past, that’s going to be good for Biden.” Trump is capitalizing on Americans’ economic dissatisfaction. At a December rally in New Hampshire, he asked supporters if they felt better off five years ago or today. “Not one thing has gotten better under crooked Joe Biden,” Trump said. Three months into the war, few Americans are happy with how Biden is handling the bloody conflict between Israel and Hamas, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll released in December. With Israelis still reeling from the Oct. 7 terrorist attack and thousands of Palestinian deaths in Gaza, voters are also sending mixed signals about how the U.S. should approach the confrontation. That divide is especially stark between younger and older voters. Those age 65 and older sympathize with Israel more than Palestinians by a nearly 6 to 1 margin, while nearly half of registered voters age 18 to 29 (46%) sympathize more with Palestinians. The poll also revealed the majority of young Americans are so repelled by Biden’s handling of Israel’s Gaza war that they are prepared to vote for the former president. Overall, Trump is winning 21% of young Americans who voted for Biden in 2020, but sympathize more with Palestinians than Israel. That means Biden will have to make a concerted effort to somehow win back support from younger voters who oppose his policy toward Israel, according to Colin Seeburger, senior advisor at the Center for American Progress Action Fund, a nonpartisan think tank advocating for progressive policies. “The humanitarian disaster that’s happening in Gaza is extremely difficult for young people to stomach,” he said. “I think that is going to necessitate the president, in his reelection effort, being especially intentional about doing outreach to young voters.” Trump suggested in a November interview that the war between Israel and Hamas will just have to “play out.” In October, he called for a reimplemented and expanded travel ban that would include Gaza and, if re-elected, said he would conduct “ideological screening” for immigrants and prevent Hamas sympathizers and Muslim extremists from entering the U.S., the Associated Press reported. Trump this year was indicted in four criminal cases totaling more than 90 felony charges. That hasn’t hurt his poll numbers in the GOP primaries. That may well change once the race enters the General Election, argued West with the Brookings Institute. Although any criminal trials are unlikely to conclude next year, the specter of Trump winning the presidency and then being convicted could be a major turnoff for some voters, he explained. “Convictions will matter a lot,” West said. “Especially with suburban voters. They’re very sensitive to issues of corruption and unethical behavior.” Trump has used his indictments to attack Biden and Democratic prosecutors, arguing they have weaponized the justice system to attack a political opponent. At the same time, House Republicans this month voted unanimously to open an impeachment inquiry into Biden related to concerns about his family’s business dealings – especially his son, Hunter Biden, who has been indicted on charges related to unpaid taxes. Unlike Trump’s convictions, the impeachment inquiry is unlikely to have any impact on how people vote unless the investigation actually turns up evidence of wrongdoing, argued Hansen with the University of Chicago. “I don’t think that’s going to sway anybody,” he said. “The people who are upset about Hunter Biden are the people who already don’t like Biden, so I don’t see it having that much effect on anything else.” Both Biden and Trump have campaign ace cards in their pocket. For the president and Democrats, abortion bans across the nation remain largely unpopular. The Ohio ballot initiative approved by voters in November that enshrined abortion access in the state’s constitution proved the issue had bipartisan support. Now, the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to take up a case that will determine future access to the widely used abortion pill, setting the stage for what could be another major blow to abortion access. That could turn some Republicans against Trump, who has touted his three Supreme Court justice appointments that led to Roe v. Wade being overturned in 2022, argued Hansen. “A lot of women aren’t very enthusiastic about (Trump),” he said. “I think the issue will probably have some considerable power still because he’s tied to it. He can’t talk about how proud he was of his three appointments to the bench and then say, well, they went too far.” On the other hand, border security and immigration have become bipartisan thorns in Biden’s side. A new Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll revealed just 38% of registered voters in December approved of Biden’s handling of immigration. That’s down from 46% who said the same in November. Republicans have hammered Biden and his administration for the besieged southern border that this month saw a record number of migrant encounters in a single day. Overall, 2023 saw the most encounters with migrants in U.S. history, with 2.4 million coming across the Mexico border. Biden has been negotiating with Republican lawmakers on immigration policy as part of the GOP deal tying border security to federal aid to Ukraine and Israel. The president will use those negotiations to attempt to gain ground with voters fed up with his immigration policies, noted West. “Biden understands it’s a liability for Democrats, and he wants to make some changes that will reduce his vulnerability on that topic … because it’s likely to be a big issue in the election,” he said.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 4:36 pm Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr., left, stands with the first-ever appointed Cherokee eelegate, Kim Teehee. TAHLEQUAH — Fueling Cherokee Nation’s call to Congress for representation is a promise dating back to 1835. A promise Cherokee Nation has been actively seeking to invoke since 2019. A new exhibit at the Cherokee National History Museum is exploring that promise and how Cherokee Nation’s treaty-mandated Delegate to U.S. Congress differs from diplomatic representatives of the past. It also sheds light on the journey to naming Cherokee Nation citizen Kim Teehee as the tribe’s Delegate to Congress in 2019 and her reappointment this year. Visitors will discover the complex story behind this iconic promise to Cherokee Nation and how the tribe has navigated US policy, including removal and allotment, to reclaim it in the 21st century. “This is about deepening our understanding, collectively, of a significant right and the modern- day assertion of that right,” said Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. “We encourage visitors to focus on the simplicity of Article 7 in the Treaty of New Echota because the understanding is inescapable. This is an obligation exclusively between Cherokee Nation and the United States of America, which we are bound by treaty to uphold, together, in our relationship as equal partners. The Cherokee Nation is a Nation that honors its promises, and we remain hopeful the United States will do the same.” The Congressional delegate post is afforded by two treaties between Cherokee Nation and the federal government and affirmed by a third. As the first-ever appointed Cherokee Delegate, Kim Teehee has helped champion the tribe’s efforts to enact the seat. Her career spans work under Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Wilma Mankiller to work in the White House under US President Barack Obama to directing government relations for both Cherokee Nation and Cherokee Nation Businesses. “You can’t tell the story of Cherokee Nation without the story of the Treaty of New Echota and the promise the US Government made to seat a Cherokee Nation Delegate in Congress,” said Cherokee Nation Delegate Kim Teehee. “This new exhibit will offer visitors an unprecedented opportunity to learn more about the work our tribe has done to hold the United States accountable and assert our treaty-bound right to a Delegate in Congress.” The exhibit includes items belonging to Teehee that are representative of her career and personal connection to Washington, D.C., as well as artwork from the Cherokee National Collection depicting past moments in Cherokee history of government-to-government relations. “Cherokee Delegate: An Unalterable Promise” is on display at the Cherokee National History Museum through June 1, 2024. It is located at 101 S. Muskogee Avenue and is open Tuesday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Admission is free. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.

In a stunning move, Fox News announced Monday that the network and Tucker Carlson “have agreed to part ways.” The statement said, ""We thank him for his service to the network as a host and prior to that as a contributor.” It’s about time. Carlson has been spreading lies and disinformation on Fox News for years, much to the delight of viewers who would rather have their beliefs confirmed than be presented with the truth. But that’s nothing new. So why him, why now? More cable news departures: CNN fires Don Lemon via his agent. \'I am stunned,\' he tweets There are probably about 787 million reasons, though even those don’t explain everything. The move comes days after Fox News agreed to an 11th-hour settlement with Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million in a defamation case soon after the jury had been seated. It’s not surprising that someone had to go after such an embarrassing blow was struck against the network’s reputation, such as it was. But it is surprising it’s Carlson. He’s the most popular host on the network — only the lunatic circus that is “The Five” gets better ratings, and not by much. Trump indictment: Fox News can\'t decide if it\'s \'history\' or \'BS\' Although Carlson was front and center in the Dominion case, when we learned that he, along with Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, continued to amplify and even push the lies about Donald Trump’s claims that the 2020 election was rigged against him, allowing Joe Biden to win. They did this even though they didn’t believe it. When Fox News called Arizona for Biden before anyone else, it enraged Trump and his supporters. When that translated to a dip in ratings, as well as a bump for even more right-wing networks like One America News Network and Newsmax, panic set in at Fox News. When a Fox News reporter dared fact-check Trump’s lies, Carlson went so far as to text Hannity and Ingraham, “Please get her fired.” A class act all the way around. At CNN: Why the Fox News reaction to its Dominion settlement made Jake Tapper laugh out loud Carlson wasn’t always this way. He morphed from a writer to an awkward, but not irresponsible, TV personality, on CNN and MSNBC. He joined Fox News in 2009, and in 2016 his show, “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” moved into the slot formerly occupied by Bill O’Reilly’s show. The popular O’Reilly was forced out after a series of sexual harassment allegations against him were disclosed. Carlson’s popularity grew the snottier he became on air — and the more irresponsible. He falsely claimed that George Floyd died of a drug overdose after autopsies ruled Floyd’s death a homicide. He said there was “meaningful voter fraud” in Georgia during the 2020 election. Here’s an oldie but a goodie — when he said that maybe the COVID-19 vaccine “doesn’t work, and they’re simply not telling you that.” What a guy. Not good: Why the \'60 Minutes\' interview of Marjorie Taylor Greene was a dangerous waste of air time What’s odd is that, while he pushed false claims that he didn’t even believe, he was neither alone nor the worst Fox News host when it came to spreading lies — Maria Bartiromo, take a bow. But if the network wanted to do something to prove it was making an effort to be more responsible, kicking Carlson to the curb was a good start. You wonder what will happen to his millions of fans, who treat every word he utters as gospel. Perhaps OAN or Newsmax? I just don’t see that happening. An educated guess is that he, like Glenn Beck, will create his own company where he can spout whatever lies he pleases, to the delight of those willing to pay to hear them and the cold shoulder from everyone else. It’ll be a lot easier to ignore him there, in other words. Carlson\'s last show was Friday. ""Fox News Tonight"" will air in his time slot Monday. What happens with the time slot long-term is one question about the network, but only one.

Low 73F. Winds SSE at 10 to 20 mph.. Mostly clear. Low 73F. Winds SSE at 10 to 20 mph. Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 4:17 pm A number of Republicans in the state Legislature might not like it, but Sen. Carri Hicks’ proposal to require all passengers riding in motor vehicles to wear seat belts needs serious consideration. Not only will it save lives, it’ll save money. Hicks knows support will hard to come by, but as she points out, Oklahoma has the highest accident fatality rate in the country. That related to the state’s lax seat belt laws – including one that removed the requirement that children be buckled up in the backseat. Oklahoma law requires all front-seat occupants to be buckled up, but it’s optional for backseat passengers eight and older. Senate Bill 106 would require all passengers to wear seat belts, and S.B. 164 would require all children, including those 8 and older, be buckled up. What is so problematic about these measures? Do people really value their “freedumbs” so much more than the lives of their children? Seat belts save lives; the evidence is incontrovertible, no more controversial than the fact that smoking cigarettes causes cancer, emphysema and other lung ailments. Oklahoma is the only state that doesn’t require all children to be buckled up while riding in the back seat. Coincidentally, Oklahoma also has some of the highest automobile insurance rates in the country. Anyone who says otherwise is an outrageous liar, and probably doesn’t have insurance. Hopefully those who raise Cain the most about it will fall under the radar of local cops and troopers who know what happens when two vehicles collide, or a texting driver veers off the road and strikes a tree. With no seat belts in use, the chances of a fatality or serious injury are extremely high. State Rep. Ross Ford, R-Broken Arrow, has tried similar measures, but all have failed. He had this to say: “Republicans believe that it is a government overreach to require kids to be buckled up.” What he means is, many of the crackpot Republicans who have managed to get elected to office think it’s government overreach. Polled about matters such as this one, Republicans in the general population don’t have much more of a problem with seat belts than their “woke” Democratic counterparts. It’s ironic they keep electing whackadoodles who don’t serve their interests. Almost everyone grumbles about the escalating costs of insurance, but the companies that sell it will frankly explain they are spreading the pain, and that careless drivers – and those who refuse to wear seat belts – are part of the equation. It doesn’t have to be that way. Parents should set a good example for their children by wearing seat belts, and by making the kids wear them from day one – and on up until they leave the nest. Good habits do tend to stick, and this habit is a good one to get into. Hicks deserves support for her legislation from anyone who uses common sense.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:28 am A version of gingerbread with historical roots Gingerbread is a popular sweet that often finds its way onto holiday dessert tables. Some people bake and construct lavish gingerbread houses, while others make cut-outs of gingerbread people to turn into cookies. Legend suggests that gingerbread originally landed in Europe in 992 with an Armenian monk named Gregory of Nicopolis, who brought a honey-and-spice cake to other monks in France, where it quickly became a favorite and was considered a ""food from heaven."" Historians are not really sure if the original gingerbread had any ginger in it at all. In fact, typical medieval recipes for gingerbread include no ginger and the French would later refer to it as ""pain d\'epices,"" or spiced bread. Gingerbread once was a treat only for the elite, but as the masses discovered it, recipes evolved to include soft cakes to hard biscuits and everything in between. The following recipe for medieval ""Gingerbread"" produces a chewy, almost candy-like texture with potent ginger flavor. Try it for holiday gatherings, courtesy of ""Tasting History"" (Simon Element) by Max Miller. Gingerbread Makes 20 to 25 1-inch pieces 12 to 14 slices (238 g) stale white bread 1 cup (330 g) honey 1 tablespoon ground ginger 3/4 teaspoon ground long pepper (a spice similar to black pepper but with more heat that typically must be ordered online) 1/2 teaspoon sandalwood powder, if desired, for color (one drop of red food dye can be used instead) 1/2 cup (50 g) or less sugar (enough for sprinkling) 20 to 25 whole cloves Gold leaf 1. Either with a food processor or by hand, grind the bread into coarse bread crumbs. Commercially bought bread crumbs will work as well, though the texture from homemade bread crumbs is preferable. 2. Pour the honey into a large saucepan set over medium heat, and heat to a rolling boil; the honey will become like syrup. Note that it will boil up quite a bit, so do not use a small saucepan. Slowly add the bread crumbs to the honey while stirring. The mixture should come together and begin to pull away from the sides of the saucepan. Continue to mix until fully combined. Remove the pan from the heat and quickly stir in the ginger, long pepper and sandalwood, if desired. Turn the mixture out onto a sheet of parchment and spread with a spatula. Then, place another sheet of parchment and, with a rolling pin, roll the gingerbread out to about 1/2-inch thick (1.2 cm). Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator until stiff, about 2 hours. 3. Once the gingerbread is cool, sprinkle sugar on top and cut into 1-inch squares or whatever shape you like. Keep in mind that each piece should be bite size, as they are very strong. They will also be quite sticky, so handle them as little as possible. Insert a whole clove into each piece of gingerbread and fleck with gold leaf. Leave the clove in until serving, then remove it just before eating.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 4:19 pm A piece of Woodward’s history burned to the ground Thursday morning. The old States Hotel/Collins Clinic on 10th and Main was destroyed by the fire broke out 6:45 a.m. on Thursday, according to people working in the area at the time and called 9-1-1. There was a fire on the second floor of the same building late Wednesday night that firefighters put out and were on the scene for a while afterwards. For some reason, the fire reignited Thursday. Cause of the fire was not immediately available. Fire Chief Mike Wickware said the cause of both fires is under investigation. When fire units on scene Thursday the building was fully engulfed and as the morning went on, the fire continued to spread. Firefighters were able to keep the fire contained primarily to the one building, said City Manger Shaun Barnett, who was on the scene along with some other officials. He noted there could be some smoke or water damage to adjoining buildings. Fire units from Mooreland, Sharon and Fargo also responded to assist with the blaze. During the course of fighting the fire, Firefighter First Class Austin Flynt sustained minor injuries due to a structural collapse and was transported to AllianceHealth Woodward for treatment, Wickware said. Flynt was later released from the hospital. “Our thoughts ar with our injured firefighter Flynt and his family and we wish him a speedy and full recovery,” Wickware said. Several businesses were closed due to smoke or in some cases lack of power. Main Street was blocked off from 9th to 11th Streets and from Texas to Kansas avenues. A part of Texas Avenue was also blocked off for debris cleanup. Crews were still pouring water on the building into the afternoon and were expected to be at the scene all day and into the night. Barnett said a big concern would be bringing down what’s left of the building in a safe manner. Wickware said in his news release, “The City of Woodward expresses its gratitude to the brave men and women who responded to this emergency and worked tirelessly to contain and extinguish the fire, as well as the City of Woodward street, maintenance and water departments. “We ask that the public respect the area surrounding the structure and avoid any unnecessary travel in the vicinity. We also request that anyone with any information regarding the cause of the fire contact the Woodward Fire Marshal’ Office at 508-254-8538.” The building, which was currently occupied by Anchor Uniform Services, a uniform rental and service company that also sold clothing, has a long history in Woodward. Local historian Robin Hohweiler emailed The News and noted the building was built in 1904 by Billy Bolton, a rather famous newspaper person. It was originally a two-story structure that housed a post office and hotel. In a 2007 story, The News spoke with then Plains Indians and Pioneers Museum Curator Ian Swart who said, “after Bolton’s death his wife used the building for a cafe and rooming house.” By 1925, the building was known as the Ideal Hotel and new brick walls went up as well as a third floor. It eventually became the States Hotel, named for having 48 rooms. The hotel, widely known as a brothel, closed in 1983. Later, the building became home to the Collins Chiropractic Clinic.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:05 am This year, about $1.5 billion has landed in state and local government coffers from court settlements made with more than a dozen companies that manufactured, sold, or distributed prescription painkillers and were sued for their role in fueling the opioid crisis. That money has gone from an emerging funding stream for which people had lofty but uncertain aspirations to a coveted pot of billions of dollars being invested in real time to address addiction. Altogether, the companies are expected to pay more than $50 billion to state and local governments over nearly two decades. Meanwhile, more than 100,000 Americans have died of drug overdoses annually in recent years, underscoring the urgent nature of the crisis. KFF Health News has been tracking the funds all year and covering the windfall’s mixed impact in communities across the country. Here are five things we’ve noticed in 2023 and plan to keep an eye on next year: 1. The total amount of settlement money state and local governments expect to receive is a moving target. Before the start of the year, national settlements were in place with at least five companies, and several other deals were in the final stages, said Christine Minhee, founder of OpioidSettlementTracker.com. Today, most states are participating in settlements with opioid manufacturers Johnson & Johnson, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, and Allergan; pharmaceutical distributors AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, and McKesson; and retail pharmacies Walmart, Walgreens, and CVS. Many are also settling with the national supermarket chain Kroger. Several of these deals began paying out in the second half of this year, leading to bumps in states’ opioid settlement pots. But there have been dents and slowdowns too. Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, a manufacturer of generic opioids, originally agreed to pay $1.7 billion as a result of its 2020 bankruptcy filing to state and local governments, as well as people directly affected by the crisis. But the company filed a second bankruptcy in August, slashing $1 billion from that figure. Purdue Pharma, perhaps the best known of all the companies for its creation and marketing of OxyContin, had agreed to pay $6 billion as part of its bankruptcy proceedings. But the Biden administration objected to the deal this summer, and the case now lies in the hands of the Supreme Court. At its core is the question of whether it’s legal for the Sackler family to gain immunity from future civil cases about the opioid crisis under the company’s bankruptcy deal when they have not filed for bankruptcy as individuals. The Supreme Court heard arguments in December and is expected to rule on the case next spring or summer. Until then, no Purdue money will flow. 2. Most states still aren’t being transparent about how the money is used. In March, KFF Health News and Minhee published a comprehensive investigation showing that only 12 states had promised to publicly report how they were using all their settlement dollars. Since then, that number has inched up to 16. But 15 states still have not committed to publicly reporting anything at all, and others have promised to publicize only a portion of their spending. Many people aren’t happy about the secrecy. In Ohio, a local advocacy group, Harm Reduction Ohio, sued the OneOhio Recovery Foundation, which controls most of the state’s settlement dollars, for violating public records and open-meeting laws. Although a judge ruled in favor of the advocacy group, it became a moot point in July, when the state passed a budget that included language exempting the foundation from such requirements. In Michigan, the Department of Health and Human Services came under fire for not publicly reporting how it was spending upward of $40 million in settlement funds. In October — just hours before a legislative subcommittee hearing in which lawmakers asked critical questions about the money — the department launched a website, displaying a breakdown of organizations to which it had awarded funds. At the national level, a dozen Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about a lack of transparency and oversight via a Sept. 25 letter to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which is leading the federal government’s response to the opioid crisis. “We urge the Biden administration to closely track opioid settlement fund spending, to ensure that populations in need of additional support receive it,” the lawmakers wrote. The Office of National Drug Control Policy responded this month that it did not have the statutory authority from Congress to do so. “Currently, no mechanism exists that would allow ONDCP to require states to disclose their spending,” the office wrote in a letter obtained by KFF Health News. “ONDCP cannot effectively monitor how states use these funds.” 3. Nationwide, money is being spent in several common areas. Although there is no national data on how settlement dollars are spent, piecemeal tracking by journalists and advocates has surfaced some favorites. One of the biggest is investing in treatment. Many jurisdictions are building residential rehab facilities or expanding existing ones. They’re covering the cost of care for uninsured people and trying to increase the number of clinicians prescribing medications for opioid use disorder, which have been shown to save lives. Another common expense is naloxone, a medication that reverses opioid overdoses. Wisconsin is spending about $8 million on this effort. Kentucky has dedicated $1 million. And many local governments are allocating smaller amounts. Some other choices have sparked controversies. Several governments used settlement dollars to purchase police patrol cars, technology to help officers hack into phones, and body scanners for jails. Supporters say these tools are critical to crack down on drug trafficking, but research suggests law enforcement efforts don’t prevent overdoses. People are also divided over school-based programs to prevent kids from developing addictions. While they agree on the goal, some people favor programs that teach kids about the dangers of drugs — like D.A.R.E. in the ’80s — while others prefer programs focused on improving mental health, resiliency, and communication skills. Perhaps the most contentious use, though, is shoring up county budgets and paying back old bills. Even if it’s legal, many people directly affected by the epidemic say this misses the goal of the settlement money, which is to address today’s ongoing crisis. 4. The settlements required companies to change problematic business practices, but that has had unintended consequences. As part of their settlements, manufacturers like Allergan and Johnson & Johnson agreed not to sell opioids for 10 years and curb marketing and promotion activities. Pharmaceutical distributors were required to step up efforts to identify suspicious orders from pharmacies, under the oversight of an independent third-party monitor. Retail pharmacy chains must conduct audits and site visits to their pharmacies, as well as share data with state agencies about problematic prescribers. The goal of these stipulations is to prevent further misuse of prescription opioids. But some people see unintended consequences. Distributors have placed stricter limits not only on pharmacy orders of opioids, but on many drugs considered potentially addictive, known as “controlled substances.” As a result, orders for these medications are being canceled more often and some pharmacies are hesitant to fill prescriptions for new patients. That has left people struggling to obtain medications for chronic pain, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder — and, ironically, even medication that treats opioid addiction. Bayla Ostrach, a researcher in North Carolina who studies substance use and health policy, said buprenorphine, which is considered a gold-standard treatment for opioid use disorder, was already difficult to obtain at many community pharmacies and in rural areas. But the settlements appear to be making it worse. Instead of increasing access to treatment — which is critical to stemming the number of overdoses — “I really worry the settlements may be having the opposite effect,” Ostrach said. 5. Many places haven’t decided what to do with the money yet. Several states, including Montana and Hawaii, have yet to spend any of the settlement funds controlled by their state agencies. In Maine and West Virginia, councils overseeing the lion’s share of funds are still in the process of identifying priorities and developing processes to award grants. Across the nation, some county officials say they need more guidance on appropriate uses of the money. Others are surveying residents on what they want before making decisions. The slow pace has frustrated some advocates, who say there should be greater urgency at a time when the drug supply is becoming increasingly deadly. But others say the money will continue arriving through 2038, so setting up thoughtful processes now could pay off for years to come. It’s a trade-off between putting out current fires and preventing future ones, said Shelly Weizman, project director of the addiction and public policy initiative at Georgetown University’s O’Neill Institute. She’s hopeful officials will strike'}]"

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 4:23 pm TAHLEQUAH — Cherokee Nation is beginning work to enhance the community and visitor experience downtown on the grounds of the Cherokee National Capitol Square. As part of the improvements, the tribe is seeking proposals for a long-term art installation that interprets the Cherokee Removal story, commonly known as the Trail of Tears. The outdoor, public art installation will be located just south of the Cherokee National History Museum. “Telling our own historical narrative is the best way to ensure it is shared authentically with the world, and at Cherokee Nation we continue to do that very well,” said Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. “Just as our people’s story lives far beyond the history books, our culture and art should extend beyond the walls of our museums. Along with First Lady January Hoskin, I’m excited to see what our talented artists envision for this public space and look forward to enjoying the enhancement of our iconic Capitol Square, just as we’ve enjoyed the popular cultural art pathway in downtown Tahlequah.” Additional improvements are also in development, including a 32-foot diameter reflecting pool and extensive new landscaping features. Those looking to submit proposals must be Cherokee Nation citizens who can provide identification as such, or artists previously designated as Cherokee National Treasures. A mandatory pre-bid meeting is slated for March 9 at 10 a.m., when those interested in the project will meet onsite with the development team to learn more about the project and its mission. The deadline to submit proposals is 4:00 p.m. on April 20. Project proposals should include conceptual renderings, narrative of theming and interpretation, proposed schedule with key milestones, and estimated costs. Proposals from teams are accepted with some stipulations. The project is being managed by Cherokee Nation Businesses.

Chance of rain 70%. Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:21 am Drivers make their way along North Lincoln Boulevard near East Eubanks Street in Oklahoma City. (Mindy Ragan Wood / Oklahoma Voice) OKLAHOMA CITY — A state transportation study is examining whether Oklahoma drivers should be taxed per mile instead of at the gas pump. Oklahoma Department of Transportation is conducting the Fair Miles Oklahoma pilot project as a pay-per-mile alternative to the existing 20-cent tax that is added on to each gallon of fuel. The study was authorized in 2021 by the state Legislature and must be completed no later than Dec. 31, according to House Bill 1712. ODOT spokesperson Bryce Boyer said as cars become more fuel efficient and more drivers choose electric vehicles, the gas tax revenue used to repair roads and bridges declines. The study will develop a per-mile rate to match the current gas tax rate for a possible replacement model. The study’s cost is estimated at $3.9 million. ODOT will pay $1.9 million and the remaining $1.9 million will be paid using a federal alternative transportation grant. Findings of the study could lead to a per-mile charge or “other options,” Boyer said. “The program is designed to be fair and equitable, ensuring all drivers in the state pay for using roads,” he said. The study includes vehicles of varying fuel efficiency levels, from older cars with 8 mpg to electric and hybrid fuel cars with more than 40 mpg, Boyer said. More than 440 Oklahoma drivers across 63 counties have volunteered since June to report their mileage to the agency. The drivers receive a mock invoice with a simulated charge for the miles driven and provide feedback to ODOT. Drivers do not owe any money during the study. Volunteers report mileage through a variety of methods, including submitted photographs of the odometer via an app, an automatic-reporting device attached to the vehicle or internal vehicle technology similar to OnStar. “These options allow us to accept more vehicle types and allow participants to choose which option works best for them,” Boyer said. Other options to recoup fuel tax revenue would be up to the Legislature to consider, Boyer said. He also said the study is only evaluating the gas tax and is not examining vehicle registration increases. Some states have imposed higher registration fees for electric vehicles to recoup lost gas tax revenue, according to a report by CNET. Oklahoma’s gas and diesel tax rate is among the lowest in the nation, with only four other states reporting below 20 cents. The top three states with the highest gas tax rates are California at 62.9 cents; Pennsylvania, 57.6 cents; and Washington, 49.4. ODOT officials said 19 other states are conducting similar studies and some are implementing pay per-mile programs.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:07 am Just under three weeks before their teams are set to face off, the two Alamo Bowl head coaches were in San Antonio for a joint press conference. A lot has changed about head coach Brent Venables’ program since the last time he held a press conference. On Thursday, he was asked about some of the Sooners’ rumored player movements. The Sooners face the Wildcats in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 28 at 8:15 p.m. Here’s a few key takeaways from the Alamo Bowl head coaches’ press conference: 1. Venables not commenting about Stutsman, Gabriel’s availability — On Wednesday night it was first reported by Sooner Scoop that Danny Stutsman plans to enter the NFL Draft early. Stutsman has not made a public comment about his future plans. When asked about the reports that Stutsman is headed to the NFL, Venables said he didn’t want to comment until Stutsman had announced his decision. “Everything has its time,” Venables said. “Whenever Danny is prepared to let everybody know what his future is going to look like, out of respect for him, I’ll reserve comment for that moment in time.” Stutsman was an All-Big 12 First Team selection after leading the Sooners in tackles this season. If Stutsman does declare for the draft, it becomes much more likely that he’s already played his final game as a Sooner. Starting quarterback Dillon Gabriel is expected to enter the transfer portal. Still, Venables said Gabriel’s status on Dec. 28 is “not finalized yet.” “We wouldn’t have put ourselves in this position and had the kind of success we did, certainly the turnaround we did from year one to year two, without Dillon, his leadership, his commitment,” Venables said on Thursday. Still, it’s rare for a player to continue to play for a team after they’ve announced their intentions to transfer, especially when the team isn’t competing for a championship. It seems likely that the Alamo Bowl will be the first opportunity for freshman Jackson Arnold to get his debut start. 2. Gabriel’s departure: Venables was asked whether Gabriel’s decision was planned before the season as a way to pass the torch to Arnold. “The only thing I would say, it didn’t have anything to do with Jackson,” he said. “I think Dillon had every intention to go to the NFL. In his mind, this was going to be his last season.” Venables added that Gabriel “knows he was more than welcome” to stay at the school and continue to compete. 3. Venables not dwelling on bowl season opt-outs: Last season, Venables spoke out about the recent trend of players opting to skip playing in bowl games. “I’m not a big fan of it for a lot of reasons,” Venables said in November 2022. “First and foremost, it’s being committed to something and finishing what you started. At some point in time, that’s gotta mean something. Relationships, being thankful for your opportunity.” Venables took a much softer stance on the topic during the Alamo Bowl press conference. Instead of focusing on the loyalty aspect of players leaving, he emphasized the opportunity it creates for the younger players on the team. The team has not yet released a list of players that will not be participating in the bowl game. “This is college football. You can’t keep guys forever,” he said on Thursday. “Sometimes people on the outside look at change as a bad thing. I look at it just as opportunity. I think we’ve talked about since the Big 12 Media Day back in August, we’ve promoted the competitive depth that we have, that we’ve improved from where we were again a year ago at this time.” Tarik Masri is the sports editor for The Transcript covering OU athletics and area sports.

To honor longtime community activist Lou Hall, who passed away April 3 at the age of 86, a food drive in her memory was organized at Pauls Valley Elementary School. Young students went to work collecting mostly cans of food to donate to the Samaritans of Pauls Valley food pantry, which Hall not only helped to establish back in the late 1970s but worked as an ultra active volunteer even in recent times. Janie Jones, who works in the school's library, knows all about Hall's influence as her own kids back when they were younger students were involved in the food drives organized by Hall. “Lou has always been a special person to the schools,” Jones said. “She's always been the one who started food drives. “We're doing this in memory of her. She has always been a champion of causes for the community. “The Samaritans were close to her heart, along with picking up litter and Earth Day. She was a great lady.” Even Wesley Walker of the Samaritans pantry had Lou Hall on his mind when picking up the food collected in the elementary school drive held in her honor. “I'm here because of Lou,” Walker said. Jones said the school had been considering the idea of holding more food drives anyway. After Hall's passing this one drive came together pretty quick. “We were talking about expanding our food drive from just having one in the fall. I wanted to do something on a local level,” she said. This drive is not only meant to honor Lou Hall but also the Regional Food Bank, which supplies food to the local food pantry and the school itself. Jones knows that all too well since she's right in the middle of the work to help get food to students for weekends. “We have 78 students in the building and their families served through the Regional Food Bank,” Jones said. “I'll sack up the food they donate and send it home with the students for the weekends. It helps to make sure they have enough to eat even when they're not in school. “These kids and hopefully their families can benefit by going to the Samaritans. There's a great need for this.” She believes there are around 1,400 families in Garvin County being served by the Samaritans food pantry here in Pauls Valley.

Laura Dumin, English professor at the University of Central Oklahoma, addressed AI in the classroom at an Aug. 8 workshop from OU’s Center for Faculty Excellence. “I got my very first paper that I knew was written by AI as a final from a student that I had not heard much from that semester, who suddenly turned in this really beautiful piece.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:11 am Friday night will be Military Appreciation Night at what promises to be an important game for the Claremore High School Zebras as they go for a 6-0 winning streak. The Zebras face off long time rivals, the Pryor Tigers, at Lantow Stadium. Two members of the Claremore football team will be among those recognized for their military service during the evening's events. Elijah Webster and Trevor Panther both ended their junior year at Claremore High School successfully in May of this year. Four days later they managed to take steps that will change their lives forever. They headed to Ft Jackson, South Carolina, where they underwent 10 weeks of intensive basic training. They have embraced what the Army promises in promotional literature, “… trainees will be well versed in the seven Army Values of Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity and Personal Courage.” These two soldiers have completed the first half of basic training and will complete Advanced Individual Training (AIT) on their return to to the Army in either Mississippi or Missouri within eight days of high school graduation. They have signed up to work in the National Guard, one weekend a month and two weeks a summer, for a total of eight years. The final two years are inactive. “We will continue our training as interior electricians through our AIT weeks,” Webster said, admitting, “Training was more than we had considered it would be, but we both made it through and that was not the easiest. Now we have the rest of it to make.” “We know and understand that we may not be assigned together through this, but we will both be in the local National Guard, so when we get done with the education we should come back and continue our lives,” Panther said. Webster is the son of Justin and Stanley Pratt, and Panther is the son of Kernessa Panther. “In December of 2024 we will be deployed to Africa, and be attached to infantry units,” Webster added, saying, “That is, if everything goes to plan, and we don’t wind up somewhere else in the world that has a problem we don’t know about yet.” Both high school seniors try to look at the impact of their decision realistically, but at the same time their voices reveal excitement as they look forward to working their plan. “We have the one weekend a month that we are having to mark out on our calendars beginning now,” Webster said. “We may not be used to it, but this will keep us on the path to our new way of life that we signed up for; six years of our life to be poured into them. This began seriously and we will continue it seriously,” Webster said. On the day of this interview, both CHS seniors had just finished another daily football practice. That in itself can be tough.

Following a pre-sentencing investigation, Presiding Comanche County District Judge Emmit Tayloe sentenced Coyante Jacoy Williams to serve a life sentence for the murder count and another 385 days for a count of assault and battery with a deadly weapon, records indicate. Due to the violent nature of the crime, Williams will have to serve at least 85 percent of his sentence before being considered for parole.

During his testimony from the witness stand, Williams claimed he shot Porter in self-defense during a drug deal gone wrong. Williams had been free on $75,000 bond since his initial court appearance in November 2021, but he was recommitted by his bondsman in September 20202.
