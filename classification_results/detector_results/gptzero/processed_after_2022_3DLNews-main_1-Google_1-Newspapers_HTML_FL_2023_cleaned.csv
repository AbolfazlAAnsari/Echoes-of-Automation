The letter alleges that the states disproportionately underfunded Florida A&M University nearly $2 billion compared to University of Florida, which is the second largest funding disparity among all land-grant universities. In the letter U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Thomas Vilsack addressed the major underinvestment. “Unacceptable funding inequities have forced many of our nation’s distinguished historically Black colleges and universities to operate with inadequate resources and delay critical investments in everything from campus infrastructure to research and development to student support services,” Cardona wrote. “To compete in the 21st century we need state leaders to step up and live up to their legally required obligations to our historically Black land-grant institutions.” The initial Morrill Act of 1862 did not include HBCUs. However, in 1890, the Second Morill Act was established. The act specified that states must ensure race would not be a factor in admission requirements or states must create separate land-grant institutions for Black students, which resulted in the establishment of several HBCUs, including FAMU, Tennessee State University, and South Carolina State University to name a few. The act solidified funding instead of land for these Black land-grant universities. In Florida specifically, there are only two land-grant institutions – FAMU and its predominately white counterpart, University of Florida. According to a 2022 investigation by Forbes, FAMU’s $123 million in state appropriation in 2020 amounted to $13,000 per student compared with UF’s $15,600 per student. On average, FAMU enrolls nearly 10,000 students, while UF’s enrollment is closer to 35,000 students. Therefore, the $2,600 difference equates to nearly $65 million. Critics believe that the disparity is heavily due to UF having more agricultural research and advanced facilities. However, because UF received the correct allocation of funding, the university is able to improve facilities and launch several research projects. Kennedy Parks, a fourth-year agricultural business student minoring in public administration, said, “In the United States, Blacks make up 5.3% of the agricultural industry, and that margin is significantly lower for Black women.” “I feel if we were given the same opportunity as my counterparts at the University of Florida, we would have more experience with hands-on research and secure better job opportunities in the field of agriculture,” Parks added. With an unrelated lawsuit pending in U.S. District Court on the same issue of underfunding for FAMU compared to other Florida universities, the letter filed by the Biden administration shined light on the allegation of unequal funding for land-grant HBCUs.'}]"

Libya is struggling to deal with the thousands of bodies being recovered in the aftermath of devastating floods. Overwhelmed officials have registered nearly 4,000 – a number that is expected to rise as more bodies are found. Corpses are washing up on the coast after being swept out to sea when torrential rains caused two dams to burst, causing flash floods that destroyed large parts of the city of Derna. The World Health Organization has urged Libyan authorities to stop burying victims in mass graves, to avert future legal and emotional problems. Meanwhile, the Red Cross is warning that the floods may have uprooted landmines and explosives left over from the country’s years of conflict. Despite the many dangers, helpers are scouring the wreckage, in the video published on Sep 16, 2023, by DW News, as “Why the floods in Libya were so destructive and deadly | DW News“, below: Days after tsunami-like flooding, aid agencies are warning of an impending health crisis, with waterborne diseases increasingly becoming a threat. Emergency teams in the eastern city of Derna are intensifying their search for bodies. Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford reports, in the video published on Sep 15, 2023, by Al Jazeera English, as “Libya flooding: Authorities warn of impending health crisis“, below: International aid efforts intensify as death toll in flooded Libya soars to over 11,000 killed. The heavy rains burst two upstream dams late Sunday, September 10, 2023, and has left apocalyptic scenes in the city of Derna. Isolated Morocco earthquake survivors feel forgotten by state as they await help and Nigeria power grid collapse causes nationwide blackouts, in the video published on Sep 14, 2023, by FRANCE 24 English, as “Libya floods kill over 11,300 as city of Derna is swept away. FRANCE24 English“, below: There are fears that as many as 20,000 people may have died in the flooding that’s devastated northern Libya after dams burst during storms. The coastal city of Derna suffered the worst of the disaster. There have been desperate calls for more humanitarian support as victims lie wrapped in body bags and others have been buried in mass graves. Many people were washed out to sea when the floods struck. Rescue teams have been digging through the rubble of collapsed buildings in the hope of finding survivors. At least 30,000 people are said to be homeless. Sophie Raworth presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Quentin Sommerville and Frank Gardner.in the video published on Sep 13, 2023, by BBC News, as “Libya floods: fears that 20,000 have died – BBC News“, below: We get an update from Libya, where at least 6,000 are feared dead after a catastrophic cyclone hit the eastern city of Derna, causing two dams to burst and flooding whole sections of the city. Storm victims are being buried in mass graves as hope is dwindling for those who have been unable to locate friends and family members. Libya’s infrastructure has crumbled over years of civil war, NATO intervention and political instability; Derna’s dams have not been maintained since 2002. Ahead of the storm, the government did not declare an emergency or carry out evacuations. “It’s obviously our government’s fault,” says Libyan youth climate activist Nissa Bek in Tripoli. She notes Libya’s lack of investment in risk mitigation or climate adaptation means the scale of the disaster was not a surprise. “I’m hoping that this tragedy could be the turning point for all of this, and for them to actually take the climate crisis more seriously,” adds Bek, in the video published on Sep 13, 2023, by Democracy Now!, as “Death Toll from Libyan Floods Tops 6,000 in Latest Climate Disaster“, below: Scenes of devastation have emerged out of Libya following catastrophic flooding in the eastern part of the country. More than 5,000 people were feared dead, with about 10,000 more reported missing after massive floods swept away entire neighbourhoods. Authorities warn the death toll could climb further as recovery efforts get under way, in the video published on Sep 13, 2023, by South China Morning Post, as “10,000 missing after catastrophic Libya floods“, below: A state of emergency in Eastern Libya. Widespread floods have killed thousands of people and left thousands more unaccounted for. Entire neighbourhoods are under water and trapped families desperately need help. But Libya’s political divisions appear to be getting in the way. The country’s two rival governments have their own resources and their own approach to this disaster. Without a united response rescue operations have inevitably been delayed. So how will Libya manage this devastation? And can this crisis be a catalyst for political unity – or will it fuel rivalry? Presenter: Mohammed Jamjoom Guests Salah ElBakkoush, political analyst and former senior adviser to both the negotiating team in the high council of states, and the Libyan Government of National Accord. Anas El Gomati, founder and director of Sadeq Institute, the first public policy think tank in Libya, in the video published on Sep 12, 2023, by Al Jazeera English, as “How will Libya deal with the aftermath of the floods?| Inside Story“, below: To find out more about the Storm Daniel mentioned in the video above, from excerpt from wikipedia, in italics, below: Storm Daniel, also known as Cyclone Daniel, was the deadliest and costliest Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone ever recorded as well as the deadliest cyclone worldwide since Cyclone Nargis in 2008. It was also the deadliest weather event of 2023 to date.[4] Forming as a low-pressure system around 4 September 2023, the storm affected Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey with extensive flooding. The storm then organized as a Mediterranean low and was designated as Storm Daniel. It soon acquired quasi-tropical characteristics and moved toward the coast of Libya, where it caused catastrophic flooding before degenerating into a remnant low. The storm was the result of an omega block, as a high-pressure zone became sandwiched between two zones of low pressure, with the isobars shaping like the Greek letter Ω.[5][6] In Greece, the storm was considered the worst in recorded history, with severe rainfall leading to flooding that caused more than 2 billion euros in damage. Libya was hit the hardest, with torrential rains causing two dams near the city of Derna to fail. This resulted in thousands of deaths, with between 10,000 and 100,000 people missing, although exact figures varied by source. Libya’s vulnerability to such disasters was blamed on its civil war, which damaged critical infrastructure and left it in poor condition before Daniel. In the aftermath, several countries along the Mediterranean Sea pledged to provide aid to affected countries. An area of low pressure developed over the Ionian Sea with its surface temperature within the range of tropical transition.[7] On 4 September 2023 it moved southwards over the Balkan Peninsula which led to torrential rains, notably over the Thessaly region.[7] The system became a mediterranean cyclone over the Ionian Sea the following day, and was named Storm Daniel by the Hellenic National Meteorological Service.[8] During the following days, the system moved southeastward, peaking as a subtropical storm with winds recorded by instruments on Metop at 45 knots (83 km/h; 52 mph).[9] The storm then made landfall near the city of Benghazi in Libya. On 10 September 2023, Daniel went east and continued inland before degenerating into a remnant low due to dry air and land interaction later on, with the storm fully dissipating by 12 September 2023.[citation needed] Flooding in eastern Libya centered around the city of Derna has left about 6,000 dead and thousands more missing. With deep divisions between Libya’s two rival governments, questions are being asked about how prepared Libya was for such a disaster. We speak to Libyans and a climate change expert to get the latest on the disaster, in the video published on Sep 14, 2023, by Al Jazeera English, as “Why did Libya’s floods leave so many people dead? | The Take“, below: More than 5,000 bodies have been recovered from Libya’s flood-affected areas. Local authorities fear the death toll could climb to 10,000. The city of Derna has experienced the worst of the flooding after two burst dams wiped out a quarter of the city. Before the floods, tens of thousands of people lived in Derna but the city now lies in ruins. Entire communities washed away into the sea when the river burst its banks and the catastrophe was made far worse after two dams burst, unleashing torrents of raging water. An international aid effort is underway but with roads cut and bridges destroyed, it could be days before'}]"

It’s a two-parter. 1. What’s the perfect play to run on a crucial 2-point conversion? 2. What’s the absolute worst play to run? Answers. 1. One that works. 2. One that doesn’t. No doubt, Gus Malzahn could ace this test. No doubt, the UCF coach could’ve aced it long before last Saturday’s game at Oklahoma, which crashed into a much-closer-than-expected defeat when a game-tying 2-pointer was blown up before it could get off the ground, quite literally. UCF quarterback John Rhys Plumlee passed the ball to his left, at a backwards angle, to slot receiver Xavier Townsend, who was then supposed to chuck it to a wide-open receiver in the back of the end zone. Except the Sooners either sniffed it out or were inadvertently fortunate — either way, a Sooner defender didn’t take the Townsend bait and instead quickly joined the darting receiver. I’ve watched the replay a dozen times. It’s almost as if the Sooners knew it was coming, but these days you don’t want to suggest such a thing. Afterward, Oklahoma defensive back Kendel Dolby, who tackled Townsend before he could even attempt the pass, did mention UCF’s DNA and how trick plays are sprinkled throughout. Some of UCF’s fan base, well beyond the “happy to be here” stage and now into the land of certain expectations, followed script and ripped the play call. “Goober Gus” was one of the ways Malzahn was described. Others weren’t so nice. “Obviously, when a play like that doesn’t work, you get questions,” Malzahn said afterwards. Yes, obviously. #UCF coach Gus Malzahn believes the Knights made the right call on the failed 2-point play vs. Oklahoma last Saturday.He also understands the criticism of the play.""If it had worked, we wouldn’t be having this conversation.""https://t.co/aAVuJjOy30 pic.twitter.com/HQf1kw3hvZ Next came a bit of an explainer. “We used one of our other 2-point plays on third-and-goal,” Gus said. Then another, with one of the late stages of grief — acceptance — mixed in. “We had another option to run it, but that’s the way it goes sometimes. Give them credit, they made the play.” It’s a play, Gus said, the team had practiced “20 or 30 times,” and called it “one of our staples.” Next time the Knights run that one, it won’t likely be in a similar scenario. Maybe second-and-9, middle of the second quarter, and when it works, Gus can look to the bleachers and say, “You see, it can work.” Meanwhile, we’re left with a perfect record, of sorts, regarding these scenarios. You will never … and I mean NEVER … watch a team fail badly to convert a necessary 2-point conversion and hear the fan base reply, “Well, you know, at least it was a good play-call.” GAME BALLS Which Volusia-Flagler area high school football players earned game balls in Week 9? LENDL\'S NEW RACKET Tennis legend Ivan Lendl turns to pickleball, and no, not casually | KEN WILLIS The weekly ranking of Florida’s seven big-league college football programs, based on results versus expectations, current trends, and fluctuations in the daily bond yield. 1. FSU (7-0). This week: at Wake Forest. Wake turned to third-string QB Santino Marucci last week and beat Pitt. Santino played prep ball up the road at Bartram Trail in St. Johns County, and was also a state qualifier in rasslin’. I like him in two out of three falls, but not in four quarters against this group. This pick: ’Noles by 18. 2. Florida (5-2). This week: vs. Georgia in Jacksonville. The Bulldogs’ next three opponents are Mizzou, Ole Miss and Tennessee. That’s right, the Hunker Downs might actually be looking past the Gator game. The pick: Dawgs by just 7. They are here! Bulldogs and Gators fans are filling up RV City this morning 🚐 More than 50 RV’s are taking their spots as Florida-Georgia week “officially” begins. Welcome back to Jacksonville everyone! pic.twitter.com/guA8NMwOxN 3. Miami (5-2). This week: Virginia at home. QB Tyler Van Dyke missed last week’s win over Clemson with something Mario Cristobal doesn’t have to reveal and so he doesn’t. They do say he’s back this week, however. The pick: Medical Mysteries by 17. 4. UCF (3-4). This week: West Virginia at home. You can literally see this one going any of four ways — either team wins a close one or a blowout. I actually chose from four scraps of paper. The pick: U C, which I think means UCF in a close one. 5. FIU (4-5). This week: Lost to Jacksonville State, 41-16, Wednesday night. And this wraps up the C-USA’s month-long Hump Night scheduling. Back to Saturdays next week. Hope the exposure was worth the disjointed work weeks. 6. USF (4-4). This week: off. Next week: At Memphis. The Bulls’ season was teetering off the rails before they managed to escape UConn with a win. And no, “escape UConn with a win” has never appeared before in the history of recorded English language. 7. FAU (3-4). This week: at Charlotte, Friday. The Charlotte 49ers are coached by Francis Poggi. He answers to Biff. Would I kid you? Also, the school’s athletic mascot answers to ""Norm the Niner."" Let\'s move along. The pick: Owls by a niner. Fans of Marquette haven’t seen their football team lose since 1960. We also may not see the basketball team lose this year. Purdue vs Marquette as 1 seeds in Phoenix for the 2024 Final 4. Free money! RYAN HEY, RYAN! Never knew Marquette used to have a football program. And you\'re right, undefeated since 1960, the year they packed away the pigskin to focus on whatever animal basketballs are made from. But a momentary burst of research shows, in the Warriors final five seasons of football, the school record was 8-39-1, which seems to be enough losing to hold you over for several decades. As for your basketball pick, are you talking the same Purdue we saw this past March? A month or so ago, you would’ve looked foolish in suggesting Deion Sanders would need to rally just for bowl eligibility with his Colorado Buffaloes. The Buffs have defined an up-and-down year, starting with three straight wins (that’s up, by the way), then losing two out of three (downish) before blowing that 29-point lead against Stanford (you got it, that’s the down). They’re sitting 4-3 and need two wins in the next five, with three of those opponents currently ranked 11th (Oregon State), 13th (Utah) and 23rd (UCLA, this week’s foe). The other two games are against Washington State and Arizona, neither of them a Vanderbilt or Kent State. Gotta pull for Deion to get at least six wins, just to see the scrambling among mid-tier bowls who\'d love to get that Colorado exposure. The bloom isn’t off the rose just yet, but it could sure use a spritz, so why not — Buffs over Bruins by 6. ● Elsewhere: Utah over Oregon; Oklahoma probably beats Kansas but who knows at this point; Jimbos by 3 over S. Carolina; Penn State rather big over Indiana; BYU upsets Texas; Notre Dame by 9 over Pitt; Duke beats Louisville; Auburn by 8 over Mississippi State; Tennessee beats Kentucky; Ohio State by 20 over Wisconsin; Ole Miss by a pair of 20s over Vandy; and smack-dab in the middle of Minnesota, the St. Johns Johnnies by 16 over the visiting Saints of St. Scholastica. #WHM at #CSS - Mother Scholastica Kerst. #CSSLibrary #CSSArchives #CSSAlumni©St. Scholastica Monastery, Duluth, MN.

It might sound like the name of Elroy Jetson’s elementary school, but the Duluth institution was built in the late 1800s and named after a deserving local monastery prioress, Mother Scholastica Kerst. Yes, prioress. Look it up. Mother S and the other Benedictine sisters proved to be educational pioneers in their neck of the woods, heroes even, but they also blazed trails in the medical world with hospitals, retirement homes and even an orphanage. Among the Mother’s key staffers was Sister Amata Mackett, who, according to long-ago scouting reports, stretched the tape to about 6 feet and tipped the local Publix scale at over 200 pounds — “Solid stock, don’t you know,” as they say up in them parts. (If only the Minnesota accent translated to print!) Amata, local lore tells us, was known as “Sister Lumberjack,” because she visited nearby lumber camps and, after baking pies and darning socks, she’d convince the loggers to quit spending so much money on beard oil and plaid flannels and instead invest in the new Benedictine health-care plan.

Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach did not sell for $422 million on Aug. 4, despite recent media reports based on an erroneous “sold” listing that appeared on the real estate website Zillow. A spokeswoman for Zillow on Friday afternoon attributed the initial listing to erroneous information provided to the popular website. But even so, the listing gained media attention in stories initially published by The Daily Express and, later, Newsweek. Trump’s son Eric Trump on Friday released to Newsweek a statement denying the sale. “Mar-a-Lago has not been sold nor will it ever be. This rumor is asinine,” Eric Trump’s statement said. Although the Zillow.com listing was still online Friday morning, the sale-price figure had been removed by 12:15 p.m., the Palm Beach Daily News found. In a statement released to the Palm Beach Daily News, a Zillow spokeswoman said the information about the sale “provided” to the site appeared to be erroneous. “Zillow strives for accuracy on our site and if we become aware of inaccurate information, we will update it immediately. After an investigation, it appears that the information provided was incorrect. We’ve corrected the information on this property,” the statement said. The Zillow spokeswoman did not provide details about the source of the erroneous information. During the time the erroneous post was active Friday morning, the Palm Beach Daily News was unable to confirm any sale of Mar-a-Lago through online searches of state business filings and Palm Beach County courthouse and property records. No deed has apparently been recorded showing Mar-a-Lago changed hands since Donald Trump transferred ownership from his name in 1995 to an entity he controlled named Mar-a-Lago Club Inc. That transaction was recorded at $12 million. The former president bought the property to use as his personal vacation home in 1985 and opened it as a private club about a decade later. Florida business records show Mar-a-Lago Club Inc. today is headed by another of the former president’s sons, Donald J. Trump Jr., who holds the titles director, chairman, vice president, secretary and treasurer. Trump Jr. assumed leadership of the property’s ownership company via a state filing on Jan. 23, 2017, three days after his father’s inauguration as president of the United States, records show. Until that change, Donald Trump Sr. had served as president of the property’s ownership company. FROM THE ARCHIVES: How much is Trump’s Mar-a-Lago worth? It depends on who you ask On Thursday, Trump traveled to Atlanta, where he was booked at the Fulton County Courthouse on state charges alleging he took part in a conspiracy to illegally overturn the 2020 presidential-election results in Georgia. He was released on $200,000 bond. In their reports Friday, Newsweek and other media outlets attributed the information about the sale to Zillow.com and The Express. Mar-a-Lago stands on 17.5 acres of land stretching between the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway. In October, the Palm Beach Daily News queried Palm Beach real estate experts about the value of Mar-a-Lago and its real estate. They spoke about Mar-a-Lago and Trump only on condition of anonymity. “It’s priceless,” quipped one seasoned Palm Beach real estate professional.

reign as Miss America was to come to an end, a stop in Boca Grande was essential for Grace Stanke. With the help of Diane Cook – Grace’s great-aunt, a Boca Grande resident and a member of the Boca Grande Woman’s Club – that highlight of her year was fulfilled this week. Grace was the guest speaker at the Woman’s Club meeting on Monday, Dec. 4. She has just about a month left in her time as Miss America, so it worked out perfectly. Grace shared some of her excitement of the past year, and then had to rush off to catch a flight to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, for another presentation. “She wowed the Woman’s Club with her great sense of humor and history on why she chose nuclear engineering as her career,” said great-aunt Diane, who also bragged (rightfully) that Grace has just been included in Forbes magazine’s “30 under 30” for “powering a more sustainable future.” Grace truly embodies the modern ideals of the Miss America program. In prior generations, it was thought of as merely a beauty contest. Today the program emphasizes the ideal of the accomplished woman. Grace Stanke is certainly beautiful and perfectly styled, but she is also extremely smart and dedicated to her own education, as well as educating others, particularly on the benefits of nuclear energy. This Miss America is soon to graduate from the University of Wisconsin as a nuclear engineer. She already has several years of experience working in the nuclear energy field and advocating for the use of this type of energy, touting its economic, power and environmental benefits. While she knows the serious side of the science, Grace is equally comfortable joking and telling stories about how she got involved in the field of nuclear energy. “I’m a storyteller,” she admitted. “I like telling stories and connecting with people through the interactions I’ve had. So I like to tell the story of how I got into nuclear science, which actually has a lot to do with my dad.” “I did it for spite,” Grace said. “My dad told me not to go into it as a 16-year-old teenage girl. And every 16-year-old teenage girl says, ‘Watch me,’ and goes and does it. So that’s what started it all.” Being an independent teenager may have gotten her started on this path, but what really grabbed her, kept her engaged and stirred her passion was what she learned in college. “The first semester I learned that nuclear science is all around us,” she said. “It’s in bananas; it’s in smoke detectors; in granite countertops; avocados. All those things are naturally radioactive. And in my mind it was, well why am I afraid of radiation? Why am I worried about this when it’s all around us?” “And then, as I continued to learn about the different applications of nuclear science,” she said, “you know, on the medicine side of things … my dad’s a two-time cancer survivor – the same man who told me not to go into this field is alive because of nuclear medicine! On the energy side, nuclear energy produces 20 percent of America’s electricity. It’s reliable and it’s zero carbon, which is one thing that politicians can agree on, on both sides of the aisle, and it’s wonderful. So, I’ve become an advocate for nuclear science – to talk about what it is and talk about what it can do for our society, how it already exists and how, when we permit it to grow, then it will grow, and it will only help us.” Such commitment and intensity are traits the Miss America judges saw in Grace that made them choose her as their national representative. The same sort of enthusiasm was evident in the talent aspect of the selection process for Miss America. Grace plays classical violin and, in fact, won the talent competition at this year’s pageant. It was the desire to improve her violin performance that pushed her to become involved in the Miss America program initially. That was several years ago, when she was just a kid of 16 (she’s now 21). “I have been playing violin now for 13 years,” she said. “And when I was about 12 or 13 years old, I was not very good at performing. I wasn’t good at playing in front of people, so I found the Miss America’s Outstanding Teen organization, which includes a challenge as a required portion of the competition. So I competed, and I ended up really enjoying it. I competed as a teen for two years, and won ‘state’ the second year.” When she won the local title, she went on to the state-level competition, where she did not do so well. Still, she obtained a scholarship and a pat on the back. “And then, when I got to college, I grew up and I had a lot of life changes, and I realized college is very expensive,” she recalled. “I knew Miss America had a scholarship opportunity, so I came back after I turned 18 and could compete in the ‘Miss’ division.” The rest is history. Again, her violin was an important part of her competitive edge. She noted that her violin helped her emotionally as she was growing up. It was “a healthy way of dealing with the not-so-fun emotions” of adolescence, she said. “I love playing my violin. I love performing.” Right now, however, she is more focused on the business of nuclear science. The violin will always be a hobby, but it is in the background. Her year as Miss America has been a whirlwind of activity for Grace. She recalled skydiving with the Army over Miami, lobster fishing in Maine, going to Paris, traveling some 210,000 miles in the past 11-1/2 months, visiting 22 states and six different countries. Along the way she has visited schools and power plants, and she’s shared her life with thousands of people. She has been photographed and interviewed multiple times, and she has loved almost all of it. Still, she is looking forward to stepping out of the national spotlight. “I’m 21 years old. I have a lot of learning left to do. I have a lot of growing left to do. And I’ve had a lot of experiences that have completely changed my perspective and my outlook on life overall,” she said. “It’s been a wonderful, wonderful experience. I’m incredibly thankful for this.” Her role as Miss America has been her paid position for the past year. That ends January 14. In March she begins her new job with Constellation Energy, a utility company and spinoff of Excelon, the nation’s largest owner of nuclear plants. She will be moving from Wausau, Wisc. to Kennett Square, Pa., where she will be working as a core design engineer. “I’ll be helping to plan out and design reactor cores at different nuclear power plants across the country. And then, I’ll also still continue the advocacy. That is worked into the job description, so I’m really excited to have that opportunity to keep educating people.” Grace worked for Constellation as a co-op student, helping design processes that were implemented in 12 different nuclear power plants, even as an 18-year-old. “It’s been really awesome,” she said. “I worked at two different research labs.

High water and dangerous rip currents have besieged much of the West Coast from Southern California to Oregon since Thursday, caused by a series of powerful storms coming ashore from the Pacific Ocean.

school districts have a First Amendment right to remove LGBTQ books. Or any book, for that matter. It’s a contention that First Amendment experts and advocates call extreme and chilling. But the state maintains the books on school shelves represent protected government speech. Public school libraries are “a forum for government speech,” it says, not a “forum for free expression.” “Public-school systems, including their libraries, convey the government’s message,” Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody wrote in a legal brief. That argument is also being made by lawyers for the school boards in Escambia and Lake counties. A pair of lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida over the removal of books in both of their school libraries. Notable among those is “And Tango Makes Three,” its authors being plaintiffs. The children’s book, based on a true story, about two male penguins raising a chick together was removed in both districts. While Lake County’s school board – which is named in one of the two lawsuits – brought the book back, Escambia County – named in both – still has it removed from school libraries. Nonetheless, the litigation continues against both school boards. The state was sued in one of the cases, with Education Secretary Manny Diaz Jr. and the members of the State Board of Education listed individually as defendants along with the two counties. Authors Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell are joined by a third grade student as plaintiffs in that case. Florida is not named in the other case, filed against Escambia County\'s school board by free expression group PEN America and Penguin Random House, the nation’s largest publisher, along with authors and parents of students. Nevertheless, the state filed a brief supporting the county and pushing the government speech argument. Those suing accuse the defendants of violating students’ First Amendment right to receive information as well as unconstitutionally removing books because of LGBTQ and race themes. The defendants, meanwhile, say school library content decisions can’t infringe on the First Amendment — because they’re protected by it. If the courts are sympathetic to that claim, there could be big consequences on book access in schools and First Amendment law as a whole. “It would upend 100 years of established First Amendment precedent,” said Peter Bromberg, the associate director of EveryLibrary, a pro-library, anti-book banning organization. “This is such a far departure and would have such a ripple effect.” First Amendment experts and advocates interviewed by the USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida all had grave warnings about what court support for the state’s argument could mean. “There’s considerable irony in that those who seek to limit access to books in school libraries often say they’re fighting for parental rights,” said Ken Paulson, director of the Free Speech Center at Middle Tennessee State University. “If government speech determines what books can be in the library, the government is essentially saying your children can only see the ideas that the government has approved. “That’s not parental rights,” he added. “That’s authoritarianism.” Shalini Goel Agarwal, counsel for Protect Democracy, called the state\'s position a “sweeping argument.” Agarwal and her organization are representing the plaintiffs in the case against the Escambia County School Board. “It seems to us that their position is that a school official has unfettered discretion to decide what is in the library, or what library books are taken out, and they can take them out for any reason at all, even for discriminatory reasons,” she said. That\'s exactly what the lawsuit alleges is happening. “In every decision to remove a book, the School Board has sided with a challenger expressing openly discriminatory bases for the challenge,” the plaintiffs write. “These restrictions and removals have disproportionately targeted books by or about people of color and/or LGBTQ people.” Over the last couple of years, Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Republican-dominated Legislature have passed laws that have led to a barrage of book restrictions and removals in schools. PEN America recently ranked Florida as the nation’s leader in book bans. That term in itself has generated controversy, with many conservatives maintaining ""book banning"" is a misleading exaggeration. Still, Florida\'s laws have also been met with complaints of vagueness, with school districts interpreting them in dramatically different ways. Some haven’t touched their shelves. Others, like Escambia County, have restricted or removed hundreds. And the argument that Escambia’s actions are protected government speech, Agarwal says, would have a broader effect than just books. Using the “government speech doctrine (in this case) would basically eviscerate a lot of other areas where people would expect the First Amendment to apply,” she said. In her case, a group of 23 constitutional scholars from across the nation filed a brief opposing the state and counties’ government speech assertions. “[We] write to caution the court against adopting the aggressive, unprecedented interpretation of the government speech doctrine,” they said. “The notion that such libraries exist to carry official messaging is profoundly antithetical to their nature and purpose.” Those interviewed by the USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida say they think and hope the defendants\' argument will get knocked down. “It’s fundamental that no government entity can engage in viewpoint discrimination,"" said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the American Library Association\'s Office for Intellectual Freedom. “That’s a basic constitutional guardrail. And those guardrails apply to governments … including school boards. And that’s really what the Supreme Court (has) said.” In legal filings, the plaintiffs extensively point to the U.S. Supreme Court\'s 1982 decision in Island Trees Union Free School District v. Pico. In that decision, justices ruled that school boards have “significant discretion to determine the content of their school libraries.” But it said that discretion “may not be exercised in a narrowly partisan or political manner.” The case law doesn’t end there: “Every court that has addressed that issue … has rejected the position that libraries — including school libraries — constitute Constitution-free zones in which government officials can freely discriminate based on viewpoint,” plaintiffs write. Despite the cited laws, those interviewed also acknowledged that, generally, there are more wild cards in the judiciary nowadays. The overturning of Roe v. Wade is one example of that. But Paulson said “fundamental constitutional principles” against the argument are clear. He even added that further judicial scrutiny of the Pico case could end up strengthening it. That decision was a plurality opinion, ""in which the court is unable to generate a single opinion that is supported by a majority of the (nine) justices,"" explained scholars in a National Center for State Courts study. Moody contends that Pico’s plurality decision has no strength, especially since it predates court findings on government speech. She points to a decision that found the selection of public park monuments was government speech as an example. “And because compiling library materials is government speech, the First Amendment does not bar the government from curating those materials based on content and viewpoint,” she wrote. Spokespeople for the governor’s office and the state Department of Education didn’t respond to requests for comment. But Chase Sizemore, press secretary for the state attorney general\'s office, said the legal filings “speak for themselves.” “State and county employees are responsible for deciding what materials ultimately appear on the shelves of Florida\'s public-school libraries,” Sizemore wrote in an email. He also said Florida law also gives parents every opportunity for input on those matters. “The plaintiffs in this case are arguing that third parties — the authors of the books themselves — can demand that their preferred materials be put in school libraries,” Sizemore wrote. “If that were right, it would negate not only the decisions of the responsible officials, but parental input too.” Arguments defending book removals as protected government speech aren’t only happening in Florida. “It’s a theory being advanced by those who would like to limit access to certain ideas or beliefs in libraries,” Caldwell-Stone said. “Not only in school libraries but public libraries as well.” Local officials in Llano County, Texas, for example, are arguing that “content and viewpoint consideration are both inevitable and permissible when weeding books.” They’re appealing a federal court’s decision ordering them to return removed books to shelves. In Arkansas, librarians filed suit against a law signed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders that went after library materials. Rebuffing the state’s government speech arguments, the federal judge in July temporarily blocked key portions of the law mandating and outlining public library book challenge policies and criminalizing providing “harmful” books to minors. “Defendants are unable to cite any legal precedent to suggest that the state may censor non-obscene materials in a public library because such censorship is a form of government speech,” U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks wrote.

things, but the latest hurricane, Idalia, has not only brought the American flamingo back to Florida, but highlighted the potential for the eventual restoration and return of the species to Florida on a permanent basis. Like so many Floridians, Ashley Scarpa had never seen them in Florida, even as an experienced birder. “To be honest I went searching for them,” said Scarpa, who has in the past monitored birds for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. “Someone had posted that they had been seen in the area, and I sprinted to where they have been seen.” The first report was that five had been seen on the north end of Gasparilla Island. She got in a boat with her husband, Glenn Scarpa, and they looked and found them on the southern tip of Little Gasparilla Island on Thursday, Aug. 31. Ashley posted a short video on Facebook and Instagram, and wrote up her thoughts. “I made Glenn take me by boat to check a few nearby spots, and on our last island stop, there they were!” she wrote. “For some reason, I immediately started crying. I’ve always wanted to see a flamingo in the wild. And my gosh, they were so majestic!” Her first notion, in seeing that the birds were juveniles, was that they were resting and off-course. They were also unbanded, which meant that they had not been domesticated. As a veteran birder, she called the flamingo a “life-bird” that she had hoped to see at least once. “It was breathtaking,” said Scarpa. “I was speechless.” Since the storm, flamingos have been seen across Florida, from Palm Beach up to Volusia County and up and down the Gulf Coast. Keith Laakkonen of Audubon’s Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary had reports of 52 in Estero Bay and a flock of 14 on Marco Island. Laakkonen said that it was important to remember that storms can have some positive impacts on birds, and they are often seen in the eye of a hurricane. Hurricane Ian, for instance, brought massive amounts of rainfall, which helped. “A hurricane will reset things,” said Laakkonen, who direct’s Audubon’s 13,000 acre sanctuary in Naples. “Nature and birds have evolved with these hurricane events,” said Laakkonen. “They can be very successful, and exploit that short-term change.” Dozens of press reports included a flock, or flamboyance of flamingos, in Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge in North Carolina, a pair in Virginia at Plum Tree Island National Wildlife Refuge in Poquoson, and sightings in Wayne County, Tenn., Ohio and Hale County, Ala. Sightings in the Tampa Bay area elicited hundreds of shares and comments on social media, including requests for exact GPS coordinates, so that members of birding groups could photograph them. And on Tuesday, Sept. 5, animal rescuers found a tired adult flamingo at St. Pete Beach. The Tampa Bay Times reported that it needed fluid therapy, but it will be released. Laakkonen believes it is human nature to worry about the birds and how they got there, and how might they get back home, but birds have many advantages and adaptations that we forget about. “Birds do have wings,” said Laakkonen. Forgotten by Florida Most Americans associate flamingos with Florida, but that is mostly because of popular culture, as they were fixtures at roadside attractions like Marineland, Silver Springs, Sarasota Jungle Gardens, the Miami Zoo and Hialeah Racetrack. While tourists almost always saw domesticated flamingos while in Florida, for most of the 20th century they had seemingly disappeared from the Florida landscape. While the passenger pigeon and dodo bird were hunted to extinction, the flamingo survived, barely. Populations began to recover across the Caribbean after World War II, but in the U.S. there were only sporadic sightings. The birds, however, were not listed because they were not seen when laws on endangered species were instituted. It turned out that the birds were hiding in plain sight in the Everglades, even as they were present all around us in the Bahamas and Cuba. “There are several populations up the west coast of Florida that appear to have been displaced from the Yucatan by Hurricane Idalia,” said Alyssa Vinson of the University of Florida’s Master Naturalist Program in Manatee County. She said that while they are native to Florida, they are most often seen in the extreme south of Florida near the Ten Thousand Islands and Florida Bay. A 2018 paper by Stephen Whitfield entitled “Status and trends of American Flamingos,” detailed many of the early sightings of the birds before they were hunted for plumes, to prove the size of local populations. The study details more recent sightings relating to tropical cyclones. The birds, which Whitfield’s paper called a “Florida icon,” were hunted not only for eating and for plumes, but for their skins, which were reportedly valued at $25 in 1885. Laakkonen first saw the birds in the wild in Florida while in Palm Beach, at a storm water treatment center. Ornithologists and birders were allowed to come and watch them from a distance. “You were just hearing these oohs and ahhs, and the sound of a thousand cameras,” said Laakkonen, a native of Cape Coral who has worked at the Charlotte Harbor State Buffer Preserve and was environmental sciences coordinator for Fort Myers Beach. This recent flamingo phenomenon has been remarkable for birding, not only in Florida, but across the U.S., and across ages and groups. He calls the bird an “absolutely beautiful, charismatic bird that everyone knows.” Restoration and Future Scarpa, upon seeing the birds, did not post their exact locations. She also reminds that if birds are in this condition, away from their homes, it is best not to stress them by getting close. They are searching for food and need to get somewhere. She recalled a snowy plover that would come each year to the Anna Maria Island area. “They have somehow imprinted the location for where they go,” said Scarpa. Laakkonen believes that as long as we can restore habitats and water quality, future generations will get to see flamingos more regularly, and we will see a return, as they are doing fine in other parts of the Caribbean. “We want to bring back species that were lost over time,” said Laakkonen, who believes there are likely more flamingos in the Everglades than we know, or could ever reach, because of the conditions there. He said “there were always a few down there.” The flamingos have given many people hope that wild populations, which have heretofore been in inaccessible places in the Everglades, will return across the state eventually and be able to adapt and breed here. “Is there a chance that some of these juveniles will stay?” asked Scarpa. “Is it possible that some of these guys could take residency?” The Audubon Society is asking the same question. “They may stay due to the Everglades restoration,” said Laakkonen. “Or they might fly back to the Yucatan.” 941.964.2995 or 800.749.2995 431 Park AvenueBoca Grande, FL 33921 Contact Us Classifieds Other Publications Advertise with Us Privacy Policy Login Copyright © Sandpaper Marketing.

NEWS Former President Donald Trump’s lawyers were swatted down as they again asked Judge Arthur Engoron to cut the trial short and issue a verdict clearing Trump, his company and top executives of wrongdoing. December 13, 2023 at 04:11 PM 5 minute read Cases and Courts Donald Trump’s lawyers rested his defense Tuesday and sought anew to immediately end the New York civil fraud trial that threatens the former president’s real estate empire. The judge said “there’s no way I’m going to grant that.” Trump’s lawyers — thwarted in a similar bid last month — were swatted down as they asked Judge Arthur Engoron to cut the trial short and issue a verdict clearing Trump, his company and top executives of wrongdoing. The judge reiterated his feeling that state lawyers had met their legal burden for seeing the three-month trial through to its conclusion. New York Attorney General Letitia James alleges Trump duped banks, insurers and others by inflating his wealth on financial statements used in securing loans and make deals. Engoron has already ruled on James’ top claim that Trump committed fraud. Trump’s lawyers renewed their request for what’s known as a directed verdict a day after Trump, the leading contender for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, skipped a planned return to the witness stand as the defense’s last big witness. Trump lawyer Christopher Kise said the defense plans to send Engoron paperwork by the end of the week fully detailing arguments for a directed verdict. “You’d be wasting your time, but I’m not going to tell you not to send me something,” Engoron told Kise. But, he warned, “It doesn’t mean I’ll entertain” or even read the written request. State lawyer Kevin Wallace complained the long-shot bid — essentially an academic exercise given Engoron’s position on the matter — was a “colossal waste of resources.” Closing arguments are scheduled for Jan. 11, just four days before the Iowa caucuses start the presidential primary season. Engoron, who is deciding the case in place of a jury, which is not allowed in this type of lawsuit, said he hopes to have a decision by the end of January. Trump’s lawyers first asked for a directed verdict on Nov. 9 after state lawyers rested their case. Engoron said he was taking the request “under advisement” and ordered the trial to proceed as scheduled. A few weeks later, Engoron rejected the defense’s request for a mistrial, denying its claims that he was politically biased and had irreparably harmed Trump’s right to a fair trial through “astonishing departures from ordinary standards of impartiality.” Trump’s lawyers moved again on Tuesday to short-circuit the trial after finishing with their final witness — an accounting expert whom Trump lauded after he testified he found no evidence of accounting fraud in Trump’s financial statements. State lawyers later started calling rebuttal witnesses. Testimony is expected to wrap Wednesday. The state’s case involved six weeks of testimony from about two-dozen witnesses, including Trump, his eldest sons Eric and Donald Jr., daughter Ivanka, outside accountants and Trump Organization executives. The defense then called witnesses over the course of about five weeks. They included real estate developers and brokers, a former federal financial regulator and accounting gurus. Donald Trump Jr. also returned to the witness stand, this time to present “The Trump Story,” a slideshow of golf course fairways, skyscrapers and gilded interiors. He hailed his father as a real estate visionary while making no mention of his casino bankruptcies or other ventures that fizzled or drew regulatory scrutiny. The defense rested after New York University accounting professor Eli Bartov’s third and final day of testimony. Bartov has blasted the state’s case and said Trump’s financial statements “were not materially misstated.” In cross-examining Bartov, state lawyer Louis Solomon sought to undermine the contention that major Trump lender Deutsche Bank didn’t rely on his financial statements. Bartov emphasized earlier in his testimony that the bank often reduced the values Trump provided, and the professor had concluded such cuts were not merely “mechanical” but the results of bankers’ own analysis. Solomon noted that retired Deutsche Bank executive Nicholas Haigh had testified that he believed such cuts were “standardized” for client-reported commercial real estate values. “There’s no contradiction at all between those two statements,” Bartov said. He opined that the bank would have scrutinized enough of Trump’s assets to be satisfied he had the wherewithal to warrant the loan, and then, to save staff work but still be conservative, bankers would have applied a standard deduction to the remaining holdings. Later, Solomon asked about a Trump Organization calculation that set the net operating income for a Wall Street office building at about four times the number that appraisers listed. If the Trump Organization’s number was inflated, he asked, wouldn’t the bank’s adjustment also be too high? “I don’t agree with your premise,” said Bartov, later explaining that appraisers and the company used different methods for the income calculation. In an unusual turn, Solomon also pointed to one of his colleagues’ defeats in another high-profile case to try to cast doubt on Bartov’s views. In the same courthouse, Bartov once testified as an expert witness for the attorney general’s office in its lawsuit accusing Exxon Mobil of duping investors about the toll that climate change regulations could take on its business. Exxon won that case, and Judge Barry Ostrager’s ruling shrugged off the professor’s testimony as “unpersuasive” and “flatly contradicted by the weight of the evidence.” Trump attorney Christopher Kise objected that the Exxon episode was irrelevant.

Researchers say it can revolutionize marine and aquatic science. “Eavesdropping on underwater sounds can reveal a plethora of information about the species that produce them and is useful for a variety of applications, ranging from fisheries management, invasive species detection, improved restoration outcomes, and assessing human environmental impacts,” said Looby, who also co-cre- ated FishSounds, which offers a comprehensive, global inventory of fish sound production research. The team’s research, “Global Inventory of Species Categorized by Known Underwater Sonifery,” was pub- lished in December in Scientific Data and involved 19 authors from six countries, funding from the Richard Lounsbery Foundation and centuries of scientific effort to document underwater sounds. “Understanding how marine species interact with their environments is of global importance, and this data being freely available is a major step toward that goal,” said Kieran Cox, a member of the research team and a National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada fellow. “Our dataset helps demonstrate how widespread underwater sound production really is across a variety of animals, but also that we still have a lot to learn,” she said.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 10:06 pm Daniel Jonas, left, of the Village of Piedmont, tries on a helmet with assistance from Windy Hall, store owner of Village Cycles in Brownwood. More people than ever capped off their Thanksgiving holiday with a big shopping weekend — a trend that\'s expected to stick around for Christmas. During the five-day Thanksgiving shopping weekend from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, about 200.4 million consumers went shopping, according to the National Retail Federation. That surpasses last year\'s record of 196.7 million and the NRF\'s initial expectation of 182 million shoppers. ""The five-day period between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday represents some of the busiest shopping days of the year and reflects the continued resilience of consumers and strength of the economy,” said Matthew Shay, NRF president and CEO, in a statement. ""Shoppers exceeded our expectations with a robust turnout. Retailers large and small were prepared to deliver safe, convenient and affordable shopping experiences with the products and services consumers needed, and at great prices.” A steady stream of shoppers is expected to continue ahead of Santa\'s arrival. The NRF predicts total spending for November and December to reach historic numbers. It is expected to increase between 3% and 4% from 2022\'s numbers to between about $957.3 billion and $966.6 billion, according to an NRF news release. The Christmas season is the busiest time of the year at Jewelry Design, which has locations in La Plaza Grande and Southern Trace Plaza. ""I just know we\'re on track to have probably one of our biggest Christmases that we\'ve had at both locations,” owner Jay Gulati said. Small Business Saturday brought in so much business, the sale numbers Gulati projected for Black Friday and Small Business Saturday together were done on Small Business Saturday alone, he said. And at this point in the Christmas season, both stores have made as much in sales as they did all last Christmas season. ""From this point, everything we do we\'re going to be ahead,” Gulati said. During the Thanksgiving weekend, about 121.4 million people shopped in person, just under last year\'s 122.7 million in-store shoppers. A significant number of consumers shopped online at about 134.2 million — up from the 130.2 million people who shopped from the comfort of their homes last Thanksgiving weekend. Black Friday once again took the top spot with the most shoppers this year. About 76.2 million shoppers did in-store shopping, which is up from 72.9 million consumers who did in-store Black Friday shopping in 2022, according to the NRF. The NRF expected about 130.7 million people to shop in stores and online on Black Friday this year, and about 166.8 million ended up doing so, according to the NRF. People flocked to both big-box stores and small businesses the day after Thanksgiving. ""Friday sometimes is hit and miss with us because there\'s a lot of competition with big box stores,"" said Mark Hall, co-owner of Village Cycles, a bicycle store in Brownwood. ""But we had a really good Friday.” Hall estimated business was about three times better on Black Friday than on a regular day. About 59 million consumers shopped in stores on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, known as Small Business Saturday, which is slightly down from last year\'s number, according to the NRF. In The Villages, however, Small Business Saturday is usually the bigger day for local businesses. This year was no different. Village Cycles experienced better sales over Thanksgiving weekend as a whole compared to last year. E-bikes were the most popular buy among customers that weekend. ""This year was really good,” Hall said. Staff at Ambrosia on the Square in Lake Sumter Landing welcomed plenty of customers on Small Business Saturday as well, boosted by the Tree Lighting festival on the square the same day. ""We appreciate all the local support, especially when they have — as The Villages gets larger — a lot of major retail places out there that I\'m sure are able to offer lower prices,"" said Laure Folland, owner of Ambrosia on the Square. ""But I think we work really hard to get some very different things that you\'re not going to see at the Targets and the Walmarts. I think they really come out and support the stores on the square in general.” Folland hopes the momentum at her business continues as Christmas gets closer. ""I am hoping that we\'re seeing the same increase that we saw in November, and it doesn\'t drop off,"" Folland said. ""It\'s still really busy. (Customers) are buying a lot of everything.” Senior writer Summer Jarro can be reached at 352-753-1119, ext. 5404, or summer.jarro@thevillagesmedia.com. A few passing clouds. Low 69F.

North Bay police have called out the flyer campaigns as “hate incidents,” which Minadeo said has damaged his reputation. “You’re essentially putting a green light on my head with the community, to say that I’m some bad person because I’m talking truth about Jews,” he said. Though Minadeo says he does not support violence, his content is rife with violent imagery and messages. One digital background that appears frequently on his livestream is a photo of the train tracks leading to Auschwitz. Much of the casual language used in the Goyim TV online universe is extremely violent; when Minadeo wants to point out something he doesn’t like, for example, he instructs his followers to “gas” it, or kill it, using a reference to the Holocaust. He also encourages his followers to harass journalists and activists who cover or speak out against his activities. Friendly Florida? Minadeo hopes Florida will be more hospitable to him and his worldview, and he may have reason to believe that to be true. A recent report from the ADL described an upward trend of extremist and antisemitic activity in the Sunshine State, driven in part by emerging white supremacist groups including White Lives Matter, Sunshine State Nationalists, NatSoc Florida and Florida Nationalists. Minadeo and Goyim TV have partnered with neo-Nazi elements in Florida on antisemitic stunts in the past, and the Goyim Defense League has been extremely active in the state. Last May, Minadeo and his followers held a “protest” outside a Holocaust memorial center in Maitland, an Orlando suburb, carrying bullhorns and holding up signs denying the Holocaust and saying “Jews promote homosexuality.” In October, he and others describing themselves as “laser Nazis” used a light projection to superimpose the “Kanye is right about the Jews” message at the Florida-Georgia football game in Jacksonville, which was attended by 75,000 people. Minadeo has pledged to continue Goyim TV’s propaganda efforts and daily livestreams from Florida, where at least one other prominent member of the hate group already lives: Dominic Di Giorgio, a tech-savvy GDL operative known as “Ned Flanders.” In its video announcing the move, Goyim TV showed images of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in Jerusalem signing an antisemitism bill and praying at the Western Wall. “Keep the pressure on,” a message on the video said. “This has to end.” The Secure Community Network, which monitors threats to Jewish communities across North America, did not address Goyim TV specifically in a statement but said it monitors threats to Jewish communities closely, and over the last six months it had addressed “risk events” affecting over 4,000 Jewish institutions and referred “over 225 individuals to law enforcement for follow-up.” “As the official safety and security organization for the Jewish community in North America, the Secure Community Network works closely with local Jewish Federations, community leaders, and law enforcement partners to keep the Jewish community safe and secure,” said the group’s leader, Michael Masters.

In some cases, the companies do disclose their revenue, including Crowley. The company has said in news releases it has annual revenue of $3.4 billion. Southeastern Grocers last publicly reported revenue of about $8 billion for 2020 in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing for an initial public offering that was pulled off the market in January 2021. The $8.5 billion is an estimate by the magazine. Forbes also listed Fanatics Inc. as a Jacksonville-based company with $6 billion in estimated revenue, ranking it 95th, but it’s not based in Jacksonville. Fanatics was founded in Northeast Florida and still maintains its commerce headquarters in Jacksonville. The company does not list a headquarters but opened a parent company headquarters office in New York City in February 2023, according to a March story by American Builders Quarterly. One other company on the list with close ties to Jacksonville is Urbana, Illinois-based Flex-N-Gate, ranked 69th with $8.3 billion in revenue. The auto parts company is owned by Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan. GEE Group Inc. reported lower revenue for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended Sept. 30.

GEE Group said Dec. 18 that fourth-quarter revenue fell 18% to $34.3 million and revenue fell 8% to $152.4 million for the entire fiscal year.

DirecTV and Tegna Inc. have been locked in a dispute for three weeks that has kept Tegna’s 64 U.S. television stations, including Jacksonville NBC affiliate WTLV TV-12 and ABC affiliate WJXX TV-25, off of the satellite service. The dispute involves the fees DirecTV pays to Tegna to be able to broadcast the stations on its service, and DirecTV offered a new approach to the contract renewal: Allow Tegna to set a market price for its stations and let DirecTV viewers decide if they want to subscribe to the stations individually. “This first-of-its-kind a la carte model would allow broadcasters to fully control the pricing for their stations based on quality and demand, facilitate a direct relationship between the stations and viewers, and most importantly return greater choice, control and value to consumers by allowing them to customize their packages and pricing,” DirecTV said in a Nov. 30 news release when the existing contract with Tegna ran out. “We’re committed to reaching an agreement that continues to ensure all of DIRECTV’s subscribers in our communities have access to the local and national news, sports and entertainment our stations offer, while providing our stations with the fair compensation they need to continue their significant investments in the content viewers value,” Tegna said in an emailed statement in response. “In contrast, DIRECTV’s proposal to instead require its customers to pay yet another standalone fee for our local stations – unlike all other broadcast stations – disserves subscribers and is not productive.” The dispute was unresolved as of Dec. 20 with no word on further negotiations between the parties. Tyson Foods Inc., which notified state officials in November it would close its Jacksonville plant Jan. 8, said in an updated notification that it is extending employment for a handful of workers past that date. However, the last of its Jacksonville employees will be laid off by March 17. The company’s Nov. 8 filing under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act said 219 workers will lose their jobs when it closes the meat processing plant at 5441 W. Fifth St., in the Paxon area of West Jacksonville. The updated WARN notice Dec. 13 said 11 employees will stay past Jan. 8 but they will be laid off between Jan. 12 and March 17. The Jacksonville facility is one of eight plant closures announced this year by Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson as it reorganizes its production footprint. As Worldpay separates from Fidelity National Information Services Inc. and reestablishes a headquarters in Cincinnati, the payments technology company is adding 500 jobs at its main office. Jacksonville-based FIS acquired Worldpay in 2019 but in July 2023, it agreed to sell a 55% controlling interest to private equity firm GTCR for $11.7 billion. After the 2019 acquisition, FIS announced a commitment to maintaining a strategic technology and innovation campus at Worldpay’s former headquarters in Cincinnati. A Dec. 11 news release from the office of Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Worldpay still has 900 jobs in Cincinnati and it committed to returning the corporate headquarters to the city with 500 additional jobs. Charles Drucker, CEO of Worldpay before the FIS acquisition, was named to again become chief executive of the stand-alone company after the GTCR deal is completed next year. That indicated Cincinnati would likely be the headquarters but in the news release, JobsOhio CEO J.P. Nauseef said there was “aggressive competition from other U.S. regions” for the headquarters office. Financial technology company FIS will retain a minority stake in Worldpay after the buyout. Conditioned Air Co. announced Dec. 18 it acquired A/C Designs of St. Augustine. Houston-based investment firm Genesis Park said it invested in Conditioned Air to support the deal, but it did not announce the size of the investment. Genesis Park took Jacksonville-based space technology firm Redwire Corp. public in 2021 by merging a special purpose acquisition company formed by Genesis with Redwire. Ed Tennant, founder of A/C Designs in 2002, said in a news release the merger with Conditioned Air was an opportunity to secure his company’s future. “I want the company to continue to prosper and grow, and I want to give A/C Designs the best opportunity to sustain that growth,” he said. Naples-based Conditioned Air said the addition of A/C Designs makes it one of the largest residential HVAC companies in Florida. Terms of the deal were not announced.

Danny Stasny | Be the first to comment With the tryptophan worn off and a full recovery from the effects of over-consumption on Thanksgiving, Anna Maria Island anglers are back on the water. On calmer days, venturing into the Gulf of Mexico is a good bet as migratory species — kingfish, mackerel, bonito and sharks — are readily available to anglers working around structure. The artificial reefs are a good bet to check out as large bait schools are gathering in these areas. Other areas, such as hard bottom and ledges, can be prosperous, too. Although targeting migratory fish with free-lined baits is most exciting, don’t forget to try bottom fishing. Mangrove snapper, Key West grunts, grouper and kingfish are lurking down deep near the structure. You may even encounter a few flounder if you’re lucky. When it’s too windy and the seas are rough, anglers confined to the back country are finding action. Fishing the inland bays — Sarasota Bay north to Tampa Bay — presents opportunities to catch the popular trio of snook, redfish and spotted seatrout. Other species, such as jack crevalle, ladyfish, bluefish and Spanish mackerel are present in these waters, providing anglers with a variety of options. And with water temps in the mid to lower 70s, the potential for pompano should be on your mind. It might be worth doing a little drifting and jigging over your favorite areas to target the fish. The drop in water temperature makes it necessary to carry a few dozen live shrimp in addition to the live shiners. When water temps drop, some species will eat a shrimp and you many encounter a species like pompano, which only eat shrimp. So keep a few in the Flow-Troll bucket among your shiners. Also, don’t forget that snook season will close Dec. 15. So if you haven’t gotten your keeper-size snook, you’d better get after it, as your time is running out. This is the last year snook will be open in December. In 2024, snook season will end Nov. 30. On my Just Reel charters, I’m spending as much time as possible in the Gulf of Mexico, where kingfish and Spanish mackerel are the main bite, with nice examples being caught of both species. Bonito and shark are in the mix, as well as some unexpected hookups on amberjack. Hooking into the AJs in depths of 40-50 feet in state waters is not a common occurrence. So any opportunities to do so are welcome. In the backcountry, I’m finding snook, reds and trout accommodating, although the bite requires more patience than the bite in the Gulf. Capt. Johnny Mattay of Anna Maria Charters is spending most of his time fishing ledges and reefs in the Gulf when the seas are calm. Hogfish are the highlight of this bite while bottom fishing with shrimp or sandfleas. Mixed in are mangrove snapper, Key West grunts and porgies. Fishing live shiners as bait on the surface in these areas is resulting in catches of kingfish, Spanish mackerel and bonito. Fishing offshore with Mattay is yielding larger kings, as well as yellowtail snapper, amberjack and catch-and-release groupers. Jim Malfese at the Rod & Reel Pier says he’s seeing plenty of action occurring for anglers using live shrimp as bait. Both black and red drum are being caught when casting shrimp under the pier on a weighted rig. Pier anglers might need to use heavier gear as some of these fish are over-slot. Reds and black drum exceeding 30 inches can be hard to curtail, especially around the barnacle encrusted pilings under the pier. Some slot- and over-slot snook are being caught, which also requires stout gear if the angler hopes to stand a chance at landing one. For anglers with light spinning gear, migratory fish such as blue runners, jack crevalle, ladyfish and mackerel are available. Try casting silver spoons or speck rigs to get hooked up. Capt. David White of Anna Maria Charters is finding good action while working offshore in the Gulf. Mangrove snapper and yellowtail snapper are being reeled up and finding their way into the ice chest. Migratory species such as blackfin tuna and kingfish also are being caught while offshore. Moving in closer to the beaches, White’s anglers are finding good results with bonito and macks, as well as plenty of sharks. Finally, on the flats of Tampa Bay, White is putting clients on snook, redfish and jack crevalle. Send high-resolution photos and fishing reports to fish@islander.org.

(AP) — Shohei Ohtani opened his first news conference with the Los Angeles Dodgers by dodging questions about whether he had a second Tommy John surgery. “At the time of the announcement, we didn\'t know which way we were going to go. That\'s why I never said what type of procedure was going to be done,” Ohtani said Thursday at a news conference to discuss his record $700 million, 10-year contract. It was Ohtani’s first time speaking with the media since Aug. 9, two weeks before a pitching injury that required surgery with Dodgers head team physician Dr. Neal ElAttrache on Sept. 19 and will keep him off the mound until 2025. Ohtani had Tommy John surgery with ElAttrache on Oct. 1, 2018. “I’m not obviously an expert in the medical field, but it was a procedure,"" Ohtani said. ""I’m not sure what it’s called, I know it was completely different from my first time, so I don’t know what you what to call it. You could probably talk to my doctor about that.” Ohtani refused to say what other teams he negotiated with before the agreement last weekend. “Free agency is still going on and I don\'t really want to mess with their plans and I don\'t want to say anything wrong, so I don\'t want to really talk about what I had talks with with other organizations,” he said through translator Ippei Mizuhara. Ohtani did, however, reveal the name of his dog, seen on his lap when he appeared on the MLB Network for the announcement of his second MVP award on Nov. 16. The dog has the American name “Decoy” and a Japanese name, “Dekopin” or “Decopin” depending on the transliteration. He wore a navy business suit with a white shirt and blue tie, took off the jacket and put on a Dodgers home jersey with No. 17 and then the blue cap with the interlocking L&A. He took off the cap before speaking. “One thing that really stands out in my head,” he said, “when I had the meeting with the Dodgers, the ownership group, they said when they looked back at the last 10 years, even though they made the playoffs every single year, won one World Series ring, they considered that a failure. And when I heard that, I knew they were all about winning, and that\'s exactly how I feel.” Ohtani never reached the playoffs in six seasons with the Los Angeles Angels. An electronic sign flashed “Welcome to the Dodgers, Shohei Ohtani” in English and Japanese above the stage. Ohtani thanked controlling owner Mark Walter, team president Stan Kasten, president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman, general manager Brandon Gomes and manager Dave Roberts. The Dodgers had attempted to sign Ohtani out of high school before he joined the Nippon Ham Fighters. ""Shohei is arguably the most-talented player who has ever played this game,"" Friedman said, flanked by Ohtani and Walter. “One of our goals is to have baseball fans in Japan convert to Dodger blue.” A unique two-way star as both a hitter and pitcher, the 29-year-old Japanese sensation left the Angels as a free agent after six years. He’s moving 30 miles up Interstate 5 after the Dodgers won out over the competition in a deal announced Monday. He said he made his decision Friday night, on the eve of his announcement. Ohtani also thanked the Angels during a news conference started shortly after 3 p.m. (8 a.m. Friday in Japan). “It was a fun ride, a great ride for the last six years. ... I’ll never forget all the memories I have,” he said. “There’s always sadness leaving teams. Last time it was the Fighters and in this case it was the Angels.” The two-time AL MVP has a .274 batting average with 171 homers, 437 RBIs and 86 stolen bases along with a 39-19 record with a 3.01 ERA and 608 strikeouts in 481 2/3 innings. Ohtani has 34.7 Wins Above Replacement (WAR), per Baseball Reference. Ohtani’s unusual contract calls for annual salaries of $70 million and of each year’s salary, $68 million is deferred with no interest, payable in equal installments each July 1 from 2034-43. Kasten said Ohtani\'s agent, Nez Balelo, proposed the deferred money last Friday, when there were false reports of a possible deal with Toronto. “Once Shohei had finished meeting with everyone, they said: Here\'s what it would take. What do you think?” Kasten said. Deferred money lowered the annual charge to the Dodgers\' luxury tax payroll to about $46 million, lowering their competitive balance tax. “I figured if I can defer as much money as I can, if that\'s going to help the CBT and that\'s going help the Dodgers be able to sign better players and make a better team, I felt like that was worth it,” he said. Ohtani can opt out of the deal if either Walter or Friedman no longer is with the team, a person told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the terms were not announced. “Everybody has to be on the same page in order to have a winning organization,"" Ohtani said. ""I feel like those two are at the top of it and they’re in control of everything. And I feel almost like I’m having a contract with those two guys. And I feel like if one of them are gone ... things might get a little out of control so I just wanted a safety net.” Said Friedman: “Obviously, it’s really flattering but also it’s a non-factor for me.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB'}]"

We have come a long way and it’s just amazing to see.” Kayla Armand, a second-year animal science major, said, “It makes me feel good being around others who are passionate about reaching their goals.” Arianna Harper, a fourth year business administration major, said, “It feels great to be at the best school in the world.” A third year Business Administration major from Miami, Nevoy Sheppard, said, “Being a part of the No. 1 HBCU makes me feel like I am surrounded by Black excellence and pushes me to be great.” Not only does the new ranking look good on paper for the university, but it seems to have a positive effect on student morale. The FAMU pride has continued to rise with new achievements.'}]"

The company said its hotels would include unexpected exterior color palettes, lush landscapes and spacious full-service bars, with more to come as the management team looks at each hotel’s business and social communities to fill gaps not answered by the long-standing franchise models. “Our first hotel is in a community that holds large conferences, so we’re building 4,500-square feet of meeting space, which is probably five times more than the brand would normally offer,” Odom said. “We’re determined to make our standard the new standard.” The first will be located at Freedom Tech Center in Fort Walton Beach. The Jay Odom Group is an industry leader in the development of master-planned communities, real estate investment, property management, hotels, resorts and mixed-use districts, its press release said. Established in 1987, the company’s portfolio includes such places as Crystal Beach Development, Destiny and Destin Jet in the Destin area; Hammock Bay and Draper J office building in Walton County; and Freedom Tech Center, The Island, Uptown Station, JG Plaza and the Emily Odom Institute in the Fort Walton Beach area, plus more than 20 other subsidiary companies.'}]"

As most of you know, our efforts to frighten the lunch out of the American electorate by repeatedly showing videos of isolated criminal activity and claiming cities led by Democrats have burned to the ground have been wildly successful. A recent Gallup poll found that 63% of Americans “describe the crime problem in the U.S. as either extremely or very serious, up from 54% when last measured in 2021.” That’s fantastic progress! Even better, that same poll shows that only 17% of Americans “say the crime problem in their local area is extremely or very serious.” That shows how effectively we’re convincing people that Democratic President Joe Biden has turned the country into a criminal hellscape, even though those same people see no actual evidence to that effect. That’s what we in the panic-inducing narrative business call a win-win! What could go wrong? Trump as a dictator? Republicans assure us it was a joke. Unfortunately, some inconvenient facts have come along that threaten to undermine the hard and patriotic work we’ve put into convincing our beloved Republican voters that their country is a wasteland ravaged by violent, drug-fueled leftists. New FBI data comparing crime from January through September of this year with the same period last year shows a number of disturbing (for us) trends: All told, these are terrible numbers for us. Crime data analyst Jeff Asher at AH Datalytics has the murder rate down 12.6% over last year, and recently wrote that this could be “either the largest or one of the largest national declines in murder on record.” He also wrote: “To put some of this in perspective, a 4 percent decline in the nation’s violent crime rate relative to 2022’s reported rate would lead to the lowest violent crime rate nationally since 1969.” I realize this is depressing news for all of us. But to maintain the success we’ve had at getting Americans to believe something that is demonstrably false, we’re going to have to double our disingenuity. Liberals, enough already: Democrats need to pull themselves together and remember: Biden is still better than Trump Recently our friends at the National Retail Federation tried their best, releasing what The New York Times called a “startling estimate that 'organized retail crime’ was responsible for nearly half the $94.5 billion in store merchandise that disappeared in 2021, a figure that helped amplify claims that the United States was experiencing a nationwide wave of shoplifting.” Sadly, facts intervened again and the federation had to retract that claim, as apparently retail theft is down, the group was using faulty data and an expert reported that “organized groups were likely responsible for just about 5 percent of the store merchandise that disappeared.” Still, kudos to the National Retail Federation for its effort to propagate our narrative. Better to have lied and lost than to have never lied at all. To keep Americans from learning about these so-called numbers that allegedly represent “what is actually happening around us,” we propose the following narrative-protecting steps: In conclusion, keep fighting the good fight and don’t let America’s falling crime rates get you down. We were able to get a shocking number of people to believe Donald Trump was a good president. Surely we can keep them believing America is a lawless land of unchecked criminals and rabid death merchants, contradictory data be damned!""}]"

In this article, we will explore the benefits of using resume builder websites, explicitly focusing on Resumebuild.com as an excellent choice. We will also highlight some examples of the website’s features and functionalities that set it apart. Resumebuild is a leading resume builder website that offers job seekers many features and benefits. Here are some reasons why Resumebuild stands out among its competitors: In today’s fast-paced world, where distractions are abundant and stress levels are soaring, the need for mindfulness has never been more crucial. Mindfulness is a powerful practice that allows individuals to cultivate a heightened sense of awareness and fully engage with the present moment. Its benefits extend beyond mental and emotional well-being, as it also impacts physical health and overall life satisfaction. In this article, we will delve into the profound effects of mindfulness and provide insights on how to incorporate it into your daily routine. At its core, mindfulness involves directing our attention to the present moment, without judgment or attachment. It encourages individuals to observe their thoughts, emotions, and sensations, fostering a non-reactive and non-judgmental attitude towards them. By doing so, mindfulness cultivates self-awareness and helps us develop a deeper understanding of ourselves and our experiences. Practicing mindfulness on a regular basis has shown remarkable benefits for mental and emotional well-being. Research has demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. Mindfulness meditation has been shown to activate the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain responsible for executive functions such as attention, self-regulation, and decision-making. This activation promotes emotional regulation, increases resilience, and enhances overall psychological well-being. Beyond its impact on mental and emotional well-being, mindfulness has also been linked to numerous physical health benefits. Studies have found that mindfulness practices can lower blood pressure, reduce chronic pain, and alleviate symptoms associated with various conditions, including insomnia and gastrointestinal disorders. By reducing stress levels, mindfulness promotes a healthier immune system, cardiovascular system, and overall physical well-being. Mindfulness can also revolutionize the way we interact with others. By cultivating present-moment awareness, we become more attentive, empathetic, and compassionate. These qualities foster healthier and more fulfilling relationships, both personal and professional. Mindfulness helps us to truly listen and understand others, creating stronger connections and reducing conflicts. It also enables us to respond skillfully to challenging situations, rather than reacting impulsively, leading to more harmonious interactions. Incorporating mindfulness into your daily routine doesn’t have to be a daunting task. Here are a few practical strategies to get started: As HVAC systems become more complex and sophisticated, the demand for skilled HVAC technicians continues to rise. HVAC technicians are responsible for installing, maintaining, and repairing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in homes, businesses, and industrial settings. With the demand for these services on the rise, many people are curious about the salary of HVAC technicians. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual salary for HVAC technicians in 2021 was $51,420. However, the salary range for HVAC technicians can vary depending on several factors, including experience, education, location, and industry. Experience is one of the primary factors that can impact an HVAC technician’s salary. Those who have been in the industry for several years and have gained experience and expertise are likely to earn a higher salary. Additionally, HVAC technicians with specialized skills such as commercial HVAC, refrigeration, or geothermal systems installation and repair can command a higher salary. Education is another factor that can impact an HVAC technician’s salary. Those with an associate’s or bachelor’s degree in HVAC technology or a related field can earn a higher salary than those without formal education. Continuing education and certifications in areas like energy efficiency, air quality, or green technology can also boost an HVAC technician’s earning potential. Location also plays a significant role in an HVAC technician’s salary. In areas with a high cost of living, HVAC technicians can expect to earn a higher salary. Additionally, HVAC technicians working in urban areas or regions with extreme temperatures may earn a higher salary due to the increased demand for HVAC services. Finally, the industry in which an HVAC technician works can also impact their salary. For example, HVAC technicians working in the manufacturing industry may earn a higher salary due to the specialized nature of the work. Additionally, HVAC technicians who work for the government or in the healthcare industry may earn a higher salary due to the nature of the work and the need for specialized HVAC systems. Quantum computing is a new technology that is set to revolutionize the way we think about computing. Traditional computers rely on a binary system of ones and zeros to perform calculations, but quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This enables quantum computers to perform calculations exponentially faster than traditional computers, making them ideal for solving complex problems that are beyond the capabilities of classical computers. The potential applications of quantum computing are vast and varied. For example, quantum computers could be used to optimize supply chains, develop new materials, and simulate complex biological systems. They could also be used to solve optimization problems that are difficult or impossible to solve with classical computers, such as the traveling salesman problem or the knapsack problem. One of the most exciting aspects of quantum computing is its potential to revolutionize cryptography. Traditional encryption methods rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers, but quantum computers are able to solve this problem in a matter of minutes. This means that quantum computers could potentially break many of the encryption methods that are currently used to secure online transactions, emails, and other sensitive data. However, quantum computers could also be used to develop new encryption methods that are immune to attacks by classical computers. Despite its enormous potential, quantum computing is still in its early stages of development. Quantum computers are notoriously difficult to build and operate, and they require specialized knowledge and expertise. However, major tech companies such as IBM, Google, and Microsoft are investing heavily in quantum computing research, and many experts predict that quantum computers will become more widely available in the coming years.

In other words, the committee can arbitrarily determine that winning is less important than losing to the “right” teams. That should infuriate every fan, coach and player in the country. It’s not right. Unfortunately, we know the committee will not reverse its decision and rightly reward FSU for its hard-fought, undefeated season, so maximum transparency is needed to explain why this happened. Until we have transparency, the justified perception of an unfair system will prevail: that the committee has wrongly disregarded the known strengths of an undefeated team over the speculated impact of losing a single player. That’s another diversion from the precedent set by the committee in previous years. Remember, in 2014, the committee did not punish Ohio State University’s team for the loss of quarterback J.T. Barrett to a season-ending injury suffered during its regular season finale against the University of Michigan. Like FSU, Ohio State was forced to rely on its third string quarterback, Cardale Jones, to win its conference championship. Unlike FSU, which remains undefeated, the one-loss 2014 Ohio State Buckeyes were selected as the 4th ranked team. Ultimately, Ohio State won the CFP Final, earning them a National Championship. The Seminoles may have repeated this incredible feat with their second string quarterback, Tate Rodemaker, but the committee’s decision has now made that impossible. In my letter to Chairman Corrigan, I requested that the committee immediately respond to a number of questions to ensure that there was full transparency behind its decision to remove FSU from playoff contention. If the committee believes it made the right choice, then responding to my letter and being very transparent about why this happened should be the easiest thing in the world for them to do. We need to know how each member of the committee voted; what private communications, if any, they had with each other, or any individuals affiliated with ESPN or the Southeastern Conference (SEC); and whether any members recused themselves from this process. It would also be informative to understand the committee’s ethical and conflict of interest standards. The CFP system was created to produce a more fair and just method for selecting the best teams in college football. Unfortunately, the decision it made this week to axe FSU from the playoffs has called into question the integrity of its process. There is a lot of speculation that this decision was made based on some financial calculation. It’s hard to know if that’s true until we see the documents I’ve requested from the CFP. I truly hope that is not the case. Next year we will have a 12-team playoff but that alone won’t solve this problem. We need answers and college football fans, especially the FSU faithful, should not stand down until this committee gives an appropriate response to this wildly concerning decision.

The child was swimming with her brother, when the two became caught in a rip current, according to rescuer Will Parard. Parard, a chef for the Anna Maria Oyster Bar family of restaurants, was fishing that day from a jetty at Cortez Beach. What started as a quiet afternoon of fishing turned into a rescue. “It was pretty slow, no bites, there wasn’t anybody really swimming in the water between tower 2 and tower 3. I was there for maybe 15-20 minutes,” he said. “I was in a daydream and heard somebody screaming. I looked up and saw the mom, who was out waist-deep in the water, screaming, ‘My son needs help!’” he recalled. “I saw a boy with a pool float caught in a riptide near the end of the jetty. He had almost made it out past the end of the jetty,” Parard said. “The swell was heavy; the current was ripping.” He and another man, Ray Arica, jumped off the jetty to help the boy. Parard said the Arica reached the boy first. As they began to swim the boy to shore, the child asked his rescuers about his sister. There was no girl on the surface nearby. The men started looking underwater and Arica noticed a child’s foot sinking out of view. He pulled the unconscious girl from under the surface and gave her to Parard. While Arica set out swimming with the boy to shore, Parard said he began swimming against the current to get the girl to medical attention. “I didn’t even think about the riptide and I just started swimming as hard as I could towards shore, straight in.” Parard said as soon as he got close to shore people came running. “I just started screaming for help and the two guys who ran down the beach just happened to be doctors,” Parard said. “They grabbed her from me, flipped her upside down and she immediately started dumping sand and water out of her mouth and nose,” he said. “The ambulance showed up very quickly and in a matter of minutes and I could hear them talking to her.” Manatee County’s beach patrol and emergency medical services teams responded, along with the Bradenton Beach Police Department. The girl regained consciousness but only partially. Paramedics determined she required transport by trauma helicopter to Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg. She was taken by EMS to the Coquina North Boat Ramp to meet the medical helicopter. The police report stated the girl was in critical condition upon her arrival at All Children’s but Bradenton Beach Police Lt. Lenard Diaz told The Islander Sept. 7 that the child was stable and expected to fully recover. “I am just so thankful that I was there in that moment,” Parard said. He told The Islander Sept. 10 that he felt as though people involved in the rescue were in the right place at the right time. “From him pulling her up, to me being able to swim through the riptide, to there being two doctors on the beach to take her out of my arms, to the ambulance being so fast. It was an amazing set of circumstances that allowed her to survive,” he said. Asked how he felt to have saved a life, Parard responded: “It’s all still setting in. It was a life-changing experience and I look at the world a lot brighter now.” To advertise here, please visit our rates pageor contact us at:sales@islander.orgPhone: (941) 778-7978Fax: (941) 778-9392 The Islander Wishbook – 2023 get it here My summer reading list includes … View Results Email address: Sign up to receive FREE email alerts when we update our site with news and classfieds.

plus d’une semaine maintenant, l’effondrement soudain de deux banques régionales de taille moyenne a eu l’effet d’un tremblement de terre en Californie, et s’est accentué à travers les États-Unis et même en Europe. Les contrecoups ont été rapidement sentis ici en Floride. Ces récentes faillites bancaires ont intensifié les inquiétudes de la population et des banques régionales partout au pays, mais les mesures du gouvernement devraient aider à calmer les marchés, et les consommateurs ! La Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation est intervenue et a saisi la Silicon Valley Bank, qui prêtait principalement de l’argent à des start-up technologiques. C’est quand même la plus grande banque à faire faillite depuis la crise financière de 2008. Pour apaiser les inquiétudes concernant la santé du système bancaire dans son ensemble, les régulateurs ont pris le contrôle de la Signature Bank quelques jours plus tard. Pour les consommateurs inquiets de leurs avoirs dans ces banques en faillite, leurs fonds sont heureusement en sécurité, jusqu’à concurrence de 250 000 $. Selon Bloomberg, ces banques montraient des signes de détresse. Est-ce que les banques régionales en Floride sont solides et quel impact potentiel aura l’effondrement de ces deux institutions bancaires sur les taux d’intérêt ? La Réserve fédérale est sous pression pour sa réunion de mars, qui aura lieu juste après la sortie de cette édition du Soleil de la Floride, quant à savoir si elle augmentera à nouveau les taux d’intérêt, Indraneel Chakraborty, professeur de finance à l’Université de Miami, déclarait la semaine dernière que « lorsque les taux d’intérêt augmentent, le portefeuille et l’actif de la banque diminuent de valeur car ils sont à un taux inférieur à ce que le marché supporte actuellement ». Avec l’indice des prix à la consommation publié le 14 mars, il est clair que l’augmentation de 6 % sur l’an dernier fait mal au commun des mortels. Malgré un léger ralentissement de l’inflation en février, les prix restent encore élevés. L’impact se fait sentir dans les familles. Quant au tourisme, l’un des trois grands moteurs de l’économie floridienne, il est en plein élan post-pandémique et son affaiblissement n’est pas encore en vue. Marcos Kerbel, professeur de finance à la Florida International University, estime que « la Réserve fédérale devrait continuer à augmenter les taux pour stopper ce cycle et ralentir l’économie ». Les experts disent que les récentes faillites bancaires ont intensifié les inquiétudes des banques régionales, mais selon Kerbel, les mesures du gouvernement devraient aider à calmer les marchés. Bien que les prix des logements restent élevés, il y a de bonnes nouvelles pour les acheteurs potentiels. « Les taux hypothécaires ont chuté en réponse aux récentes turbulences bancaires », rapporte le Mortgage News Daily.

gray atop my head gets more pronounced, the years seem to come and go faster than ever before. It\'s hard to believe 2023 will soon be a memory and 2024 upon us. It was a rough 2022 for me and 2023 started out just as bad personally. My wife\'s mother passed away and a longtime friend was arrested on child pornography charges. Thankfully things took a drastic turn and we celebrated some truly wonderful things like my son getting married, family reconciliations and great trips to South Carolina and Alaska. And if 2023 proved anything to me it\'s the absolute fact that no matter what is going on, life still goes on. Some things seem to have no end in sight, such as the audit of former County Commissioner Bryan Lober\'s spending that expanded to include a full examination of the use of purchasing cards by the five Brevard County Commission offices initiated in the spring of 2022. It\'s been more than a year since County Clerk Rachel Sadoff asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to assist in the investigation last November. And speaking of probes, current County Commissioner John Tobia is being investigated by state authorities as well for alleged voter fraud. This one bears a close eye as Tobia is running for the Supervisor of Elections post here in Brevard. We\'ve seen some familiar faces take over some high-profile positions such as new Brevard County School Superintendent Mark Rendell (see more below) and U.S. Space Force Col. Robert Long, who retired earlier this year after commanding Space Launch Delta 30 at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California and now heads up Space Florida as president and CEO. We also welcomed new faces, like that of John Nicklow who left his post as president of the University of New Orleans to take over at Florida Tech. Arrivals are typically made possible because of departures and we definitely experienced some of those, including a few who were helped out the door. Assistant State Attorney Bryon Aven finally turned in his resignation papers after pleading guilty to charges brought by the Florida Bar that he presented and encouraged false testimony during a 2022 battery case. He is barred from practicing law for two years. Also shown the door was Cocoa Beach Police Chief Scott Rosenfeld, who came under fire for alleged bullying, sexism and toxicity in the department. Leading the investigation was Cocoa Beach City Manager Robin Hayes, who resigned herself earlier this month. It\'s unclear what prompted Hayes to resign. Palm Bay City Councilman Peter Filiberto resigned early in the year after being arestesd on felony drug charges. West Melbourne Mayor Hal Rose resigned this year as well after some back-n-forth battling over his residency. There were some things to celebrate, too. William Dillon marked his 15th year of freedom after being exonerated for a murder he did not commit and spending 27 years in prison. Cocoa notched yet another state title in high school football (see below) and foodies relished in the long-anticipated opening of Chef Ercan Ekinci’s Urban Prime Marketplace and Restaurant in Viera. Rockets are being launched in record numbers (see below) and we went a full year without a hurricane — though we did have a tornado, record heat and other weird weather. Here in no particular order are the top 10 stories we covered locally in 2023: Crosley Green, believed by many to be innocent of the crimes he was convicted of in 1990, returned to prison to serve out the rest of his life sentence after the US Supreme Court refused to consider his appeal. Green, 65, spent nearly two years as a ""free"" man in Titusville under house arrest after a federal court overturned his conviction. He was allowed the limited freedom while the state appealed the ruling. After the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Green\'s conviction in late 2022, he was permitted to remain free pending the US Supreme Court. More: Torres: Nothing to do with Crosley Green now except enjoy some ice cream. Green returned to prison in April. His attorneys continue to seek avenues of freedom on his behalf. ""The last two years have been the best years of my life,"" Green said, before turning himself in. ""I reunited with my family and met my grandkids for the first time. I learned a new job that I really love. I\'ve enjoyed worshiping with my church in Titusville. And I\'ve begun new relationships that have changed my life. I would like to live the years I have left in freedom and peace."" — John A. Torres In May, the Brevard County School Board chose Mark Rendell, then-principal at Cocoa Beach Jr./Sr. High School, as its next superintendent. Rendell was chosen from a list of 33 applicants. The board did not unanimously vote for Rendell, with Katye Campbell and Jennifer Jenkins voting against his selection, citing concerns about the choice further dividing both the board and community. They also brought up concerns about his controversial exit from Indian River County, where he served as superintendent from 2015 to 2019. Both board members felt two other finalists were more qualified. Since he took the reigns in June, Rendell has been faced with the challenges of interpreting and implementing vague state rules, like guidelines about what can and can\'t be taught in AP Psychology, the need for parental approval on all extra curricular activities and more. He has approached these challenges with caution, saying he wants to protect both students and teachers from legal repercussions. More: Brevard school board chooses Mark Rendell as new superintendent Rendell, the only candidate with history in Brevard County, began as a teacher for BPS in 1993 and was later an assistant principal before becoming principal at Titusville High School in 2001. He left for other jobs in 2006 but returned to helm Cocoa Beach Jr./Sr. High School in 2019. — Finch Walker By the week before Halloween, the Space Coast had already shattered its record for orbital launches in a single year. And unprecedented launch traffic keeps racking up from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. More: SpaceX Falcon 9 mission Monday night ends 11-day launch drought from Florida\'s Space Coast For more than a half century, Brevard County’s longstanding record of 29 orbital launches dated to the conclusion of the Gemini program in 1966. That record increased to 30 in 2020 and 31 in 2021 — before rocketing up to 57 last year. In 2023, it was smashed as launches topped 70. And in a November speech on Merritt Island, Florida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez predicted the Space Coast will host more than 100 launches in 2024. — Rick Neale Port Canaveral was one of Brevard County\'s economic powerhouses during 2023. It began the year surpassing PortMiami as the world\'s busiest cruise port, based on passenger volume. Miami recaptured the crown by the end of 2023, but Port Canaveral still had a stellar year. Port Canaveral had a 66.5% increase in passenger volume in the 2022-23 budget year that ended Sept. 30, rising to 6.78 million arriving and departing passengers, up from 4.07 million in 2021-22. It also posted record operating revenue of $190.75 million and record profits of $88.73 million. More than $158 million ― or 82.8% ― of its operating revenue came from cruise ships and cruise passenger parking. The port\'s cargo business set records as well. More: Port Canaveral loses title of world\'s busiest cruise port after one year to Miami Port Canaveral this winter is home to 13 multiday cruise ships from five cruise lines ― Carnival, Disney, MSC, Norwegian and Royal Caribbean. By the end of 2024, two more cruise lines ― Celebrity and Princess ― will base ships at Port Canaveral, and the port will have at least 16 home-ported ships in the winter of 2024-25. The port also helps boost the Space Coast\'s overall tourism market, because many cruise passengers stay at local hotels before or after their cruises. They also eat at local restaurants, shop as local stores and visit local attractions. — Dave Berman Brevard County death row inmate James Barnes was executed by lethal injection in August at Florida State Prison northwest of Starke. Barnes was put to death for brutally raping and murdering Melbourne nurse Patricia “Patsy” Miller inside her condominium in 1988. After killing her, he set her bed on fire with her body in it. He was also convicted of strangling his estranged wife, Linda, and leaving her body inside a bedroom closet in 1997 in her home near West Melbourne. More: Torres: Murderer\'s family anxiously awaits his execution The day of his execution, Barnes neither requested a last meal nor gave a final statement. ""James Barnes was a violent and ruthless criminal,"" Melbourne Police Chief David Gillespie said via email. Barnes became the first Brevard death row inmate to be executed since Mark Dean Schwab was put to death in July 2008. The Cocoa High'}]"

New stories, special moments and unforgettable memories are ready to be made in Scotland in 2023. From January through to December there are plenty of reasons why Scotland should be at the top of any travel bucket list. Start the year with Burns Night Celebrations across the country, watch the blooming of bluebells, snowdrops, and fresh fauna, welcoming new wildlife in spring, before gearing up for a festival extravaganza in the summer months. Then comes the turning of the leaves casting a golden blanket over the luscious landscapes before winter rolls round again and the year closes with the sound of fireworks and revelry at Hogmanay celebrations far and wide. There are cabins aplenty positioned under the stars for views that are out of this world, lush green forests and spectacular waterfalls spraying mists that are reinvigoratingly cool, and intimate gigs where revellers can dance the night away. So, whether seeking adventure or tranquillity, shopping or feasting – or a taste of it all – those who venture to Scotland will find a world of choices at their fingertips. And as always, visitors can expect a warm welcome awaiting them! There are many reasons to make Scotland the place to be in 2023, the list below is just a selection of some of the major openings, news updates and events to look forward to in the year ahead. 2023 highlights Celtic Connections 30th Anniversary, January 2023 Celtic Connections, the home of world-class music, one-off collaborations, and genre-defying spectacles, is set to celebrate its 30th anniversary in January 2023. The 30th Anniversary is a pinnacle moment for the festival as it recognises the advancements and achievements of the last thirty years and everything the organisers have overcome to bring people together in a defining cultural celebration. The internationally renowned festival marks this milestone with an ambitious and eclectic programme of music showcased between Thursday 19th January – Sunday 5th February 2023. The full programme can be viewed here: www.celticconnections.com Dundreggan Rewilding Centre, March 2023 Opening in 2023, Dundreggan Rewilding Centre will be Trees for Life’s flagship rewilding estate, a unique place rich in natural and cultural heritage where real change is happening, restoring Scotland’s landscape. The new wild landscape and its ancient connections to Gaelic culture will encourage people to ‘rewild’ themselves by connecting with nature and exploring the heritage of the Highlands. Dundreggan Rewilding Centre will become a gateway for people to experience rewilding in ways that are best suited to them; from a casual visit while passing through, to immersive experiences, encouraging the idea that we can work with nature rather than against it. V&A Dundee – Tartan, April 2023 In its fifth anniversary year, V&A Dundee will offer a radical new look at one of the world’s best-known fabrics through its flagship exhibition: Tartan. Tartan, the first major exhibition curated by V&A Dundee, with consultant curator \u200b\u200bJonathan Faiers of the University of Southampton, will celebrate the global story of a unique pattern which has connected communities worldwide, expressed tradition, revolt and diversity, and inspired playful and provocative design. It is a complex, rich, and sometimes painful history unequalled by any other cloth or pattern. Tartan is a textile which is adored and derided, inspiring great works of art and design, and representative of unity and dissent, tradition and rebellion. Moreover, V&A Dundee, the first V&A museum in the world outside London, will celebrate its fifth anniversary in September 2023.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 10:11 pm On Tuesday the 21st of November, the courtyard of Florida City’s City Hall was illuminated with purple lights to help promote Epilepsy Awareness Month. Partnering with the nonprofit Epilepsy Alliance Florida for the event, both Mayor Otis Wallace and Vice Mayor Walter Thompson spoke about the impact of epilepsy in the community and the need for awareness and understanding of the disease. Before the event, Epilepsy Alliance Florida President and CEO Karen Egozi told the News Leader that the Alliance’s mission was first to support the approximately 426,000 Floridians who suffer from epilepsy and their families including financial assistance for health care for those in need. She also spoke of the additional mission of education about epilepsy and how to react to seizures in schools and other public locations. She emphasized that working to educate teachers, First Responders and the public helps to de-stigmatize and support those around 1 in 26 individuals who will suffer from epilepsy at some point in their life.

The target was preemption – legislation that specifies powers reserved to the state alone and bars locally added controls. More-frequent preemptions have centralized powers in the Florida Legislature and governor at the expense of county and city commissioners and mayors, who resent being penned into narrower roles. Not all preemption is wrong. A long-standing prohibition on a city or county income tax, for example, seems proper in a state that has consistently avoided such a tax itself. But local governments that feel closer to the needs of their residents lament that the state often insists on one-size-fits-all solutions to issues that may hit rural North Florida much differently than an urban metropolis like Miami-Dade County. In a long and geographically diverse state, needs often diverge. In 2022, for example, the state preempted localities from targeting large rent jumps. Rent hikes in smaller areas at the time differed markedly from runaway rises in South Florida during the pandemic as housing demand skyrocketed with an influx of New Yorkers and others. While Miami Today never supports rent controls, we understand why urban governments might look to such a panacea in a housing crunch. The state, however, made that option impossible, taking it off the table at a crucial time. Beyond rent levels, the state has preempted localities from tenant protections – for example, controlling terms of evictions. Likewise, the state has prevented cities and counties from using health and environmental controls that might be less vital in Tallahassee than Miami. For example, Florida preempted to the state alone regulation of smoking, making an exception to allow local smoking rules in public beaches or parks – but oddly preempting non-filtered cigars. Is protecting the non-filtered cigar really a state matter? Another issue has been environmental control of throw-away plastics and Styrofoam. Waterfront communities sought controls that the legislature rejected in 2008 as it preempted local regulation of auxiliary containers, wrappings or disposable plastic bags. Then in 2016 it preempted local regulation of polystyrene products. Likewise, the state has kept to itself the power to regulate guns and bullets, barring more stringent local controls than exist in rural counties, where hunting is a way of life and urban crime is nil. When Key West tried to limit cruise vessels calling or the number of passengers entering the city, the state prevented it. While Miami has arms open wide for cruise ships and passengers, we appreciate why a tiny city on very limited land might not be so welcoming. The needs of the cities differ, but the state says the rules must be the same in both. Preemptions seem tied to Tallahassee’s bias against local governments and its effort to centralize power. For example, new Florida law allows any business to sue for damages if local legislation cuts into the business’s profits by 15% or might do so. The threat of such lawsuits can hang over governments as they try to regulate anything. A high-profile example of state versus local power is the attack on Miami-Dade’s control of expressways that lie only within county limits. A state-created expressway board on which the governor controls most of the seats is trying to take over those tollways. That battle goes on in court. Local governments walk on eggshells with the state because it controls funds that they need. It’s not uncommon that Miami-Dade agendas include requests to Tallahassee for money. What was unusual last week was commissioners’ gentle pushback by passing resolutions against state controls on how the county can serve its residents’ particular needs. A resolution by Micky Steinberg asked the legislature to adopt a bill already filed for 2024 that would remove past preemptions of local regulation of Styrofoam, disposable plastic bags and wrappers. The other three resolutions seek to prevent future state preemptions. One by Ms. Steinberg opposes a 2024 state bill to further preempt cities and counties from regulating short-term vacation rentals. Miami-Dade has had regulations since 2017, updated in 2020, in dealing with Airbnb and HomeAway. Ms. Steinberg’s resolution cites needs to deal with safety, security, noise, traffic and quality of life and the potential need for fines greater than the $300 that the state bill specifies. In a third resolution, Ms. Steinberg opposes bills for 2024 that would reserve to the state the power to regulate dredging and filling. She notes current county regulations relating to dredging and filling in tidal waters of Biscayne Bay and in wetlands that protect water quality, quantity and supply. The bills, she said, would impair Miami-Dade’s efforts to protect the bay, manage stormwater and provide coastal protection against storms and sea level rise. Finally, a resolution by Eileen Higgins opposes a state bill to preempt wage, benefit, staffing or recruitment requirements on anyone doing business with a county. The legislation cites impacts on five existing Miami-Dade programs dealing with pay, business size, hiring area for workers and employment of county residents. She noted that the state’s minimum wage is $12 and Miami-Dade’s standard is $20.34 minimum, a local premium that she fears the state legislation would eliminate. Obviously, wages in high-cost South Florida differ from more rural areas. Needs of various areas of this growing state and its rapidly changing population mix vary vastly. The increasing efforts by Tallahassee to mold us all into a homogenous lump are misguided. Local governments know their areas’ needs better than a distant state government does and deserve the freedom to meet those needs. The entire state would be better off for more home-town control. © 2024 Miami Today. All Rights Reserved. E-Paper | Terms and Conditions | Site Map | Privacy Policy |'}]"

The credit would cover 50% of journalists’ compensation in the first year and 30% of compensation (up to $50,000) in the subsequent four years. This tax credit would only be available to local community papers with fewer than 750 employees and, if they don’t invest in their newsroom, they don’t get the credit. And these tax credits are only available to local newspapers. The importance of local newspapers and local business is the reason Reps. Tenney and DelBene introduced the legislation. We are most grateful for their support. We need your support, as well, to encourage legislators to enact this legislation. Please contact the offices of your senators and representatives in the U.S. Congress and encourage them to add their support to this legislation. These tax credits aren’t permanent; they will sunset in five years. But, these critical five years will allow the newspaper industry the time needed to address the challenges that it is facing from Big Tech, which often uses newspapers’ content without compensation, as well as other technological and market challenges. Visit www.usa.gov/electedofficials for the contact information for your legislators. More local reporting means more access for hometown news that citizens like you rely on. And stronger newspapers mean stronger advertising vehicles for local businesses.

Ron DeSantis’ opposition to almost all COVID-19 restrictions.“Given Florida’s reputation, or at least what DeSantis has tried to sell it as, with the ‘Free State of Florida’ [slogan] … if I’m a retiree, that’s what I associate Florida with,” Coleman said.But it also goes the other way, Isbell said, especially with headlines about the state’s new laws on abortion, schools, and gay rights, and even neo-Nazi groups. “If you’re a liberal retiree up in the Northeast, if you’re Jewish retiree in New York City right now, you see this stuff out of Florida, the Nazis and stuff, do you really think you’re going to come down here?” Isbell said.Even if liberals do come to Florida, they would probably avoid conservative places such as The Villages, the sprawling retirement community stretching across Marion, Sumter and Lake counties north of Orlando.“The Villages does not have a mandate that you must be a registered Republican to live there, there’s no litmus test,” he said. “But if you’re a liberal retiree, you probably don’t care to move there, so it becomes kind of self-sorting.”‘Kind of a constant’It’s not just wealthier retirees, experts said. Working-class whites are also moving into the state.Polk County, the home of former Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles, “used to be more of a rural, Democratic type of county,” Coleman said. “You have a lot of migrants now from the Midwest there who don’t really have any attachment to that Democratic tradition. They vote Republican.”In 2016, Trump did well with working-class voters in the Midwest, Coleman said. “Well, those same types of voters have been moving to Florida. Those types of trends don’t happen in a vacuum.”Not all experts agree that migration is the main cause of the state becoming more conservative.Daniel A. Smith, the political science chair at the University of Florida, cited instead a drop in Democratic registration among younger voters.Republicans’ voter registration advantage over Democrats in Florida has grown to nearly 700,000 this year. There were more registered Democrats than Republicans in Florida as recently as 2021.Republicans moving to Florida, Smith said, “has been a trend for at least 60 years. … I don’t think that’s what’s causing the shift in terms of [more] Republicans. Frankly, that’s kind of a constant.”The culture warsNortheastern Republicans have tended to be more socially moderate than their Southern counterparts.Despite their influx, Florida has become a hotbed of the culture wars in recent years, with DeSantis signing laws such as the so-called “don’t say gay” bill, the “Stop WOKE Act” impacting schools and bills targeting transgender people.“Much of that can be put on the shoulders of DeSantis, for raising these issues that most of these transplants don’t give a hoot about,” Smith said of DeSantis’ focus on social issues ahead of his presidential campaign.Coleman said he was not surprised that there’s been no larger backlash or pushback from Northeastern Republican transplants.“If you’re attracting more fiscally conservative, culturally moderate voters? They still vote for Republicans,” Coleman said. “And if you vote for the Republicans, you don’t just get their fiscal policies, you get some of their social policies those voters would maybe have to hold their noses for.”With DeSantis’ wilting presidential campaign, culture war politics may be on the wane, Isbell said. But those issues won’t go away any time soon.“I still think they’ve overplayed their hand with it a bit,” Isbell said. “But the demographics will determine how governments operate. And the demographics of Florida right now say that while it’s not a Bible Belt state … you have retirees [in Central and South Florida] that are willing to just kind of go along with that.”Smith said many transplants may simply not care about what happens in schools.“These are folks who generally have paid high property taxes, they’ve gotten their children through public schools, and now they’re looking to wipe their hands clean,” Smith said. “… They’re happy to go into their gated communities and put those days behind them.”Florida vs. TexasFlorida is not the only state seeing an influx.Texas saw nearly 187,000 new residents move from elsewhere in the country between 2022 and 2023, and more than 656,000 since 2020.But the two states are trending in the opposite direction, Isbell said.“Florida came from the center, maybe leaning Democratic in the ‘90s, and moved further to the right, and then Texas has moved a bit further to the left,” Isbell said. “But they’re both still right of the country.”While Trump won Texas by about 5.5 points in 2020 and Florida by 3, Coleman said he believes that could soon flip.“One of my hot takes for the next election is that I would not be surprised if Texas ends up being closer than Florida,” Coleman said.Jim Henson, director of The Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, said new residents of Texas are “younger, and almost certainly more directly economically and occupationally driven,” in comparison to Florida.But he was more cautious about whether the states were moving apart politically.“The inner line suburbs are getting more Democratic, but slowly,” Henson said. “But the outer areas are [still] very Republican … So I’m not entirely ready to conclude this unambiguously pushes the state in a bluer, more purple direction.”The younger migration into Texas helped to give the state a leg up over Florida in one key area. From 2020 to 2023, there were more than 94,000 more deaths than births in Florida, while Texas had more than 407,000 more births than deaths.All those trends will play a role in the next reapportionment of congressional districts. The Brennan Center projected that while Florida is set to get three new seats in Congress in 2032, Texas could pick up four.‘Still very powerful’Georgia, along with North and South Carolina and Tennessee, is projected to pick up one new district thanks to similar influxes. But one reason Georgia is not trending Republican, Coleman said, is because the Atlanta suburbs are growing while its coast is largely undeveloped.“Just by virtue of not having much of a coastline, it can’t attract many of those types of conservative retirees,” Coleman said. “Which kind of was a net plus for Democrats.”The prevalence of increasingly expensive retirement communities along Florida coastlines could be what starts to slow the trends.Soaring homeowners insurance premiums and the impact of climate change, from rising seas to more and stronger hurricanes, are “slowly eroding that ‘cost of living’ argument,” Smith said. Hurricane Ian wreaked havoc on heavily Republican Lee County in 2022.“We’re seeing the housing prices going up partly because of the cost of insurance going up,” Smith said. “… People losing their house insurance because of high risk or paying a lot more is certainly a detriment.”While “the illusion still is very powerful in drawing folks from the Northeast down to Florida,” Smith added, “the cost of living actually is a little higher in most of Florida than many of the Midwest states.”For Democrats, though, a turnaround any time soon is not in the cards.“There’s no realistic demographic change that will suddenly [happen] in Florida,” Isbell said. … “Democrats are going to be behind, and they’re going to have to keep slowly building back. And there’s no magic switch or demographic swing that’s going to do that for them.” New estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau this month showed that movement is continuing, with hundreds of thousands of people leaving states such as New York, Illinois and California and moving to Florida and Texas in 2022 and 2023. “The notion of the ‘Big Sort’ … is really proving itself,” said Matt Isbell, a Democratic'}]"

began with hope that quickly faded to disappointment, while the year ended with a changing of the leadership guard among the Indian Trail Improvement District Board of Supervisors. Along the way, a judge’s decision vindicated ITID’s legal efforts to ward off what supervisors saw as encroachment on district roads by nearby Westlake’s developer, a major renovation to Acreage Community Park was completed and big facelift for Nicole Hornstein Equestrian Park was approved. Here is a look at major Acreage/Indian Trail happenings in 2023: January A bill calling for an incorporation referendum for the area’s 43,000 residents was approved unanimously by Palm Beach County Legislative Delegation members. Rep. Rick Roth took it before a committee of the legislature in Tallahassee. Roth put the chances of the bill’s passage at “a little better than 50 percent.” February The Palm Beach County Commission approved $3 million for the construction of an artificial turf, regulation-size football field and other improvements at Acreage Community Park. Other improvements planned for Phase 2 of the park’s south expansion project included new bathrooms, equestrian parking for the equestrian trail, new lighting, and the relocation and construction of a new skate park. Meanwhile, supervisors learned that $7.7 million had been authorized by the state to complete the J.W. Corbett Wildlife Management Area levee. In 2012, when Tropical Storm Isaac dumped 19 inches of rain over The Acreage, water held in Corbett partially broke through the existing levee and added to the area’s flooding problems. March The Acreage incorporation referendum bill was not reported favorably out of the Florida House’s Local Administration, Federal Affairs & Special Districts Subcommittee. “After almost three years of hard work, hundreds of hours away from our families, we are disappointed that once again, our request to have a referendum on determining our own future has been denied by our own state government,” wrote Bob Morgan, one of the leaders of the VoteLox citizens group behind the bill. Then-ITID President Michael Johnson and Acreage Athletic League Acting President Wendy Tirado were among those on hand March 16 for the grand re-opening of Acreage Community Park’s north football fields, which had undergone a 10-month, $580,000 renovation. ITID employees, who handled the entire project except for the resodding, worked through Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s to make sure they would be ready for the AAL’s spring sports, ITID Executive Director Burgess Hanson said. April A schism broke open between members of the AAL, which has run youth sports in the area for three decades, and the upstart Breakthru Athletic League, which in 2022 took its flags and footballs and some 330 players and moved on. The acrimony generated by the split spilled onto the ITID dais when Supervisor Patricia Farrell suggested there was a “vendetta” against the founders of Breakthru and their supporters. “We’re doing our best,” Tirado told the board. “There are ups and downs… [but] there’s an opportunity for the league to continue growing. That’s our goal.” Approximately 600 young athletes participate in AAL programs overall, she said. Also in April, ITID supervisors voted to create a 12-member Equestrian Trails Committee and to create an ITID Adopt-a-Street Program to help clear roadside trash. May ITID staff proposed a $24 million budget for the 2024 fiscal year. If accepted, the budget would mean a $7.9 million increase over the 2023 fiscal year budget and would result in an average $366 per acre increase in assessments for district residents. However, significant cuts were expected. June Parks & Recreation Director Kenny Lawrence proposed an $858,121 maintenance budget for fiscal year 2024 that would shift maintenance of all of the district’s parks to a private company. The 2023 maintenance budget was $284,000. Lawrence said that more staffing — either in-house or outsourced — was needed to properly maintain and oversee the parks, especially Acreage Community Park. Using an outside company would allow ITID to avoid hiring at least eight more full-time workers, he said. In a related matter, Hanson said he met with county officials about moving the proposed artificial turf football field from Acreage Community Park south to north, to take advantage of lighting that already is installed on the north side. Hanson said that county officials seemed supportive. July Supervisors approved a $134 per acre assessment increase for the upcoming fiscal year. That meant the average ITID property owner would pay $922 per acre to cover a $19,505,334 district budget. During the 2023 fiscal year, the average property owner paid $787 per acre to fund a $16,463,896 budget. “We’re all feeling the impact [of assessment increases],” Supervisor Elizabeth Accomando said. “But we’re a special district, and that’s the way we have to operate.” August Supervisors voted to revamp the district’s millings policy. Under the new policy, residents of a dirt road with a 50-percent-plus-one petition asking for millings will no longer have to wait in line — often overnight or even for several days — to be one of the first five petitioners at the ITID offices on the first business day of the fiscal year. Instead, residents will have five business days to present their petition at ITID’s offices. September Supervisors voted 5-0 to approve a three-year contract valued at $2.7 million with Juniper Landscaping of Florida for maintenance of the district’s 12 parks. Supervisors also voted to contract with Hartley Construction for improvements to the Nicole Hornstein Equestrian Park. The Hartley contract was for $476,850 and was coupled with a $400,000 federal Land and Water Conservation Fund grant. Also in September, Supervisor Betty Argue worried that The Acreage could become a haven for long-haul truckers and others pulling heavy loads under a plan proposed by District 6 County Commissioner Sara Baxter. However, Argue said that grandfathering in pre-2019 heavy-haulers and capping the number of vehicles allowed per residence at two may be a “reasonable solution.” However, expanding the exemption to include incoming residents with big rigs is a different matter, Argue said. October Circuit Judge Richard Oftedal issued a partial judgment in favor of ITID, ruling that Minto Communities USA and the Seminole Improvement District, which provides infrastructure to the City of Westlake, have no inherent right to access ITID’s roads. If they wish to do so, they must seek a permit from ITID and pay “a reasonable fee,” the judge wrote. Supervisors again debated the proposed GL Homes’ rights swap plan involving the 4,872-acre Indian Trails Grove property in the district’s northwest corner that was scheduled for a final county commission vote Oct. 24. ITID supervisors were solidly supportive of the swap and attendant water-retention features until construction of a 200-acre off-highway vehicle (OHV) park and campground was added to the deal at the last minute at Baxter’s request. Argue made a motion that a letter be sent to the county commissioners supporting the GL swap but without the ATV park. The motion died for lack of a second. In the end, the GL rights swap plan was voted down by the county commission. November The board agreed to pay Rosso Site Development Inc. $275,000 to settle the long-running legal dispute stemming from construction of the Acreage Community Park expansion project. Rosso signed on as the district’s major contractor for the project in 2015. ITID later terminated the contract, which brought on the lawsuit. On Nov. 29, the Palm Beach County Commission voted 4-3 to move forward with a proposal that would allow up to two tractor-trailer rigs to be parked on properties in The Acreage. The plan that now moves forward to a Jan. 25 meeting. December The ITID board chose their two newest members to lead them in 2024. Accomando was chosen as president and Farrell was picked as vice president. Both were elected in November 2022. Argue, a longtime member of the board, shifted from vice president to secretary. Johnson, who served as president for the past two years, took over as assistant secretary. Supervisor Keith Jordano was named treasurer. Acreage resident Natalia Melian, a leader in the Save Our Truckers movement, and Baxter spoke during public comment, asking supervisors to withdraw a May letter opposing the plan to allow 18-wheeler parking in the district. The supervisors took no action on the request. ITID gets no county, state or federal funds for its roads. All road construction, improvements and maintenance costs are paid for by direct assessments on Acreage property owners. Next Town-Crier print edition out June 14, 2024.

The main purpose of the study is to determine if the three Island cities should be consolidated into one city, into the city of Bradenton, into Manatee County or remain as three municipalities. The idea was first broached by members of the Manatee County Legislative Delegation during a January meeting where the study request was passed unanimously without notification to or input from any of the three Anna Maria Island cities the study is slated to scrutinize. While leaders in all three cities said they would support the study looking at ways the cities could share resources to save taxpayer money, they are against consolidation of any kind. After city leaders were given several months to discuss consolidation of services among themselves, state Rep. Will Robinson Jr. (R-Bradenton) and Sen. Jim Boyd (R-Bradenton) came back in the fall with a letter stating they would be moving forward with the OPPAGA study. During a Dec. 12 meeting, Holmes Beach Commissioner Dan Diggins said he’d spoken with Bradenton Mayor Gene Brown with one of the topics being the OPPAGA study. When asked, Diggins said that Brown has no interest in annexing the Island into his city. Titsworth said that while the first wave of records requests from the city are over, she expects more in the coming months before the study concludes in 2024 and thanked staff for their hard work to manage the large number of document requests while also attending to their normal duties. Later in the meeting, Holmes Beach City Attorney Erica Augello said that while the city can’t initiate a referendum to put consolidation of the three cities on the ballot in November, it doesn’t mean that residents can’t. According to the Florida Department of Elections, in order to have a referendum put on the ballot for voter consideration, at least 8% of the city’s voters who voted in the last presidential election must sign a petition to approve the placement of the referendum on the general election ballot and the action must be financially supported by the residents. Having a referendum to see how many registered Holmes Beach voters are in favor of or against consolidation could potentially override the state if legislators push for consolidation, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. © Longboard Communications 2024'}]"

Low 79F. Winds E at 10 to 15 mph.. Partly cloudy this evening with more clouds for overnight. Low 79F. Winds E at 10 to 15 mph. Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 7:21 pm Approximate maximum coverage of the Sun as seen from Melbourne. In short time, a rare celestial phenomenon will set forth over Florida Tech. On Saturday Oct. 14, the moon will pass in front of the sun, partially blocking out the light, also known as a solar eclipse. The eclipse will begin to take place around noon, cover a maximum of 64 percent of the sun’s disk by 1:30 p.m. and run to completion at 3 p.m., according to Time and Date. Florida Tech’s Student Astronomical Society will be providing access to special telescopes that allow the sun to be safely viewed, as well as eclipse glasses to view the eclipse without eye damage. Doc Harris, a physics professor at Florida Tech, explained why such astonishing astronomical events occur, why they are so rare and how we can safely view them without deep frying our eyeballs. “The reason eclipses happen is in part, a really fun coincidence. The distance from the Earth to the Moon is 400 times less than the distance from the Earth to the Sun, but the Sun is 400 times larger than the Moon,” Harris said. “This allows the Moon to completely cover up the Sun because of that geometric effect.” All planets and moons will cast a shadow behind them when they pass in front of the sun. This means that on Earth, nighttime can be thought of as the Earth eclipsing people from seeing the sun. However, this region of “nighttime” does not just affect us on the surface of the Earth, but extends beyond 180 degrees opposite the Sun for a long distance. Like the Earth, this same concept applies to the Moon, too. However, the geometry of this shadow gets more complex. “The shadow is not perfect because the sun is not just a tiny little dot. If the sun was a tiny little dot of super bright light, then you’d get a perfect circular shadow of the Moon on the Earth,” Harris said. “Because the sun is not a perfect dot but an extended object, the shadow gets kind of smeared out a bit and you get what is called the umbra, which is the region of perfect shadow.” The umbra is a relatively small region of the eclipse on Earth and takes great luck to find yourself under without traveling to it. In Melbourne, the area will experience the penumbra of the eclipse, where only a part of the Sun is covered by the Moon. In fact, this eclipse is known as an annular eclipse, meaning the geometry between the Sun and Moon is less favorable as the moon is further away than normal in its orbit. This results in nowhere experiencing the umbra and instead, the middle of the eclipse’s path forms a thin ring around the sun, giving the name annular (annulus) eclipse, according to NASA. While it would seem Earth should have an eclipse at least once every month as the Moon orbits the Earth, this is not actually true. “The reason this can only happen occasionally, turns out about twice a year, is that the Moon’s orbit is inclined compared to the orbit of the Earth around the Sun. The moon doesn’t pass directly between the Earth and the Sun due to its orbit, it passes a little bit above or a little bit below,” Harris said. “Twice a year, the Moon will pass right through that line aligning the Earth to the Sun and you will get the eclipse.” Although solar eclipses are fascinating events, the sun is still an angry ball of superheated plasma radiating powerful amounts of visible and infrared light, alongside harmful UV light that can cook your eyes without the correct protection. Luckily for us, however, the eclipse can still be viewed in several safe ways. Schematic of how a pinhole projector is constructed. “If you have very thick solar glass, glass that has been specially designed to put in front of your face so that you can look at it. Though normally only astronomers really only have access to that,” Harris said. “However, being a STEM school with an astrophysics program, we do have astronomers with these accessories “Another interesting way of viewing the eclipse is to make your own projector,” Harris said. “If you can get a piece of aluminum foil and poke a tiny, tiny little hole in the aluminum foil, you can make a little pin point projector, like a pinhole camera if you point it at the sun.” A final method of viewing the eclipse is with approved solar eclipse glasses. However, you need to be wary when purchasing them, as sometimes companies are distrusting, such as Amazon in Harris’s opinion. The safest way to source solar eclipse glasses is to buy them from an approved vendor with an ISO approval according to the American Astronomical Society (AAS). Fortunately, SAS will be providing Florida Tech students and community members with glasses to view the eclipse on the day of the event. Doc Harris, Professor at Florida Tech. This eclipse will be one of two partial solar eclipses occurring over the state of Florida, with the second eclipse occurring April 8 2024. So, if the weather doesn’t hold, there will still be another chance this academic year. Make sure to bring sunscreen though, the sun is still strong during a partial eclipse, especially this one occurring right at solar noon. Log In Keep it Clean.

Ron DeSantis dedicates significant ink to criticizing the news media. Here is a 2021 story that gives context to how DeSantis leverages his relationship with perhaps the most important conservative media outlet. (You may have seen John Oliver reference it on Sunday’s episode of Last Week Tonight.) Early in Florida’s vaccine rollout, during a period marked by confusion and images of seniors in long lines desperate for a shot, Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office devised a pitch to air a more flattering view. In mid-January, his staff took the idea to Fox News. The timing was perfect. Producers for Fox & Friends, the network’s top-rated cable morning news show, were already inquiring about DeSantis’ availability. A plan came together in a flurry of emails and phone calls over several days. DeSantis’ team provided a senior, a location and the talking points. Fox News would bring the cameras and its audience. No other media would be allowed in. When Fox & Friends viewers tuned in Jan. 22, they heard applause live from St. Petersburg as a 100-year-old World War II veteran received his first coronavirus vaccine. Standing nearby, DeSantis cracked jokes about the senior’s good looks and boasted that Florida was leading the country in vaccinating older residents. “I honestly think he could host the show with the chops we saw from him at the vaccine site,” a Fox producer wrote afterward in an email to Meredith Beatrice, DeSantis’ deputy director for communications at the time. The details of this staged news event were captured in four months of emails between Fox and DeSantis’ office, obtained by the Tampa Bay Times through a records request. The correspondences, which totaled 1,250 pages, lay bare how DeSantis has wielded the country’s largest conservative megaphone and show a striking effort by Fox to inflate the Republican’s profile. From the week of the 2020 election through February 2021, the network asked DeSantis to appear on its airwaves 113 times, or nearly once a day. Sometimes, the requests came in bunches — four, five, even six emails in a matter of hours from producers who punctuated their overtures with flattery. (“The governor spoke wonderfully at CPAC,” one producer wrote in March.) There are few surprises when DeSantis goes live with Fox. “Exclusive” events like Jan. 22 are carefully crafted with guidance from DeSantis’ team. Topics, talking points and even graphics are shared in advance. Once, a Fox producer offered to let DeSantis pick the subject matter if he agreed to come on. By turning to DeSantis to fill the many hours of airtime once devoted to former President Donald Trump, Fox has made Florida’s hard-charging leader one of the country’s most recognizable Republicans. That has given DeSantis a leg up on others who may seek the party’s nomination for president in 2024. A recent nationwide poll of Republican voters put DeSantis atop the field if Trump doesn’t run again. No other prospective candidate was close.

decrease the number of new schools and student seats needed to meet projected student enrollment over the next 10 years. That could mean larger schools, less maintenance, finding new revenue streams and more debt. What comes next will come down to funding. “It is still not a great picture. We are definitely looking at some critical decisions moving forward,” Superintendent Dr. Christopher Bernier said at Tuesday’s school board meeting. “The sales tax, if not renewed, runs out in 2028. There will still be residual dollars because it is a trailing fund. Some money takes us through 2029. With what we build in 2029, we are in pretty good shape by 2030. That is a pretty critical point where we still don’t know. Anything projected beyond 2030 is an increase level of risk of what will transpire.” Faced with a projected enrollment of more than 114,000 next year, staff is maximizing its time between now and January on components of the district’s capital plan. “It is a living document, but it shouldn’t be able to change by either staff changing it alone, or an individual board changing it alone. It has to be the seven individuals that occupy the seats,” Bernier said. Chief Financial Officer Dr. Ami Desamours said the district’s initial 10-year plan was out of balance by $1.9 billion. Staff reduced the working forecast by $900 million with new construction, facilities and expansions, falling from 17 to 12 with a reduction of almost $700 million. In addition, the plan reduced planned property purchases by $10.4 million and proposed maintenance by about $200 million. “The capital plan in front of you is also contemplating taking on additional debt, or revenue in the form of debt of about a billion in a 10-year span,” Desamours said. The presentation included five recommendations: • Increase school size at the secondary level — middle and high school • Reduce the number of new buildings • Decrease maintenance expenditures by expanding rotation cycles and eliminating some planned enhancements, which increases the risk of critical failures and possibly increases operational costs • Restructure, increase, debt to provide more funds • Explore additional revenue streams. “The capital plan as currently structured does anticipate the expiration of the half cent sales tax in 2028 and does not anticipate any additional funding sources beyond what we currently have,” Desamours said. Planning Growth & Capacity Director Dr. Adam Molloy began the presentation by sharing the enrollment from 2003 to the projected enrollment of 2033 – 58,438 students to 114,563 students. The district’s current seat capacity is 91,773 students. If the projected 114,563 students in 2033 comes to fruition, then the district would face a 16,539-seat shortfall. The district took a proactive approach with a 10-year plan, which was introduced to the board Aug. 16 and included 17 new school district facilities to accommodate the growth with 28,380 student seats, which would position the seat excess of 5,642 in 2033. This had an estimated cost of $2,173,966,000. With board direction, the district crunched more numbers and decreased the new facilities to 12 with 17,780 new student seats, decreasing the estimated cost to $1,484,852,592. “Today we are adjusting the capital 17,780 seats at a cost of $1.4 billion with 12 school district facilities. This modification reflects a reduction of over 10,000 student seats,” Molloy said. The presentation also focused on the 2024 capital plan prototypes which would design larger middle and high schools to allow the district to resolve the capacity issues sooner. The proposed increase for middle schools would go from 1,200 current capacity to 1,800 student seats. The high school would increase from 2,000 to 2,800. This provided some pause for board members with some asking if they could have more K-8 school buildings. Bernier said a K-8 school does not help as it does not grow enough of the middle school population in the areas it is needed the most. An elementary school has 1,000 seats, middle school 1,800 seats and a K-8 has 1,600 seats. “It may be a great learning environment, but not necessarily the capacity for our students,” Molloy said. Board member Chris Patricca said she is worried about the increased capacity at the middle and high school level — not the prototypes, but the human relationships inside the building. “Human relationships have a significant impact on educational outcomes,” she said. Molloy said the 12 projects include an expansion at Bayshore Elementary School of 300 seats, making it a K-8 school to be completed by 2028 with an estimated cost of $50,000,000. Other west zone projects include Hector Cafferata K-8, 1,620 seats to be completed in 2026, High OOO, 2,800 seats to be completed in 2026, and elementary 0 with 1,000 seats to be completed in 2028. Other projects include the remodel of Bonita Springs Elementary School to be completed 2025 and Cypress Lake Middle rebuild to be completed 2026. The remaining projects are in the east zone and include a high school with 2,800 seats, one middle school with 1,200 seats, three elementary schools for a total of 3,000 seats and Innovations School K-8 with 1,260 seats. “The proposed list includes two in the South Zone, four new schools in the West Zone and eight schools in the East Zone,” Molloy said. “The projected cost is over $1.4 billion.

The 2024 examples include chillers, roofs and gutters, electrical panels, interior lighting, switchgear upgrades, bathroom upgrades, window replacements, and athletic related items. “Our commitment and focus on existing facilities is $1.25 billion in planned projects.

We uncovered information unknown even to many local elected officials — and gave readers access to data about their own drinking water that they should have had decades ago. The fund covered the cost of the graphics and maps that helped tell those stories in such a compelling way, and helped us pay for expensive books that were donated to Seminole and Orlando libraries. From the editor: You can help Orlando Sentinel continue our important journalism Before that, the fund helped us unravel the statewide web of deceit and election interference that had a nexus right here in Central Florida. We’ve also had the resources to push back against local and state officials who, increasingly, are blocking access to public records that reveal misspent tax money and self-dealing. But the value of individual contributions goes beyond that. It puts local and state officials on notice: Floridians expect them to be held accountable, and they depend on the Sentinel and other news organizations to fight for them. That’s a critical message in today’s climate. Florida was once considered a national leader in transparency — but state and local governments are demonstrating increased lawlessness and defiance of Government in the Sunshine laws. In coming months, News Fund resources will expand the ways we can fight to make public records accessible and reveal back-room machinations that benefit a few at the expense of many. At times, fighting these battles can seem like an exercise in futility, particularly in an era where attacking investigative journalism is a standard part of politicians’ playbooks — and many have gone even further, blocking information that was once provided routinely. Most notably, it took us more than three months to get an official response to basic questions about a new office in the state Department of Education — including salary data and budget figures that should have shown up in publicly accessible databases. Our readers encourage the Sentinel’s reporters and editors in ways that can’t be measured by dollars alone, through the messages that often accompany fund contributions. Here’s a sampling from the past year, and some from years past: By any journalistic standard, “Toxic Secret,” is a reminder to the public that this is what great journalism can and should attain. We greatly appreciate the Sentinel getting to the truth behind so many stories. Thank you! By shining light in dark places you help keep integrity in our community. We’re glad to help continue the outstanding investigative reporting and local journalism. We need investigative reporting now more than ever. Messages like this — with or without contributions attached — gives us the heart to keep fighting, to keep acting as your watchdog, to keep looking for ways'}]"

This money directly supports the journalism Miami New Times produces and helps keep our work freely accessible for all, because not everyone can afford to pay for news. If you value our work, please make a contribution today to help us reach our goal. Contribute Now No matter that Mandela is home across the Atlantic after a quick visit here in June, or that Castro, from across the Florida Straits, thinks less about Miami than Miami thinks about him. Judged by the degree of passion they inspire, the two international figures might spawn a new religion for Miami - with Mandela the gatekeeper of an Overtown heaven and Castro lord of a Calle Ocho hell. But if Miami\'s exiled Cubans still view Castro as pure evil, they now see the deputy president of the African National Congress as a fallen angel. Mandela\'s tumble from grace occurred the week before his arrival in Miami, on ABC\'s Nightline. Having emerged from a South African prison after 27 years in confinement, the aging former guerrilla leader refused to repudiate his old allies Fidel Castro, Yasir Arafat, and Moammar Gadhafi. Overnight, Dade\'s Cuban-American mayors, including Miami\'s Xavier Suarez and Hialeah\'s Julio Martinez, signed a statement denouncing Mandela. And before Mandela arrived on June 27, Suarez and Miami City Commissioner Victor De Yurre withdrew their support for a proclamation honoring him. Mandela never received an official welcome from Miami, Miami Beach, or from the government of Metropolitan Dade County. The local governments\' response enraged Miami\'s black community. And that rage was deepened and complicated by the violent arrest of 62 Haitian demonstrators on July 5 at the Biscayne Plaza shopping center on the edge of Miami\'s Little Haiti. The demonstrators had been protesting the alleged mistreatment, a week before, of a Haitian customer at a Cuban-owned clothing store. The lasting effect of Mandela\'s Miami visit is a well-organized boycott of Dade\'s tourism industry, which injects an estimated $5.7 billion into the local economy each year. Fifteen local, state, and national black groups have so far canceled meetings and conventions in the Greater Miami area, or said they are considering doing so. They include the National Bar Association, the National Medical Association, the National Alliance of Postal and Federal Employees, the National Conference of Black Mayors, the National Forum for Black Public Administrators, and the National Association of Black Journalists. By various estimates, the boycott - chronicled nationally by the Wall Street Journal and USA Today - has already cost the county from five to twelve million dollars. The organizers of the tourism boycott - Dade\'s Black Lawyers Association and representatives of fourteen local black groups - threaten to keep the pressure on until their four demands are met. The demands: a public apology by elected officials for their failure to welcome Mandela during his visit; a federal investigation of the July 5 arrests at the Biscayne Plaza shopping center; a review of U.S. immigration policy, which boycott organizers say favors nonblack immigrants; and substantial reforms in Dade\'s tourism industry to allow increased employment and business opportunities for blacks. Since the boycott began on July 17, its inventor and spokesman, Miami trial lawyer H.T. Smith, has refused to negotiate with public officials or business leaders, saying Miami\'s or Dade County\'s politicians must meet the first demand before any talk of resolving the boycott can take place. Elected officials have refused. Though Smith\'s handling of the boycott has been criticized by some black leaders, their willingness to do so appears to be fading. On the other hand, Cuban business and political leaders show no signs of acquiescing to the demands of the boycott organizers. Instead of a new religion, the twin specters of Castro and Mandela have spawned a bitter dialectic for Miami\'s ethnic politics. Though a comparative unknown among Miami\'s recognized black leaders, H.T. Smith has had little trouble mustering support for the boycott from the black community, a fact he attributes to the unusual developments of the past three months, and to his own background in local anti-apartheid efforts. More and more, the attention and the political power created by the boycott comes to rest squarely on Smith. ""It\'s kind of interesting when people tell me they haven\'t heard of H.T. Smith,"" says Johnnie McMillian, president of the Miami-Dade chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ""I don\'t see it as this young man coming out of the blue. He in fact has been out here for a long time."" ""We have decided to follow his lead,"" says the Rev. Victor Curry, pastor of the 2800-member Mount Carmel Baptist Church in Liberty City. ""H.T. Smith knows exactly what he\'s doing. He may have not been as visible as some of the other leaders, but he has certainly been a dedicated and effective leader in the past."" In a recent interview, Smith talked with New Times about the growing economic-sanctions movement he calls a ""quiet riot."" The idea of a boycott was conceived several days before Mandela arrived in Miami. On behalf of the South Florida Coalition for a Free South Africa, you delivered a letter to Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez, demanding that he and his fellow commissioners provide an official welcome for Mandela. You wrote that such a welcome would ""at the very minimum include a key to the city and an official proclamation."" You also warned that a failure to do so could result in ""a black boycott akin to the one last year against the State of Arizona for its refusal to declare the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a national holiday."" What was the response? I called down to Mayor Suarez before Mandela\'s visit to ask him what type of welcome Mandela would get, whether there was a proclamation in the works, that sort of thing. Same thing with [Metro-Dade] Mayor Steve Clark. We warned them before Mandela arrived of the consequences, so it\'s not as though they were blindsided. To this date I have not received a response to either letter or either call. No call, no fax, no letter, or anything to say, ""We disagree with you,"" or what. That\'s symptomatic of the disrespect my community gets. Have you contacted Suarez or Clark since the boycott began? I have not contacted Mayor Suarez or Mayor Clark. I don\'t intend to. Until they respond to my initial correspondence, and acknowledge I am a human being, I will not contact them. How did the boycott begin? After the Mandela fiasco, in my judgment, Miami was ready to explode. The least little thing could have caused it to go up. While we were wrangling around trying to come up with an appropriate response, we had the incident with the Haitians. We felt - when I say we, I mean lawyers, accountants, shirt-and-tie-wearing black folks - we felt it was very important that we find a nonviolent way to release this frustration, but be effective, too - not just provide some symbolic gesture like going down and standing in front of Mayor Suarez\'s office. I had been, along with others, instrumental in bringing the National Bar Association convention to Miami in 1994. Having been contacted by a lawyer before Mandela\'s visit who said, ""I don\'t feel welcome if Mandela isn\'t welcomed,"" and having been contacted by a member of the National Medical Association who said the same thing, the idea hit me. Fine. Let\'s move our convention out of Miami, because if Mandela\'s not welcome, we\'re not welcome. Being the kind of person that I am, I believe in leading by example. When the [National Bar Association] host committee met, a lot of people said, ""Let\'s go to some local organizations and ask them to organize this effort."" Several of us said, ""Look, let\'s put our money where our mouth is"" - let\'s move first and then ask them to join us.

This was spontaneous economic combustion. Before we could even contact other organizations, they began calling us, saying, ""Hey, we want to join the boycott too. We feel the same way you do.""
