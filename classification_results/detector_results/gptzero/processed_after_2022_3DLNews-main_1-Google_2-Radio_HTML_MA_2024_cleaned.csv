(AP Photo/David Zalubowski) Photo: Associated Press By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — Consumer inflation in the United States cooled last month yet remained elevated in the latest sign that the pandemic-fueled price surge is only gradually and fitfully coming under control. Tuesday’s report from the Labor Department showed that the consumer price index rose 0.3% from December to January, up from a 0.2% increase the previous month. Compared with a year ago, prices are up 3.1%. That is less than the 3.4% figure in December and far below the 9.1% inflation peak in mid-2022. But the latest reading is still well above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target level at a time when public frustration with inflation has become a pivotal issue in President Joe Biden’s bid for re-election. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, so-called core prices climbed 0.4% last month, up from 0.3% in December. On a year-over-year basis, core prices were up 3.9% in January, the same as in December. Core inflation is watched especially closely because it typically provides a better read of where inflation is likely headed. Biden administration officials frequently note that inflation has plummeted since pandemic-related supply disruptions and significant government aid sent it soaring three years ago. And a raft of forward-looking data suggests that inflation will continue to cool. Still, even as it nears the Fed’s target level, many Americans remain exasperated that average prices are still about 19% higher than they were when Biden took office. From December to January, average national gas prices tumbled 3.3%, the government said. Yet so far this month, the average price has climbed higher, rising 15 cents to $3.23 a gallon as of Tuesday, according to AAA. Grocery prices rose 0.4% from December to January, the biggest such rise in a year, though compared with 12 months earlier, food prices are up just 1.2%. The costs of physical goods, including clothing, used cars and prescription drugs, fell for a third straight month. Lower prices for goods are the key driver that is cooling inflation. By contrast, the prices of services — hotel rooms, restaurant meals, auto insurance, apartment rents and the like — are still rising faster than they did before the pandemic and keeping overall inflation persistently high. The cost of car insurance has soared more than 20%, on average, compared with a year ago. The mixed data released Tuesday could reinforce the caution of Fed officials, who have said they’re pleased with the progress in sharply reducing inflation but want to see further evidence before feeling confident that it’s sustainably headed back to their 2% target. Most economists think the central bank will want to wait until May or June to begin cutting its benchmark rate from its 22-year-high of roughly 5.4.

(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting) We love Trump. DONALD TRUMP: This is a persecution. DOMONOSKE: Last week, we saw developments in all four of the criminal cases facing former President Donald Trump and a nearly $355 million verdict in the New York civil fraud trial. We\'ll focus on one of the criminal cases today, the New York hush money case, which now has a trial date - March 25, meaning this will almost certainly be the first criminal case to go to trial. This is the one about hush money payments to bury alleged affairs, which Trump covered up by falsifying business records, and how all that affected the 2016 election. My colleague Miles Parks spoke with NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro and NYU law professor Melissa Murray. Miles started off by asking Professor Murray how significant it is that we have a firm start date. MELISSA MURRAY: I think it\'s very significant. So there\'s at least one trial that\'s going to get going. And interestingly, this is a trial where the prosecutor bringing it is not a federal prosecutor, but a state prosecutor, Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan DA, which means that if he is able to secure a conviction here, this isn\'t something that Trump could pardon himself afterwards with if he were president. Nor is it a prosecution, if it continues beyond the scope of the election, that Trump could end if he becomes the president and has more power at the DOJ to determine prosecution priorities. MILES PARKS, BYLINE: Talk us through how that intersects with the political calendar and then also how that could potentially affect some of these other cases. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Well, I\'ll start (ph). I think when Melissa says it\'s significant, I think that she\'s exactly right because it does sort of set the wheels in motion now for the first of these cases to go forward. A lot of people consider this New York case to be the weakest of the four to be going forward. You know, some people will say, well, maybe that\'s something that\'ll give Trump a chance to make an argument that these cases are biased or there\'s a witch hunt against him or whatever. But I kind of think that having that case go first means that you\'re setting up the cases that have some more serious implications for him going closer to the general election when you have a less friendly audience on his behalf. I think that actually potentially hurts Trump, especially when we\'ve seen polling that shows that if he were convicted in any of these cases, that he would lose some support. PARKS: Yeah, I\'ve heard this a lot, this idea that the New York case is the weakest of the four. Melissa, can you comment on that? I mean, is that how you feel, or is there something more to this that we\'re missing? MURRAY: Well, I want it to be really clear - part of the reason people are talking about it as the weakest case is that\'s how the media has presented it, talking about it as the hush money case. I think it\'s very notable that Alvin Bragg has made a very concerted effort to talk about this case as a species of the kind of election interference that we saw in full flower in the January 6 indictments. He\'s basically saying this is sort of a precursor, a dress rehearsal for that, where Donald Trump paid payments on falsified business records for the purpose of hiding a personal relationship from the American electorate. And I don\'t think that this is the weakest of the cases. I think there are some challenging aspects to this case. For example, the crime with which Donald Trump has been charged is ordinarily a misdemeanor in New York state, but here it is being prosecuted as a felony because it is attached to or adjunct to the perpetration of another crime. Here, the apparent predicate crime is the fact of election interference, election fraud. And it may be a broader question as to what the predicate crime is, what statutes Alvin Bragg is relying on to bootstrap this into a felony-level charge. And, you know, those are definitely aspects of this indictment that may well be brought up by Donald Trump\'s lawyers as potential defenses going forward. PARKS: Wondering, Melissa, can you walk us through what\'s actually going to happen on March 25 and where this case goes from here? MURRAY: Well, we will begin jury selection on March 25. So, you know, there will be sort of a broad cross-section that\'s brought in, and from there, both sides will get an opportunity to select the jury that ultimately will hear this case and ultimately render a verdict. And, you know, I think one of the things that we\'ll look for is the bases on which both sides make requests to eliminate certain prospective jurors. I think the Trump lawyers have already suggested that they are unlikely to get a, quote-unquote, ""fair trial"" in the borough of Manhattan on - pushed back on that, making clear that, you know, this is a national case with national implications and national attention. If you have difficulty here, you\'re going to have difficulty anywhere. And so, you know, this is the jury you have. This is the jury you get. So I think I\'m going to be looking for the choices that both sides make as they make their selections, make their challenges to prospective jurors. PARKS: OK. And finally, to you both, can you kind of give an overview on whether anything happened this week that fundamentally changed what\'s happening with either of these cases or with the election more broadly? MONTANARO: What I thought was interesting was having the date for setting these cases in motion. I mean, March 25 sort of is the starting line now for all of these cases. And I thought it was notable that the judge in New York said that he had been coordinating with Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is a federal judge with another one of the Trump cases. They were also talking about whether there were firm dates in the Florida case with Judge Cannon and how that case wasn\'t necessarily firm, and that\'s why the judge in the case was able to set March 25. So notable here that we know that they are coordinating with each other. And they\'re going to have to because they have to also consider Trump\'s schedule as he\'s on the campaign trail. MURRAY: So one of the things that I thought was really interesting about this week is that we had news about every single one of these criminal indictments, and these four criminal indictments essentially make clear that before, during and after his presidency, Donald Trump is accused of engaging in criminal activities. So, you know, the New York DA has brought charges around these hush money payments that were in service, apparently, of defrauding the electorate about the nature of Donald Trump\'s personal relationship with Stormy Daniels before he was president. The January 6 indictments in Georgia and in the district of the District of Columbia are about activities undertaken while he is president. And then, of course, the Mar-a-Lago documents indictment is about the retention of classified information after his presidency. I mean, we talk about the unprecedented nature of prosecuting a former president, but that is a kind of criminal tableau that really is extraordinary and I think something that ought to register more in the way we cover these cases.

The charges are part of a sweeping federal RICO case involving alleged members of the Heath Street gang, which has been active for decades around the Mildred C. Hailey apartments, previously known as the Bromley Heath Public Housing Development, in Boston\'s Jamaica Plain neighborhood. Nearly two dozen members or associates of the Heath Street gang were arrested Wednesday morning, according to Acting U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts Joshua S. Levy. Law enforcement officials also seized more than 60 firearms. Levy said several other suspects already in state and federal custody were charged with new federal offenses. The defendants were allegedly involved in multiple murders, attempted murders and shootings. ""Some of those shootings left innocent victims in the crossfire, including a 9-year-old girl who was severely injured attending a family gathering,"" Levy said. Although the number of shootings in Boston has been declining recently, Levy said these charges make it clear that parts of the city remain in the grip of violent criminals. ""If you live in a community that\'s threatened with violence on a daily basis the city-wide numbers don\'t mean nearly as much,"" Levy said. Some of those charged allegedly bragged about their crimes on social media and in texts, according to Levy, who said some of the suspects were armed with fully automatic weapons. According to the indictment, some of the suspects produced music videos in which they referenced the murders they committed. Levy said one of their videos allegedly mentioned their victims, saying, ""I can say the names, but it might make the feds come for us."" Levy, in announcing the charges to the press Wednesday, said: ""Well, the feds have come for you."" The suspects allegedly relied on juveniles to help facilitate many of their crimes, pressuring them to work as lookouts, gun and drug holders, and in some cases, even participating in shooting attacks. “These bad actors that we targeted today took advantage of young people,” Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox said. “They used fear, intimidation, and violence""for personal gain. According to the charging documents, Heath Street gang members and their associates have used the Mildred C. Hailey Apartments for drug trafficking activities and, over a period of years, established distribution networks throughout Massachusetts, Maine and California. The case further alleges the Heath Street gang committed theft and financial crimes. This includes an organized retail theft group that allegedly brazenly stole merchandise from various stores in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Additionally, Levy said gang members and associates engaged in loan and unemployment fraud, notably from the relief aid provided by the federal government during the COVID pandemic. If found guilty, the defendants could face up to 20 years in prison for the charge of RICO conspiracy, plus three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000.

The Kansas City Chiefs won 25-22 against the San Francisco 49ers. (AP Photo/John Locher) Photo: Associated Press By JOE REEDY AP Sports Writer The longest Super Bowl game will also go down as the most-watched program in U.S. television history. According to Nielsen and Adobe Analytics, Kansas City’s 25-22 overtime victory over San Francisco on Sunday night averaged 123.4 million viewers across television and streaming platforms. That shattered last year’s mark of 115.1 million for Kansas City’s last-play victory over Philadelphia and is a 7% increase. The game was televised by CBS, Nickelodeon and Univision and streamed on Paramount+ as well as the NFL’s digital platforms. Nielsen also said a record 202.4 million watched at least part of the game across all networks, a 10% jump over last year’s figure of 183.6 million. The CBS broadcast averaged 120 million. The network’s previous mark for its most-watched Super Bowl was 112.34 million for the 2016 game between the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers. Some of the increase can be attributed to a change in the way viewers are counted. Nielsen began including out-of-home viewers in its ratings in 2020, but only from limited markets. That measurement expanded to all 50 states beginning this year. Sunday’s game was only the second of the 58 Super Bowls to go to overtime. The previous one was in 2017, when New England rallied from a 28-3 deficit and beat Atlanta 34-28. “I was managing my expectations, but I had a bit of hope that it would happen,” CBS Sports chairman Sean McManus said of overtime, which was set up when San Francisco kicker Jake Moody had an extra point blocked in the fourth quarter, which kept it a three-point game. “I can’t imagine a Super Bowl any better or more exciting than this.” Kansas City sent it to overtime on Harrison Butker’s field goal. After the 49ers kicked a field goal on the opening possession of OT, the Chiefs won when Patrick Mahomes threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Mecole Hardman. This Super Bowl had the added attraction of Taylor Swift in attendance. The pop superstar is dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, a romance that has brought new fans to the NFL. It was the second straight year the Super Bowl averaged more than 100 million viewers after a period where four of the five games before 2023 had fallen short of that number because of cord-cutting. That included 95.2 million for the 2021 Super Bowl between Tampa Bay and Kansas City, which was the game’s lowest TV-only average since 2007. Univision averaged more than 2.2 million viewers, the highest Super Bowl viewership on record for a Spanish-language network. The Super Bowl has been televised in Spanish in the United States since 2014. The NFL playoffs averaged 38.5 million viewers the first three weekends, a 9% increase over last year. That followed a regular season that averaged 17.9 million, tied for the second highest since averages were first tracked in 1995. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl 1 day ago in Entertainment Thirty years later, Nicole\'s three sisters want her remembered for more than those static images or the violent way she died.

(AP Photo/Eric Thayer) Photo: Associated Press By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer LOS ANGELES (AP) — Tiger Woods in a red shirt on Sunday has become as recognizable as a Masters champion in a green jacket. Only it’s no longer about a Sunday red shirt for Woods. It’s about a brand. Five weeks after Woods and Nike announced their relationship had ended after 27 years, the 48-year-old Woods said it was “the right time in my life” to develop his own brand in an expanded partnership with TaylorMade Golf. The brand is called “Sun Day Red,” and men’s apparel — golf shirts, hoodies, outerwear — will be available online in the United States and Canada starting May 1. The plan is to expand his line to include footwear, along with women and kid’s apparel. The logo is a tiger with 15 stripes, one for each of his majors. And if he happens to win another major? “We’re going to have to redo the trademark,” he said with that famous smile. It was quite the show Monday evening, more of an event than an announcement. David Abeles, the CEO and president of TaylorMade Golf, was so excited about the new brand that he promised those in the crowded room that they would remember 10 or 20 years from now where they were when “Sun Day Red” launched. Here are a few details why this deal is important to Woods and a bold step for TaylorMade, which until now was mostly about golf equipment and its recent entry into the ball market. WHY SUCH A FUSS? Sportscaster Erin Andrews, who hosted the Monday event, might have said it best when she introduced Woods by saying, “For the first time in 27 years wearing something different … .” As much as Woods was known for his red shirt on Sunday, he was equally known as one of the top Nike athletes. Nike signed him after he won his record third straight U.S. Amateur in the summer of 1996. “Hello, world,” Woods said the day he turned pro. Nike then churned out an advertisement campaign, and that was no coincidence. But there was trouble brewing. Woods returned to golf following his February 2021 car crash and was wearing FootJoy shoes instead of the swoosh. He said it allowed him to be more stable. Nike said it would work with Woods to meet his needs. He was still wearing the FootJoy brand in his final tournament representing Nike. SO WHAT ABOUT THE SHOES? TaylorMade or the new Sun Day Red brand does not have golf footwear just yet, though Abeles expects that to be developed before too long. Germany-based Adidas previously owned TaylorMade, and all the golf clients wore the shoe. But a year after Nike Golf got out of the equipment business, Adidas sold TaylorMade to a private investment company. That allowed Woods to switch his golf equipment to TaylorMade, ultimately the start to what led to this new brand. WHAT IS SUN DAY RED? Abeles and Woods described it as a premium active lifestyle brand. This is as much performance on the golf course as comfort at his children’s soccer games. The rollout will be gradual, starting May 1 online in the U.S. and Canada before expanding to key markets. The tiger with 15 stripes is the logo, but it’s not prevalent like the swoosh (Nike) or the alligator (Izod) or the polo rider (Ralph Lauren) on other brands. The cap has the tiger on the front. Some shirts are plain, with the logo in a small square at the bottom of the buttons on a golf shirt. Some of the outwear has block letters of “Sun Day Red” written along the side of the quarter zip. “The logo is sustainable and applicable, but it’s not unilaterally the same,” Abeles said. “We also think in lifestyle, it’s nice to have some tonal logos when you’re out at night.” WHY IS IT SPELLED THAT WAY? The Sunday red is obvious. “Sunday red — it’s me,” Woods said. “It’s just become synonymous with me.” So why the three words? Abeles and Woods talked about the “Rule of Three,” when three words or sentences of the same length can leave a greater impression. Woods, for example, is fond of saying his goals in golf were, “Work hard, think hard, play hard.” Abeles said “Sun” also can mean the preferred weather (missing at Pebble Beach). Day can also mean that golf is played every day of the week. Red is what Woods has long considered his power color, with guidance from his mother. There was no shortage of thought that went into that one. WHEN WILL THE PUBLIC SEE IT? Woods was wearing a cashmere hoodie during the announcement. He will be in the new threads at Riviera Country Club this week, where he makes his 2024 in the Genesis Invitational. Woods is the tournament host of the $20 million signature event. There was a chance of him playing Tuesday afternoon. He has the pro-am on Wednesday, and the tournament starts Thursday. As for the Sunday red? First he has to make the cut. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf 1 day ago in Entertainment Thirty years later, Nicole\'s three sisters want her remembered for more than those static images or the violent way she died.

File) Photo: Associated Press By LINDSAY WHITEHURST and LISA MASCARO Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — An FBI informant has been charged with fabricating a multimillion-dollar bribery scheme involving President Joe Biden, his son Hunter and a Ukrainian energy company, a claim that is central to the Republican impeachment inquiry in Congress. Alexander Smirnov falsely reported to the FBI in June 2020 that executives associated with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma paid Hunter and Joe Biden $5 million each in 2015 or 2016, prosecutors said in an indictment. Smirnov told his handler that an executive claimed to have hired Hunter Biden to “protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems,” according to court documents. Prosecutors say Smirnov in fact had only routine business dealings with the company in 2017 and made the bribery allegations after he “expressed bias” against Joe Biden while he was a presidential candidate. Smirnov, 43, appeared in court in Las Vegas briefly Thursday after being charged with making a false statement and creating a false and fictitious record. He did not enter a plea. The judge ordered the courtroom cleared after federal public defender Margaret Wightman Lambrose requested a closed hearing for arguments about sealing court documents. She declined to comment on the case. The informant’s claims have been central to the Republican effort in Congress to investigate the president and his family, and helped spark what is now a House impeachment inquiry into Biden. An attorney for Hunter Biden, who is expected to give a deposition later this month, said the charges show the probe is “based on dishonest, uncredible allegations and witnesses.” The top Democrat on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, called for an end to the Biden impeachment inquiry. Raskin said the allegations from the Republicans against Biden “have always been a tissue of lies built on conspiracy theories.” He called on Speaker Mike Johnson, Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer and House Republicans “to stop promoting this nonsense and end their doomed impeachment inquiry.” Comer, R-Ky., downplayed the importance of the informant, who had figured centrally to the start of the probe. “To be clear, the impeachment inquiry is not reliant on the FBI’s FD-1023,” Comer said in a statement, referring to the form documenting Smirnov’s allegations. The chairman said the inquiry “is based on a large record of evidence, including bank records and witness testimony,” including interviews this week. He said the committee will continue to “follow the facts” and determine whether to proceed with articles of impeachment against Biden. In the indictment, prosecutors say that Smirnov had contact with Burisma executives, but it was routine and actually took place in 2017, after President Barack Obama and Biden, his vice president, had left office — when Biden would have had no ability to influence U.S. policy. Smirnov “transformed his routine and unextraordinary business contacts with Burisma in 2017 and later into bribery allegations against Public Official 1, the presumptive nominee of one of the two major political parties for President, after expressing bias against Public Official 1 and his candidacy,” the indictment said. He repeated some of the false claims when he was interviewed by FBI agents in September 2023 and changed his story about others and “promoted a new false narrative after he said he met with Russian officials,” prosecutors said. If convicted, Smirnov faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison. The charges were filed by Justice Department special counsel David Weiss, who has separately charged Hunter Biden with firearm and tax violations. The Burisma allegations became a flashpoint in Congress as Republicans pursing investigations of President Joe Biden and his family demanded the FBI release the unredacted form documenting the allegations. They acknowledged they couldn’t confirm if the allegations were true. Comer had subpoenaed the FBI last year for the so-called FD-1023 document as Republicans deepened their probe of Biden and his son Hunter ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Working alongside Comer, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa released an unclassified document that Republicans at the time claimed was significant in their investigation of Hunter Biden. It added to information that had been widely aired during Donald Trump’s first impeachment trial involving Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani’s efforts to dig up dirt on the Bidens ahead of the 2020 election. After Grassley released the document, the White House said the claims in it had been “debunked for years.” The impeachment inquiry into Biden over his son’s business dealings has lagged in the House, but the panel is pushing ahead with its work. Hunter Biden is expected to appear before the committee later this month. His attorney, Abbe Lowell, said he had long warned the probe was based on “lies told by people with political agendas, not facts. We were right and the air is out of their balloon.” A judge set a detention hearing for Feb. 20 for Smirnov, who was arrested at the Las Vegas airport after arriving in the U.S. from overseas. ___ Associated Press writers Ken Ritter in Las Vegas and Eric Tucker contributed to this report. 1 day ago in Entertainment Thirty years later, Nicole\'s three sisters want her remembered for more than those static images or the violent way she died.
