(NEXSTAR) — The Illinois Department of Agriculture instructed 26 inspectors in the Weights and Measures division to return to work on Monday, the same day Governor J.B. Pritzker warned private businesses who reopen too soon that they could “be taking on liability.” State law requires the Department of Agriculture to inspect gas pumps, small scales, fuel trucks, propane trucks, large scales, grain elevators, warehouse receipts and other measures as a form of consumer protection and safety. Only the gas pump inspectors have been called back to work. “We’re grabbing a nozzle four times after thousands of people grabbed it days before, and then we go to the next pump to do the same thing,” 15-year veteran inspector Scott Miller said in a phone call on Tuesday. “If the station has one gas pump with the virus on it, by the time I get done, all pumps have the virus on it,” Miller said. “Even wearing wearing rubber gloves, it’s still on the gloves. So it’s not getting me, but I could be spreading it all across the station. So then, everybody who pulls up at that station has the possibility of getting the virus.” According to emails obtained by WCIA, Miller is one of several concerned inspectors who fear that without the proper personal protective equipment and training, they could unintentionally act as state-sanctioned super spreaders of COVID-19. “They gave us no training at all,” he said. “They gave us some CDC guidelines and some YouTube videos.” Recently, Pritzker has suggested he’s considering ways to start releasing parts of the state from his Stay-at-Home order in an attempt to re-open the economy, but only after the Illinois Department of Public Health reports a steady two-week decline in a variety of Coronavirus risk factors.

Winds NW at 5 to 10 mph.. Some clouds. A stray shower or thunderstorm is possible. Low 63F. Winds light and variable. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 4:53 am Jackie Porter (Red Oak) -- Persistence pays off for a Red Oak woman selected as Montgomery County\'s next treasurer. Earlier this week, the Montgomery County Board of Supervisors appointed Jackie Porter to fill the vacancy left by Tera Hughes\' resignation last month. Porter will take the oath prior to the supervisors\' next meeting Tuesday morning to fill the remaining two years of Hughes\' term, which expires with the November, 2022 elections. No stranger to the treasurer\'s office, Porter has worked in the department\'s motor vehicle department for almost seven years. Porter told KMA News she planned to apply for the opening after losing to Hughes in the 2018 general elections. ""I was sincere about it then, and I was serious about it now,"" said Porter. ""Tera just happened to win the election, which was totally fine by me. The best person ran at the time, and won it. I believe that this time, evidentally it was my turn."" In fact, Porter has been gearing up for the treasurer\'s position by cross training in other areas of the department. ""I did start cross training in the property tax-driver\'s license office,"" she said. ""So, I was getting a little bit of insight since Tera had left the position, which kind of gave me an edge. I just want to make a difference in our offices, and make sure that everything is run smoothly, and that the office stays open, and that we handle everything diplomatically."" Porter cites management and leadership skills as strengths. Her background includes serving as a quality supervisor with the Romech manufacturing plant in Red Oak, and as a clerk with the city of Emerson. ""When I had become an Emerson city clerk for three years,"" said Porter, ""I think that better prepared for this office, because it was really similar with the duties, where, as a city clerk, you have to deal with accounts payable, accounts receivable, utility bills. You do budgets, budget amendments. So, a lot of the duties are really similar. I think that the treasurer\'s office just uses a lot of different software to do their transactions on."" Porter says communications and transparency will be important in serving as treasurer. ""I will try to be as transparent as possible,"" she said, ""and do the best to my ability with emails, and contacting them by phone, and attending any meetings that I can to try to enhance the work experience here."" She adds she will run for the position if a special election is necessary. Residents had 14 days from Tuesday--the time of the appointment--to petition for a public vote on the treasurer\'s post.

(IARN) — “Coronavirus shook the world, (and) cattle futures took the brunt of it,” explains Jim McCormick, branch manager of Ag Market Net. McCormick further speaks to losses in cash and futures markets, as well as recovery efforts underway in cattle futures. Food traders feared people would not go out to eat, amid public health concerns. Hence the aggressive selling of cattle futures. The collapse in cattle futures, however, was triggered by a culmination of events. “Here’s what happened – As states have gone into lockdown, you had a run on the grocery store,” McCormick said. “People started aggressively buying meat. They (customers) clear the shelves. They (grocers) bring it in. They (customers) clear the shelves. Packers started making massive amounts of premium profit. Calculations late last week were almost up to $600 a head.” “Late last week, Tyson came in, bid up, and gave an extra five-dollars on some of the cattle they bought previously, for last week,” McCormick said. “That has the industry thinking (that) these guys are going to try to get this cash market in line with the value of boxed beef. A lot of people are looking for the cash market to trade as high as 125 this week.” However, futures were only trading up 106 at Tuesday’s open. “A lot of that money that got chased bearishly into the cattle market a few ago is reversing now, trying to get out as fast as they can. That’s why we’re limit up again today, and may trade limit up a couple days as the future market tries to catch up with the cash market,” McCormick said. McCormick senses cattle futures will “calm down” near-term. “Demand for store bought meat is going to slow back down. That should bring this packer price back down, and we’ll come back into an equilibrium,” McCormick said. “If the markets are high enough, I would encourage producers to consider using options, protecting profit, if levels get back to profitable. We don’t know how long this virus is going to last and how long the lockdowns will be in effect.” Story courtesy of the Iowa Agribusiness Radio Network.

Large supplies of hogs are waiting to be slaughtered while packers are trying to get back to running at their pre-COVID capacities as soon as possible. There are many hog producers who started switching diets in attempts to get their hogs to quit gaining weight, and thus stave off the need for euthanizing the animals. However, that backlog of animals has not gone away. As the hogs are still waiting for their turn, more hogs are coming up behind them. How long will it take to catch up? Steve Meyer is an economist with Kerns and Associates. He has been analyzing the packer situation throughout the pandemic.
