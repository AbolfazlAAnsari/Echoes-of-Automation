Low 56F. Winds light and variable.. A few passing clouds. Low 56F. Winds light and variable. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:11 pm Nissa Sugden holds the phone Friday while her son, Kian Olson, talks to her and friend Jen Wettergren over Facetime from the Mankato hospital. Nissa Sugden expected this story to be about her son recovering from COVID-19. On Monday, 19-year-old Kian Olson was taken off the ventilator that had breathed for him the past several days. The staff at Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato had decided he was ready for assisted oxygen in moderate doses from a thin tube. Nurses had arranged for Kian to be moved to the progressive care unit, a step down from intensive care, later in the week. Sugden’s mind jumped ahead in time, she said Friday morning. She began rearranging his bedroom to accommodate any medical equipment he might depend on for the upcoming weeks. She replaced the shower doors with a curtain because she knew Kian would need a shower bed. She was “trying to prep the home for him to come home because I didn’t know — any day he could be released. And then, you know, within an hour it’s like, ‘Oop, just kidding,’” Sugden said with a pained laugh. Sugden is a mother of two, and on Thursday night her 15-year-old daughter had a volleyball game in Red Wing. During the two-hour drive to Nadine’s match, with Sugden’s boyfriend at the wheel, she received a call. Something was wrong in Kian’s unit. Medical staff said, “‘He’s trying to leave,’” she recalled. Sugden would learn Kian was demanding to see his father, Mark Olson, who is in hospice care at his home in upper North Mankato. Her son had worked out in his head that if he fell asleep, his father — Sugden’s ex-husband — who has battled pancreatic cancer for years would die. Sugden on Friday estimated Kian had slept roughly six hours over the past five days. He was enraged when told he couldn’t leave the hospital. As Sugden will say, her son is large, strong and stubborn. There were 10 medical staffers in the room. He had to be sedated to relax. She gave the nurses her permission to treat Kian as they saw fit. They decided that, although his oxygen level and the state of his pneumonia have measuredly improved, he needed the one-on-one care provided only in an ICU. On a cool, gray morning of drizzle, one yard in North Mankato was brighter than the rest. The words “Kian’s Fight” are written in shiny silver lettering on a sign, contrasting with the green of the lawn. The front yard of Nissa Sugden’s home. Inside the home on Friday were Sugden and Jen Wettergren, a friend who has helped create Caring Bridge and GoFundMe pages in response to Kian’s condition. The living room could be an average makeshift workspace, surrounded by personal mementos glimpsed in video calls throughout the pandemic. A laptop sits open on a wooden TV tray. Papers are strewn about the coffee table in the room’s center. Neither woman has done her day job in weeks, however. Their mission has been to spread Kian’s story and monitor his condition based on reports from his Mankato hospital care team. On a television stand, a red booklet with “Mankato West High School” in gold letters on its cover holds Kian’s diploma. Tucked inside are pictures of Kian as a boy. Nearby on a wooden stand is a newspaper front page showing his face below the words “COVID CRISIS.” Sugden’s phone rings. “Hi honey!” she says. “Hi Mom,” Kian says in a soft, dazed voice on the other end of Facetime. He wears a white hospital gown and lies on a white sheet, his head small in the center of the frame. A nurse is heard shuffling in the background, occasionally interjecting in a kind tone to assist Kian. Video or phone calls remain the only way Sugden can speak with her son. He has gradually become more lucid, holding a slow conversation with his mom for about 20 minutes that morning. But typically Kian lapses into what Sugden calls a loop: He feels guilty for the position he’s in, the money being spent on health care. He wonders about his own savings. He worries about his father. When he smiles on the call, his mother tells him it’s the first one she’s seen on his face in two weeks. “Makes me wanna cry with happiness,” she tells him, grinning. Physically separated from her son, Sugden has spread his story hundreds of miles. It began with an Aug. 23 Facebook post urging others to be vaccinated and has progressed to twice-daily updates on Kian’s Caring Bridge site. Nissa Sugden and Jen Wettergren have spread Kian’s story hundreds of miles from Sugden’s living room in North Mankato. Her son’s staunch position against vaccination was cemented by nationally known commentators dismissive of the coronavirus, such as Joe Rogan, who also has been diagnosed with COVID-19. Now Sugden has to reassure him that his friends plan to be vaccinated. Kian hopes to receive a shot the first day following the required 90 days of recovery. It’s not a political thing, Sugden repeats constantly, knowing it’s more of a goal than a fact. A vaccine dramatically reduces the chances of severe COVID-19, she says, echoing medical experts and national health officials. Her focus for weeks has been split between her son’s concrete suffering and the hypothetical suffering of vaccine skeptics, as well as their families. “The more I can tell the story of what Kian’s going through — I’m trying to push them over the edge of whatever fear is holding them back from doing it,” Sugden said of skeptics. “Because if we can keep somebody from having it — their family members from going through this …” After pausing, she begins again: “I mean, seeing your kid on a ventilator, and talking to him, watching his chest go up and down when it could be helped.” Tears forming and voice wavering, she finishes, “And then seeing him struggle afterwards ... is something nobody should have to go through if it can be helped.” The number of people Kian’s story has reached is likely in the thousands. The number of minds the story has changed is unknown. But old and current personal friends have shared their changed views with Sugden, offering a sample of the impact wrought by her efforts. Kim Gores, of Garden City, told The Free Press last week she ended her vaccine holdout as soon as she read that Kian was on a ventilator. Mankato teen struck with COVID-19 goes on ventilator During the Facetime call, Sugden reassured Kian that several friends he named were either vaccinated or making plans to be. Jen Hawley, who went to high school with Sugden and now lives in Colorado, said Friday her husband had resisted vaccination when the couple saw Sugden on Aug. 12, five days before Kian’s positive test. She also opposed shots for her two children, 12 and 13, because of their youth. Then Hawley, who was vaccinated in March, and her husband heard about Kian’s deterioration. The culmination of the Federal Drug Administration’s recent approval of the Pfizer vaccine, the surge of the highly infectious delta variant and Kian’s fight for his life convinced the couple. Within days her husband and two children received their first shots. Lori Hargrove’s hardened resistance to the COVID-19 vaccine was completely erased when she learned about Kian, said the 46-year-old Welcome resident who knows Sugden. Not only does she prefer holistic, at-home treatments to traditional medicine, but Hargrove’s distrust also rested in the “ifs, mights, possiblys and coulds” that she said characterized media and public health reports about the vaccine. She compared her prior lack of familiarity with suffering caused by COVID-19 to the apathy non-soldiers may feel during a war. Everyone knows it’s happening. Everyone knows there’s tragedy. But in our houses, leading our mundane days, we don’t directly experience the turmoil. “We remove ourselves emotionally from a situation until it’s affected us personally. And that’s just how I felt.” Her husband and 17-year-old son had already tested positive for the virus but showed no symptoms. Hargrove said that further entrenched her rationale for avoiding the vaccine. But now, having received a shot Monday, she finds herself trying to undo any resistance to vaccination she bred in her son. She tells him about someone else’s teenage boy who was on a ventilator, struggling to live. “It was a true physical anxiety of getting the vaccine. But Nissa and her family’s story truly outweighed that for me,” Hargrove said. “If there was a fence, it tipped me over the fence. “My fight against myself isn’t worth what she’s going through.” Mark Olson knew that every time he bridged the topic of the coronavirus with his son, a fight would ensue. Nonetheless, he encouraged Kian to'}]"

is a large majority of our campus’s population–conversations about race look a lot like fear: fear of saying or doing the wrong thing and offending someone. And, yes, it’s good to be conscious of how our words and actions can have a negative impact on our peers, but the root of fear around conversations of race is inherently privileged. It is a privilege to live our lives not worrying about the impact of our words and actions until now. It is a privilege to be so afraid of being wrong that we choose not to say anything at all, and this privilege is catastrophic because it centers around our comfort as white people over racial justice and equality. I’ll admit that I’ve made many mistakes in my own journey. I have asked inappropriate questions and gotten defensive and spoken up when I should have shut up and stayed quiet when I should have said something. There is no guidebook, no “How-to” when it comes to anything in life. All we have is trial-by-error, and nothing is simple. Nothing is, “This is wrong, and that is right.” Messing up doesn’t make you a villain, just like doing one good thing (or even multiple) doesn’t make you a hero. There is a lot of gray area, and the best we can do is admit to our mistakes and grow from them. Question everything. Where does your fear stem from? Fear of hurting someone, or fear of looking like a bad person? Do you care more about how your white peers will view you than how your words, or lack thereof, are negating the existence of people of color? It is privileged to be more focused on our own images than the livelihood of others, which places our appearance value as white people higher than lives that people of color are living. I am not knowledgeable enough to speak on every aspect of this multifaceted issue, but I will say this: No, you cannot speak for someone else and their experiences. Yes, you can say, “I don’t know enough to comment on that” when someone asks for your opinion. No, you cannot play “Devil’s advocate.” Yes, you can (and should) hold your peers AND professors accountable, especially as white students on campus. It is not the job of students of color to educate us. I started writing this article out of frustration that stemmed from a conversation in one of my classes, but as I began reading “How To Be Less Stupid About Race” by Crystal M. Flemming, I realized how ignorant I was being to focus more on asking white people to speak up than focusing on shutting the hell up and listening. Flemming discusses the concept of ignorance being bliss at the beginning of her book, “Living in a racist society socializes us to be stupid about race.” We grew up with textbooks that centered on the white experience, perpetuated white savior–ism and erased the contributions the BIPOC community has made to our country and the world. We grew up with teachers who, most of the time, were uneducated themselves or “miseducated about the history and ongoing realities of racial oppression,” Flemming said. If we don’t understand race and racism, then we can’t fight it. This lack of education is intentional. This lack of education is racist. Flemming continues on saying that having conversations about race without understanding it is harmful. That might seem obvious to some of you, but let me repeat that again. Entering into conversations about race without properly being educated on it is harmful. White people‒we need to talk less and learn more. There are already professors teaching classes, social media influencers holding virtual lectures and people writing books. All the tools are already here for us if we just reach for them. I’m still reading Flemming’s book, a book that’s an incredibly easy and quick read, and I’ve already learned so much. All I had to do was shut up and listen. You’re afraid to talk about race. I understand, but it’s important to be uncomfortable. In fact, we should be uncomfortable. Being comfortable isn’t the goal nor is it an endgame, just like simply being an “ally” isn’t enough. Passive allyship is dangerous and a lazy way out. Simply saying, “I’m an ally” and doing nothing more is once again placing your appearance value over people’s lives. Letting go of our image, of our ego, is an important step in active allyship‒in anti-racism, but as you know by now racial understanding doesn’t just come from talking– especially white voices talking. It comes from reading, listening and watching. It comes from hearing. Right now you may be asking, just like I’ve asked myself, “But now what? What can I do? How do I know when I should speak up and when I should stay quiet?” Listen. That’s as good of an answer as I can give you‒actively listen. Sometimes talking about race involves less talking from white people. Listen when someone asks you to help them. Listen when someone speaks from a place that you don’t understand. Listen to your peers when they tell you that something you did hurt them. Read, watch films and then read some more. Invoke empathy. Try to understand perspectives beyond your own. Be a sponge, but not a passive one waiting to be picked up. Our world has been waiting too long for us to join the conversation. Jump in head-first and leave your fear at the door. We’re living through two plagues‒COVID and racism. Along with your COVID self-screening, do a racism self-screening every day. It doesn’t stop existing, in our society or in ourselves, just because we acknowledge it. That’s the first step. And there is no last step, no “The End,” no completion. To quote from professor Jill Locke, “It’s a chase to be man enough, to be white enough, but there is no ‘there’ so we end up hurting others in our attempt to prop ourselves up.” In our attempts to be enough, whether it’s man enough or white enough or straight enough or “ally” enough, we’re harming others and losing our own humanity. There is no destination where “enough” lies. “The goalposts keep moving,” Locke said. To quote from James Baldwin in his essay, “On Being ‘White’ And Other Lies,” there is no white community. “No one was white before he/she came to America . . . the people who, as they claim, ‘settled’ the country became white‒because of the necessity of denying the Black presence, and justifying Black subjugation” (page 178). If this is all new to you, have you asked yourself recently WHY you’re holding onto a past education written from the perspective of white men desperately trying to keep you in the dark, and not expanding your knowledge? You’re in college for a reason. You’re getting an education for a reason‒so LEARN. No one likes to be wrong, to not know things, but we never reach a destination where we’re “finished” or where we know everything. We’re going to make mistakes and be wrong our entire lives, the only important thing is if we learn from them. Our fear is holding us back. Acknowledge the racism, shed your ego, actively listen, check yourself and your friends, and be willing to join in on the conversations and do the work. White people: Why are they afraid to talk about race? We’re not race is not an issue for white people we accept all cultures today. That’s why America had good immigration policy’s until recent years. Now immigration is a political football. Because of that people migrating to America are being abused by leftist politics. In general white people are not racist not privileged or any other derogatory label the left wants to throw around we just happen to be white. We are also the only true minority on the planet we make up less than 10% of the population. That’s a fact that can’t be denied. Over population is not a white problem. Non white countries need to take more responsibility for their people. White people: Why are they afraid to talk about race?

2021 February is Black History Month. March is International Women’s History Month and Cerebral Palsy Awareness Month. April is Autism Acceptance Month. June is Queer Pride Month. July is Disability Awareness Month. October is Coming Out Month and Sexual Violence Prevention Month. If this seems like a lot, it’s because it is. The funny part is that this isn’t even an exhaustive list. If it seems exhausting to keep up with, that’s because it’s exhausting to keep up with. When I was younger, I thought that awareness months were exciting. And by younger, I’m talking about my first and second years of college. I still remember the excitement of Coming Out week the fall of my first year. The coming-out vigil was calm, beautiful and emotional. The following June, Pride felt like a month-long party for me. My Facebook thread was blowing up with rainbow stuff and I even tried going to my local pride parade. While I was in euphoria about it, a sense of relief washed over me on July first. I realized I was on a treadmill. While I still love Pride Month and want to go with my friends once it’s safe, I do get the feeling of burnout every July first. If I’m being honest, compared to disability awareness and disability pride months, queer pride feels like a vacation to me. I’m really into disability activism and educating people on ableism. So, you would think I would love the whole month of March and July. But, to be honest, I hate it. This march pissed me off so much. But, the real storm came on March 25th, National Cerebral Palsy Day. Now, if I’m being honest, I usually forget National Cerebral Palsy Day until it’s like April 7th, and then, I shrug, say “Oh, crap!”, and I promise myself to remember next year. And it repeats itself. But this year, I looked up the date and I remembered. My plan for the day was to eat leftovers with my mom and enjoy her company. But, when I checked Instagram, my page was riddled with smiling kids and family in green shirts (green representing Cerebral Palsy) and them talking about how they were grateful for Cerebral Palsy and how much Cerebral Palsy has taught them. Seems innocent enough, right? Well, it could be. But, when you take a closer look, it has a jaded meaning behind it. First of all, I should mention that I don’t like the fact that parents put their children, disabled or not, on the internet. But, that’s a whole different topic. The reason why I hate Cerebral Palsy awareness is the same reason that Cerebral Palsy awareness is the way that it is; for our oppressor’s comfort and acceptance. It’s the same reason why a ton of disabled characters in media are either inspirational or superheroes. We’re much more likely to be accepted if we smile, don’t complain, and don’t challenge the system. Because if we challenge the system, people get uncomfortable. Good! Great! Perfect! I want people to get uncomfortable. I want them to face the reality of ableism. I don’t want them to just wear a green shirt once a year, snap a picture for Instagram and call it a day. That will do nothing for me. Ableism is a daily fight for me. It doesn’t just go away with a stroke of midnight or a new calendar page. And it shouldn’t for everyone else. I’ll leave you with a question: Is this day for me? Or is it for the people who want a pat on the back?

The new logo will soon grace all Massey Ferguson machines, including the high-horsepower tractors produced in Jackson. “Massey Ferguson has been offering farmers around the world straightforward and dependable machines since its inception nearly 175 years ago,” said Eric Hansotia, chairman, president and CEO of AGCO Corp. “Few brands around the world can claim such a lasting impact in the agricultural industry.” Luis Felli, senior vice president and general manager for Massey Ferguson, said Massey Ferguson is pivoting from being a pure farm machinery manufacturer into a provider of straightforward and dependable experiences that provide the best value for farmers and make their business more profitable and sustainable. “This globally consistent, farmer-first approach enables customers to experience the transformation of the brand in a unique way all over the world,” he said. “Complemented by a synchronized global organization, it was only natural to launch a new logo during this unprecedented moment in our history.” Francesco Murro, Massey Ferguson vice president of global marketing, sales enablement and partnerships, said the new logo has been in the works since 2019. The new logo comes 63 years after the introduction of the old one. “As we celebrate the 175th anniversary of Daniel Massey’s first farm equipment workshop in 2022, we felt it was the perfect time to refresh the logo while introducing a new meaningful tagline,” Murro said. “The triple triangle shape is a strong icon that has embodied Massey Ferguson since 1958. Our new logo is a mix between our strong heritage and fresh brand values. The three triangles overlap to represent the mutually beneficial relationship and trust between farmers, dealers and the brand.” “Working as one Massey Ferguson Global Team, we aim to make farming operations easier, more profitable and more sustainable across the globe,” said Alfredo Jobke, director of global marketing for Massey Ferguson. “We want to use this new logo to invite farmers, more than ever, to become part of the ‘Born to Farm’ Massey Ferguson family. We also took this opportunity to transition to a modern, sleek and flat design while giving the logo life through the interaction of three triangles interlocking one into the other. Drawing it with one single, solid and straightforward gesture creates the appearance of movement. The flat design is very reflective of our current digital world, allowing us to manipulate the logo to bring it to life for our websites, applications on smartphones and smartwatches or even the screens inside the machines themselves.” The new logo will be progressively implemented across the globe. It has already begun to be featured in the brand’s digital channels and will be updated in all Massey Ferguson marketing material moving forward. Farmers around the world will be able to experience the new Massey Ferguson brand identity for the first time toward the end of the first quarter of 2022. The company is also implementing a step-by-step introduction into its facilities, factories and offices across the globe, as well as in Massey Ferguson Dealer Network signage starting in 2022.

The Wright Flyer replica was built by Flight Expo, Inc. in 2003 for the 100 year anniversary, according to flightexpo.org. The full size replica has been on display around the Twin Cities area until a few weeks ago when it landed in Pine County. “This will be on permanent display at the Pine County Museum,” said Sharon Sandberg, president of Flight Expo, Inc. She explained it was quite a process to get the plane into the museum. “The Wright Flyer had to be trailered in. This last move we had to take the aircraft completely apart to fit into the doors and trailers we had available,” said Sandberg. “It was also a great time to clean the aircraft up. The sewing that was pictured (see photo) was marrying two sections of the upper wing together. We still have to do this for the lower section.” The plane is also equipped with a replica of the original engine from 1903. The original engine was 12 horsepower and weighed 180 pounds, according to wright-brothers.org. It had a one gallon fuel tank that was suspended from a wing strut and fed down a tube to the engine by gravity. The engine was custom made by a “mechanician” friend from ideas turned into sketches and then into reality, according to the website. The long bicycle chain turns the camshaft, which works other parts in a domino-like effect. The first run of the original engine on February 12, 1903 was successful, but the following day the engine overheated and seized during a test run before even leaving the bench. They rebuilt the engine and it was ready to go by late spring. Jacob Roshott knows a few things about aircraft engines. He is a semi-retired aircraft mechanic in the Twin Cities area and teaches aircraft maintenance at Minneapolis Community and Technical College. He admired the old plane after having lunch with his sister at the Little Mermaid Cafe in the museum. He is impressed with how the original A group of volunteers prepare to lift the Wright Flyer into place on a stand. engine was built out of ideas and sketches. “Charles Taylor was a bicycle mechanic,” Roshott said. “The engine was basically carved out of metal.

pursuing a double major in studio art and environmental studies with an emphasis in sustainable design. Thomas believes in the power of art and architecture to affect social change and has worked with organizations across the country to further causes of equity and sustainability through design. He was recently awarded the Joy of Giving Something Fellowship. As part of his honors thesis and the fellowship, he is designing a community project that explores the effects of redlining, highways and other racist planning policies on neighborhoods of color in the Twin Cities. The following is part of an interview The Mac Weekly conducted with Thomas. This transcript has been slightly edited and revised for clarity. The Mac Weekly [TMW]: What is the key focus/argument/motivating factor of your work? Alex Thomas [AT]: A lot of what I put my energy and emotion toward are these larger goals of equity and sustainability in various forms ranging from race, gender, or even development. Growing up in a developing country, there are larger socioeconomic inequalities that I’m hoping my work can contribute toward alleviating. All those considerations help lead to issues of sustainability as well. It’s not possible to have an equitable society where some communities are using way more resources than they need to, or where a few people are responsible for massive externalities that affect the poorest and most vulnerable amongst us. I’m hoping to use architecture and design as a way to effect some change within that. TMW: Have you found any major trends in your field/work? AT: I developed an interest in architecture through art and through other creative modes of expression. I try not to think of architecture just from a technical or functional perspective. I think I value the artistic component of a space because that’s what makes architecture more than just a building — something that speaks to you visually, experientially, and emotionally. But beyond that, I’m always considering how it’s going to affect someone and the work that I do is going to impact the community I’m in. Over the summer, I was working on a big commercial project in Manhattan. Although the work was interesting and challenging, and the people that I worked with were amazing, I didn’t really feel like I was making a positive impact around me. Sure, I was motivated by the people around me and I was able to learn new things, but they weren’t in service of that larger social sensibility that I want to have. In sharp contrast to that was when I had the opportunity to work on an affordable housing project in St. Paul. When I was visiting the site there, my heartstrings pulled and I thought to myself “Oh, yeah, this is what I want to do with the rest of my life.” There’s something fulfilling about seeing where families can raise their children versus where corporations would set up their businesses. So, in a lot of the things that I do, I’m always thinking about my positionality as an aspiring architect, because architects and urban planners have an immense responsibility in the world that they create. For better or for worse they can really make or break a community, and historically, it’s been a lot of breaking, especially in the Twin Cities around neighborhoods like Rondo that were split by the I-94 freeway. There’s a lot of historical reflection that has to be done and the recognition that architects and planners haven’t always done the most altruistic work. They’ve often catered to the richest and the most influential, and that’s not the best for everyone. TMW: What is the most interesting discovery/realization that you’ve had so far about your work? AT: I’ve realized how complex the design process of a building or a community is, and how many different people and factors go into determining what spaces look like. Sure, architects and urban planners have a huge say in what’s going to happen, but there’s natural, economic, cultural and social considerations that are challenging to predict, like how people are going to socialize or work in a space. But in all of that complexity, there is a certain harmony in how things work out. Even though it seems like designers have a lot of agency of their own, your work is very determined and defined by the people and the spaces around you. It requires you to be able to actively listen and empathize with everything around you to figure out what a space needs and what people need. I learn that in different ways every day, but I think that’s the crux of it. TMW: Where do you think this work could go in the next five years? What are some future avenues for this work? AT: As a field, I think people are trying to get more and more conscious about issues of equity. And sure, part of that may just be corporate virtue signaling, but it’s been just a growing awareness of everything else that’s going on around us. I think designers of any sort need to be reflective of what’s happening around them, whether it’s politically or economically or even from a public health perspective — recognizing that there are other things that are changing about the world and that design isn’t the only thing that’s responding to issues of equity more recently. I feel there’s a stronger focus on making sure that communities are a lot more livable. Recently, and more locally there’s a project called ‘Reconnect Rondo’ that’s seeking to rectify the issues that were caused by the highway. I feel that projects along those lines that contribute to a growing awareness would do a lot to move us in the right direction. And the same applies to climate issues as well. We have an incredibly long way to go, but we’re making small incremental steps. And sure, it’d be nicer if we did that at a faster pace, but that’s where I see it going. TMW: Did you reach a low in the duration of your engagement? How did you address it? AT: One of the most challenging things about any sort of creative work is that eventually, you hit a creative block or this period of time where you don’t feel as motivated to do what you want to do. These are hurdles. If you’ve been working on something for an incredibly long time or there’s a bunch of bureaucracy getting in your way or there’s just something that makes you feel like the amount of work that you’ve put in isn’t reflecting in what’s coming out of it — I think that’s the hardest part for me about design. During those times, a lot of what helps me is taking a little bit of a break from it and doing other things that I care about. Taking care of my plants, or going on a bike ride or cooking. And having moments like that, that can reframe my time and my energy. If I spent 12 hours a day on a computer doing something, versus if I spend a part of those hours cooking, cleaning or reading, that helps me take a mental break from everything and look at things with a cleaner slate. It also makes me realize that there are other things happening and it’s okay if not everything goes according to plan. In addition to that, just talking with people. Not necessarily about the project, not necessarily about what I’m working on, but about just anything that helps me get back my energy. TMW: Is there something you wish you knew before getting started? AT: I wish I had some more guidance on how to do it, as opposed to having to figure it all out on my own. Nobody else in my family has taken a similar route to exactly what I’m doing. I think that ties into the sort of the BIPOC experience where these paths aren’t really laid out for us. So, it takes a lot of independent work and a lot of self-determination to actually do that. But at the same time, I’m glad I had to do all the work by myself because it made me realize everything that I could do and the few things that I wanted to do. I don’t regret anything about how I arrived at where I am because I think now I have a much stronger motivation for why I want to do certain things. TMW: Finally, if you could manifest one wish or vision about your work, what would it be? AT: I’d wish that there was more funding for affordable projects because one of the biggest barriers creatively is that when there’s not a big budget, you’re often limited in how you can design dignified spaces. That also means that the work isn’t the most financially rewarding. So I just wish there were more people'}]"

Filling in for Evangelical Lutheran Churches By BARB FINSETHStaff Writer Pastor Joshua Skogen began serving the Hartland and Manchester Evangelical Lutheran Churches as vacancy pastor at the beginning of August of this year. Previously, Pastor Shawn Stafford served for 10 years with the people of these two churches before leaving to fill a position as an assistant professor in the Religion Department at Bethany Lutheran College in Mankato.In the Evangelical Churches, it is customary for a local pastor of their fellowship to serve a vacancy on a part-time basis until a full-time pastor is hired. Pastor Skogen is now serving as full-time pastor for Scarville and Center Lutheran congregations in Iowa. He has taken the responsibility to line up pastors or seminarians to cover each Sunday worship service for Hartland and Manchester. He also travels to Hartland to teach confirmation class, visit shut-ins, and provide personal pastoral care wherever it is needed. Joshua and his wife, Katie, live in Scarville, Iowa with their six children, ages 12, 10, 9, 7, and identical twins three years old. In personal time, Joshua says he enjoys, ""spending time with my family, visiting extended family, playing disc golf, and helping with the youth wrestling club in Lake Mills, Iowa.” Joshua was born in Peru, but grew up on a dairy farm in rural Princeton, MN. When he was younger, some pastors began suggesting to Joshua that he should consider entering the ministry. Then he won the ""future pastor"" award at his church\'s youth camp, and, ""That got me thinking about it. I love Christian doctrine and I care about the souls of others, so becoming a pastor seemed like a possible fit for me."" With the encouragement of a pastor, he started his study in Greek and Hebrew in preparation for seminary. In 2000, he earned an Associate of Arts degree at Bethany College, then continued his studies at Southwest Minnesota University, graduating with a Bachelor\'s degree in secondary education in mathematics. He worked for a few years before beginning his seminary education at Bethany Lutheran Theological Seminary, graduating in 2010 with a Masters of Divinity degree. Pastor Skogen served churches in Waukon, Iowa and Portage, Indiana before accepting the call to serve as full-time pastor with the Scarville and Center Evangelical churches in 2018. He says it is now such a pleasure to be able to meet and serve the people of the Hartland and Manchester congregations while they search for a full-time pastor. The Hartland and Manchester churches are a part of the Lutheran denomination affiliated with the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod. They practice a conservative, traditional liturgy. Pastor Skogen expands on the Evangelical Church’s beliefs: ""We believe that the Bible is God\'s Word, and we submit to it as being authoritative in all that it says. The worship services use the historic liturgy, which we have shared in our Christian Church through generations. It keeps us focused on Jesus Christ, who was crucified for our forgiveness and eternal salvation.""

SMS wasn’t new in 2006. Dec. 3, 1992, an engineer named Neil Papwort sent the first test SMS message using his personal computer. He sent the message “Merry Christmas” to a friend’s mobile cellphone. Today, you and I commonly send SMS instant text messages over our smartphones to friends, family, and co-workers. Digressing back to July 2006, while having lunch in a city park, Odeo employee Jack Dorsey proposed to his colleagues a new and effective method for sending text messaging updates among large groups of people using mobile phones and online computers. Odeo was a podcasting aggregator technology collecting news for redistribution onto websites. Dorsey and Isaac “Biz” Stone built the new text-based messaging prototype they originally named Twttr. It was spelled, “Twttr”, with no vowels because folks, in the beginning, used it just between mobile devices, and the SMS five-character shortcode 89887 spelled “twttr.” The tweeting amongst the birds in the park partly inspired the name given to this new texting service. Its first text message sent by engineer Jack Dorsey read, “just setting up my twttr.” Six months after Twttr started, its name changed to today’s familiar Twitter, because someone else previously obtained the 89887 SMS shortcode name (twttr). Noah Glass, who founded Odeo, chose the name Twitter. According to Merriam Webster’s online dictionary, the word “twitter” means “to utter successive chirping noises – to utter in chirps or twitters – to talk in a chattering fashion.” So, chirping birds inspired today’s text “tweets” over the Twitter online social media platform. At the start, engineers set Twitter messages at a maximum of 140 characters in length to fit inside the limits of a mobile phone text message; today, it is 280 characters in a single tweet message. Ruby is a high-level application framework software operating on Twitter’s web server. Twitter also uses the general-purpose C++ programming code, in addition to JAVA and Scala. The US is the country with the most significant number of Twitter users, at 73 million. Japan follows with 54 million, and the UK has 18 million. Twitter originally asked its users to tweet messages about what they are doing. Today, there are 206 million daily active users on Twitter. Worldwide, those 25 to 34 years old make up the largest share of Twitter users. In the US, those aged 18 to 29 make up 42 percent of our country’s Twitter population, while people 30 to 49 hold 27 percent. Folks 50 to 64 make up 18 percent, and those 65 or better come in at 7 percent. While Twitter has 322 million users worldwide and gets a lot of press coverage, it is overshadowed by Facebook, with its 2.8 billion users. YouTube follows with 2.3 billion users. One of the earliest Minnesota Twitter articles I found is from Jan. 27, 2007, Minneapolis Star Tribune, in a column by James Lileks titled “Do you Twitter? You will.” The hashtag (#) feature on Twitter (which groups tweets by subject) made its first appearance in August 2007. A Twitter user thought of the hashtag idea. The 2020 statistics show users sent more than 200 billion Twitter messages, with 700 million being politically related. San Francisco, CA is Twitter’s primary location, with employees working in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and the state of Washington. At the end of 2020, Twitter employed 5,500 people. Its web page is www.twitter.com. In addition to tweeting about what we are doing, the leading reason found for being on Twitter these days, based on its usage, is to get news and information. Each online minute, 319 new Twitter users are registered. As of March 2021, former president Barack Obama is the most followed Twitter user, with 130 million followers.

Ammunition prices and permit requests remain high. A surge in demand for new firearm permits-to-carry demand that began in 2020 continued through the first half of 2021 in Scott County, according to law enforcement officials. The highest permit-to-carry requests were in the first three months of the year, with 807 new requests for permits and 507 renewals, according to Sheryl Schmitt, administrative services supervisor with the Scott County Sheriff’s Office. For comparison, there were 360 new permit requests and 146 renewals in the first quarter of 2017, the year after the previous presidential election. (Data does not include permit-to-purchase requests, some of which are handled separately by local police departments.) There were 1,844 new permit-to-carry requests in Scott County in the second half of 2020, compared to 598 the first half of the year. Demand always rises in election years, and civil unrest in Minnesota − including protests around police brutality in Minneapolis − may have contributed to the long-lived surge, said Scott County Sherriff Luke Hennen. The high permit numbers in the first three months of 2021 is likely an “extension” of the election-year surge, he added. Craig Burris, who owns Tactical Training Solutions in Lakeville, said he’s seen a demographic shift in new gun owners in the past 18 months. Whereas before the COVID-19 pandemic, “the majority of gun sales and training were to conservative, white, middle-aged men,” 2021 has brought a huge jump in female students at Tactical Training Solutions, to almost 50% of his customers, Burris said in an email. “Through 2020 and continuing in 2021, we are seeing far more diversity in sex, race, and political affiliation,” he said. “This is awesome to see because I firmly believe that the more people who exercise their rights, the stronger we are as a country.” The market for guns and ammunition is “starting to settle” after a year of unprecedented high sales in 2020, Burris added, though ammunition prices are still twice or three times as high as they were before March 2020. “Firearms manufacturers seem to be catching up and that market is almost back to normal,” Burris said. “You can walk into most gun shops and buy any model from the major manufacturers.” Sorry, there are no recent results for popular articles.

Many business owners have faced waves of openings and closures throughout the last year due to the ongoing pandemic and the resulting shutdowns. At-home bakeries have been able to continue running throughout it all, though it’s come with some challenges and changes, but home bakers say the operations of their businesses were largely pandemic-safe before the coronavirus. For Emily Tiritilli of Emily Grace Cakes, an at-home bakery based in Prior Lake, sales increased during the pandemic’s peak. As a senior at Prior Lake High School, Tiritilli started her baking business in October of 2019, specializing in custom cakes and cupcakes. She was building a customer base, joining the chamber and meeting other local business owners in her first year before concerns of coronavirus shutdowns were raised. As restrictions were placed, “I was scared to see if people would even buy from me, knowing that other businesses had shut down if that’s even something I can do.” Tiritilli said. But she saw the opposite effect and in April her sales began to grow. “I think since other businesses were closed everyone is wanting to shop small and I was available and I was able to sell which I’m very grateful for,” she said. Due to the closure of other businesses and restaurants, some customers had their reservations in ordering baked goods from a home kitchen, so Tiritilli has been taking extra measures to ensure the safety and peace of mind of her customers. She bakes wearing gloves and a mask and sanitizing surfaces frequently. Instead of handing off cakes face-to- face, Tiritilli is leaving boxes of sweets outside her door for contactless pick up or delivering them to their doorsteps. Packaged baked goods from Prior Lake home bakery Emily Grace Cakes rest on a table outside owner Emily Tiritilli’s home ready for contactless pick up. Besides adding some extra precautions, Tiritilli said it’s a business model that works well in a pandemic. “I’m able to talk to my customers through email, over the phone, through my website and most of everything I do is not in person, it’s all pretty much virtual,” Tiritilli said. And that was how most of her business was conducted pre-pandemic. Remaining flexible has become a large part of operating Emily Grace Cakes, she said. Her cancellation policy has become nearly “non existent” because she understands plans for celebration are changing in an instant. Tiritilli is grateful to have been able to continue her business through the pandemic as it provided her with an outlet during the extra time at home while still being able to help others celebrate. That uncertainty in celebrations has been the biggest hit to Hue Yeates’ Belle Plaine home bakery, Sweet Sugar Hy, which she started roughly a year and a half ago. “People order stuff for graduations and bridal showers and baby showers, where people meet and gather and since that wasn’t being allowed anymore that’s where it really hurt my business,” Yeates said. While not unaffected, she feels lucky her business was essentially already set up to operate amid COVID-19. She too is sanitizing surfaces frequently, offering contactless pickup and drop off options and packaging her hand-decorated cookies and other treats in individual containers making them convenient for adapted celebrations like drive-through baby and bridal showers, Yeates said.
