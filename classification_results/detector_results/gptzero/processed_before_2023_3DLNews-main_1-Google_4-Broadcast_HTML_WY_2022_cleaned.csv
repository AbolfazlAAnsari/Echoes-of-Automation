hoping for a knockdown, drag-out, battle of wits and wills at Thursday\'s Wyoming US House Republican Debate would be disappointed. Every congressional nominee, including current Congresswoman Liz Cheney, Trump-endorsed Harriet Hageman, Senator Anthony Bouchard, and more were on their best behavior during the event. Each candidate was respectful to their opponents, and to the audience, and the debate went off without a hitch. Sheridan College hosted the debate, in conjunction with Wyoming PBS and, though the event was closed to the public due to safety concerns, those concerns turned out to be for naught. There were some thinly-veiled comments every now and again but, for the most part, the candidates demonstrated the type of camaraderie that the rest of American politics would be wise to replicate. The debate itself covered a wide-array of issues, from gasoline prices to inflation, the war in Ukraine, to the January 6 insurrection (of which Congresswoman Cheney leads the investigation). Each candidate tackled those issues in 90 seconds or less, before participating in a lightning round of questioning designed to evoke immediate thoughts on essential issues. Then, each candidate got to make one final pitch for themselves on why Wyoming residents should vote for them in November. Craig Blumenshine moderated the debate, and his docile tone set the, well, tone, for the rest of the evening. Steve Peck, publisher of The Ranger newspaper in Riverton and the Public Affairs Producer for Wyoming PBS, Bob Beck, the News Director of Wyoming Public Media, and Stephen Dow, with The Sheridan Press served as the panelists for the event, asking questions throughout the evening. Congresswoman Cheney was joined on stage by her opponents: Harriet Hageman, Robyn Belinskey, Anthony Bouchard, and Denton Knapp. Each candidate brought their own talking points, their own ideas, and their own brand of Wyoming to the Sheridan College stage. Wasting no time in cutting to the controversial subject matter, panelist Steve Peck brought up Cheney\'s role in the January 6 House Committee, and her semi-abandonment from the Republican party. He asked the candidates what ""this divergence of views"" meant to the race and what it said about the Republican party. Hageman was the first to answer, and her very first sentence raised some eyebrows. ""My first response is that we\'re not a democracy, we\'re a Republic,"" Hageman said. ""And I think that\'s an extremely important distinction, and I think it\'s one that was missed by the statements last night. Our Republic is not in danger because of President Donald J. Trump. President Trump was an excellent president for the United States of America, and especially the state of Wyoming."" Hageman said that the ""threat to our republic"" came from other sources, making mention of Hillary Clinton, President Biden and his son, Hunter. Hageman also referenced a situation in Portland, Oregon that recently happened after the announcement of the Roe v. Wade reversal by the Supreme Court. ""We have a situation, what we saw in Portland,"" Hageman said. ""Where you have rioters attacking the federal courthouse and federal agents. You have billions of dollars of damage being done to our cities through rioting and the people are not being held accountable for those things."" She did not mention the similar actions that took place at the U.S. Capitol in January of 2021. Congresswoman Cheney did, however. ""I think there\'s no question that what we saw on January 6 was clearly an attempt to delay the count of the electoral votes,"" Cheney stated. ""Anybody who was there understands the violence that was involved. I\'m frankly stunned that one of my opponents on the stage, who is a member of the Wyoming Bar, who has sworn an oath, as many of us on the stage have, to the Constitution, would be in a position where she is suggesting that somehow what happened on January 6 was justified. Or that, somehow, what happened that day...that people have the right to ignore the rulings of the courts. We are, in fact, a nation of laws. And we are a nation of laws only if we defend our Constitutional Republic. And as I made clear last night, we have to put our oath to the Constitution above party."" Cheney stated that the Republican party has a rich history, and it\'s a history that she was proud to be a part of. She said Republicans are known for embracing conservative values, such as limited government, low taxes, and a strong national defense. ""But we are now embracing a cult of personality,"" she stated. ""And I won\'t be part of that. And I will always stand for my oath and stand for the truth."" Anthony Bouchard made his feelings about the January 6 issue known as well. He said that, really, none of it even actually matters at this point. ""It\'s a lot of distraction,"" Bouchard said. ""We aren\'t talking about the real issues that the people of Wyoming care about, like putting fuel in their fuel tank. We\'re focused on something that happened, that people disagree on. Certainly my opponent has a certain view that she has stuck to, but the Republicans as a whole...they\'re tired of it."" Colonial Denton Knapp used the question to speak about why he was running for the Republican House seat to begin with. ""I\'ve not been a politician,"" Knapp started. ""I\'ve been a servant all my life with the army and that shapes how I think. And I came in because of what I saw happen with the Federal Government, and the fact that I could do something. So I stepped forward for that. We\'ve devolved into a two-party system for the most part in this country. And if you\'re not on those partly lines, you\'re shoved to the side."" Colonial Knapp shared that he\'s been a Republican all his life, and said that he believes in the platform. And he took issue with Congresswoman Cheney\'s comments about the Republican Party devolving into a cult of personality. ""I don\'t believe it\'s a cult of personality that we need to worry about,"" Colonial Knapp stated. ""[We need] somebody to get in and do action in Congress for two years."" Ms. Hageman was then given the chance to offer a rebuttal, and that\'s exactly what she did. ""The biggest threat to our Republic is the current administration and the corruption of our various institutions,"" Hageman stated. ""The Department of Justice, the FBI, and the other things that have happened over the last couple of years. And what we have is a committee in Congress right now [that are] focusing on something that happened 18 months ago. They\'re not focusing on the issues that are important to the people in Wyoming. And they\'re also ignoring the corruption that is absolutely destroying Washington D.C. and, as a result, taking down the rest of the country."" Continuing down the rabbit hole of the January 6 insurrection, Bob Beck asked nominee Belinskey why she wasn\'t more concerned about the events of that fateful day and the fact that some former important members of the Trump administration admitted that Trump said his goal was to overturn the election. ""[I\'m not concerned] because I have actually watched several hours of video myself from every angle possible and have done my own due diligence on this,"" Belinskey stated. ""I believe again, this is a distraction from what is actually going on in our country right now. We don\'t need to be spending this kind of money and time on a situation where, again, we have lawlessness in our country. Instead of dealing with those issues, we are dealing with something that, again, happened a while ago and was a setup from the beginning for the election situation. Our voices...We, the people, were stifled. Our first amendment right was washed out the door. And so, you know, to me, this is a waste of time and our resources to go after something. We should be going after the lawlessness in our country."" Nominee Belinskey did not actually state what that lawlessness entailed, however. Congresswoman Cheney stated that the work the January 6 Committee is doing is, in fact, important work. And it\'s being done for an important reason. ""You know, I think that there\'s a real tragedy that\'s occurring and, and the tragedy is that there are politicians in this country, beginning with Donald Trump, who have lied to the American people and people have been betrayed,"" Cheney said. ""He consistently has said that the election was stolen when it wasn\'t; when it\'s absolutely clear...the courts determined the outcome, as you\'ve seen. You\'ve watched our hearings; predominantly, maybe entirely Republican witnesses, from the former attorney general, the former deputy attorney general, to the head of the Trump campaign. [All have said that] the election was not stolen. I\'d be interested to know whether or not my opponent, Ms. Hageman is willing to say here tonight that the election was not stolen. She knows it wasn\'t stolen. I think that she can\'t say that it'}]"
