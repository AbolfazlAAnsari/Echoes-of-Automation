""I do think it\'s very important for people to understand how close we came to a far greater constitutional crisis — and how quickly and easily — in a way that is, frankly, terrifying."" Cheney does credit a handful of brave Republicans in state and federal offices from stopping ""the worst of what could have happened."" But she says many of those people won\'t be there the next time around. The stakes for the country, she adds, ""couldn\'t be higher."" ""All of these things that we know Donald Trump and those who enabled him did before, they will do again,"" she said. ""And people who are willing to abide by that, including Republicans in Congress, can\'t be trusted with power. And that\'s something that voters need to have at the forefront of their minds when they go into the voting booth in 2024."" Cheney isn\'t afraid to name names in her book. Among them: She describes McCarthy, the former speaker, as a coward and hypocrite who knew Trump\'s election claims to be false but defended them publicly anyway. She calls Johnson, the current speaker, an election denier who was easily swayed by Trump\'s flattery well before he ascended to House leadership. She invoked such examples, she says, to show how ""it didn\'t take much for people to decide that they were going to ignore the most fundamental obligation I believe elected officials have."" She says many Republicans — herself included — anticipated Trump would bring legal challenges immediately after the 2020 election and then concede by the time the Electoral College met to certify its results. Courts across the country dismissed more than 50 lawsuits from Trump\'s team alleging electoral fraud. Trump and his allies focused on overturning the election results through an elaborate scheme that culminated in the Capitol riot, as detailed by the Jan. 6 committee\'s investigation and alleged by a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., where he faces criminal charges. Cheney says in the days after Jan. 6 there was ""near unanimity in the sense that Donald Trump was responsible for what happened."" Republicans proposed legislation that would have censured Trump, and floated a bipartisan commission to investigate what it called a ""domestic terrorist attack."" ""It was common sense,"" she added. ""We\'d lived through it."" But that near-unanimity began to dissipate very quickly, which she attributes to two factors: elected officials putting their own political ambitions ahead of their oath to the Constitution, and their fear — including of violence. Cheney writes that some members of Congress told her at the time that they believed Trump should be impeached but couldn\'t vote that way because they were afraid for their security and that of their family. She urged listeners not to gloss over that fact. ""People really need to stop and think about: What does it mean in America that members of Congress are not voting the way that they believe they should because they fear violence instigated by, then, the sitting president of the United States?"" she adds, calling that ""a place we haven\'t been before."" And she says once her colleagues took that position they were able to rationalize it, which helps explain where the party stands now. ""Once you\'ve accepted something that is so indefensible, then it\'s hard ever to sort of go back and say, \'Well no actually, I should have stood against that.\'"" Cheney backed Trump\'s agenda some 93% of the time during her Congressional career. But says that after Jan. 6, as she saw it, ""there never seemed to be a choice."" ""It was very clear what was right and what was wrong,"" she added. ""It was very clear that we had gotten to a point where the president had crossed lines that could never be crossed. And as Republicans, we had a particular obligation to say, \'No, we won\'t support this.\'"" In July 2021, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced her picks to serve on the Jan. 6 panel: seven Democrats and Cheney, who, at the time, was still in GOP leadership. After a back-and-forth with McCarthy that led to him rescinding his Republican picks, Pelosi also appointed Adam Kinzinger, a Republican Trump critic who did not seek reelection in 2022. Cheney says it would have been inconceivable to her a year earlier that she would be accepting a committee appointment from Pelosi, with whom she disagreed vehemently on policy matters. She doesn\'t recall the two ever speaking more than a few sentences to each other in Cheney\'s six years in Congress. But she says she didn\'t hesitate to accept, and their relationship became ""absolutely indispensable"" as Pelosi worked to support the committee\'s efforts. ""As passionately as we both care about our views on a whole range of issues, and they\'re different, we both knew immediately that that did not matter as much as doing everything we could to defend the Constitution,"" Cheney said. All members of the Jan. 6 committee recognized that ""partisanship could not rule the day,"" and that they needed to let the witnesses and the evidence speak for themselves, which is what Cheney believes made it successful. The committee held ten televised hearings that attracted millions of viewers, culminating in an 800-page report and four criminal referrals of Trump to the U.S. Justice Department. And while some of the people singled out by the committee as collaborators are facing racketeering charges in Georgia, many others remain in positions of political leadership — and Trump leads the Republican primary pack, despite facing 91 felony counts across four criminal cases. Cheney says the committee\'s work was ""crucial and indispensable"" both in terms of informing the Justice Department\'s work and presenting evidence of Trump\'s involvement for the historical record. And she says it\'s far from over. ""Looking to the future requires that we acknowledge what happened and how dangerous it was and certainly not put those same people back into office again,"" she added. ""Making sure that that story is written and that story\'s told is very important as we think about, particularly, the election that\'s coming up next year."" Cheney was a notable figure in conservative politics well before she was elected to represent Wyoming in Congress in 2017. She worked on her father Dick Cheney\'s campaign when he was George W. Bush\'s running mate in 2000, and focused on promoting democracy in the Middle East as a State Department aide in Bush\'s administration. She says she grew up in Republican politics and believes in the values of the party that former President Ronald Reagan, for example, embodied. But she doesn\'t recognize them in today\'s GOP, which she says has become ""an anti-constitutional party."" She points to the moment at the first Republican primary debate, when six out of the eight candidates onstage raised their hand to show they would support Trump as the nominee even if he were convicted.

University of South Florida researchers said Monday the quantity of seaweed in the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt “decreased substantially” between June and July. The seaweed belt remains huge – there’s an estimated 6 million tons of sargassum still floating around – but it’s down several million tons in just a few months. That’s good news for residents, visitors and workers of beach areas of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean. The problem with this type of seaweed, sargassum, isn’t with it floating out in the ocean. The issues start when it comes on land and starts to rot. As it decays, sargassum lets off hydrogen sulfide and smells like rotten eggs, explains the Florida Department of Health. It can irritate people’s eyes, nose and throat, and trigger breathing issues for people with asthma. Some of this could still be happening in the Florida Keys and southeast Florida, the researchers said, but the amount washing up is less than earlier in the summer. Looking forward, things are expected to get even better. “The sargassum growing season is now over,” said the University of South Florida report. They expect just a small amount of sargassum to be found in the Gulf of Mexico next month, and a moderate amount in the Caribbean Sea. While the overall amount of potentially toxic seaweed is declining, some beaches will still get hit with waves of it, the researchers said. Last month, for example, Mexico’s Yucatan coast and the west side of Jamaica actually saw more sargassum, even as most places saw less. By October, they forecast “minimal” sargassum levels in all regions. If you do see sargassum, the Florida Department of Health recommends beachgoers avoid touching or swimming near it. The small creatures that live inside it, like jellyfish larvae, could sting or cause your skin to itch. The department also suggests using gloves if you have to handle sargassum and closing windows if you live near the beach to avoid breathing issues and bad smells. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

Jesse Watters’s 7 p.m. program will move to 8 p.m. and take the slot previously held by former host Tucker Carlson, while Laura Ingraham will have her program moved into Watters’s 7 p.m. hour. Longtime host Sean Hannity’s show will remain at 9 p.m., and late-night host and comedian Greg Gutfeld will host a show at 10 p.m. The changes will take effect on July 17, the network said. In a statement announcing the moves, Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott said: “The unique perspectives of Laura Ingraham, Jesse Watters, Sean Hannity, and Greg Gutfeld will ensure our viewers have access to unrivaled coverage from our best-in-class team for years to come.” The overhaul of Fox’s prime-time lineup comes just weeks after it parted ways with Carlson, its formerly top-rated prime-time pundit who had hosted the 8 p.m. hour since 2016. Watters and Gutfeld, who both are members of cable news’ most watched show “The Five,” were each given their own eponymous programs in recent years. All three of Watters, Ingraham and Gutfeld’s shows keep their names and format. Watters and Gutfeld will remain co-hosts of “The Five.” Fox’s prime-time lineup has long been ranked as the most watched slate of programming on cable news, drawing audiences consistently averaging millions of viewers each weeknight. The network’s prime-time shows have for years served as a megaphone for GOP messaging and a platform for Republicans seeking public office to reach voters and fundraise. The changes at Fox also come amid broader concerns facing the cable news industry relating to cord-cutting and changing news consumption habits. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

John Fetterman (D-Pa.) vowed Monday to work to block the $14.9 billion sale of U.S. Steel Corp. to Japanese steelmaker Nippon Steel, which he described as an “outrageous” move. The deal was announced Monday, prompting the stock prices of U.S. Steel to jump up 25 percent. Fetterman criticized the sale, saying in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that the move was “wrong for workers and wrong for Pennsylvania.” “I’m gonna do everything I can to block it,” Fetterman wrote on X. “I live across the street from U.S. Steel’s Edgar Thompson plant in Braddock,” Fetterman said in a statement. “It’s absolutely outrageous that U.S. Steel has agreed to sell themselves to a foreign company. Steel is always about security — both our national security and the economic security of our steel communities. I am committed to doing anything I can do, using my platform and my position, to block this foreign sale.” According to an October press release, U.S. Steel “supported an estimated 11,417 jobs” in Pennsylvania, including more than 3,700 directly employed by the company. The October report estimated that U.S. Steel generated $3.6 billion for the local and state economy in fiscal 2022. Fetterman reiterated his support for the steelworkers in Pennsylvania in his statement and also posted a video taken from the roof of his house on X that shows his home directly across from the steel plant in Braddock, Pa. “This is yet another example of hard-working Americans being blindsided by greedy corporations willing to sell out their communities to serve their shareholders. I stand with the men and women of the Steelworkers and their union way of life,” he said in his statement. “We cannot allow them to be screwed over or left behind. I promise to them and to all forgotten communities across Pennsylvania that I will work with [Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.)] and the rest of the delegation to fight like hell to make this right,” he continued. U.S. Steel said in its announcement that Nippon Steel will “honor all collective bargaining agreements with United Steelworkers Union as part of commitment to maintaining strong stakeholder relations” and that the headquarters will remain in Pittsburgh, Pa. Nippon Steel said that the higher demand for steel under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was one of the contributing factors in the deal. “Energy and manufacturing industries [will] return to the U.S. under changes in the world economy structure and cheap energy in the U.S. The infrastructure bill and spending is expected to drive steel demand uptick moving forward,” the company wrote in a statement analyzing the deal.

John Fetterman (D-Pa.) went after Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) on Monday, mocking his effort for an impeach inquiry of President Biden over unproven claims of illicit family business deals. “Oh, no, please, please don’t!” Fetterman joked in a CNN interview Monday. “Impeachment! Oh, my God. That bad, bad man. It’s so scary. Oh, no!” Johnson committed to pushing for a floor vote on an impeachment inquiry of Biden last week, claiming a House Oversight and Accountability Committee investigation into the president’s family has found enough to warrant a full impeachment effort. “The evidence is so clear you cannot look away,” Johnson said Saturday in a Fox News interview. “The Constitution requires the House to follow the truth where it leads. We have a duty to do this. We cannot stop the process.” House Republicans have alleged that Biden and his family accepted money from foreign interests in suspicious business deals, though they have yet to produce compelling evidence of the accusations. The current investigation, led by House Oversight Chair James Comer (R-Ky.), has come under fire from Democrats who have marked it a political effort to hurt Biden’s reelection chances in 2024. “If Republicans had a smoking gun or even a dripping water pistol, they would be presenting it today,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at the beginning of the Oversight investigation in September. “They’ve got nothing on President Joe Biden.” Fetterman, however, said that the effort could actually help the president. “But whatever a weirdo says about that, it’s like, go ahead!” he said, adding that he doesn’t believe a continued investigation of the president will find any wrongdoing. The House GOP is considering a vote on an impeachment inquiry in the next two weeks, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) told reporters Friday. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

A Butler County woman ended up in the hospital with an allergic reaction after her medication was switched. Heather Soones of Portersville said her ordeal should serve as a warning for patients who are told they have to take a new drug. Soones has Crohn’s disease, an inflammatory condition that can damage the intestinal system. In March, a nurse came to her home to give her a new medication through infusion. Soones said the nurse grew concerned when her blood pressure started rising. “She kept monitoring it every 15 minutes, and it kept going up and going up. I was a little bit shocked,” Soones said. Soones had been taking a medication called Remicade for 17 years. It allowed her to stay healthy and run a business that supplies saddles and other equipment for horse owners. But in December, she said her doctor\'s office told her UPMC Health Plan mandated a switch to a drug called Inflectra. Soones asked why, and a nurse told her the patent for Remicade had expired. After the adverse reaction to the new drug, her nurse was so concerned she called 911, and an ambulance took Soones to Butler Memorial Hospital. The symptoms eventually subsided, but Soones was left with a bill totaling nearly $1,000. She had some serious questions. “Why was I taken off the Remicade when I\'d never had any problems with it? And then they put me on the Inflectra and immediately had a reaction?” Soones said. She spent months trying and failing to get answers to her questions. She said she contacted Action News Investigates “because I\'m not getting any luck with anybody else, and if it\'s happened to me, it must have happened to other people.” Soones suspected her health insurer, UPMC Health Plan, ordered the switch. A UPMC spokesperson said: ""UPMC Health Plan covers both Remicade and biosimilars and we do not require members currently taking either drug to switch to the other."" But Soones\'s medical record has a note from a nurse saying, ""The patient will be mandated to use either Avsola or Inflectra, per UPMC Health Plan."" Her medical record also had a note from her pharmacy saying her insurance wanted a different medication than Remicade. After Action News Investigates shared this information with UPMC Health Plan, they said in a statement, “We always work to ensure our members receive access to the care they need and are working to address and resolve the concern.” Soones’ pharmacy, CarepathRx, told her she would be reimbursed for her out-of-pocket expenses. “Well, I think that\'s very nice, but it still doesn\'t answer the question about who changed the prescription,” Soones said. UPMC and CarepathRx both declined further comment. Experts said specialty drugs for conditions like Crohn\'s can be very costly. “The sticker price for some of these is in the range of $15,000 to $40,000 per year,” said Dr. Alan Moss, chief scientist of the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation. Moss said that steep price tag drives insurers to use biosimilars like Inflectra that are less expensive than the original medication. There is no evidence that cost drove the decision to switch Soones’s medicine. “It\'s essentially an economics issue that the costs often to the payer are significantly different than the original product,” Moss said. Unlike generics, biosimilars are not exact duplicates of the original medication. But pharmacists and doctors said that in nearly all cases, they give patients the same results without additional side effects. Action News Investigates asked Pfizer, the company that makes Inflectra, about adverse reactions to the drug. In a statement, Pfizer says Inflectra ""has been shown to have no clinically meaningful differences compared to its reference medicine Remicade. It\'s possible for allergic reactions to occur when taking a biologic medicine, and patients should speak with their doctor if they experience signs of adverse reactions during or after infusions."" Pfizer pointed to Inflectra\'s label that says possible side effects include stroke, serious infections, nervous system disorders and allergic reactions. Pharmacist Chris Antypas of Asti’s South Hills Pharmacy said patients can have an allergic reaction when they switch to a biosimilar. “It\'s conceivable that they could have a reaction to the biosimilar when they didn\'t have a reaction to the branded product,” Antypas said. “Ultimately, biosimilars are not going to be appropriate for every single patient.” Soones said she wants others to know her story so they can avoid suffering and aggravation when their medicines are switched. “Really take a hard look at what they\'re going to switch you to and make sure you ask all the questions that you need to ask to make sure that this is something that\'s going to be necessary for you,” Soones said. Experts said patients should talk to their doctor and pharmacist if they have any questions about a drug that they’ve been switched to.

It became known as the Blizzard of \'93. It paralyzed Pittsburgh and much of the East coast, closing roads and forcing Public Works crews and emergency personnel to work around the clock. It also forced people to hunker down in their homes. Next week marks the 30th anniversary of the Blizzard of \'93. If you lived through it, you probably have your own story to tell. But, we decided to look back on it with two beloved former KDKA-TV employees, who worked through the storm to keep you informed. It\'s known as the ""Storm of the Century."" Forming on March 12, 1993, this megastorm decimated the south by producing 11 tornadoes. It also left double-digit snow totals in unlikely places like Alabama and Tennessee. In Pittsburgh, the extreme storm dumped a single-day record of 23.6 inches of snow. It\'s a record that still stands to this day. Most memories tend to fade away, but events like the Blizzard of \'93? Most say it\'s hard to forget something like that. ""I had been here 37 years before I just retired, and the Blizzard of \'93 - what a storm - was something that I will never forget,"" Harold Hayes said. For nearly 40 years, Hayes was a fixture on KDKA-TV. From cover-ups to sentencings, to just plain old bad weather, he covered it all. Yet, this storm stands out. ""It almost reminded you of a movie where there had been total destruction, and you\'re driving down the street and there\'s nobody on the street,"" Hayes said. For more than 30 years, no one has kept a better account of Pittsburgh weather than retired KDKA-TV Meteorologist Dennis Bowman. ""According to my journaling, the first flakes began around 2:30 a.m. We had 3 inches on the ground by 7:30. And then, 22 by 9 in the evening and it was still totaling up there to our total of 23.6 inches,"" Bowman said. When the Blizzard of \'93 hit, Dennis was working at another television station. He worked the Friday night before the storm arrived in Pittsburgh. Then, he came back Saturday morning as the storm intensified and stayed for 24 hours straight. ""It was all hands on deck and everyone who could get to work did,"" Bowman said. ""By noon, we knew that there was the potential to have something historic."" The storm by itself is historic enough, but there\'s a local spin that adds even more notoriety to this blizzard. It will always go down in history as the year Pittsburghers held the city\'s annual St. Patrick\'s Day Parade in a blizzard, with a sea of white replacing the normal green of the day. ""Most units didn\'t show up, but some did. Most people didn\'t show up to watch it, but some did,"" Bowman said. Looking back at the Blizzard of \'93, it\'s a storm that most say not even Snowmageddon in 2010 tops. Additionally, it is still the storm by which all others are measured. ""The 1950 storm was something that your parents or even grandparents talked about, and \'93 was the modern day storm of that caliber,"" Hayes said. If you\'re wondering, Pittsburgh has seen more than 20 inches of snow falling in a single day only twice in the city\'s history. The only other instance was on Dec. 17, 1890, when an even 22 inches of snow was recorded. First published on March 13, 2018 / 6:20 PM EDT © 2018 CBS Broadcasting Inc.
