U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm is calling for more nuclear reactors to be built in the United States and worldwide. But the CEO of the Georgia utility that just finished two reactors at a cost of nearly $35 billion says his company isn’t ready to pick up that baton. Granholm spoke Friday at Plant Vogtle, where Georgia Power and three other utilities put a second new reactor into operation last month. The federal government says it is easing the risks of nuclear construction, but the $11 billion in overruns at the reactors remain sobering for other utilities. Granholm says she believes others could learn from Vogtle’s mistakes. Lab-grown meat is not currently available in any U.S. grocery stores or restaurants. If some lawmakers have their way, it never will be. Alabama has executed a man convicted of killing an elderly couple at their home in 2004. Authorities say 50-year-old Jamie Ray Mills was pronounced dead Thursday evening following a lethal injection at a south Alabama prison. Mills was convicted of capital murder in the deaths of 87-year-old Floyd Hill and his 72-year-old wife Vera Hill. Mills was the first Alabama inmate put to death since the state became the first in the U.S. to use nitrogen gas to execute another man in January. Lethal injection remains Alabama’s main execution method. Prosecutors said Mills beat the couple with a machete, hammer and a tire iron and stole $140 and medications. The U.S. Department of Labor wants a federal judge to prevent Hyundai and two other Alabama companies from what the government contends is the illegal employment of children. The complaint filed Thursday follows an investigation by the department’s Wage and Hour Division. It said it found a 13-year-old working on an assembly line that makes auto body parts. Defendants include Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama LLC. The lawsuit said it seeks to end alleged child labor use and require the companies to give up any associated profits. Hyundai said it cooperated fully with authorities and called it unfair to be held accountable for the practices of its suppliers. Months after nitrogen gas execution, Alabama puts man to death by chemical injection for elderly couple’s killing.

Eds: The Alabama editorial roundup will not move this week due to a lack of editorials of state-wide interest. We will resume the roundup at its normal time on Wednesday, June 5, 2024. Lab-grown meat is not currently available in any U.S. grocery stores or restaurants. If some lawmakers have their way, it never will be. Earlier this month, both Florida and Alabama banned the sale of cultivated meat and seafood, which is grown from animal cells. In Iowa, the governor signed a bill prohibiting schools from buying lab-grown meat. Federal lawmakers are also looking to restrict it. It’s unclear how far these efforts will go. Some cultivated meat companies say they’re considering legal action, and some states shelved proposed bans after lawmakers argued they would restrict consumers’ choices. The U.S. first approved the sale of lab-grown meat a year ago. MONTGOMERY — Huntingdon College has named Anthony Leigh as its 15th president.

LeFlore Magnet High School for Communication and the Arts earlier Tuesday turned herself in later in the afternoon, according to a statement. The girl started an argument with a 15-year-old boy in the school’s hallway and pulled out a gun to shoot him. The bullet grazed the boy and hit a 17-year-old boy who authorities said had nothing to do with the argument going on around him. Both male students sustained nonfatal wounds from the gunshot. The girl surrendered to police after running away from the school. Mobile County Public Schools spokeswoman Rena Philips said earlier in the day that the student could face expulsion, as well as criminal charges. MCPSS has a “zero tolerance” policy for firearms, she said. It is unclear how the student was able to bring the gun into the school, Philips said. Some schools have policies requiring students to carry clear backpacks, but she said she is unsure if that policy is in place at LeFlore. MCPSS teachers are trained to respond to situations such as this, Philips said, and those protocols went into effect during Tuesday’s shooting. Violence among young people is a topic the city of Mobile has been focused on for a while. In comments to reporters, Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson said it is going to take conversations between students with pastors, parents and community leaders to help solve the problem. ""We can\'t police our way out of challenges like this,"" he said. ""It takes the community."" Recently, Councilman Cory Penn and the city held a forum to address the concerns over youth violence and seek guidance from community members on ways to improve the situation. Stimpson said he supports LeFlore graduate Penn on any plans moving forward. As for Penn himself, he said he’s there to “support the community” at his alma mater and a school in his City Council district. Corsica Lambert, a Leflore graduate and mother of two daughters at LeFlore told Lagniappe she was “terrified” and left work early to see what was going on. Both of her daughters are OK. ""My daughter was scared, she was distraught,” Lambert said. ""They\'re scared, my daughter told me to come get her."" Baldwin County Public Schools Superintendent Eddie Tyler said in a statement news of the shooting broke his heart, and he pledged to help MCPSS. ""School violence is an issue we deal with every day and, in fact, all educators are dealing with it across Alabama and across the country,"" Tyler said. ""Schools must be a safe place for children and we will do anything we can to support Mobile County in this difficult time and mission."" The investigation is ongoing.

Events already lined up for the upcoming year at the site will still move forward. “This is certainly exciting,” said Council President Kent Back. “We are the caretakers of a kind of one-of-a-kind piece of property. I think this is a move in the right direction to bolster those campgrounds and to even attract more of that money that comes from out of state. I think it’s a smart move.” The funds for such a large project are coming from revenue brought in by some of those out of state travelers. According to Ford, the Christmas At The Falls event is paying for the renovations. “We had the biggest year [at Christmas At The Falls] we’ve ever had,” Ford said. “This [project] will be paid for in 10 to 12 years.” Reach more people with your message.

The statewide news site al.com put out a calendar with one restaurant for each month its readers should try. Pizza Ed in Guntersville and Hartselle made the list for May. Here's what al.com said: The husband-and-wife team of Eddie and Chandra Gwin opened Pizza Ed on “a pie and a prayer,” as Eddie likes to say, in downtown Hartselle five years ago. Buoyed by its success, the Gwins opened a second Pizza Ed in Guntersville this past summer. The Pizza Ed menu features classic New York hand-tossed, Chicago deep dish, and thin-and-crispy Chicago tavern-style pizzas, which are made with Stanislaus tomatoes, Bacio cheeses and Fontanini sausages and pepperonis, among other toppings. Although running two pizzerias in two different cities keeps them hopping, in their spare time, the Gwins love to travel to some of the top pizza restaurants in the country to learn more about the craft and the business. That extra effort shows in every pie they serve, and in 2023, Pizza Ed topped AL.com’s list of the 10 best pizzerias in Alabama. Log In Keep it Clean.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 1:54 pm The National Book Critics Circle in late January announced 30 finalists in six categories — autobiography, biography, criticism, fiction, general nonfiction and poetry — for the best books of publishing year 2023. Other announcements included two lifetime achievement awards, the NBCC Service Award, the winner and finalists for the Nona Balakian Citation, finalists for the John Leonard Prize for Best First Book and the shortlist for the Gregg Barrios Book in Translation Prize. “It’s a thrilling privilege for the NBCC to continue the work envisioned by John Leonard, Nona Balakian, and Ivan Sandrof in 1974: to honor outstanding writing and foster a national conversation about literature,” said NBCC president Heather Scott Partington. “This year’s remarkable and uncompromising finalists delve into subjects as diverse as adoption, authorial identity, cultural disruption, mythmaking, and the banal,” Partington said. “Many tell stories that have previously been silenced or ignored. Our Sandrof Life Achievement Award and Morrison Achievement Award winners Judy Blume and the ALA exemplify how literacy and literary access lead to liberation. What a beautiful year for books.” The finalists in the NBCC’s six categories represent a wide-ranging array of writers, translators and presses. As autobiography award chair May-lee Chai said, “It was a particularly rich year for autobiography. Each book on the shortlist changed the way we viewed the world in some fundamental way.” Fiction award chair David Varno said, “It was a staggering year of worthy novels and collections. Each of the finalists pushes the limits of what we think fiction can do.” In addition to the six award categories, the NBCC announced the finalists for the John Leonard Prize and the Gregg Barrios Book in Translation Prize. Mandana Chaffa, vice president of the Barrios Book in Translation Prize said, “We’re immensely proud of our rich multi-genre shortlist which celebrates the work of both translators and authors from diverse cultures and languages, and also underscores the importance of independent and small press publishers in our literary conversation.” The recipient of the 2023 Nona Balakian Citation for Excellence in Reviewing is Becca Rothfeld, the nonfiction book critic for The Washington Post, whose reviews have also appeared in a variety of publications. “The two reviews that Rothfeld submitted, of Benjamin Labatut’s historical novel, ‘The MANIAC,’ and Sen. Josh Hawley’s self-help book, ‘Manhood: The Masculine Virtues America Needs,’ brilliantly embody her insight, range and depth of knowledge in lively and persuasive prose,” said Balakian committee chair Colette Bancroft. The recipient of the Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award is Judy Blume. Named after the first president of the NBCC, the award has gone to past winners such as Percival Everett and Joy Harjo. As award chair Jacob M. Appel said, “Blume, whose widely acclaimed works include such modern classics as ‘Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret,’ has inspired generations of young readers by tackling the emotional turbulence of girlhood and adolescence with authenticity, candor and courage. As her works generated controversy, she earned a national reputation as a relentless opponent of censorship and an iconic champion of literary freedom. At 85, this grand doyenne of American letters now owns and operates a non-profit bookstore, Books & Books, in Key West, Florida.” The recipient of the Toni Morrison Achievement Award, established by the NBCC in 2021 to honor institutions that have made lasting and meaningful contributions to book culture, is the American Library Association. As Appel said, “We honor the ALA for its longstanding commitment to equity, including its twentieth century campaigns against library segregation and for LGBT+ literature, and its perennial stance as a bulwark against those regressive and illiberal supporters of book bans. At a time when our nation’s libraries remain under relentless assault from both political and economic forces, the ALA towers over the literary landscape as a beacon for our most vulnerable voices.” The National Book Critics Circle Awards, founded in 1974 at the Algonquin Hotel and considered among the most prestigious in American letters, are the sole prizes bestowed by a jury of working critics and book review editors. The awards for publishing year 2023 will be presented on March 21, 2024 at the New School in New York City, in a ceremony that will be free and open to the public.

replace Nick Saban. Washington coach Kalen DeBoer has agreed to become the next Alabama coach, a source with direct knowledge has confirmed to The Tuscaloosa News. He fills the opening created after Saban announced his retirement on Wednesday. Details for his contract are not yet known. He made $4.2 million this season at Washington, and he will owe Washington a $12 million buyout. DeBoer, 49, has coached Washington the past two seasons, leading the Huskies to a 25-3 record and an appearance in the CFP national championship game this week. That was the only game Washington lost in the 2023 season. DeBoer has won everywhere he's been. Before Washington, he coached two seasons at Fresno State and five seasons at the University of Sioux Falls, an NAIA school where DeBoer went 67-3. At Washington and Fresno State, DeBoer has an overall record of 37-9, including wins over Oregon three times, Texas twice and USC. His previous roles include offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach at Indiana, Fresno State and Eastern Michigan. He began as a receivers coach at Sioux Falls in 1997. DeBoer has the colossal task of replacing a seven-time national championship coach. Saban won six of those titles at Alabama over 17 seasons, to go with 10 SEC West titles and nine SEC Championships. MORE: Relive Nick Saban's epic Alabama football coaching career with our special book! EPIC NICK SABAN STORIES: Epic Nick Saban stories, as told by Alabama football players who'd know as he retires Alabama athletics director Greg Byrne had to begin his search Wednesday after Saban decided to retire. Names that emerged by Thursday night included DeBoer, Florida State's Mike Norvell and Alabama offensive coordinator Tommy Rees. Texas' Steve Sarkisian was also thought to be a name to watch. Norvell and Sarkisian each confirmed commitments to their schools on social media. There was no such confirmation from DeBoer, though. Instead, he decided to become Alabama's next coach. DeBoer took over a Washington team that finished 4-8 in 2021 under Jimmy Lake. He went 11-2 in 2022 and became the first Washington coach to win a bowl game in his rookie season. He had a 3-0 record vs. ranked teams and beat Sarkisian and Texas in the Alamo Bowl. The Huskies tied for second in the Pac-12. Then in 2023, Washington finished 14-1, an effort that resulted in him winning Pac-12 coach of the year for the second consecutive season; he was co-coach of the year in 2022. Washington's only loss was to Michigan in the College Football Playoff final. The Huskies beat Oregon twice, Utah, Oregon State and USC – all ranked at the time – en route to the Sugar Bowl, where they beat No. 3 Texas in the CFP semifinals. DeBoer was named AP coach of the year this season, beating out Norvell, Missouri' coach's Eli Drinkwitz and Arizona's Jedd Fisch. His other accolades include NAIA coach of the year three times, AFCA coach of the year (2023), Eddie Robinson coach of the year (2023), Home Depot coach of the year (2023), Sporting News coach of the year (2023) and Walter Camp coach of the year (2023). DeBoer, a native of Milbank, South Dakota, attended Sioux Falls and played football and baseball. He was a wide receiver who tallied 3,400 yards on 234 receptions and 33 touchdowns. He was also a member of a NAIA Division II national championship team. He was a successful baseball player, too. DeBoer batted .520, still a school record, during his senior year in 1998. He hit 37 home runs over his collegiate baseball career with a .944 slugging percentage. When he was the offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach for the Hoosiers in 2019, Indiana finished No. 42 in the nation in scoring offense. The Hoosiers averaged 302.4 yards per game passing and 130.8 yards rushing. At Fresno State, DeBoer coordinated the nation's No. 28 offense in points per game with 34.6 in 2018, an improvement from 27.1 points per game in his first season (No. 77). While at Eastern Michigan, DeBoer's offenses finished No. 61 (2016), No. 91 (2015) and No. 126 (2014). It's clear he improves each of the groups he has coached as an offensive coordinator. DeBoer led Sioux Falls to three NAIA championships in his five seasons. Those wins came in 2006, 2008 and 2009. He also led his team to a runner-up finish in 2007. Of course, that's a long ways from winning College Football Playoff national championships, but it's a good sign DeBoer knows how to win in big games. DeBoer has risen to the top of his profession, but once upon a time, he was coaching high school football. In the second coaching job of his career, DeBoer became an assistant coach at Washington High School in South Dakota. He was there from 1988-89. DeBoer has a wife, Nicole, and two daughters, Alexis and Avery. Alexis DeBoer is a top softball prospect who is currently signed to play for Washington. She was ranked No. 11 in the 2024 recruiting class by Extra Innings Softball.

U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm is calling for more nuclear reactors to be built in the United States and worldwide. But the CEO of the Georgia utility that just finished two reactors at a cost of nearly $35 billion says his company isn’t ready to pick up that baton. Granholm spoke Friday at Plant Vogtle, where Georgia Power and three other utilities put a second new reactor into operation last month. The federal government says it is easing the risks of nuclear construction, but the $11 billion in overruns at the reactors remain sobering for other utilities. Granholm says she believes others could learn from Vogtle’s mistakes. Alabama has executed a man convicted of killing an elderly couple at their home in 2004. Authorities say 50-year-old Jamie Ray Mills was pronounced dead Thursday evening following a lethal injection at a south Alabama prison. Mills was convicted of capital murder in the deaths of 87-year-old Floyd Hill and his 72-year-old wife Vera Hill. Mills was the first Alabama inmate put to death since the state became the first in the U.S. to use nitrogen gas to execute another man in January. Lethal injection remains Alabama’s main execution method. Prosecutors said Mills beat the couple with a machete, hammer and a tire iron and stole $140 and medications. The U.S. Department of Labor wants a federal judge to prevent Hyundai and two other Alabama companies from what the government contends is the illegal employment of children. The complaint filed Thursday follows an investigation by the department’s Wage and Hour Division. It said it found a 13-year-old working on an assembly line that makes auto body parts. Defendants include Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama LLC. The lawsuit said it seeks to end alleged child labor use and require the companies to give up any associated profits. Hyundai said it cooperated fully with authorities and called it unfair to be held accountable for the practices of its suppliers. Months after nitrogen gas execution, Alabama puts man to death by chemical injection for elderly couple’s killing.

A series of powerful storms in the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend has killed at least 22 people as they left a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages.

Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coat later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. By letting Donald Trump be Donald Trump, the Right Side Broadcasting Network has grown from a shoestring operation to a major player in the former president\'s universe. RSBN beams Trump\'s rallies and other events live, allowing him to skirt traditional media and inject his vision for America directly into the veins of his diehard supporters. The channel has amassed more than 2 million subscribers on its YouTube channel and on Rumble, an alternative video-sharing platform. RSBN’s positive coverage has made the internet channel a Trump favorite and a destination for his “MAGA” movement, a reference to the ex-president’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. In less than a decade, Right Side Broadcasting Network has gone from an upstart internet broadcaster to a major player in Donald Trump’s universe, amassing more than 2 million subscribers on its YouTube channel and on Rumble, an alternative video-sharing platform.

The Supreme Court has preserved a Republican-held South Carolina congressional district, rejecting a lower-court ruling that the district discriminated against Black voters. The justices said Thursday the Republican-controlled state legislature did nothing wrong during redistricting when it strengthened Rep. Nancy Mace’s hold on the coastal district by moving 30,000 Democratic-leaning Black Charleston residents from the district. The state argued partisan politics, not race, and a population boom in coastal areas explain the map. A lower court had ordered South Carolina to redraw the district after finding it used race as a proxy for partisan affiliation. The case differed from one in Alabama, where the court ruled Republican lawmakers diluted Black voters’ political power. MONTGOMERY, Ala.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 1:57 pm Photo by Robert Sutton / Crimson Tide Photos / UA Athletics It’s the news few is any Alabama fans wanted to hear. The news broke Wednesday afternoon that University of Alabama Head Football Coach Nick Saban announced his retirement, after an unparalleled career at the Capstone, after an impressive career at other locales. His teams won seven national titles – six of them at Alabama. Sports Illustrated reported Saban was reportedly stepping down, and described his career in this way: “Through 2012 he had a perfect record when a crystal football was on the line. He notched the most wins when ranked No. 1, and beat the team ranked No. 1 the most. He’s the only coach in the modern era to win titles with two different programs, and he’s done so while competing in a conference that was similarly at its own unique level,” Christopher Walsh wrote. His story online was headlined: “Nick Saban's Legacy is Simple: The Greatest College Football Coach Ever.” Saban came to the University of Alabama in 2007, a heralded hire after a series of coaches that came nowhere near to restoring the program to the place it had occupied during Coach Paul “Bear” Bryant’s tenure. Even his critics would likely argree that Saban did that, and more. Log In Keep it Clean. Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexually-oriented language. PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR CAPS LOCK.

He said it would be a great asset for the sheriff’s department with training for deputies. “We’ve never had that before in Coffee County,” Byrd said. “I want to thank the commissioners for approving that grant, and I especially want to thank Mike Thornton for getting the ball rolling on the project.” He said the venue would include a classroom and pistol range. Commission chairman Dean Smith asked Sheriff Byrd if he thought gun safety classes would be offered to the public in the future at the new range once it is constructed, and the sheriff said he absolutely anticipated that being something offered to the public. “I foresee that class being booked for months,” Sheriff Byrd said regarding a public firing class. The county administrator also received approval from commissioners during Monday’s meeting to execute an easement agreement with Alabama Power at the site of the new State Bureau of Investigations building being constructed in Coffee County for the SBI and ABC Board. County engineer Michael Walters received approval from commissioners to make the 2024 truck purchase for the highway department. He said this is done annually with the county’s dump trucks to keep miles down and the vehicles under warranty. “This is a program that has worked well for us for many years now,” Walters said. He said the trucks being purchased are scheduled for a June delivery. Commissioners voted to approve the purchase of five new dump trucks at $197,500 per chassis and one truck-tractor to be utilized as the county’s low-boy truck tractor at a cost of $201,200. Walters said these trucks would be purchased from Truck Works of Alabama using the ACCA [Association of County Commissions of Alabama] joint bid. Also, upon Walters’ request, commissioners approved the annual report for the Rebuild Alabama Grant. He said this report is an annual requirement of the Rebuild Alabama Grant Program to show the additional gas taxes are being used on roadways. In Fiscal Year 2023, Walters said the county was able to use $942,586.54 of Rebuild Alabama funds to resurface county roads 719, 346, 450 and the west end of County Rd. 239. Commissioners also approved a minor subdivision plat for Blanton’s Pass on County Rd 708. The county engineer said this subdivision would include 15 lots. The next Coffee County Commission meeting will be Monday, Jan. 22, at 9 a.m., at the county complex in New Brockton, Ala. Editor Log In Keep it Clean.

Jacksonians, a group of people who behave in ways the media has misjudged are the force beyond today\'s polls numbers. We also took a bit about calling states for networks in elections, something Ellis had a role in in the 2000 election. Bulwark host Charlie Sykes talks with Joe Klein and John Ellis about MAGA putting Taylor at the top of its enemies list, Greg Abbott inviting another Jan 6 at the border, and GOP governors coming out for just ignoring the Supreme Court — plus these potential tech disruptors in the election will set your hair on fire. For this edition of ""The Takeout,"" Major Garrett speaks to political analysts and hosts of the ""Night Owls"" podcast, Joe Klein and John Ellis. Ahead of the Super Tuesday primaries, the trio discuss all things politics, from President Biden\'s age, to the war in Gaza, to the happenings on the 2024 campaign trail.

In this newest episode “Trump Beat Rupert Murdoch” Taegan Goddard, the founder and publisher of Political Wire, and John Ellis discuss Rupert Murdoch’s retirement, Fox News’s unsuccessful effort to make Donald Trump disappear and, on the eve of the second debate, where things stand in the GOP presidential nomination campaign. In this fascinating conversation, John Ellis and Grant Williams discuss Code Inequality and the dangers it poses to society as well as the implications for governments as the rise of AI continues. We also discuss the lack of understanding in mainstream media about the level of threat posed by the financialization of everything. John Ellis and Jim Haskel of Bridgewater Associates speak with Karen Karniol-Tambour, Bridgewater Associates’ co-Chief Investment Officer. They cover a wide range of topics, from markets to geopolitics to climate. It\'s said that energy and intelligence are what make a great podcast, Ms. Karniol-Tambour is a podcaster’s dream. In this episode, we go one-on-one with news media industry veteran John Ellis about his 40+ year journey from NBC News, columnist for the Boston Globe and LA Times, leadership roles in the 21st century at CNBC, and FOX News. We also chat with Ellis on how he sees journalism and news publishing in general have changed over the decades, where the industry is today and how he feels it will evolve in the years to come.

'2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'New Alabama football coach Kalen DeBoer and offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb engineered one of the most prolific offenses in college football over the past two seasons at the University of Washington. The shotgun attack featured a heavy emphasis on the short passing game, but included plenty of vertical routes that went for explosive plays, with a remarkable variety of wrinkles and a high degree of unpredictability. And while the high-flying Huskies were led by a Heisman Trophy finalist quarterback in Michael Penix last year, they ran the ball well enough for Dillon Johnson, a transfer from Mississippi State, to rumble for 1,195 yards and 16 touchdowns over 15 games. The Deober/Grubb approach to offense bears little resemblance to what Alabama ran under former offensive coordinator Tommy Rees last year, so installation will be a major adjustment for the Crimson Tide\'s returning offensive players. DeBoer said upon being hired that his offensive staff will tailor the offense to the talent on hand, and to the extent that he\'s willing to do so, that should make the transition somewhat easier. But make no mistake: Alabama\'s offense isn\'t going to look at all the same. Below, we unpack some of the key differences, and note a few similarities, that can be expected. You can also see much of what\'s featured in the Tuscaloosa News\' All-22 Film Room breakdown of the DeBoer/Grubb offense. The Huskies attack defenses with a bevy of screen passes and short throws, but the route concepts often include a vertical pattern, allowing the quarterback to take deep shots here and there. UW averaged 344 passing yards per game, which ranked No. 2 in the nation. The screen package is diverse and oft-called by Grubb; UW threw 73 screen passes on the year, an average of once every eight throws. That\'s a far heavier reliance on the screen game than what Alabama fans saw from Tommy Rees last year. Grubb also likes to run dual crossing routes across the middle from opposite sides of the field, creating a ""rub"" with one receiver to free another and strain the defense horizontally. Throw in a good dose of short curl routes against loose coverage, and it\'s little wonder that opposing pass rushes averaged less than a sack per game against Washington. The offense is designed for the quarterback to get rid of the ball quickly. GOODBREAD: Alabama football QB Jalen Milroe in for major adjustment to Kalen DeBoer offense VIDEO ANALYSIS: All-22 film room: Inside the Kalen DeBoer offense coming to Alabama football this fall On this question, there are two areas where Washington and Alabama were similar last year: 1) Both primarily lined up in the shotgun with one running back offset to one side; 2) Both made frequent use of ""12"" personnel (one running back, two tight ends). Beyond that, the DeBoer/Grubb attack last year was much more diverse, formationally speaking, than Alabama\'s. Washington used more pre-snap motion. It often lined up a tight end and an H-back beside a tackle to create an extended edge to the offensive line. Its trips formations (three wide receivers to one side) were sometimes split wide but other times bunched close to the offensive line. As for other formations, Grubb also used the Pistol formation, an empty backfield, a smattering of traditional I-formation, and even a few snaps in Wildcat formation. Both Alabama and Washington employed a similar mix of gap-scheme and zone-scheme blocking when it came to the running game. But the UW offense demanded far more athleticism − pulling, blocking in space and reaching linebackers − from its Joe Moore Award-winning line. Between all the aforementioned screen passes, which heavily involve downfield blocks from linemen, and run concepts that call for the big men to pull to the edge, the Alabama returning linemen who can run and lock onto moving targets will have a better chance of surfacing to the starting lineup. The Huskies\' starting offensive line averaged 305 pounds per man. By contrast, Alabama\'s starting line − the biggest in the SEC by a significant margin − averaged 338. It won\'t be surprising if 352-pound guard Tyler Booker, for instance, is asked, or chose on his own, to shed a few pounds in advance of the season. Said former Washington right tackle Roger Rosengarten: ""I\'m sure they\'re great players and will do fine under (offensive line) coach (Scott) Huff, but there is a lot of pulling and a lot of moving. It\'s different from a technique standpoint."" Also worth noting: Grubb built a background coaching offensive lines before he became a quarterbacks coach. While Washington was efficient when it decided to go without a huddle, the Huskies offense didn\'t operate at a breakneck speed. It was deliberate with checks and audibles, and didn\'t mind burning seconds deep into the play clock. In fact, Grubb\'s offense ranked in the bottom half of the FBS last year in seconds per snap, averaging a play every 27.2 seconds (87th of 130 FBS teams). For perspective, with the exception of service academies, CFP champion Michigan was the slowest-paced offense in the country at 30.9 seconds per play. The fastest was Jacksonville State at 20.3, and Alabama ranked 95th at 27.6. In watching all 985 of Washington\'s offensive snaps last year, The Tuscaloosa News counted 16 trick plays in 15 games, an average of just over one per game. That\'s a great deal more trickery than was typical for an Alabama offense under Nick Saban. Wide receiver Germie Bernard, who has transferred to Alabama, was involved in several of them; he even threw a pass for a 14-yard completion. Grubb called everything from a standard flea flicker to a variation of the always-fun Emory & Henry formation. The reverse pass and the double pass, or some variation of them, comprised about half of those trick plays. While the aforementioned I-formation didn\'t show up much in the UW offense until midseason, it was relatively common when the Huskies got inside the opponent\'s 5-yard line, especially when snapping from the 1 or 2. That should be music to the ears of Alabama fans who witnessed the horror of a shotgun snap from the 1-yard line that sailed over QB Jalen Milroe\'s head last year against Ole Miss. The Huskies sometimes employed the ""sugar"" huddle when near the goal line, a quick huddle that breaks close to the line of scrimmage and allows the defense little time to get set.

The Auburn defense seemed to be too much for the home team as the Razorbacks were only shooting 16.7% from the field, only putting up six points by the end of the first quarter. In the second quarter, the Razorbacks picked up a little more momentum, putting up 17 points for the quarter. However, Auburn maintained the lead, up by nine to end the half. The home team came in hot to start the second half with back-to-back three-point jumpers. The Razorbacks eventually tied the game with just under five minutes left in the third quarter. Arkansas finished the quarter with 31 points in third alone. Auburn eventually scored in the last couple minutes to end Arkansas' run but still trailed 56-45. The Razorbacks extended their lead by three to start the fourth quarter followed by a three from Scott-Grayson to put the Tigers within seven. Auburn continued to fight back, eventually cutting the lead to three points with four minutes to go. A bucket from Collins put Auburn within one point, but the Razorbacks quickly responded with an and-one under the basket. Collins tied the game at the free-throw line with just a minute and a half remaining, but another three-point play from the Razorbacks gave them the lead with less than a minute on the clock. A failed three-point attempt from Auburn caused the Tigers to foul, resulting in free throws from the home team. After two made free throws which put Arkansas back up by five, Scott-Grayson put Auburn within two with a three-point jumper. Auburn fouled Arkansas again and the Razorbacks missed both of its free throws to give Auburn another chance. After a missed Collins layup and a review, Auburn maintained possession under its own basket with 1.8 seconds left to play. Arkansas stole the ensuing out of bounds play from Auburn, but the Razorbacks' fell out of bounds and gave the Tigers .8 seconds to score – signaling the Tigers last hope of tying the game. Mar'shaun Bostic passed to Collins who got the shot off, but the ball failed to go through the bottom of the net as the Tigers fell in heartbreaking fashion. “I thought we played tough,” said Auburn head coach Johnnie Harris. “We knocked down shots in the first half, we were right at 50 percent. I thought everything else was good except guarding (Taliah Scott). If we make our free throws… We were 13-of-27, we lost by two, and we left 11 points on the board.” Up next, the Tigers head to Columbia, Missouri to take on the Missouri Tigers on Sunday, Feb. 11. Tipoff is set for 1 pm CST, and the game will be televised on SEC Network. Do you like this story?

(AP Photo/Matt Slocum, File)AP When two Native American boys from Nebraska died after being taken to a notorious boarding school hundreds of miles away in Pennsylvania, they were buried there without notice. Nearly 130 years later, the tribe wants the boys’ remains back home. So far, the Army has refused to return to the Winnebago Tribe the remains of Samuel Gilbert and Edward Hensley. A federal lawsuit filed on behalf of the tribe accuses the Army of ignoring a law passed more than three decades ago aimed at expediting the return of the deceased to Native American lands. Samuel had been at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania for just 47 days when he died in 1895. Edward spent four years at the school before dying in 1899. Both died in their teens, but records do not disclose their exact ages. Tribal leaders weren’t informed when the boys died, and relatives never learned what killed them. The tribe made a formal request to the Office of Army Cemeteries for the remains in October but learned in December that the request was denied, according to the lawsuit filed Jan. 17. “The Army always sought to maintain a position of control, dominance over native peoples while they were alive — and while they were dead,” said Greg Werkheiser of Cultural Heritage Partners, one of the lawyers for the tribe. The bodies remain in a graveyard along with those of about 180 other children not far from where the school once stood in Carlisle, some 1,150 miles (1,850 kilometers) from the tribe’s eastern Nebraska home. The graveyard serves as a “tourist attraction,” the lawsuit states. A spokesperson for the Office of Army Cemeteries said she can’t comment on pending litigation. But the spokesperson said in an email that Samuel and Edward, along with other children who died at the boarding school, are buried in individual graves with named headstones. “The cemetery is a dignified resting place demonstrating respect and care of all the deceased buried there and is absolutely not treated as a tourist attraction,” the spokesperson said. The Carlisle Indian Industrial School in south-central Pennsylvania, the first government-operated school for Native Americans, was founded by a former military officer, Richard Henry Pratt. He believed that Native Americans could be a productive part of society, but only through assimilation. After it opened in 1879 in an old Army barracks, thousands of Native American children were sent by train and stagecoach to Carlisle. Drastic steps were taken to separate them from their culture, including cutting their braids, dressing them in military-style uniforms and punishing them for speaking their native languages. They were forced to adopt European names. More than 10,000 children from more than 140 tribes passed through the school by the time it closed in 1918, including Olympian Jim Thorpe. The children — often taken against the will of their parents — endured harsh conditions that sometimes led to death from tuberculosis and other diseases. The remains of some of those who died were returned to their tribes. The rest are buried in Carlisle. After the school closed, the property was transferred from the Department of Interior to the War Department. It was used by the Army for a rehabilitation hospital and the Medical Field Service School. The OAC spokesperson said the original cemetery was “in an inappropriate location adjacent to the pre-existing refuse dump, and blacksmith shop,” so the remains were moved in 1927 to another location on Carlisle Barracks. Servicemembers, veterans and their families also are buried there. In 1990, Congress passed the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, or NAGPRA. It allowed for remains to be returned to tribes at their request. But the lawsuit said the Army refused to follow that law and is instead requiring the tribe to adhere to an Army policy. The difference: While NAGPRA requires the remains to be returned, Army policy gives the agency discretion to decide if, and when, to do so. It also requires a request from the boys’ “closest living relative” — which the lawsuit called “nearly impossible to apply in these circumstances.” “Defendants’ conduct perpetuates an evil that the United States Congress sought to correct when it enacted NAGPRA in 1990,” the lawsuit states. The Army has disinterred 32 remains of Native American children at the Army’s expense since 2017, the OAC spokesperson said. But Werkheiser said those remains weren’t technically returned to the tribes, but rather to the children’s relatives, and often after arduous waits. He said that using the Army process rather than NAGPRA “strips the tribes of all of their political rights.” Tribes whose members had remains returned include the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate, Spirit Lake, Washoe, Umpqua, Ute, Rosebud Sioux, Northern Arapaho, Blackfeet, Oglala Sioux, Oneida, Omaha, Modoc, Iowa and Alaskan native. “The Winnebago, after listening to what all those other tribes went through, said, ‘We’re not going to play this game. We’re not going to be bullied.’” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American Cabinet secretary, has pushed the government to reckon with its role in Native American boarding schools. In 2022, her agency released a report naming the 408 schools the federal government supported to strip Native Americans of their cultures and identities. At least 500 children died at some of the schools, including Carlisle. The lawsuit states that the Winnebago Tribe “continues to experience the pain of knowing that Samuel’s and Edward’s spirits remain lost.” “The way Winnebago views it is that the boys have been waiting to come home for nearly 125 years,” said another attorney involved in the lawsuit, Beth Wright of the Native American Rights Fund. “Their spirits can’t rest and they can’t go on unless they are returned to the place that they were taken from.” __ By JIM SALTER Associated Press If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

When she returned to Skyline as a teacher, Debbie immediately made a positive impact on students and the community. Throughout her career, Debbie has given back to the people of Skyline. I’m happy to be able to help a deserving student in her honor, and I hope others who have been blessed by Debbie will donate to the scholarship fund.” Ann B.

2, 2024 By Annie Bresee Martinez Shaver, a graduate of Valley High and current service member in the U.S. Army, spoke to the students of Chambers County on Thursday. Shaver’s talk focused on building resilience and his path through the Chambers County School District. He also spoke some on Black history, as the presentation coincided with the first day of Black History Month, on people he believes signify resiliency in Black history. He included in his list of inspirational figures, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; Harriet Tubman; the creator of what is now Black History Month, Carter Woodson; the abolitionist John Brown, and signer of General Order No. 3 which proclaimed the remaining enslaved peoples free, Gordon Granger. General Order No. 3 is the proclamation that informed the people of Texas that enslaved people were freed, the anniversary of the order is now celebrated as Juneteenth. The majority of the presentation revolved around ways the kids could build resiliency and confidence in their lives; lessons Shaver has learned the hard way. Shaver related his experience of doing well in school and sports for much of his upbringing until he got a job in high school. “I started to hang out in the streets after work. I started to smoke. I started to drink and at about the age I started to do those things,” Shaver said. “In school when you make those bad decisions, the results are bad grades, suspension, it gets you kicked off the team. When you make those types of decisions outside of these four walls, the consequences are much worse.” Shaver said as a result he went through hard moments, including being held at gunpoint. When he realized he wanted a different life, Shaver started working overtime at his job to stay away from vices. Shaver also started writing poetry to fill his time, a passion he holds today as a twice-published author. Soon after college, Shaver joined the military to pay for his tuition to college. He has an associate’s degree and is attending Troy University online to get his bachelor’s degree. Today, he is a staff sergeant and signals intelligence analyst in the Army and has been stationed in multiple countries in Europe. The date of the presentation had to be moved up due to Shaver’s upcoming deployment to South America. Having overcome these obstacles, Shaver had some tips for the kids on becoming resilient. First, he advised kids to fight negative thoughts with positive ones. Shaver also preached the importance of focusing your energy on priorities, giving the example of playing video games rather than studying or practicing for a game. Finally, he told the kids to put their decisions in perspective, asking themselves their part in positive or negative outcomes. The second half of the program focused on building confidence. Shaver’s tips were to complement others and give everything the best effort possible. Shaver’s desire to be a speaker started at Valley High School as a student. Once he started sharing his poetry, often reading it aloud, those around him encouraged him to continue sharing. “I just always wanted to come back [to Chambers County] and encourage them and just try to be a positive influence,” Shaver said.'}]"

Levi Smith’s nonprofit organization announced the addition of a new “Blessing Box” to its Making A Difference (MAD) mission last week, January 24, after reports of vandalism to newest box were made public. Aimed at providing essential items to those in need, Smith’s initiative has become a beacon of community. The expansion comes in the wake of a recent incident where there newest of the existing Blessing Boxes was subjected to vandalism. According to Smith, this is not the first instance of such an occurrence, highlighting an ongoing challenge faced by the MAD mission. In response to these acts, Wesley Daniel of Champion Buildings has stepped in to bolster the initiative, donating a building to Smith’s foundation. Smith explained that early Wednesday morning he received a call that the Blessing Box had been vandalized. “I was just in disbelief and couldn’t wrap my mind around the situation after this same situation not only happened once but twice.” Smith stated that he made a Facebook post asking the community to help get the Blessing Box operational again when Wesley Daniel from Champion Buildings reached out to him and offered one of his buildings free of charge. “After he called me I was speechless,” Smith added. “I was so happy for the community and the blessings that the building will serve to others.” Daniel, who donated the building, explained that he simply saw a need on Facebook. “As Christians, we should be giving blessings. We have been so blessed in our short existence. Part of Champion’s core values is to be a part of the community. Vandalism of the previous building is a negative and we wanted to provide a positive solution.” In light of the repeated vandalism, the organization has had to reevaluate its approach to maintaining the Blessing Boxes. Initially, the locations of these boxes were kept confidential to preserve the privacy and dignity of those utilizing them. However, the recurring acts of vandalism have necessitated a change in this policy. Smith’s foundation has reluctantly decided to install surveillance cameras to monitor the boxes, a measure that was previously not preferred. “Having to put cameras up at the Blessing Box was a very tough decision,” stated Smith. “I felt many emotions. I was honestly devastated because the one thing I wanted was it to be somewhere that people could go and not be seen…but I do think adding 6 cameras to the blessing box location was a good idea because it gives security to the location and it also reassures our donors that the things they donate will be under constant supervision.” Smith emphasizes the significance of supporting local businesses, noting their pivotal role in community welfare. According to Smith, the investment in local commerce is not just about economic transactions but also about nurturing a community that looks out for each other, as evidenced by the support his organization has received, while Daniel emphasized the importance of businesses supporting the community. “Be a positive solution,” said Daniel, “There’s so much negativity in this world today, we can start right here at home being a positive solution.” The MAD mission continues to strive towards making a tangible difference in the lives of those in need, adapting to challenges and receiving backing from local entities. Smith encourages the public to familiarize themselves with the new box at 14888 Court Street in Moulton. “When you walk up to the beautiful blessing box you will open the door to 4 different tables and shelves that are stocked completely full of everything you need from food items to household items and hygiene products,” said Smith. “There is everything for everyone and every age. I understand that everyone has a time of need and we want to be there to support them, but over all I couldn’t do it without the help of the community.” Community members in need can find food and necessary care items at the blessing box, as well as information about resoures in the area that provide help for issues such as homelessness, domestic violence, and addiction. For those wishing to donate items, Smith has suggested the following: bottled water, tea bags, ramen noodles, oatmeal, peanut butter, jelly, bread, pop tarts, knorr rice, chili, ravioli, soups, beans, canned food, individually packed snacks, cold and flu medicine, razors, shaving cream, toothpaste, toothbrushes, toilet paper, pads, tampons, two-in-one shampoo and conditioner, bodywash, bars of soap, deodorant, detergent, diapers, baby wipes, bottles, pacifiers, baby food, formula, blankets, heaters, and toys.

The train, with a length of between a quarter and half a mile, was stopped from the early morning hours until around 7 p.m., blocking access to the crossing on County Road 356, a major thoroughfare for large trucks needing to transport goods and supplies to various markets, according to town officials. According to Norfolk Southern officials, the train stoppage was due to a mechanical issue. Lynn Police Chief Kirkpatrick noted a meeting was being sought with U.S. Congressman Robert Aderholt and members of Winston County’s state legislative delegation, including Representatives Tim Wadsworth and Tracy Estes and Senator Garlan Gudger, as well as Norfolk Southern officials, in hopes of resolving this issue. Although Norfolk Southern had the halted train removed by 7 p.m., town officials are adamant something needs to be done to prevent future events, Kirkpatrick stressed. “We’re going to have a sit-down about this to see if we can get something resolved,” said Kirkpatrick. “It’s repetitive. It happened several times last year, and it is starting again this year.” Kirkpatrick explained the stalled train has caused problems at l three different crossings in the town over the past year at least, with each incident lasting up to 12 hours before the train was moved. According to Norfolk Southern’s own operating guidelines, unattended trains cannot block crossings. According to Norfolk Southern Operating Rules dated April 15, 2023, obtained by the Alabamian, trains, engines or cars when left unattended must clear crossings and crossing signal circuits. “When practicable, the equipment must be at least 300 feet from a public or private crossing,” the rules state. “Public crossings must not be obstructed unnecessarily.” “Something has got to be done,” Kirkpatrick stressed. “This is a small town, but we matter. We have several industries in this town that rely on these crossings. They can’t go out of their way. That is detrimental to the business. State Representative Danny Garrett (R) introduced House Bill 122 in early 2022, that would have placed fines on rail companies each time a stalled train was left on the tracks two or more hours, but the bill never made it out of the state senate.The bill was designed to prohibit blockage of railroad highway grade crossings under certain conditions, and to provide a civil penalty for a violation, according to a copy of the bill. “Except for trains stopped due to mechanical failure, derailment or other unforeseeable events outside the control of the rail carrier...any train that has come to a complete stop and is blocking a railroad highway grade crossing for two or more continuous hours shall be cut, separated, or moved to clear the crossing upon the approach of any authorized emergency vehicle,” wording in the bill read. Also a train blocking such a crossing for over two hours was termed in the bill as a public nuisance. “The rail carrier...operating the train shall pay a civil penalty of $5,000 for each hour the train blocks the railroad highway grade crossing, provided the civil penalty does not exceed $50,000,” according to the bill. After this most recent incident in Lynn, State Representative Tracy Estes noted he is seeking to have such a bill reintroduced in the legislature. “I’m aware of the bill we did get through the House in 2022,” Estes stated. “We passed it at the House, but that was as far as it got.” Estes noted he would be seeking answers to legal questions, as to what authority needs to be taken in dealing with this situation. “I’ve had a conversation with Congressman (Robert) Aderholt about this issue,” Estes said. “He understands the federal government will have more influence here than the state government, simply because they have more power in situations such as these. “Even with that said, I know our Winston County delegation will work together to do what we can at the state level to see if we can remedy this circumstance, to be an aid and assistance to our local industries and to the residents who travel these roads that are impacted,” Estes emphasized. State Representative Tim Wadsworth noted he has contacted the Public Service Commission and Federal Regulatory Commission, and got with the Town of Lynn to draft letters for business owners to send to those agencies about the problem. “For something (to sit on the tracks) 12 hours is a violation of the law,” Wadsworth stated. “I can understand why all of the businesses in the Town of Lynn and citizens are upset,” Wadsworth pointed out. “Something has to be done. You are going to have the regulatory (commission) do the investigation, so this will not happen in the future. “Hopefully, (Norfolk Southern) will be sanctioned for their actions,” Wadsworth pointed out. Aderholt stressed his office has been in frequent contact with Norfolk Southern officials and that any such issues with rail companies should be addressed at the federal level. “You get their attention when you have legislation that they hear is moving,” Aderholt said. “If you just threaten them, the big train companies like the Norfolk Southerns of the world, they will sometimes brush you off,” Aderholt added. “But if they understand there is going to be some federal legislation that impacts them, then you can get their attention. “I think something probably needs to be done on the federal level,” Aderholt pointed out. “That is something we can’t have in Winston County or any part of the 4th (Congressional) district as far I’m concerned, anywhere in the state,” Aderholt emphasized. “Obviously, there are a lot of federal laws that govern the railroads that you just can’t run over them,” Aderholt began. “But at the same time, this is clearly something that is impeding economic development and commerce.” Aderholt has also dealt with stopped trains blocking key intersections in Sheffield, literally dividing that city into two sections, Aderholt explained. “No matter where it is, it’s a real issue,” Aderholt pointed out. The key, Aderholt continued, is to work with Norfolk Southern and any affected railway companies to make sure they understand that when they are blocking crossings, they are blocking commerce. “They are blocking economic development, especially for an area like Lynn where you shut everything down,” Aderholt stressed. Aderholt admitted he didn’t know of an immediate solution, but would seek an answer. “We want to make sure that doesn’t happen again,” he said. Giving train companies the benefit of the doubt, Aderholt did say sometimes emergencies cause trains to be parked on tracks for extended periods. “But they have to be very mindful of the local communities and the local areas. I want to make sure they are not just taking advantage,” Aderholt said. “When it’s 12 hours,” he added. “That’s when it becomes inexcusable.” Bill introduced at federal level Senate Bill S 576, known as the Railway Safety Act of 2023, was introduced in the U.S. Senate on March 1, 2023, sponsored by Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and J.D. Vance (R-OH). This bill addresses safety requirements for rail carriers and trains transporting hazardous materials. It was referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation in March, 2023, but no action has been taken, according to Congress.gov. Neither of Alabama’s senators have signed on as co-sponsors of the bill. The bill’s language specifically states that the Department of Transportation (DOT) must issue safety regulations for trains carrying hazardous materials, requiring that rail carriers or shippers (1) provide state emergency response commissioners with advanced notice and information about the hazardous materials; (2) reduce blocked rail crossings; and (3) comply with certain requirements regarding train length and weight specifications, track standards, speed restrictions and response plans. U.S. House Bill 1674 is the House version of the legislation, sponsored by Christopher R. Deluzio (D-PA) and also introduced in 2023. Aderholt has not signed on as a co-sponsor of this legislation, although several of his Republican colleagues have, according to congress.gov. The House bill has been referred to the House Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials, of which Aderholt is not a member.

U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm is calling for more nuclear reactors to be built in the United States and worldwide. But the CEO of the Georgia utility that just finished two reactors at a cost of nearly $35 billion says his company isn’t ready to pick up that baton. Granholm spoke Friday at Plant Vogtle, where Georgia Power and three other utilities put a second new reactor into operation last month. The federal government says it is easing the risks of nuclear construction, but the $11 billion in overruns at the reactors remain sobering for other utilities. Granholm says she believes others could learn from Vogtle’s mistakes. Alabama has executed a man convicted of killing an elderly couple at their home in 2004. Authorities say 50-year-old Jamie Ray Mills was pronounced dead Thursday evening following a lethal injection at a south Alabama prison. Mills was convicted of capital murder in the deaths of 87-year-old Floyd Hill and his 72-year-old wife Vera Hill. Mills was the first Alabama inmate put to death since the state became the first in the U.S. to use nitrogen gas to execute another man in January. Lethal injection remains Alabama’s main execution method. Prosecutors said Mills beat the couple with a machete, hammer and a tire iron and stole $140 and medications. The U.S. Department of Labor wants a federal judge to prevent Hyundai and two other Alabama companies from what the government contends is the illegal employment of children. The complaint filed Thursday follows an investigation by the department’s Wage and Hour Division. It said it found a 13-year-old working on an assembly line that makes auto body parts. Defendants include Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama LLC. The lawsuit said it seeks to end alleged child labor use and require the companies to give up any associated profits. Hyundai said it cooperated fully with authorities and called it unfair to be held accountable for the practices of its suppliers. Months after nitrogen gas execution, Alabama puts man to death by chemical injection for elderly couple’s killing.
