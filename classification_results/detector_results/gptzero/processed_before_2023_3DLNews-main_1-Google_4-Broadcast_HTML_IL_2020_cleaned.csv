Griffin, 64, has worked at NBC News for 35 years and has been president of MSNBC since 2008. With a primetime lineup led by Rachel Maddow, it has become established as the favorite of those wanting news from a liberal perspective. Jones, who has been with NBC News for the past seven years, is currently chief of breaking news and major events at the network. She just led the network’s coverage of the 2020 presidential election and the team preparing Kristen Welker as moderator of the third presidential debate. She’s the first Black executive to lead one of the major cable networks. Cesar Conde, the new chairman of the NBC Universal News Group, has made diversity one of his top priorities. “She leads with a laser-like focus and grace under pressure,” Conde said. Jones takes over on Feb. 1. Her immediate challenge will be leading the network into coverage of the Biden administration; many in the news industry have feared that the exit of President Donald Trump means the time of high ratings for news networks may be coming to an end. Griffin is leaving the network, and it’s not immediately clear what he’ll be doing next. “Phil has built something remarkable,” Conde said in a memo to NBC News staff. “He leaves the network in the best shape it has ever been. Six straight record years. Each one better than the last.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.'}]"

by Sarah Rosenthal QUINCY, Ill. (KHQA) — Multiple national media outlets have projected Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to be the winners of the 2020 presidential election. President Donald Trump disputes this. President-Elect Biden is putting together a team to take over the reins of the government on Jan. 20, 2021. However, Trump and his team insist the election is not over. Both sides are reacting, leading to celebrations and protest rallies. Both Democrats and Republicans reside in the Tri-States, but voters in the area tend to vote on the conservative, Republican ticket for the most part in presidential elections. Many Tri-State Democrats are celebrating the projected winner of this year\'s presidential election. Meanwhile, many Tri-State Republicans are questioning that projected winner, just as many Republicans across the country are doing. Some area residents are continuing to break the law days after the presidential election. The Biden-Harris billboard on State Street in Quincy was vandalized again with graffiti over the weekend. As KHQA reported last month, an Adams County Republican is offering a reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the vandals responsible. You could find crowds celebrating the Biden-Harris announcement over the weekend on New York City streets. It was a different story here in the Tri-States, as some KHQA viewers describe the announcement as ""disastrous"" and a ""nightmare."" Matt Dietrich from the Illinois State Board of Elections said voter ballots continue to be counted in Illinois, and if you are unsatisfied with the election results, there is still time for changes. ""We know that we have at least 344,000 vote-by-mail ballots that are sitting there waiting to be counted,"" Dietrich said. ""We know that more are going to trickle in in the days to come, so we know that the results aren\'t final."" Dietrich said mail-in ballots in Illinois will continue to be counted until Nov. 17. Culver-Stockton College Political Science Professor Dr. Chad DeWaard said tensions continue to run high following the contentious race. ""President-Elect Joe Biden comes to office with a deeply divided country,"" DeWaard said. ""It is going to be a challenge for him to restore a sense of unity."" Final election results in Illinois will be officially announced on Dec. 4. RELATED: Vandalized billboard leads to reward offered by member of opposing political party'}]"

LGIS was an offshoot of Timpone’s organization created by Dan Proft, a well-known radio talk show host on Chicago’s AM560 The Answer, a right leaning station. A Federal Election Commission complaint was filed over Proft’s creation of the group for taking over production and distribution of newspapers and designing it in the format of looking like local, community papers – an alleged violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed in July last year. The Reporter has recently come under fire for releasing headlines saying “No White Residents of Greene County had COVID-19 tests return positive” on July 21st and again on August 4th. According to the Tow Study, it’s a case of the algorithm generating articles and conservative talking points. The group behind the sites has set up more than 189 new websites within the last year. The New York Times article alleges that the stories are directed by political groups and corporate P.R. firms to promote a Republican candidate or a company, or to smear their rivals. The Times has allegedly uncovered details about the operation through interviews with more than 30 current and former employees and clients, as well as thousands of internal emails between reporters and editors spanning several years. Employees of the network shared emails and the editing history in the site’s publishing software that revealed who requested dozens of articles and how. WLDS has sent emails to the West Central Reporter for comment within the last two months and has not received any answer. The Times also alleges that some of the stories are being paid for by community groups. John Tillman, an activist who once led the Illinois Opportunity Project and whose other groups have paid Timpone’s companies hundreds of thousands of dollars, said in an email to the Times that some of the payments to Timpone were to underwrite his news operation. According to state and federal political finance records, former Republican gubernatorial candidate and current U.S. House candidate Jeanne Ives has had a direct financial relationship with the operation. Ives has paid approximately $55,000 to Timpone’s companies over the last 3 years. The sites have allegedly published several stories on Ives, including running press releases from her campaigns verbatim. Ives, in an interview with the New York Times, says she has never paid for positive coverage of her work and that the payments were made to create her website and monitor her Wikipedia page for negative entries. Currently, the West Central Reporter is running multiple stories on the effect the Graduated Income Tax Amendment would have on retiree households in counties across the listening area.'}]"

After days of resistance, President Donald Trump said Saturday that he was tested for the coronavirus and is awaiting his results as the White House stepped up precautions around him following his repeated direct and indirect exposures to COVID-19. Trump also told reporters at a White House briefing that he had his temperature taken and it was “totally normal” before stepping into the room to discuss the government’s efforts to halt the spread of the virus. The pandemic has now infected more than 2,200 people in the U.S. and caused at least 50 deaths. Trump had held out on testing for days — concerned that it would make him appear weak — despite his interactions with at least three people who have since tested positive for COVID-19. Trump had said Friday that he would “most likely” submit to testing “fairly soon,” but the White House doctor said in a memo released shortly before midnight that no test was called for, despite the contact, because he wasn’t exhibiting symptoms like a fever or cough. The president said he’d gone ahead with it anyway after repeated questions from reporters at a news conference Friday and would have the results in “a day or two days, whatever it is.” Vice President Mike Pence, speaking at the same briefing, said he and his wife, Karen Pence, would also “be more than happy to be tested,” despite the doctors’ guidance, and would be contacting White House medical staff to arrange it. Multiple lawmakers and countless citizens across the country who have had the same degree of exposure have not only tried to get tested, but also chosen to quarantine themselves as a precaution and to avoid potentially infecting others. The president, according to two people close to the White House, had been reluctant to take the test for fear it would project weakness or worry. Trump has wanted to appear in full control during the crisis, and had expressed concerns that taking personal steps could undermine that appearance. But as the White House grapples with repeated exposures by Trump and multiple senior aides, it has tightened precautions. On Saturday, the White House announced that it is now conducting temperature checks on anyone who is in close contact with Trump and Pence, including reporters who attended the Saturday White House briefing and anyone entering the Oval Office. Additional precautions are expected to be rolled out over the weekend. To that end, a representative from the White House physician’s office took the temperature of members of the media at the briefing, going around and putting the device to their heads. One reporter with a suspected elevated temperature was not allowed in. Pence also wrote a memo to White House staff Saturday reminding them to take precautions such as avoiding physical contact, washing hands frequently and staying home when sick to help the administration keep the virus at bay. “It’s imperative each one of us do our part to take the proper precautions to keep ourselves and our colleagues safe,” Pence wrote. “As an employee aboard the White House Complex, we have an additional duty to protect the health of our Executive Branch and those working with us.” Trump, 73, is considered to be at higher risk of complications from the disease because of his age. He has long tried to minimize the threat posed by the virus and continued to engage in behaviors that health officials are warning the public against. On Friday, Trump shook the hands of multiple officials at his Rose Garden news conference and he has continued to appear at large gatherings despite tweeting Saturday morning that Americans should be practicing “SOCIAL DISTANCING!” “It almost becomes a habit,” Trump said when asked why he continues to shake hands contrary to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. “People come up to me, they shake hands, they put their hand out, it’s sort of a natural reflex.,” he said. “We’re all getting out of it. All of us have that problem.” He added: “Shaking hands is not a great thing to be doing right now, I agree.” Trump has now had multiple direct and indirect contacts with people who have since tested positive for the virus, including three people he spent time with last weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. The Brazilian Embassy in Washington said late Friday that the country’s chargé d’affaires, Nestor Forster, tested positive after sitting at Trump’s dinner table. So, too, have a top aide to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who took a photo with Trump and attended a party with him, and another person who attended a campaign fundraiser with the president that Sunday, according to two Republican officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss private health matters. Republican chairwoman Ronna McDaniel is awaiting her own test results after experiencing a fever and flu-like symptoms. She and her family are quarantining at home, the RNC said Saturday. Several top administration officials, including Attorney General William Barr and Trump’s daughter and senior adviser, Ivanka Trump, also met last week with an Australian Cabinet minister who on Friday was confirmed positive. A handful of other White House staffers have been tested for the virus after exhibiting flu-like symptoms, but have all tested negative, according to a senior White House official. Flu activity in the country is currently high. The White House has been saying, citing CDC guidelines, that the president and other White House officials don’t need to be tested or isolate themselves unless they are exhibiting symptoms, even though that advice is contradicted by many health professionals who note that the virus can be spread even by people who are asymptomatic. The reporter who was not allowed into the White House briefing Saturday had a temperature above the 100.4-degree guidelines in three checks over 15 minutes, tweeted Pence’s spokeswoman, Katie Miller, citing the White House Medical Unit. Public health officials say that people with a cough and elevated temperatures of 100.4 degrees or higher are deemed concerning.
