highlighted housing and growth as key priorities in his annual State of the City address. Mia Cortés Castro & Ariela Lopez 1:57 am, Feb 06, 2024 Staff Reporters Staff Reporters Nydia del Carmen, YTV Editor Nydia del Carmen, YTV Editor Around 200 alders, city officials, attendees and pro-ceasefire protesters gathered at City Hall on Monday evening to receive Mayor Justin Elicker’s annual State of the City Address. Elicker’s now fifth-annual address aimed at highlighting the city’s accomplishments in the past year, as well as tracing future plans. The speech highlighted elements of the city’s Vision 2034 plan, which will determine the city’s next steps during the next 10 years, preparing for New Haven’s 250th anniversary. Elicker also emphasized visions for how the city can ensure that its growing population of 139,000 can thrive. “With such a milestone, it’s a time for us to reflect on both where we stand as a city today and where we want to go in the future — the values we hold, the challenges we face, the progress we’ve made and the continued work that’s required to uplift more of our residents so they have the opportunity to thrive,” Elicker said in his address. Housing takes center stage Elicker’s address emphasized, among many broad topics, on the city’s affordable housing initiatives. Elicker cited 1,900 new housing units built since 2020, when he was first inaugurated, 900 of which were affordable units. He mentioned 3,500 additional units in planning right now, 40 percent of which will be affordable. “Every resident in our city deserves to live somewhere safe, clean and affordable,” Elicker said in the address. Many of these units were funded by American Rescue Plan Act funds — federal funds intended for use in economic and community recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Projects like the city’s first non-congregant shelter, the redevelopment of a twelve-acre housing site on Church Street and projects like Elm City Communities were listed, among others. With 70 percent of New Haven residents being renters, the mayor emphasized not only the need for more affordable and deeply-affordable housing, but also the need for more flexible housing options and more market-rate housing to keep supply high and housing costs down. Among these, Accessory Dwelling Units, which allows homeowners at select properties around the city to add an additional residential unit to their property, including alternative housing options such as tiny homes. He also mentioned the rise in landlord and tenant issues in New Haven, with three new legally recognized tenants unions, and the city’s commitment to bringing justice to residents. Elicker commended the Liveable Cities Initiative and the Fair Rent Commission, whose housing inspection cases have quadrupled in recent years, for their work in protecting residents. NHPS applauded for education initiatives Elicker applauded New Haven Public Schools superintendent Madeline Negrón, who began working for NHPS in July, for “hitting the ground running” on improving student attendance, school culture and literacy levels. He specifically stressed the city’s improving chronic absenteeism levels, which peaked at 60 percent among NHPS students during the pandemic. Chronic absenteeism — when a student misses 10 percent or more of school days — is currently at 33 percent citywide, the mayor noted. “My cell phone voicemail box is full and has run out of memory several times from all the reminder calls I and my fellow parents get from Dr. Negrón, Danny Diaz and New Haven Public Schools staff to make sure my daughters are in school,” Elicker quipped. Elicker highlighted new career exploration initiatives that NHPS is undertaking with partners such as Gateway Community College, Southern Connecticut State University and other nonprofit and private sector organizations. Although several such initiatives involve Yale, Elicker did not mention the University during his speech. The mayor also shouted out the schools’ new literacy curriculum, which was implemented this year, and the New Haven Tutoring Initiative. Reducing gun violence and enhancing crisis response After discussing education, Elicker’s focus moved swiftly to public safety. With violent crime down 5.8 percent since last year, Elicker attributed improvements to new additions to public safety infrastructure, violence prevention programs and strategic community policing approaches. “Our streets are not only safer, but we’re actually connecting individuals who are at the greatest risk of committing or being a victim of an act of gun violence with the support they need to stay safe, alive, out of jail and successfully reintegrate into the community,” Elicker said in his speech. One of the initiatives Elicker listed was P.R.E.S.S. — Program for Reintegration, Engagement, Safety, and Support — which aims to provide supportive case management for individuals returning from incarceration with a current or prior conviction of a firearm-related offense, as well as for gang or group members who are identified to be at higher risk of involvement with firearms. Elicker also mentioned Elm City COMPASS, a collaborative crisis-response team, which has just celebrated its first anniversary. Elicker committed to expanding and continuing the development of both programs. Sustainability takes a backseat as Mayor recovers from interruption As the mayor began to describe the city’s growing commitment to parks, green spaces and the climate, he was interrupted by a protester from the crowd that lined the chamber. The protesters began to sing and chant in support of the Gaza ceasefire resolution proposed to the Board of Alders. The interruption continued for 20 minutes, until New Haven Police Chief Karl Jacobson threatened to clear out “anyone who is interrupting city business.” When the Mayor continued his speech, he jumped to his conclusion, skipping over a prepared section describing ongoing sustainability initiatives. In the section, which is included in the copy of the mayor’s comments provided at the meeting, Elicker highlights the city’s Long Wharf Responsible Growth Plan, an initiative with nearly $200 million in funding to begin construction on the 18-acre Long Wharf Park and Waterfront. “A decade from now, in 2034, the Long Wharf and Gateway districts will in many ways be unrecognizable from what it looks like today,” Elicker wrote. The mayor also promised to develop an Urban Forest Management Plan, double the amount of trees planted in the next five years and “accelerate” the city’s transition to electric vehicles and solar power sources. After a 20-minute interruption by protesters, Elicker concluded that the state of the city is “strong.” Ward 27 Alder Richard Furlow told the News that he found Elicker’s speech to be “well-phrased.” “In these meetings, the business of our city takes precedence for us and our residents,” Furlow said.

2024 | 22:21 It was only ten years ago that concerns about uncontrolled migration dominated the thinking of the British electorate. A 2015 YouGov poll found that 71 percent of Britons were concerned about their country's migration and asylum policies at the time. “Migration concerns dominated the Brexit vote [Abstimmung über den Austritt des Vereinigten Königreichs aus der Europäischen Union, Anm. d. Red.]”, reported in 2018 “Washington Post”. The seemingly uncontrollable influence of foreign workers in the country's low-wage sector left many voters feeling disempowered, which reflected a kind of reflexive isolation politically. The results of a recent Yougov poll seem to paint a completely different picture: only 39 percent of those surveyed are still concerned about the migration issue. A survey conducted by the Center for Comparative Social Studies at City University London found that 59 percent of British respondents said migration was beneficial to the British economy. 58 per cent said immigrants had culturally enriched British life. Where does this change come from? Also, will something similar happen soon in the Federal Republic? Would such a thing even be desirable? Political scientists around the world are currently answering these and similar questions with varying and complex interpretations. Renowned political scientist Robert Ford From the University of Manchester, for example, believes that the radical test of Brexit has irrefutably shown the British that migration has never been the sole or main problem of the British economy. Advertising “[Wir] Knowledge [nun]It is [uns] “If the government stopped the refugee boats there would be no food on the table,” says Ford “the world”. But it was Brexit that brought this clarity to the majority. But in practice, Ford says, the problem has also changed as a result of Brexit. With Brexit, the Conservative government has shifted decision-making power over British asylum and migration policy from Brussels to London. This act restored many voters' faith in their own country. With the help of this regained decision-making power, the Conservatives have in recent years effectively adapted immigration to the needs of the British economy. The vast majority of immigrants coming to the country now are people whose professional skills are actually needed here and are therefore welcome. Fears that the “Polish plumber” will steal jobs from the Brits have caused delight in skilled, culturally enriching work colleagues. Ironically, the Conservative government is unlikely to benefit from its own policies in the next election, says Ford. People are already used to the new landscape. The young generation who have grown up in this landscape are not interested in migration policy. Economic growth, inflation, labor and health policy will determine the next election. At least these are the insights that Brexit brought to the world and to Germany, Die Welt reports: to allay people's concerns about immigration policy, the focus must first be on immigration to be more consciously and economically managed. Humanitarian aspects must be considered. “Communicator. Entrepreneur. Introvert. Passionate problem solver. Organizer. Social media ninja.” Your email address will not be published.

From the get-go, Topher J. Babb as the charismatic drag queen, Lola, captures your heart and takes your breath away. </span></p><p><span style=""background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The boots… the thigh-high glam-filled [kinky] boots… are a vibrant, colorful metaphor for life\'s bold and fearless journey.

Levine has assembled the largest cast to date, accompanied by eleven orchestra musicians who elevate the actors to new heights, surpassing even their stiletto heels! ""Theater serves as a dynamic place where individuals can unveil their deepest and authentic selves, shaping both self-expression and identity."" Levine proclaims, “This show is a great example of that!""</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The heart of the musical beats with Charlie Price, portrayed by Andrew Cekala, who finds himself at the helm of his father\'s failing shoe factory. In a twist of fate, Charlie crosses paths with Lola, brought to life by the uber-talented Topher J. Babb whose vibrant spirit and unwavering confidence infuse new life into both the factory and Charlie. The duo, in seemingly stark contrast, demonstrate that no matter your stride, the boots were made for walking and sometimes they feel more comfortable six inches off the ground.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The ""Angels"" in KINKY BOOTS are truly MAGNIFICENT elevating both Charlie and Lola to new heights.

In a twist of fate, Charlie crosses paths with Lola, brought to life by the uber-talented Topher J. Babb whose vibrant spirit and unwavering confidence infuse new life into both the factory and Charlie. The duo, in seemingly stark contrast, demonstrate that no matter your stride, the boots were made for walking and sometimes they feel more comfortable six inches off the ground.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"">The ""Angels"" in KINKY BOOTS are truly MAGNIFICENT elevating both Charlie and Lola to new heights.

For each of her paintings, Chamlin sets a highly specific palette; experimentation within this limited range then guides her decisions about process and pictorial space.</p><p><a href=""https://events.culturalalliancefc.org/events/we-will-rock-you-546be"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(17, 85, 204);""><strong>WE WILL ROCK YOU</strong></a></p><p><strong>Downtown Cabaret Theatre</strong></p><p>Friday May 31, 12:00 am - 12:00 am</p><p>Based on the music of Queen, We Will Rock You is set 300 years in the future.

provisions” in the bill, including “increased opportunities for family reunification and employment-based immigration, expanded access to work authorization for newcomers, and ensuring vulnerable children have assistance navigating their immigration proceedings.” Consistent with the bishops' objection to House efforts in December to make additional aid to Ukraine contingent on more restrictive border policies, Bishop Seitz said that “attempting to resolve complex migration-related challenges that have festered for decades in the time-sensitive context of an emergency funding bill is not

The letter, written by El Paso Bishop Mark Seitz, chairman of the U.S. bishops’ Committee on Migration and addressed to Senate majority and minority leaders Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell, stated that “while taking no position on the overall measure,” the bishops “believe this effort to make sweeping changes to immigration law — particularly in the context of this supplemental funding bill — is flawed, both in terms of substance and form.” “Rather than sustainably reducing migration to the U.S.-Mexico border, consistent with the common good and the good-faith intentions of many lawmakers,” Bishop Seitz said that “several changes proposed in this bill would unjustly undermine due process and pave the way for avoidable and potentially life-threatening harm to be inflicted on vulnerable persons seeking humanitarian protection in the United States.” “As shepherds committed to defending the sanctity of human life and upholding the God-given dignity of all, we implore you to reject those changes,” the letter said. What is the Senate’s Border Deal? The Senate’s bipartisan border deal, which was brokered by Sens. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma; Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut; and Kyrsten Sinema, I-Arizona, is part of a larger 370-page “Emergency National Security Supplemental Appropriations” bill. The bill proposes $118.2 billion for various national security priorities, including the war in Ukraine, Israel, and support for Taiwan as well as humanitarian support for Palestine. Also in the bill is $20.23 billion for various programs designed to address the festering migration crisis along the U.S. southwestern border. After months of secret negotiations, the details of the border deal were finally released Sunday evening. Since being made public, the bill has been lambasted by progressives for being too restrictive and by conservatives for being too lax. Despite the support of McConnell, an increasing number of Republican senators have expressed their disapproval of the deal, casting doubt on whether it will be able to pass the Senate. Nevertheless, the Senate is set to vote on the measure this week, with the first procedural vote set for Wednesday. Even if the legislation passes the Senate, it will still need to clear the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson has already pronounced it “dead on arrival.” Bishops Detail Concerns Bishop Seitz, a longtime advocate for migrants’ rights, said the bishops’ perspective on the bill is based on Catholic social teaching, which, he said, “recognizes a country’s right and responsibility to manage its borders in accordance with the common good.” “As we have constantly implored,” Bishop Seitz explained, “this need not and should not occur at the expense of our nation’s fundamental commitment to humanitarian protection.” “The legitimate interests of the state to regulate immigration and safeguard the well-being of the existing population should not be carried out in such a way that concern for the human lives of newcomers is set aside and vice versa,” he said. Specifically, Bishop Seitz expressed concerns with three sections of the bill that he said would “effectively mandate rushed proceedings for most people seeking protection, severely limiting due process and access to asylum,” “heighten the credible fear standard, making it even more difficult than it already is under current law for those with bona fide asylum claims to pursue relief in the United States,” and “would establish an expulsion authority akin to what was used under Title 42, inevitably producing the same opportunity for harmful, arbitrary, and counterproductive treatment of vulnerable persons.” Apart from those objections, Bishop Seitz voiced support for several “positive provisions” in the bill, including “increased opportunities for family reunification and employment-based immigration, expanded access to work authorization for newcomers, and ensuring vulnerable children have assistance navigating their immigration proceedings.” Consistent with the bishops’ objection to House efforts in December to make additional aid to Ukraine contingent on more restrictive border policies, Bishop Seitz said that “attempting to resolve complex migration-related challenges that have festered for decades in the time-sensitive context of an emergency funding bill is not conducive to prudent policymaking.” “We will always commend good-faith bipartisan cooperation to address the challenges confronting our nation, and we cannot achieve the necessary reform of our immigration system without authentic bipartisanship,” Bishop Seitz said. “Nevertheless, we respectfully urge you to reject provisions in the Senate’s version of H.R. 815 that further restrict access to asylum, curtail due process for noncitizens, and create authorities inconsistent with the United States’ obligations under international law.” Copies of Bishop Seitz’s letter were sent to all U.S. senators as well as House Speaker Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. The letter concluded by stating that the U.S. bishops “remain committed” to helping Congress find a “transparent, well-informed, bicameral, and truly bipartisan approach” to addressing the border crisis. Fort Worth, Tucson Bishops Also Raise Objections Bishop Seitz was not the only bishop to raise concerns about the Senate border deal. Bishop Michael Olson of Fort Worth, Texas, told CNA that the Senate’s border deal is “very much lacking” measures to combat the growing problem of human trafficking at the border. Bishop Olson has previously sounded the alarm that an underreported aspect of the border controversy is the rise of human trafficking and sexual exploitation by criminal elements. He has said that cartels and traffickers use Fort Worth as one of their hubs to traffic humans and drugs to different parts of the country. Those who live near the border “are in a tough situation,” Bishop Olson said. Though the Church is called to help all those in need, Bishop Olson warned that “naive” policies that encourage unrestricted immigration also encourage more trafficking and crime. The situation is made worse, Bishop Olson added, when the federal government is not “doing its part in maintaining a legitimate border.” “All of this is very diabolical and unless we really see this as a multinational problem and really hold those who are perpetrating this in both supply and demand accountable, it’s going to eat us alive,” he said. “As a people of prayer, who are rooted in justice and charity, we have to humbly recognize that this is a complicated issue that cannot be solved overnight and it cannot be solved without looking at the legitimate role and the legitimate function of a national border.” Bishop Olson noted that he is not “promoting a naive view that we have endless resources and that somehow everybody who’s coming to the border is either de facto our enemy or de facto our friends.” “The just rule of law is required to promote true justice and also true charity because there are realistic limits to human resources and unless we address this issue in a measured and ordered way, in light of these other issues as well, we’re not going to be able to take care of the poor and the vulnerable who are already here, and we see that happening in many of our larger cities.” Meanwhile, Bishop Edward Weisenburger of Tucson, Arizona, whose diocese includes 372 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, told CNA on Monday that he “cannot agree with or endorse provisions that could unjustly undermine due process for those seeking humanitarian protection.” “I echo the much-repeated refrain that our immigration system is broken, and I welcome all efforts at improvement. However, I am not without substantial concerns when studying the proposed bipartisan immigration legislation currently under review,” Bishop Weisenburger said, adding that some of the bill’s provisions would result in migrants “facing extreme violence or even death if forced to return to their home of origin.” “I likewise am deeply concerned,” Bishop Weisenburger went on, “that establishing almost impossible standards for those legitimately applying for asylum will have the unintended consequence of large numbers of those who are vulnerable or in grave crisis turning instead to smugglers, human traffickers, gangs, and other criminal elements.” Bishop Weisenburger said that diocesan ministries, such as Catholic Community Services and the Kino Border Initiative, “routinely see how anxious these criminals are to prey upon the weakest — oftentimes women and children.” “While many refer to the situation as a crisis at the border, those actually working with it every day and ministering to legally processed asylum seekers view the situation primarily as a humanitarian crisis with families, women, and children, and other individuals fleeing violence and impossibly difficult situations around the world — hoping and praying for safety and a better life,” he said. What Other Catholic Border Leaders are Saying Dylan Corbett, a Catholic leader and executive director of the Hope Border Institute, told CNA that he is opposed to the'}]"

We decided that we would save as many people as we could in the process,” said Neria Sharabi. Neria, 22, together with his brother Daniel, 23, arrived at the Supernova Music Festival near Kibbutz Re’im, just over 3 miles from Gaza, at 1:30 a.m. on Oct. 6. They sat outside and had a few drinks before entering the festival site a couple of hours later. “It was the biggest and most amazing rave I had ever attended in Israel,” Neria said of the event, which was attended by 3,500 partygoers. The pair joined a group of friends, danced and mingled all night, blissfully unaware of what was about to happen. “At 6:30 a.m., we started seeing rockets in the sky. Someone approached the DJ, who turned off the music and told us to disperse,” Neria recalled. Like most Israelis, both brothers had served in the army, Daniel as a combat medic. “We were in the process of packing up when I saw some of those who had left earlier come back with gunshot wounds. As a combat medic, I knew how to treat them. I immediately volunteered to help,” Daniel told JNS. He quickly realized that the situation was more serious than he’d thought. As Hamas terrorists approached the site of the rave, security forces tried to block them. Eventually, they got through—and began targeting the revelers with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. The Sharabi brothers fled toward the highway. “At first we were all running in the same direction, but eventually we lost sight of everyone else we knew. Neria and I managed to stay together amid the chaos. Two of our friends, Itay and Ben, were killed by the terrorists,” said Daniel. Another friend, Yosef-Haim Ohana, 23, was abducted and remains in Gaza over 80 days later. Fighting back “We ran on the road, jumped from car to car, carefully avoiding the shooting. Then, we saw a tank which had drifted to the side of the road,” said Daniel. Daniel and Neria entered the tank. They first tried to alert the army via the tank’s radio, but in vain. Eventually, Neria seized an M-16 rifle off a dead soldier, exited the tank and started shooting back at the terrorists together with another two soldiers onsite. “Quickly enough, people understood that we knew what we were doing. They came to take shelter behind the tank, which was the safest place near the site, while we fought back. I assisted those who needed first aid,” said Daniel. Throughout the assault, Daniel was on the phone with his reserve commander, Yoni Skrisewsky, who helped the group organize their defense remotely. While giving instructions to the Sharabi brothers over the phone, Skrisewsky departed from Tel Aviv to join the fight with another three reservists. On the way, Skrisewsky encountered more terrorists, and was only able to reach the site of the party five hours later. “I was fighting from the left and the two soldiers who joined us were on the right. One had a machine gun, I had the M-16. We fought more than 100 terrorists as they tried to kill us,” said Neria. “We were outnumbered and did not have enough ammunition to fight for hours. We made sure to shoot two bullets every 16 seconds. We used military tactics to stay alive for as long as we could,” he added. While under fire, Daniel set tourniquets to prevent the wounded from bleeding to death. Five hours later, the army arrived, and took another hour before the road was clear enough to evacuate the wounded. ’We were civilians fighting terrorists’ Some 364 people were murdered at the Supernova Music Festival event —nearly one-third of the 1,200 people killed by Hamas terrorists during their mass invasion of the northwestern Negev that Saturday morning. Many were wounded, and at least 40 were taken back to Gaza as hostages. There were widespread reports of rape and sexual abuse, including gang rape. The Sharabi brothers explained that their clarity of mind and quickness to take action came from witnessing the suffering of the wounded. “We saw this girl with a hole in her leg. We instantly switched back into army mode. We blocked our emotions and used our minds rather than our hearts,” said Neria. The Sharabi brothers saved dozens of revelers that fateful day. “We had never fought a war. But even if we had, this was something different. We were not in uniform and this was not a combat zone. We were civilians fighting terrorists,” said Neria. In response to the Oct. 7 massacre, Israel declared war on Hamas in Gaza. The Sharabi brothers were mobilized, but soon after the pair was sent back home to recover from the trauma. “We came with emotions. It wasn’t the place. Our commanders were worried about us and sent us back,” said Neria. ’Our story blew up’ In early November, the brothers flew to the United States to speak about their experience. “Our story blew up. We started fundraising for the survivors and the wounded of Oct. 7. Our objective is to make sure that everyone who survived the rave gets the treatment they need to build a life,” Daniel said. Last month, Israel’s Justice Ministry told lawmakers at the Knesset in Jerusalem that “quite a few” of the survivors were forcibly hospitalized in mental-health institutions due to their harrowing experiences. The day after, Neria said, was especially difficult for those revelers who were on drugs during the massacre and did not immediately internalize the trauma. “I’m worried about the aftershock. I don’t want to see anyone I know on the news or get calls from friends saying that after all we’ve been through, they’ve committed suicide,” said Neria. “This can be avoided if they get early treatment. We feel a commitment to them. This is now our duty,” he added. ’The world is quick to forget’ The Sharabi brothers have so far raised around $15,000 for their community. Earlier in December, the organizers of the Supernova Music Festival launched an exhibit at the Tel Aviv Expo recreating scenes of the assault of which the proceeds will go towards helping survivors of the attacks recover. “We want to commemorate all the people that were killed on that day including security forces, police officers and medics. They sacrificed their lives for us. The world is quick to forget. We, the living, have to continue telling their stories,” said Neria PHOTO: We the living CAP: Daniel Sharabi (wearing helmet) and other Israelis regroup and treat the wounded after fleeing Hamas’s attack on the Supernova Music Festival at Kibbutz Re’im on Oct. 7.
