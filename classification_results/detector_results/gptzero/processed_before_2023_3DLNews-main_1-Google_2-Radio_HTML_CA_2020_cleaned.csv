This archival content was originally written for and published on KPCC.org. Keep in mind that links and images may no longer work — and references may be outdated. Glendale is one of around a hundred cities in California that was historically known as a “sundown town,” with formal or informal laws barring Black Americans from the city after sunset. To address its history of racist exclusion, which has wide repercussions today, Glendale’s City Council released a resolution last month apologizing for its racism. While Glendale did not find any formal sundown laws in its review, the city did find evidence in other forms, including records of police escorting Black people and other people of color outside the city limits. While Glendale is the first city to draft a resolution of this kind, it is far from the only California city with a history of racist sundown practices. Arcadia, Bel Air, South Pasadena, Whittier and Cerritos are just a handful of the many sundown towns designated in California. Today on AirTalk, we’re discussing Glendale’s resolution as well as the legacy of sundown towns in California. We want to hear about your experiences. Comment below or give us a call at 866-893-5722.

His reports are heard regularly on NPR\'s award-winning newsmagazines Morning Edition, All Things Considered, and Weekend Edition. He joined NPR in 1996 and was based in San Francisco before moving to Boston in 2001. Most recently, Arnold has been reporting on the financial struggle millions of Americans are facing amidst the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. As part of that, he\'s done investigative stories showing how mortgage companies have been misleading homeowners who\'ve lost their jobs, demanding outrageous balloon payments if they skip mortgage payments and scaring them away from help that Congress wanted them to have under the CARES Act. Arnold\'s reporting often focuses on consumer protection issues. His series of stories ""The Trouble with TEACH Grants,"" that he reported with NPR\'s Cory Turner, exposed a debacle at the U.S. Department of Education through which public school teachers had grants unfairly converted into large student loan debts — some upwards of $20,000. As a result of the stories, members of Congress demanded reforms and the Education Department overhauled the program and is now giving thousands of teachers their grant money back and erasing their debts. Arnold was honored with a 2017 George Foster Peabody Award for his coverage of the Wells Fargo banking scandal. His stories sparked a Senate inquiry into the bank\'s treatment of employees who tried to blow the whistle on the wrongdoing. Arnold also won the National Association of Consumer Advocates Award for Investigative Journalism for a series of stories he reported with ProPublica that exposed improper debt collection practices by non-profit hospitals who were suing thousands of their low-income patients. In addition to reporting for NPR\'s main radio programs, Arnold has been hosting the personal finance episodes of NPR\'sLife Kit podcasts, which offer listeners actionable tips backed up by behavioral economics research on the best ways to save money, invest for the future and a range of other topics. Arnold previously served as the lead reporter for the NPR series ""Your Money and Your Life"", which explored personal finance issues. As part of that, he reported on the problem of Wall Street firms charging excessive fees in retirement accounts — fees that siphon billions of dollars annually from Americans trying to save for the future. For this series, Arnold won the 2016 Gerald Loeb Award, which honors work that informs and protects the private investor and the general public. Following the 2008 financial crisis and collapse of the housing market, Arnold reported on problems within the nation\'s largest banks that led to the banks improperly foreclosing on thousands of American homeowners. For this work, Arnold earned a 2011 Edward R. Murrow Award for the special series, ""The Foreclosure Nightmare."" He\'s also been honored with the Newspaper Guild\'s 2009 Heywood Broun Award for broadcast journalism. He was also a finalist for the Scripps Howard Foundation\'s National Journalism Award. Arnold was chosen for a Nieman Journalism Fellowship at Harvard University during the 2012-2013 academic year. He joined a small group of other journalists from the U.S. and abroad and studied economics, leadership, and the future of journalism in the digital age. Arnold also teaches Radio Journalism as a Lecturer at Yale University and was named a Poynter Fellow by Yale in 2016. Over his career at NPR, Arnold has covered a range of other subjects — from Katrina recovery in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, to immigrant workers in the fishing industry, to a new kind of table saw that won\'t cut your fingers off. He traveled to Turin, Italy, for NPR\'s coverage of the 2006 Winter Olympics. He has also followed the dramatic rise in the numbers of teenagers abusing the powerful and highly addictive painkiller Oxycontin. In the days and months following the Sept. 11 attacks, Arnold reported from New York and contributed to the NPR coverage that won the Overseas Press Club and the George Foster Peabody Awards. He chronicled the recovery effort at Ground Zero, focusing on members of the Port Authority Police department as they struggled with the deaths of 37 officers — the greatest loss of any police department in U.S. history. Prior to his move to Boston, Arnold traveled the country for NPR doing feature stories on entrepreneurship. His pieces covered technologists, farmers, and family business owners. He also reported on efforts to kindle entrepreneurship in economically disadvantaged areas ranging from inner-city Los Angeles to the Pine Ridge Indian reservation in South Dakota. Arnold has worked in public radio since 1993. Before joining NPR, he was a freelance reporter working out of San Francisco\'s NPR Member Station, KQED.'}]"

It’s the world’s first dual-sided, center-hung video board, which marks another evolution in scoreboard development and how fans consume information during games. The video board at AT&T Stadium, fittingly nicknamed ”JerryTron” after Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, tried to bring an arena experience at a much larger scale to a stadium. The ”Haloboard” at Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium was the first 360-degree board at a stadium when it opened in 2017. Three years later, this board has upped the ante. SoFi Stadium hosts its first game Sunday when the Rams welcome the Dallas Cowboys. ”Everyone was interested in taking it to the next level. It is connected to the architecture and allows us to create this canvas for digital immersion,” said Lance Evans, the stadium’s main architect from design firm HKS. ”The way that the video board interacts as you walk around the venue is the beautiful piece of the design. You always feel like you are connected to it but it doesn’t scream for your attention. The way that we’ve created the elliptical shape with the aperture that allows light to flow through – it is a complementary shape and form.” SoFi Stadium’s video board is the largest ever created, with 70,000 square feet of digital LED space. It is also the first and only board that is capable of 4k video from end to end. It weighs 2.2. million pounds, it took nearly six months to construct and raise. Samsung manufactured the video display, making this the fourth NFL stadium where it has video boards. Mark Quiroz, Samsung’s Vice President for Product Marketing, said one of the biggest challenges was trying to make sure the construction could take place while everything else was going on around the complex. In the three months since the board was lifted, it has been tested to make sure the display was consistent throughout all seating levels. ”We want that screen to look as perfect as it can be along with there being a perfect balance,” he said. When it comes to what can go on the board, there really aren’t any limits. The size of the board allows for multiple feeds where fantasy stats can be showed along with instant replays, live action or multiple events. There also can be the possibility of showing other games. While fans aren’t allowed into Rams or Chargers games for the foreseeable future because of the coronavirus pandemic, both teams will be able to put the board through many different tests to come up with the best presentation format. But there is one group who will be able to see it this season – the players. ”The video board is dope, just the way it circles the whole field. It’s going to be exciting and hard not to watch,” Chargers receiver Keenan Allen said.
