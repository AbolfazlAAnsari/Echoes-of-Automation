Nikki Haley defended her position on social media during the fourth GOP debate after her GOP rivals said Haley’s proposal would be a “massive expansion of government.” “What I said was social media companies need to show us their algorithms. I also said there are millions of bots on social media right now. They are foreign, they are Chinese, they are Iranian,” Haley said.

She has also previously backed a ban on TikTok, saying teenagers “will understand” the need for a ban on the platform. She added, “I will always fight for freedom of speech for Americans. We do not need freedom of speech for Russians and Iranians and Hamas. We need social media companies to go and fight back on all of these bots.” Haley drew backlash over her proposed TikTok ban, saying the platform was “trying to influence young voters.” She also emphasized that people need to know about the “dangers of TikTok,” including foreign bots that she says can spread misinformation. During the debate, Haley sparred with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, who claimed Haley’s previous position was much harsher. “As a mom, do I think that social media would be more civil if we went and had people’s names next to that? Yes, I do think that because I think we’ve got too much cyberbullying. I think we’ve got child pornography and all of those things.

DeSantis claimed that this is false, saying, “She said one of the first things I’m going to do, all social media, I want your name.

Dombrowski has been broadcasting polka programs since 1979 on both radio and television. The Polka is a Central European dance and genre of music that became familiar throughout Europe, originating in 19th century Bohemia. The name means “Polish Lady.” The music was introduced to America in 1844, and enjoyed a resurgence in popularity after World War II when Polish refugees moved to the Americas. Many Polish people settled in Buffalo, and the surrounding communities. Western New York holds a top 5 ranking for Polish Americans in the United States. However, Polka music is enjoyed by people of all ages and ethnicities. “Polka Buzz” will celebrate this genre of music as a recorded dance party program, featuring the top Polka Bands in the country. Program tapings from Pott’s Banquet Hall in Cheektowaga are currently on hiatus. Polka music stirs the spirit in a positive way. It brings people together to dance, and share a rich cultural experience. I am proud to help bring people together with this exciting show!

(WIVB) — As people across Western New York get ready to ring in the New Year, New York State Police are urging people not to get behind the wheel impaired. “Don’t put other people and other families at risk on the roadway. The last thing we need is another tragedy here in WNY and it’s something that could be completely avoided just by a good decision,” said New York state trooper James O’Callaghan. Trooper O’Callaghan said every December state police pull over and arrest hundreds of people who are driving impaired. “It’s very dangerous for people to get behind the wheel impaired at all. When we’re talking about alcohol .08 is very low, it’s only one or two drinks a lot of people might feel fine, but by law, they’re impaired,” O’Callaghan said. Between the Buffalo Bills home game and New Year’s Eve celebrations, there are going to be a lot of people on the roads. “Buffalo is very unique, very different area than the rest of the state. We have the Bills game, we have the ball drop downtown, which is a very popular event then we have every little party,” O’Callaghan said. “We have to prioritize in categories. How safe are the roads? We’re going to be pushing extra patrols out there.” State police are setting up checkpoints across the region to ensure people are following the law. “We’re coming out of Christmas, we’re joining into the New Year and New York state police will be joined by other local law enforcement agencies, looking for intoxicated or impaired drivers,” O’Callaghan said. “That’s a big issue and we want to keep the roads as safe as possible.” If you plan on drinking, or doing anything else that could impair your driving, O’Callaghan is urging people to seek other ways home besides getting behind the wheel. “There’s so many other options. Whether it be ride sharing, designated driver, or maybe you live close to wherever you’re coming from but if alcohol and marijuana are part of your festivities tonight do not drive or get behind the wheel,” O’Callaghan said.

Former N.Y. state senator David Carlucci and GOP strategist Joe Pinion discuss the state of the U.S. economy and President Biden’s approval ratings among minority voters. By a 32-point margin, more voters feel they have been hurt rather than helped by President Biden’s economic policies. In addition, since the beginning of his term, negative views of the economy and dissatisfaction with the way things are going in the country have increased substantially, according to the latest Fox News national survey. Views among Democrats contribute to those declining sentiments. The survey finds 68% of voters feel unhappy with how things are going in the country, up from 53% since early in Biden’s term. Much of that 15-point rise in dissatisfaction comes from a 27-point increase among Democrats – climbing to 47%, up from 20% in 2021. AMERICANS DESCRIBE STRUGGLES TO AFFORD FOOD WHILE BIDEN TOUTS STRONG ECONOMY: ‘I AM HONESTLY SCARED’ Polling shows the majority of voters are dissatisfied with how things are going in the U.S. (Fox News) Plus, large numbers of Republicans (93%), independents (85%), and Democrats (61%) rate the economy negatively. Compared to when Biden took office, those marks have worsened by 6 points among independents, 8 among Democrats, and 11 among Republicans. Overall, 78% of voters say the economy is in bad shape, worse by 9 points since Biden took office (69%). The majority of Republicans, Democrats, and independent voters say the economy is in a bad state. (Fox News) On the personal level, 64% say their financial situation is only fair or poor. That’s worse by 6 points compared to the 58% who felt that way at the end of 2022 and 2021. Nearly half of voters (46%) say the administration’s policies have hurt them personally – that’s more than three times as many as say they were helped (14%). Another 39% think the policies haven’t made much difference either way. The number saying they’ve been hurt by Biden’s policies is up 8 points compared to 2021. Fox News Polling reveals how registered voters feel about the economic conditions across the nation and personally. (Fox News) To top it off, voters don’t see the economy getting better – instead, they are twice as likely to see the economy getting worse next year (44% worse vs. 22% better).

PBS will offer free viewing access from Sunday, November 12, through Saturday, November 18, on PBS.org, the PBS App and on PBS stations (check local listings). The short film, which features the Beatles, Sean Lennon and Peter Jackson, will then be available for PBS station members to stream on PBS Passport from Sunday, November 19, until Monday, December 11, 2023. This historic track is the product of decades of conversations and collaborations between the members of the band. In 1994, Yoko Ono, Lennon’s wife, mentioned to George Harrison that she had a tape of her husband recording some original songs. In February 1995, Paul, George and Ringo worked on the Lennon demo as part of The Beatles Anthology and were successful in putting together the songs “Free As a Bird” and “Real Love,” released in the mid-1990s. But “Now and Then” proved to be an insurmountable technical challenge, as John’s vocal was partially obscured by his piano accompaniment. The song lay dormant for decades. But in 2022, there was a stroke of technical serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team for the documentary series Get Back finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John’s vocal from his piano part. As a result, the original recording could be brought to life, and the newly cleared vocal enabled McCartney and Starr to complete the track last year. The final recording includes John’s original vocal, McCartney’s bass and a slide guitar solo he added as a tribute to George Harrison, drums by Starr, and a guitar part Harrison had recorded nearly three decades ago. This remarkable story of musical archaeology reflects The Beatles’ endless creative curiosity and shared fascination with technology. It marks the completion of the last recording that John, Paul, George and Ringo will get to make together and celebrates the legacy of the foremost and most influential band in popular music history. ##### About PBS PBS, with more than 330 member stations, offers all Americans the opportunity to explore new ideas and new worlds through television and digital content.
