Tens of thousands of Venezuelan migrants have arrived in Denver over the past year, escaping violence and instability and looking for economic opportunities. Some are settling in rural communities like the Roaring Fork Valley, where over a hundred migrants have arrived in recent months. A few of those newcomers have elected to represent the group when meeting with community stakeholders, including Libia. She recently spoke with reporters Halle Zander and Eleanor Bennett about fleeing Venezuela, walking to the U.S., and caring for her newfound family. This is the second story in a series of three audio postcards and includes a story of kidnapping and murder, which may not be suitable for all listeners. Libia spoke in Spanish through interpreters with Convey Language Solutions. Her story below was edited for clarity and length and then re-recorded in English by Claudia Pawl. The audio postcard was produced by Halle Zander. Libia: In Venezuela, I belonged to the military forces. When you do the military service, they teach you to protect the people, not to harm the people, so I refused to do certain things. They wanted me to shoot people, to kill human beings. “No,” I said. “That is not accepted by God. God can forgive a lot but not taking another life.” So I refused. I escaped. The Tren de Aragua organization came to get me, and my sister hid me in a farm while she was selling the house and all that. I ran to Colombia, then to Peru. And when I got to Peru, that organization arrived in Peru. So I called my nephew, who was in Chile, and I asked him to come with me and see what we could do. So I saw on YouTube that people were crossing the jungle, Darién jungle, to come to the U.S. So I walked with my nephew, and we got to the border with Peru and Ecuador. When I arrived, there were some men that knew me, so I crossed to Ecuador [and] Colombia. I stayed five days in the jungle and after crossing the jungle with my nephew, his wife, and another guy, the Panamanian militarists took us in trucks, in different trucks, and separated us. I didn\'t see my nephew anymore, and I walked 21 kilometers to a church. When I got to the church, my brother sent me $40, and I continued with the little I was able to save. I got to Guatemala. I was there [for] about three months trying to get some money because Guatemala is the last place where you can get help before getting to Mexico, because Mexico is very difficult. So I went in a caravan of 5,000 to 6,000 people walking to cross Mexico. You have to go in a group because otherwise, immigration will send you back, and starting all over again is hard. So I walked and walked, and we got to a place that is called ""el basurero,"" the dump, where you can take the train, “the beast.” So I got onto “the beast,” and I was there for six days. I wished I was dead. It was like torture; I had no food. People would throw food, but I was never lucky enough to get anything. We got to the capital city of Juárez. I met my nephew in Juárez, and I was so happy. So when we got on the bus and other people arrived with guns, they stopped the bus, and suddenly we were kidnapped. So they took the phones so they could call our families, asking us to ask them to send the money. And if they could not send the money, we had to say goodbye. I saw them kill a boy. They did it so we would see it was true, and I felt that it was going to be my death because I had no money. So I looked at the kidnapper in the eyes, prayed to God, and I lied to him, and I told him, “I\'m pregnant. Please don\'t kill me.” I don\'t know where that idea came from, but it worked. And he asked me, “How far are you in the pregnancy?” And I said, “Four months.” So a man, their boss, I don’t know, came and told them to let us go. I was in Texas, in El Paso. The ticket from Texas to Denver was $95. We came to Denver. When we got here, I met my girlfriend that has helped me a lot. She\'s from Honduras, and she\'s the one that has supported me and helped me. And she loaned me her car and covers so I could sleep in her car. She helped me with food, and thanks to her and her kids, that has made me feel like living. And I want to help them. They are the kids that God gave me, and every day they make me want to live and continue to fight. I came here because in Denver I went to an emergency shelter, but it wasn\'t my environment. There were many sick people with drugs, and I felt unsafe. I would like to stay here — here in Aspen, because it\'s quiet. It\'s safe, and if there is a job, I\'m fine. That\'s what I really want to do. I want to get a job so I can help them and start to help my family in Venezuela. Once I can work, my dream is to be a lawyer and defend people who have no money. Because in my country, there\'s a lot of injustice. That\'s what I always wanted to do since I was a kid. I miss my nephews who are there, but I want to work and help them. Everything is expensive. We make $15 a week, and that\'s not enough. For example, my nephews live in a little shack, so I want to work so I can help them with a house, help them to study, to be somebody in life. I\'m not fully legal yet, but I hope I will be. Now we\'re all together with the kids. They call me “mom.” If you open the door, they will run and call me “mom,” and that fills me with joy and motivation. We are all little angels. My partner is an angel. I\'m an angel. And the little kids are angels, too. And we\'re going to support each other. Editor\'s note: An earlier version of this story included Libia\'s last name. We have removed it upon legal advice that it may put her immigration status at risk.'}]"

Maybe too cheap. Municipal water departments in the Colorado River basin are entering a time of change. Their infrastructure is aging and needs replacement, and they’re starting to invest in new systems that will help cities adapt to a future with a smaller water supply. But, that means big spending and costs that will get passed along to the millions of people who use that water in sinks, showers and sprinklers. “There's literally nothing else you can have 1,000 gallons of delivered to your house at two in the morning for a few bucks,” said Mark Marlowe, water director in Castle Rock, Colorado. Marlowe and other water experts across the arid West agree, the amount you pay for tap water should probably go up, and likely will over the next few decades — in large part due to aging infrastructure. “Our utilities are, at this point, middle aged,” said Kathryn Sorensen, former director of the water department in Phoenix. Major cities in the arid West – Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, and others – saw significant population booms on the heels of World War II. Pipes and other water delivery systems were rolled out quickly, and are starting to reach the end of their lives. “All of this is very expensive infrastructure,” said Sorensen, who now researches water policy at Arizona State University. “It's concrete, it's iron, it's steel, and it needs to be replaced. And the cost of all those materials, the cost of labor, the cost of construction, have all gone up.” Those costs are likely to be spread out across water ratepayers, Sorensen said. Even though rate hikes can be politically unpopular, failure to pay for necessary upgrades to water systems could lead to pipes crumbling even further. On a cool fall morning in Denver, hulking construction trucks are sending dust up into the early beams of sunlight. An excavator is ripping up the road, and a group of yellow-vested workers is down in the trench it leaves behind, laying bright blue PVC pipe. Here, in a quiet residential neighborhood, infrastructure upgrades are happening in real time. The 77-year-old water main getting replaced is a small part of a massive series of repairs planned by Denver’s water department. The agency expects to spend about $1.9 billion over the next decade in upgrades, replacements and maintenance. Denver Water’s system includes more than 3,000 miles of pipe. Spokesman Jimmy Luthye said that network, which would stretch from Seattle to Orlando if laid end to end, requires near constant maintenance. “Every morning you will see your friendly neighborhood water utility Denver Water crews out there replacing pipe and and fortifying and upgrading our system wherever we can, as much as we can, while keeping water as affordable as we possibly can,” he said. The agency replaces about 15 miles of subterranean pipe every year. Its maintenance efforts currently include a large-scale replacement of lead service lines; the pipes that bring water from the water main in the street to the plumbing in the home. That comes with a price tag of $667.5 million. Because the department serves so many customers, it’s able to spread those big costs across a big customer base. About 1.5 million people are connected to Denver Water’s system – roughly a quarter of Colorado’s population – and their bills will only change incrementally over the coming years. The average monthly bill in 2024 will be $1.60 to $2.30 higher than a typical bill from 2024. Manny Teodoro, who studies water utility policy and management at the University of Wisconsin, said Denver’s price hikes are similar to increases he expects across the nation and region. “How much those prices go up, and how quickly they go up, is largely going to depend on the local politics,” he said. “These are not decisions that engineers, hydrologists and economists make. Ultimately politicians make these decisions.” Teodoro said politicians usually decide to spread out costs as much as possible, opting for incremental rate increases over long periods of time. But even gradual price bumps are getting bigger than water managers might have expected. “I talked with water utility leaders around the country who are scrambling now to revise their capital replacement and capital investment programs because they budgeted them two or three years ago, before inflation rates went up and before interest rates went up,” Teodoro said. For water utilities in the Southwest, replacing old infrastructure is often only half the battle. The region’s two-decade mega-drought, fueled by climate change, has forced city utilities to get creative with their water systems and find new ways to get the most out of finite supplies. “They will try to lessen their dependence on Colorado River water, or make the Colorado River water they do have go further,” Sorensen said, “and that means investments in alternatives that are far more expensive.” Cities and towns across the Colorado River basin proudly tout how they’ve been able to stretch out finite water allocations across growing populations. Tucson, Arizona, for example, uses the same amount of water it did in the 1980s, despite adding about 200,000 people to its population. Colorado Springs uses the same total amount as it did in the 1980s, too, even as its population has doubled since then. Urban areas have been able to maintain that kind of growth by cutting back on per capita water use – incentivizing people to use less water by trading their grass lawns for less thirsty plants and installing low-flow showerheads and toilets – but some are preparing to keep taps flowing in the future by reusing water that’s already in the system. That embrace of reuse technology is on display in Castle Rock, Colorado. The suburb between Denver and Colorado Springs has ranked among the fastest-growing cities in the nation. Between 2010 and 2020, the town’s population grew by nearly 52%, according to U.S. census data. At the same time, the aquifer – a pool of water that has gathered in underground bedrock – that supplies the majority of its water is drying up, pushing the city to lean harder on other water sources, like a nearby creek. Castle Rock is legally allowed to use most of its water over and over, so the city has installed new systems to do that safely. Over the past few decades, the city has spent about $211 million on renewable water supplies, including a lot of physical infrastructure – pipes, pumps and filters to clean water that has already been used. “That is a cost to doing advanced treatment and providing that really high quality water supply,” said Mark Marlowe, director of Castle Rock Water. “But for us, given the water supplies we're treating, it's absolutely imperative that we have this technology.” Right now, Castle Rock’s sewage is cleaned up to environmental standards required by state and federal agencies, then put back into Plum Creek before flowing to other cities downstream But Castle Rock is interested in going a step further and investing in cutting-edge equipment that would cut out the middle step – allowing sewage to be cleaned so thoroughly that it can be piped directly back into the drinking water supply. The burgeoning technology has picked up interest around the state and the Colorado River Basin. Castle Rock appears poised to be among the first cities that will take advantage of new Colorado regulations designed to make it easier to roll out the filtration system, which is called “direct potable reuse.” Further south, near Los Angeles, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California is investing in its own direct potable reuse system. The proposed facility would cost an estimated $3.4 billion to build and would cost $129 million to operate each year. Once built, the new equipment could redirect up to 150 million gallons of wastewater back into the municipal supply each day. Officials with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said “anywhere from three to several dozen” cities in the state are considering water recycling systems in the future. In Castle Rock, construction of a direct potable reuse facility would cost upwards of $60 million. Marlowe and his team plan to soften the blow of spending on new equipment by spreading it out across about four decades. Castle Rock Water has already mapped out water rates through the year 2065, including roughly $450 million in new spending. All told, the increases that show up on customers’ water bills are relatively modest. In 2023, the typical monthly water bill in Castle Rock was $2.02 higher than a typical bill from the year before. In 2024, that increase will be $2.11 for a monthly bill. “You've got this long term capital plan,” Marlowe said, “And you're making sure you're spreading those costs out over a reasonable period of time so folks can afford it.” President Joe Biden has made infrastructure spending a hallmark of his time in office, and a large chunk of that federal money is set aside for water utilities.""}]"

(AP) — A massive explosion at a duplex where police were investigating reports of shots fired shook a Washington, D.C, suburb Monday and destroyed the home. All officers escaped serious injury but it was unclear what happened to the suspect who was inside the home when it was leveled by the explosion, Arlington County, Virginia, police spokesperson Ashley Savage said. Officers went to the home at about 4:45 p.m. after receiving reports of shots fired. They later determined the shots came from a flare gun, Savage said. While police investigated, they obtained a search warrant for the home. When police later attempted to execute the warrant the suspect fired several rounds inside the home and the explosion occurred just before 8:30 p.m., shooting flames and debris into the air police said. Savage said it was unclear whether the rounds were fired from a flare gun or a firearm. Police don’t have any evidence that others were in the duplex but can’t rule out the possibility, she said. Carla Rodriguez of South Arlington said she could hear the explosion more than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) away and came to the scene but police kept onlookers blocks away. “I actually thought a plane exploded,” she said. Bob Maynes thought maybe a tree had fallen on his house when he heard the explosion. “I was sitting in my living room watching television and the whole house shook,” Maynes said. “It wasn’t an earthquake kind of tremor, but the whole house shook.” Arlington is located across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C.

got a little murky this week. Former President Donald Trump had both a victory and a defeat. And former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, whose campaign was gaining some steam, dealt herself a very public blow. To hear more about it, we have NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving on the line. Good morning, Ron. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good morning, Alina. NIKKI HALEY: So, Ron, things went sideways for Nikki Haley at a campaign event in New Hampshire this week. She was answering audience questions about the American Civil War. Tell us more about what happened. ELVING: A voter asked Haley what caused the Civil War at a campaign event. It was in Berlin, N.H., on Wednesday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HALEY: Well, don\'t come with an easy question, right? I mean, I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms and what people could and couldn\'t do. ELVING: When the stunned voter raised the issue of slavery, here was Haley\'s response. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HALEY: What do you want me to say about slavery? ELVING: Well, the backlash was immediate. And by Thursday, Haley, who blamed a Democratic plant for the question, seemed to remember more about the Civil War. Here she is at a town hall in North Conway, N.H. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HALEY: Of course, the Civil War was about slavery. We know that. That\'s unquestioned, always the case. We know the Civil War was about slavery. ELVING: And, of course, we do know that. We know when South Carolina, Haley\'s home state, seceded - the first state to do so - they said it was to protect slavery. We also know some people don\'t like to say that out loud and prefer talking about states\' rights or states\' freedoms or free enterprise. Well, the whole incident serves to remind us that Haley has never run for anything outside her home state. SELYUKH: How are Haley\'s competitors responding to all this? ELVING: Well, everyone got to dunk on Nikki Haley this week. A couple of her opponents for the Republican nomination, Chris Christie and Ron DeSantis, mocked her for it. DeSantis said she wasn\'t ready for prime time. Even President Joe Biden sent out a four-word message, just saying, quote, ""it was about slavery."" And, you know, it all came at an awful time for Haley. She had been gaining ground in New Hampshire. Two state polls there showed her within hailing distance of Trump if she could consolidate some of the anti-Trump vote in that state. She had the support of its popular governor. Now she\'s fighting just to get back to where she was. And all those rivals she had recently surpassed are gleefully welcoming her back into the pack. SELYUKH: Now, former President Donald Trump, meanwhile, scored a bit of a win in Michigan, where the state Supreme Court decided this week to keep him on the ballot. But then Maine\'s secretary of state decided to take him off the primary ballot there. How many more states can we expect to make these calls? ELVING: There may be quite a few. We should note these conflicts all pertain to primaries at this point, but they could also affect Trump\'s eligibility to be on the ballot in November. Now, the Supreme Court - the U.S. Supreme Court - could step in at this point and clear the air. It could dismiss these ballot challenges for the primaries and possibly for November, too. But the court seems less than eager to get involved in all this presidential campaigning. The court tends to wait. They would rather this cup pass from them, rather that the case got resolved in some other way. But just as they will have to decide whether Trump is immune from prosecution, they will probably have to decide if he is fit to be on the ballot. Right now, it seems highly unlikely they would deny the voters the right to decide. You don\'t have to be radically pro-Trump to think the voters have a right to decide. SELYUKH: OK. So let\'s turn to the border now and President Biden. President Biden is under growing pressure to increase security on the southern border. Agents there have encountered roughly 2.5 million migrants so far this year, which is a record high. But Biden is also under the gun to provide more funding for the war in Ukraine. How is he going to square that budget circle? ELVING: These two issues, Ukraine and the southern border, were yoked together in the Senate in an effort to win over Republicans. Democrats seemed willing to bend much further than they have before on immigration restrictions in order to get that aid for Ukraine. But thus far, it\'s been slow going. Without Republican help, it is quite possible Biden will be stuck with the defeat of Ukraine and a border crisis, despite his best efforts to compromise and his willingness to anger some of his Democratic constituencies in the process.

The child victims have now been identified as seven-year-old Aden Wentz and nine-year-old Elianna “Ellie” Wentz. As FOX21 has previously reported, the incident occurred on Dec. 18, when CSPD found the two children dead inside their home in the Stetson Hills area, as well as serious injuries to the third 11-year-old daughter and Singler. The children’s pictures and identities were confirmed in a press release from the father of the victims, Kevin Wentz, where he recounted events leading up to their deaths on Dec. 18. According to the release, the incident is rooted in a contentious divorce and custody dispute between Singler and Wentz, dating back to September 2018 in Larimer County. Throughout the custody battle, Wentz says Singler levied serious allegations of child abuse and domestic violence against him. However, court proceedings found these claims unsubstantiated, deeming Wentz non-threatening to the children. Recent legal actions further compounded the situation. On Sept. 14, Singler obtained a Temporary Protection Order in El Paso County, alleging that Wentz brandished a knife toward her. Despite Wentz’s denial and a scheduled hearing, the temporary order stood until Jan. 24, 2024. Moreover, another Emergency Motion was filed by Singler in Larimer County Court on Nov. 17 to restrict parenting time based on the same allegations regarding the knife. This order was rescinded after the court found no imminent threat, ordering Singler to cover Wentz’s legal expenses and allow him to make up parenting time for the time lost due to the allegations. However, Singler failed to comply with the court’s directives and did not bring the children on the scheduled date of exchange on Dec. 16. Wentz says he and his divorce attorney tried to contact Singler, to which she did not respond, prompting him to seek legal intervention. The court granted an Emergency Motion for Law Enforcement Assistance to Enforce Parenting Time filed by Wentz’s attorney on Dec. 18 and scheduled a Status Conference on Dec. 20, ordering Singler and the children to appear in person. Singler is now accused of murdering her two children, Aden and Elianna, and seriously injuring their 11-year-old sister and herself on Dec. 18, just two days before their scheduled court appearance. According to Wentz, she failed to contact the authorities until the early hours of Dec. 19. In the aftermath of the devastating news, Wentz says he cooperated fully with the police investigation. Subsequently, a warrant for Singler’s arrest was issued on Dec. 26, accompanied by charges including multiple counts of murder, child abuse, and attempted murder. CSPD says the 11-year-old girl who was injured is safe and being cared for in Colorado Springs. Singler’s whereabouts remain unknown. Wentz is requesting anyone with information to contact the CSPD at (719) 444-7000. If you would like to remain anonymous, you can contact the Crime Stoppers Tip Line at (719) 634-STOP (7867). Plans for a private funeral for Aden and Elianna are underway, with a GoFundMe account established to aid with funeral expenses and the care of the surviving child: Fundraiser by Erica Burkhardt: The Wentz Family.

la junta directiva de la escuela, luego de casi una semana de protestas por el testimonio que dio en una audiencia en el Congreso sobre antisemitismo. ""Como miembros de la Corporación Harvard, hoy reafirmamos nuestro apoyo al liderazgo continuo del Presidente Gay en la Universidad de Harvard. Nuestras extensas deliberaciones afirman nuestra confianza en que el Presidente Gay es el líder adecuado para ayudar a nuestra comunidad a sanar y abordar los problemas sociales muy graves que enfrentamos. que enfrentamos"", dijo la Corporación Harvard en una declaración firmada por los becarios de la universidad. ""La presidenta Gay se disculpó por cómo manejó su testimonio ante el Congreso y se comprometió a redoblar la lucha de la Universidad contra el antisemitismo"", decía el comunicado. Gay fue nombrado presidente de la universidad hace menos de seis meses. Es la segunda mujer y la primera persona negra en dirigir la institución de la Ivy League. Gay y sus homólogos de la Universidad de Pensilvania y del Instituto Tecnológico de Massachusetts recibieron duras críticas después de comparecer en una audiencia de la Cámara la semana pasada y parecieron eludir la pregunta de si los estudiantes que pedían el genocidio de los judíos deberían ser castigados. En un polémico intercambio con la representante Elise Stefanik, republicana por Nueva York, Gay dijo que ""ese tipo de discurso es personalmente aborrecible para mí"" y ""está en desacuerdo con los valores de Harvard"". Stefanik luego presionó a Gay: ""¿No puedes decir aquí que va en contra del código de conducta de Harvard?"" Gay no respondió directamente y dijo en parte: ""Aceptamos un compromiso con la libre expresión incluso de opiniones que son objetables, ofensivas y llenas de odio; es cuando ese discurso se convierte en una conducta que viola nuestras políticas contra el acoso, la intimidación"". En una entrevista con el periódico estudiantil Harvard Crimson publicada el viernes, Gay se disculpó por sus comentarios y dijo en parte: ""Quedé atrapado en lo que se había convertido en ese momento en un intercambio prolongado y combativo sobre políticas y procedimientos"". ""No logré transmitir cuál es mi verdad"", dijo. El testimonio de los presidentes se volvió viral en las redes sociales y provocó la condena de la Casa Blanca, legisladores, defensores de la comunidad judía, exalumnos y donantes. La reacción ha sido impulsada en parte por Stefanik y el inversionista multimillonario Bill Ackman. El furor empujó a Harvard a una crisis, y las demandas de que Gay dejara su trabajo parecieron ganar fuerza durante el fin de semana después de que la presidenta de Penn, Liz Magill, dimitiera. Magill había sido objeto de escrutinio por responder al interrogatorio de Stefanik en términos igualmente legalistas. Sin embargo, Gay recibió el lunes el apoyo de un gran grupo de profesores y ex alumnos de Harvard. Más de 700 miembros de la facultad, incluido el experto en derecho constitucional Laurence Tribe, firmaron una carta instando a los administradores a resistir los pedidos de destitución de Gay. ""Nosotros… le instamos en los términos más enérgicos posibles a defender la independencia de la universidad y a resistir las presiones políticas que están en desacuerdo con el compromiso de Harvard con la libertad académica, incluidos los llamados a la destitución de la presidenta Claudine Gay"", dijeron en el carta. ""El trabajo crítico de defender una cultura de libre investigación en nuestra diversa comunidad no puede continuar si dejamos que su forma sea dictada por fuerzas externas"", continúa la carta. NBC News obtuvo el texto de la carta de la profesora de historia Alison Frank Johnson, uno de los miembros de la facultad que encabezó el esfuerzo. En una carta separada, el comité ejecutivo de la Asociación de Antiguos Alumnos de Harvard dijo que respaldaba ""unánime e inequívocamente"" a Gay. ""Tenemos plena confianza en su liderazgo durante este momento difícil"", escribieron los miembros del comité.'}]"
