The Macon County Courthouse is obscured by Canadian wildfire smoke, as seen from Krekel’s in Decatur Tuesday evening. DECATUR — The ""smell of money"" has been replaced, at least temporarily, with the smell of smoke from Canadian wildfires that have rendered Soy City\'s skies a dull gray and reduced its air quality to among the worst the state. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday afternoon, Decatur\'s air quality index was 280, or ""very unhealthy,"" which was the highest of any major in the city in the state and, by some measures, the highest in the country. ""This is just shy of the worst category of air quality, \'hazardous,\' which begins with an AQI value of 300,"" said Matt Holiner, chief meteorologist for the Herald & Review. ""Older adults, children, and those with heart or lung conditions should avoid outdoor activity. All others should limit outdoor activity and consider wearing a N95 or KN95 mask."" Drifting smoke from Canadian wildfires prompted health advisories and outdoor event cancellations on Wednesday in Central Illinois. The sun appears red due to wildfire smoke from Canada in Decatur Tuesday evening. HSHS Medical Group pulmonologist Dr. Brian Reichardt said pollution of 60 micrograms per cubic meter is what would be found while standing surrounded by vehicles in a busy intersection. He said Central Illinois has been experiencing 180 micrograms per cubic meter. ""That is pretty unprecedented, particularly for our neck of the woods,"" Reichardt. He said these conditions will fortunately be brief and people can take precautions, including minimizing their time outside and keeping their windows closed and using an air purifier if needed indoors. Dr. Jeremy Topin, who works in critical care pulmonology at Mattoon-based Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center, said he and his colleagues were concerned that the drop in air quality that started on Tuesday would exacerbate such pre-existing health conditions. This drone photo provided by Vieweg Real Estate shows a view of downtown Decatur obscured by the smoke from the wildfires in Canada. Decatur\'s air quality index Wednesday afternoon was the highest among any major city in the state. Forecasts show the smoke gradually decreasing over the next few days Topin said he had not seen an uptick in patient traffic as of early afternoon Wednesday. Still, Topin said he encourages those with heart and lung conditions to lower their threshold for managing flare ups at home while air quality is so poor. ""I would encourage them to come in and get evaluated,"" Topin said. Canadian wildfire smoke obscures a bridge over Lake Decatur as a boat comes to shore Tuesday evening. Dr. Anna Richie, medical director of Memorial Urgent Cares, said they had seen patients on Wednesday, ages from 10-70, with complaints of headache, wheezing, shortness of breath, itchy eyes, hoarseness and congestion ""all believed related to the poor air quality the past 24 hours."" ""If you have a history of asthma or reactive airway disease, keep your inhaler close to you during this time,"" Richie said. ""Seek medical attention if you become short of breath or have chest pain."" The poor air quality disrupted some daily activities. The Decatur Park District, for example, closed Splash Cove waterpark and Overlook Adventure Park. “I tried to work today but called it quits because it’s brutal out there,” said Jeffrey Lambert, owner of Lambert Cleaning Services. Decatur Fire Department Deputy Chief Tim Ohl said wildfire smoke fortunately did not result in any calls from community members on Tuesday and Wednesday mistaking the odor for a structure fire. Ohl said the number of ambulance dispatches remained steady on those days, but they did field inquires from concerned citizens. ""We had a couple of people call and ask about the air quality,"" Ohl said. Conditions are expected to improve gradually by the end of the week, with some forecasted rain expected to help, according to Mike Albano, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Lincoln. ""One of the things that will help flush the smoke out is some thunderstorm activity, which is also badly needed across the area,"" Albano said. ""We\'ve been mired in a bit of a drought. But as those disturbances are coming through, it\'ll, in a sense, settle the dust."" Children, older adults, and those with heart or lung conditions can resume outdoor activities, but should avoid extended amounts of time outside and strenuous activities. ""With additional rain and southerly winds, air quality should finally reach the level 2 \'moderate\' range on Friday,"" Holiner said. ""Only those with severe lung conditions will need to limit outdoor activity at this point and skies will be noticeably less hazy. We\'re expected to stay in the ""moderate"" range though through the weekend. Air quality may not return to level 1 \'good\' until additional rain falls on the Canadian wildfires, shrinking their size."" Get the daily forecast and severe weather alerts in your inbox!

Hundreds of students turned out and presented demands to administrator’s on the union’s behalf. Among the demands delivered during the demonstration: The college’s administration said they have been urging the union to “negotiate at the bargaining table” rather than striking. CFAC last went on strike in the fall of 2017, walking out for two days. In 2019, the union voted to authorize a strike but did not walk out after signing a new contract. This is a developing story.

Durante la asamblea, el sindicato pidió a los estudiantes que participen en la demostración durante el discurso presidencial del presidente y director ejecutivo Kwang-Wu Kim, en “Family Weekend”, que tomó lugar el sábado 21 de octubre. Cientos de estudiantes asistieron y presentaron demandas a los administradores en nombre del sindicato.

He recalled how one participant shared that he had been charged with manslaughter after killing his best friend in a drunk driving accident. “Watching him blink back tears while telling us how deeply he missed his friend and how badly he wanted to make things right, I wondered in what world jailing him means justice,” said Ostrow, a fourth-year student in the College. Experiences such as this one have made Ostrow a vigorous advocate against local and federal incarceration. On Dec. 11, it was publicly announced that Ostrow received the prestigious Marshall Scholarship, which will enable him to study at the University of Oxford, where he will advance his work on incarceration reform by pursuing a graduate degree in socio-legal studies next fall. He is the 29th person affiliated with U Chicago, since 1986, to win a Marshall Scholarship, which recognizes academic excellence, leadership and ambassadorial potential. Ostrow said he is guided by a belief that “if the goal of incarceration is to correct human behavior, the institution of prison is a failure.” His resolve is anchored in a stark reality: 90 percent of incarcerated individuals in Chicago re-offend within a year, which Ostrow said reflects the failure of prisons to rehabilitate. His ultimate goal is to expand restorative justice—a method for repairing harm that uses dialogue to achieve accountability and reconciliation—as a viable alternative to incarceration. The Marshall Scholarship, Ostrow said, helps prove that imagining new responses to harm besides criminalization is realistic. Additionally, he said that the opportunity to study the U.K.’s historical national uptake of restorative justice will help teach him how to intervene and institutionalize a similar system in the U.S. Previously, as a Stamps Scholar, Ostrow trained as a restorative justice facilitator and researched restorative justice practices across Europe. “Ethan’s willingness to question the status quo and apply problem solving to the complexities of our justice system is inspiring, and exemplifies so many of the unique qualities that distinguish students here at UChicago,” said Melina Hale, dean of the College. “We are so proud of Ethan, and this well deserved honor.” Associate Dean of Undergraduate Research and Scholars Programs, and Executive Director of the College Center for Research and Fellowships Nichole Fazio said, “Ethan’s courage of conviction and his integrity have earned him one of the most prestigious national fellowships available to American students.

We are proud of Ethan for his evident compassion and his enduring pursuit of what is just and true.” “If the goal of incarceration is to correct human behavior, the institution of prison is a failure.” A Law, Letters & Society major in the College from San Francisco, Ostrow will finish his bachelor’s degree in the spring, as well as a master’s in political science. When he returns from Oxford, he plans to pursue a law degree and continue developing connections with legislators, law enforcement and restorative justice practitioners to build upon the relationships he forges in the U.K. Together with fellow student Harley Pomper, Ostrow has written multiple op-eds, including one in the Chicago Sun-Times last spring that spurred public and media attention to a paper ban at the CCJ, which was imposed after drug-laced paper entered the jail.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:49 pm Editor Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias announced several new laws initiated by his office that will take effect at the start of the new year. The initiatives were passed earlier this year by the Illinois General Assembly and signed into law. They include: Combating Distracted Driving Giannoulias drafted this legislation to increase road safety by making it illegal to Zoom, watch or stream videos, or access social media sites while driving. In 2022, more than 24,000 drivers were issued citations for distracted driving in Illinois. Nationwide, distracted driving kills more than 3,000 people annually, or about eight each day, according to the National Safety Council. “We need to take steps to change the culture surrounding distracted driving, which will lead to more responsible drivers and ultimately save lives,” Giannoulias said. “Videoconferencing takes hands, eyes and minds off the focus of driving. Our plan utilizes a combination of increased education, stronger laws and tougher enforcement to encourage drivers to change bad behaviors for the better.” House Bill 2431 was sponsored by state Rep. Mike Kelly (15th District- Chicago) and state Sen. Javier Cervantes (1st District- Chicago). Expanding Voter Registration for Teens Under this measure, teens obtaining their driver’s license or ID card may preregister to vote at a Secretary of State DMV. Giannoulias’ office initiated a measure to expand voter participation by allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to preregister to vote, so that when they turn 18 and are officially eligible to vote, they are already registered to do so. “Voting is one of our country’s most cherished rights,” Giannoulias said. “I’m committed to increasing voter participation and voter access. This initiative ensures more young people register to vote and are eligible to vote at age 18.” Senate Bill 2123 was sponsored by state Sen. Julie Morrison (D-29th District) and state Rep. Katie Stuart (D-112th District). Preventing Book Bans Giannoulias, who also serves as the State Librarian, initiated this first-in-the-nation legislation to prevent public and school libraries from banning books, guarding against censorship and protecting librarians. Giannoulias proposed the legislation after extremist groups– including the far-right nationalist group, the Proud Boys– targeted Illinois libraries, divided communities and harassed librarians. The law authorizes state grant funding only to libraries that adhere to the American Library Association’s (ALA) Library Bill of Rights or that issue a statement prohibiting the practice of banning books or resources. “The concept of banning books contradicts the very essence of what our country stands for,” Giannoulias said. “It also defies what education is all about: teaching our children to think for themselves. This landmark law is a triumph for our democracy, a win for First Amendment Rights and a great victory for future generations.” House Bill 2789 was sponsored by state Rep. Anne Stava-Murray (81st District- Downers Grove) and state Sen. Laura Murphy (28th District- Elk Grove Village). Protecting Motorists’ Privacy This first-in-the-nation legislation limits the use of automatic license plate readers (ALPRs) to protect individuals seeking abortion care. It also prohibits this data from being used to criminalize a person’s immigration status. While ALPRs can be a valuable tool for law enforcement, the use of that data is currently unregulated. This puts innocent people in jeopardy of being prosecuted in other states for obtaining healthcare services that are legal in Illinois. Without regulation, it is impossible to know who shares this information or how it is used. “No one seeking abortion care in Illinois should be harassed in any fashion, and I’m committed to enabling individuals to pursue and obtain the lawful healthcare they seek without government interference,” Giannoulias said. “License plate readers are an important tool for law enforcement– especially when apprehending suspects in violent crimes or recovering stolen vehicles in car jackings– but we need to regulate these cameras so they aren’t abused for surveillance, tracking the data of innocent people or criminalizing lawful behavior.” House Bill 3326 was sponsored by state Rep. Ann Williams (11th District- Chicago) and state Sen. Sara Feigenholtz (6th District- Chicago). Stopping Pretextual Traffic Stops This legislative effort makes it illegal for police to stop motorists for items hanging from their rearview mirror, such as air fresheners. Amending the current Illinois law– that prohibits items hanging from a rearview mirror because they obstruct a motorist’s vision– decreases unnecessary encounters over minor infractions, which can lead to violent confrontations between police and motorists. “Pulling someone over for merely having an air freshener attached to their rearview mirror is not only archaic but ridiculous,” Giannoulias said. “Amending the law by prohibiting traffic stops that encourage discriminatory practices will ultimately make our streets safer for both motorists and police officers.” House Bill 2389 was sponsored by state Rep. La Shawn Ford (8th District- Chicago) and state Sen. Christopher Belt (57th District- East St. Louis). Increasing Library Access This measure authorizes the office to negotiate with e-book and audiobook publishers to acquire digital rights to these materials at lower prices, which will make digital book resources more available to residents across the state, regardless of where they live. “Libraries are the cornerstones of our communities, but due to technological advancements residents are no longer restricted to just brick and mortar buildings when they want to borrow a book,” Giannoulias said. “That’s why I advocated for the increased acquisition of e-books– so that readers can borrow more digital books from our libraries. Libraries can negotiate better prices from publishers when they work together.” Senate Bill 2419 was sponsored by state Sen. Laura Murphy (28th District- Elk Grove Village) and state Rep. Nabeela Syed (51st District- Palatine). Editor The Journal-Pilot mobile app brings you the latest local breaking news, updates, and more.

Caroline Kubzansky / Pioneer Press Skokie Ethics Commission Chair Jonathan Minkus, center, with attorney James Ferolo, front, and member Rabbi Leonard Matanky, back, at a meeting of the Skokie Ethics Commission, March 2, 2023. The Skokie Ethics Commission will not investigate a village trustee’s complaint about Mayor George Van Dusen and Village Corporation Counsel Michael Lorge after commissioners on Thursday said they determined the complaint did not merit inquiry under the provisions of the ethics code.This makes the third time in about two years that the Ethics Commission has dismissed village Trustee James Johnson’s complaints about possible conflicts of interest between village government and the Skokie Caucus Party, whose members have dominated the mayoralty and the board of trustees for decades.In Skokie, “commissioners are appointed by the mayor and approved by the village board of trustees,” according to the village website. Johnson has made two complaints, and the second, which was the subject of the March 2 hearing, has now been dismissed twice.The March 2 hearing was the second the commission has held on Johnson’s complaint alleging that Van Dusen and Lorge conspired to block a trio of referenda from the November 2022 ballot. The hearing was held a second time in order to ensure compliance with the Open Meetings Act, which requires government bodies to provide public notice of government meetings and allow public participation. Trustee James Johnson at a meeting of the Skokie Ethics Commission, March 2, 2023.In October, the commission found that Johnson’s complaint did not “establish probable cause that a violation of the State or Village of Skokie ethics ordinance occurred,” according to a letter from commission chair Jonathan Minkus to Johnson dated Oct. 12.Johnson then submitted a request for review to the Illinois Attorney General’s Public Access Counselor alleging that the commission had violated the Open Meetings Act in coming to its decision.Thursday’s hearing was a re-review of that complaint. It took place in a conference room on the second floor of Skokie Village Hall and was not live-streamed, broadcast or taped. Before the board adjourned into a closed portion of the meeting, Johnson addressed the board regarding his complaint.“As a member of the Village Board, I am telling you we need your help,” he said. “Our village legal department is rife with political conflicts of interest, and members of the Village Board are complicit.Johnson alleged that Van Dusen, a member of the Skokie Caucus Party, and Lorge, a former vice-chair of the party, worked together to prevent the three form-of-government referenda from coming before voters by placing three referendum questions about environmental sustainability on the ballot instead. The limit for ballot questions is three, so if three questions appear on a ballot, no more can be added.Van Dusen ultimately withdrew the environmental sustainability referenda, thereby allowing the form-of-government referenda to appear on the ballot. All three passed, authorizing staggered elections, non-partisan elections and the election of trustees by geographic sections as well as at-large trustees.Johnson said he had asked Lorge about his involvement in the abandoned referenda during an executive session meeting in January 2023 and said Lorge had denied personal involvement in the process but said “one of his Assistant Corporation Counsels had helped Mayor Van Dusen develop and draft the resolutions.” Skokie Ethics Commission Chair Jonathan Minkus, center, with attorney James Ferolo, front, and member Rabbi Leonard Matanky, back, at a meeting of the Skokie Ethics Commission, March 2, 2023.Johnson said he believed Lorge was referring to Assistant Corporation Counsel Jim McCarthy, the current chair of the Skokie Caucus Party. Attorney James Ferolo asked Johnson to refrain from introducing new complaint material at the hearing to avoid triggering a new set of due process requirements.“I believe there is more than sufficient evidence that Lorge and McCarthy’s outside political roles have clearly impaired their “independence of judgment or action in the performance of [their] official duties,” Johnson said.Van Dusen has previously said Johnson’s complaint was “ludicrous.”During the public comment portion of the meeting, former trustee Ilonka Ulrich said she was disappointed in the amount of public notice that the village provided prior to Johnson’s ethics complaint and subsequent meetings.She said as a trustee, the village provided notice for even the most mundane zoning related issues: “a dispute about a mere fence was published, heard and documented,” she said, asking why “an allegation involving moral turpitude” hadn’t received the same treatment.“If you do not conduct a public hearing for a public official in his capacity, what can the average Joe in Skokie do?” Ulrich asked before calling on the board to withdraw its conclusions and refer the case to outside counsel. Attorney James Ferolo, front, Ethics Commission chair Jonathan Minkus, center and commission member Rev. Richard Lanford, back, at a meeting of the Skokie Ethics Commission, March 2, 2023.“You are appointed by the mayor and the mayor is the interested party,” Ulrich said, addressing the commission members.Kimberly Polka, an organizer with the Skokie Alliance for Electoral Reform, which backed the three form-of-government referenda, said it is to be expected that those in public service have a party affiliation but said “it looks like there is no line between the Skokie Caucus Party and our government.” Trustee James Johnson and Skokie Alliance member Kimberly Polka during the public comment portion of a meeting of the Skokie Ethics Commission, March 2, 2023.“Where is the line?” Polka asked.After the commission delivered its verdict, Johnson asked that the written version of the decision include information about how to appeal the decision and asked if he could ask a round of follow-up questions.Ferolo told him he could not.“We have been very generous to you,” Minkus said. “We’ve heard you, we’ve listened to you, we really did listen to you.”“Denied further due process,” Ulrich said, heading out of the room with her coat.After the hearing ended, Johnson told Pioneer Press he would consider appealing the decision and planned to continue advocating for changes to the village’s legal department.

He also received a second Purple Heart during the war for a chest wound. And he received the U.S. Army’s Presidential Citation for capturing Steinbach. But Mr.DeMeyers was most proud of the Belgian Forageure, an award given by the Belgian Army for acts of bravery in the liberation of Belgium.“He was quite proud of that, being partially of Belgian descent,” his wife, Rose, said. “I still have it displayed on the bedroom wall.”After the war Mr. DeMeyers went into the U.S. Army Reserves and was called back into active duty during the Korean War, serving in Germany for 18 months, his wife said. He remained in the reserves until 1962, retiring with a rank of captain, logging 22 years of military service.For 37 years, Mr. DeMeyers worked as a land inspector of residential property and title abstracter for Chicago Title and Trust, based in Geneva. In 1974, he retired and moved to North Port, Fla., near Ft. Myers, where for 10 years he was a utility coordinator and safety officer for the Charlotte County Engineers.Other survivors include a daughter, Linda Uselding, a son, George; a sister; three grandchildren; and a great-grandson. There will be no services. Burial will be at Arlington National Cemetery. A native of St. Charles and a former Fox Valley resident, Mr. DeMeyers enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1941, and trained at Ft. Sill, Okla., where he received his officer’s commission. After receiving a three-day pass, he married his wife, Rose, on Feb. 14, 1942. He was shipped out to Europe in January 1944 and was part of the 4th Infantry Division, 29th Field Artillery Battalion, Battery A. “George went over enemy lines, mapped out the artillery batteries and returned and gave the coordinates to Allied gunners,” said his son-in-law, Doug Uselding. During Mr. DeMeyers’ time in the European Theater, he was “in the thick of it,” Uselding said. He was a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army when he landed on Utah Beach during D-Day, the Allied invasion of France, on June 6, 1944, he said. Four days after the invasion, on June 10, Mr. DeMeyers was heading for Monte Burg in France when Germans opened up with .88-caliber mortars, hitting Mr. DeMeyers in the throat. He was sent back to England where he recuperated in a military hospital, receiving the first of his two Purple Hearts. After 2 1/2 months, he rejoined his unit and the push toward Cologne, Uselding said. Mr. DeMeyers, of Belgian and Dutch ancestry, was stationed in Northern France, and in December 1944 he was part of the Battle of the Bulge in the Ardennes Forest of Belgium–considered the last great battle of World War II–and then fought in the Rhineland in Germany. As a member of the 4th Division, 8th Infantry Regiment, Mr. DeMeyers was credited with capturing German Brig. Gen. Paul Steinbach, who was hiding in a German hospital at Kleinrinderfeld, faking a war wound. The general apparently had hidden there after a heavy bombing, said Linda Uselding, who read about the capture from a yellowed newspaper article. For his bravery in the Ardennes and capturing the German general, Mr. DeMeyers was awarded the European Theater Operations Ribbon with five stars, the Bronze Star with one oak leaf cluster, and the Silver Star.

Cannawerx CBD and Wellness Solutions opened in Crystal Lake this past fall. The owner hopes to start a series of health and wellness classes this year.

Developers are hoping to turn the south entrance into Woodlore Estates in Crystal Lake, which currently passes through an empty field and wooded area, into a 47-unit townhome development that would feature a large amount of open space amenities. The McHenry County chapter of the organization has a new initiative called Big Futures intended to help teens thrive in the path to adulthood.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:33 pm John Denver and actor George Burns laugh over their lines as they rehearse a scene for the movie ""Oh, God!"" in Los Angeles on Dec. 8, 1976. Today is Friday, Dec. 8, the 342nd day of 2023. There are 23 days left in the year. Today\'s Highlight in History: On Dec. 8, 1941, the United States entered World War II as Congress declared war against Imperial Japan a day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. On this date: In 1765, Eli Whitney, inventor of the cotton gin, was born in Westborough, Massachusetts. In 1886, the American Federation of Labor was founded in Columbus, Ohio. In 1949, the Chinese Nationalist government moved from the Chinese mainland to Formosa as the Communists pressed their attacks. In 1980, rock star and former Beatle John Lennon was shot to death outside his New York City apartment building by Mark David Chapman. In 1987, President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed a treaty at the White House calling for destruction of intermediate-range nuclear missiles. In 1991, AIDS patient Kimberly Bergalis, who had contracted the disease from her dentist, died in Fort Pierce, Florida, at age 23. In 2001, the U.S. Capitol was reopened to tourists after a two-month security shutdown. In 2008, in a startling about-face, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told the Guantanamo war crimes tribunal he would confess to masterminding the Sept. 11 attacks; four other men also abandoned their defenses. In 2011, the 161-day NBA lockout ended when owners and players ratified the new collective bargaining agreement. In 2014, the U.S. and NATO ceremonially ended their combat mission in Afghanistan, 13 years after the Sept. 11 terror attacks sparked their invasion of the country to topple the Taliban-led government. In 2016, John Glenn, whose 1962 flight as the first U.S. astronaut to orbit the Earth made him an all-American hero and propelled him to a long career in the U.S. Senate, died in Columbus, Ohio, at age 95. In 2020, the Supreme Court rejected Republicans\' last-gasp bid to reverse Pennsylvania\'s certification of President-elect Joe Biden\'s victory in the electoral battleground; the court refused to call into question the certification process in the state. In 2012, Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel became the first freshman to win the Heisman Trophy. In 2017, Japanese pitching and hitting star Shohei Ohtani announced that he would sign with the Los Angeles Angels. In 2022, Russia freed WNBA star Brittney Griner in a high-profile prisoner exchange with the U.S., which released Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. Today\'s Birthdays: Flutist James Galway is 84.

DESIGN Will Google Convert Distinctive Thompson Center To “Mylar Balloon”? “Google has a ‘build-to-suit agreement’ with JRTC Holdings to buy the Thompson Center once renovations are complete. The internet giant is expected to begin occupying the building in 2026, the company said in July 2022,” reports the Trib. “Continued demolition and remodeling might significantly alter the historic building, said Ward Miller, executive director of Preservation Chicago… ‘From what we’re seeing, there’s a chance that this building could really lose its integrity and look like a Mylar balloon if we’re not careful,’ Miller said. [He] praised JRTC and Google’s decision not to demolish the building but criticized them for not sharing more recent renderings… He shared hopes the redevelopment would maintain the building’s plaza, colors and atrium.” LaSalle Street Residential Conversion Plan At Risk “Alderpersons Bill Conway (34th) and Brendan Reilly (42nd) sounded the alarm about the future of ‘LaSalle Street Reimagined’ during Wednesday’s budget hearing, seeking assurances from city planning officials that developers now fronting huge costs can count on the city to be their partner,” reports the Sun-Times. The pair say that Mayor Johnson’s “plan to use a record tax increment financing (TIF) surplus threatens to deprive developers of the subsidies they need to transform LaSalle Street office buildings into residential use.” Benedictine Sisters To Sell West Ridge Campus Of A Century-Plus “The Benedictine Sisters of Chicago have lived on a sprawling [fifteen-acre] West Ridge campus since 1906. Due to age and declining ranks, they are… looking to sell the property,” reports Block Club. “The finances of running a large campus have become too much of a challenge for the [nineteen] women who remain” of what was once a 200-nun order. Alinea Co-Owner Nick Kokonas’ Old Town House Yours For $7 Million “After five months trying to sell his artful Old Town home using his own eccentric method, Alinea restaurant co-owner Nick Kokonas is now putting it on the market in the conventional way,” reports Crain’s. “The biggest change from his method is that there’s a published asking price, $6.84 million.” Kokonas and his wife are now listing the property with an agent, Jeff Lowe of Compass. “In May, Kokonas put the Eugenie Street property, made up of two nineteenth-century houses connected by a glass bridge, a third post-Chicago Fire house out back and a garage, up for sale with no agent representing it and, far more unusual than that, no asking price. Kokonas calls the method an ‘inverted commission’ model, in which the higher an offer a buyer’s agent brings him, the bigger the agent’s percentage gets. He told Crain’s at the time that he had sold three properties that way.” DINING & DRINKING Ferrara Candy Buying Jelly Belly “Ferrara Candy is buying jelly bean maker Jelly Belly Candy for an undisclosed amount,” reports Food Dive. “The proposed deal would combine Jelly Belly, whose roots date back to 1869, with Ferrara’s broad portfolio of candies such as Laffy Taffy, Red Hots, Brach’s and SweeTarts.” Since 2017, Nutella maker Ferrero Group has owned Ferrara. (The corporate press release is here.) Coca-Cola Offers Lou Malnati’s Slice In West Loop For An Empty Bottle Coca-Cola is giving out a free drink and a slice of pizza if you turn in an empty plastic beverage bottle at Lou Malnati’s West Loop location (1235 West Randolph) on November 7. It’s to promote bottles made from one-hundred percent recycled plastic, reports CBS 2. Taco Bell Goes Fastest Through Drive-Through “The industry insiders at QSR Magazine have released the annual Drive-Thru Study, sharing the lowdown on which fast food chains have the fastest drive-through lines, which ones prepare the most accurate orders, and which are the friendliest while they’re doing both of those things,” reports Food & Wine. “Taco Bell has the fastest drive-thru for the third straight year. On average, it took customers 278.84 seconds to receive their orders, almost half a minute faster than Carl’s Jr. (303.74 seconds), the next-speediest.” FILM & TELEVISION True/False Film Fest Assesses Fire Damage “About a month out from the office fire, we are getting a handle on the loss,” the Columbia, Missouri-based nonfiction film mainstay reports on Instagram. “We are likely facing about $75,000 in loss, including projection equipment, computers, furniture and supplies. While we have insurance to help offset hard costs, that process, as most know, is tedious and protracted—and at a time when we are heading into our busiest festival season. The building is, at this time, unusable, and we are in search of a temporary home for our year-round staff that can also be a base for the seasonal Fest team members who will be working hard in January and February. We’re hoping to get back on our feet so we can continue to do what we do best: connect cinema and community. We love being intricately woven into the Columbia arts scene, and we’re deeply touched by the folks who have helped us get here, and help us stay here.” More here. “Barbenheimer” Crush Sparks Movie House Worker Organizing “For movie theater owners around the country, the same-day release of ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ this summer meant record box-office sales and a gratifying sign that the public still craved entertainment on the big screen,” reports Associated Press. “But for some employees at the Alamo Drafthouse in Manhattan, ‘Barbenheimer’ was the breaking point.” Says a guest attendant, “It was just the constant understaffing and the emotional exhaustion.” Dozens of workers at the Manhattan theater decided it was time to form a union. “Alamo employees worked with United Auto Workers Local 2179 and this week voted to unionize, with nearly two-thirds in favor. They join Alamo employees at the Brooklyn theater, who voted last month to become part of Local 2179.” LIT People For The American Way Contests Scholastic’s Segregation Of Books Following reports that children’s book publisher Scholastic will banish books about race, gender or sexuality to a separate section at school book fairs to accommodate local and state restrictions on materials that can be taught, People For the American Way President Svante Myrick said in a release, “There are almost no words to describe the harm that will come from Scholastic’s decision to segregate or eliminate books dealing with race and gender from its book fairs. Putting these books in a separate section will send an unmistakable message to kids that being Black or LGBTQ is so wrong, so out of the mainstream, that it belongs in a separate room. That the books consigned to this Siberia will include books about icons like Ketanji Brown Jackson and John Lewis is even more incomprehensible. We are urging Scholastic, in the strongest way possible, to reconsider this decision. The hurt and pain it could cause to kids would be lifelong.” Iowa Censors Use Of “Sex Act” As All-Purpose Weapon; Huntington Beach, California Creates Twenty-One-Parent Review Board “Kim Reynolds, Iowa’s Republican governor, signed a law in May that, among other provisions, requires schools to remove books that depict a ‘sex act.’ That statutory phrase has now helped unleash a frenzy of book-banning across the state, one that illustrates a core truth about these types of censorship directives. Their vagueness is the point,” reports Greg Sargent at the Washington Post. “This week, the Iowa City Community School District released a list of sixty-eight books that it removed from schools to comply with the law… The Iowa law requires K-12 schools to remove materials that depict any one of a series of sex acts that include intercourse and other types of genital contact… Beyond Iowa City, the Des Moines Register reports that school districts across the state have removed hundreds of books from their school libraries, also in response to that law. Among these titles: ‘1984’ by George Orwell, ‘Brave New World’ by Aldous Huxley, ‘Slaughterhouse-Five’ by Kurt Vonnegut and ‘Forrest Gump’ by Winston Groom.” Reports the Los Angeles Times, “A community parent advisory board will be tasked with approving children’s books that hit shelves in the Huntington Beach Public Library, a move critics say is a book ban and takes power away from trained and educated librarians.” Of those who contacted City Council, “more than ninety percent [were] against the idea of a council-appointed board screening children’s books for sexual content.” MEDIA Ebony Relaunches As “One-Stop Shop For Upward Black Mobility” A history of the Ebony-Jet empire, with its plans for the future, reported by the Columbia Journalism Review. “There was nothing inevitable about the persistence of Ebony, and the fact that backers keep investing in it—specifically, Black patrons attached to its historical significance—reflects its importance to Black identity in the United States and, perhaps more broadly, what brand power a magazine can have.

provided by Edward Benyas By Annie Hammock, Faculty Managing Editor April 19, 2023 Applied mathematics professor Mingqing Xiao, who was indicted and then cleared on charges of grant fraud under a Trump-era crackdown on Chinese academics, has been taken off paid administrative leave and allowed to resume teaching and advising. Dr. Julianne Wallace, interim associate provost of academic affairs, sent an email to Xiao’s dean saying, “Please provide him with an appropriate workload assignment for the remainder of the academic year and proceed as normal when issuing a workload assignment for next year, but per agreement, with more of an emphasis on instruction and service.” Before he was charged with lying in a grant application for federal funds, Xiao’s duties included research and recruiting, particularly of students in China, in addition to teaching. It was a planned trip to China’s Shenzhen University that landed him in trouble. Advertisement The university created a bank account for Xaio to help him cover travel expenses, but the trip was canceled due to Covid. When he filled out the grant application and that year’s taxes, Xiao did not consider the money his, he later told FBI agents. The federal government indicted Xiao in April of 2021, accusing him of two counts of wire fraud and one count of making a false statement. The indictment was part of a Trump-era program known as The China Initiative, in which academics of Chinese heritage were scrutinized under the belief some were stealing intellectual property for the Beijing government. In October of 2021, federal prosecutors added four charges of tax fraud, because he did not check a box indicating he had a foreign bank account. After a short trial last year, a jury exonerated Xiao of all charges in the original indictment but convicted him of the tax charges that had been added at the last minute.

When AJ Sabanovic arrived as a freshman at Streamwood, he made a bold proclamation.By the time he’s a senior, he has one major aspiration.“There’s a video of me saying I’m going to be an All-American,” Sabanovic said, smiling as he recalled the memory. “I was all-state this year. My goal is to be an All-American.”Sabanovic, the 2023 Beacon-News/Courier-News Boys Soccer Player of the Year, indeed took a big step with that all-state nod. He led the Sabres with 20 goals and 13 assists.But there was more to the junior forward this season than just numbers and statistics. He had to work for everything, he had to earn everything, and he rose to that challenge.“The thing is, it could have been a lot more with the amount of chances he was getting,” Streamwood coach Matt Polovin said. “That’s what happens when people know about you.“Some games, he was getting triple-teamed. It was fascinating to watch. He still found chances.”Part of working through that defensive attention was looking for his teammates. It was an area of Sabanovic’s game heading into the season that Polovin wanted to see improve. His assist total shows his willingness to share the ball.

He has witnessed Sabanovic’s progress throughout the years.“The thing that makes it most difficult is he’s more physical than most forwards,” DiNuzzo said. “He’s a fantastic scorer and puts himself in good positions. He’s just grown into a man.“He’s only going to get better. He’s a real determined kid and just loves the game. He’s fun to watch.”Sabanovic’s parents hail from Bosnia, where his father played soccer.

The bottom line from the five-year forecast from the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget: The current fiscal year is now projected to end with a $1.4 billion surplus, while the upcoming fiscal year 2025 is projected to face an $891 million deficit. “So that five-year forecast, you know, we look at it as a guide for how careful do we need to be as we move forward in the in the budget year thinking about FY ’25,” Gov.

It takes stock of the state’s general revenue fund, which is the main discretionary spending account that’s subject to budget negotiations each spring. This year’s five-year forecast projected deficits of over $1 billion from FY 2026 through FY 2029. But, as Pritzker noted in his interview with the news media outside of the Governor’s Mansion Thursday, future-year budgets can be “very hard to project” due to state, national and global economic factors. It’s noteworthy that actual revenue performances have routinely exceeded prior-year estimates during Pritzker’s tenure – his GOMB has proven a conservative prognosticator. And the governor noted he expects some fluctuation in the anticipated FY 2025 revenue total as the state gets closer to the fiscal year that begins July 1. “I think you’re going to see different projections as we go forward just because the economy is changing,” Pritzker said, alluding to strong Thursday stock market gains after the Federal Reserve indicated interest rates would remain flat for the time being and decrease in the coming months. While budget surpluses have routinely yielded supplemental spending plans in Pritzker’s tenure amid sustained revenue booms, the governor and lawmakers have been noncommittal when asked about such a plan passing in the upcoming session. But Pritzker on Thursday noted at least one area of supplemental spending need. In November, he announced $160 million in state support to aid and house migrants being bussed to Chicago from U.S. border states, particularly Texas. That plan shifted money from elsewhere in the Department of Human Services’ budget, including block grant funding and $40 million that was backing a pending application for Federal Emergency Management Agency funding. Pritzker said it “is going to be a requirement” that the state reexamines “whatever buckets that we’ve had to pull from” to provide aid to migrants as winter approaches. The five-year report from GOMB identified another $969 million in added “spending pressures” that could also require supplemental appropriations. Those include potential state assistance for asylum seekers, increased caseloads at the Department on Aging and the Department of Human Services, delays in other federal reimbursements, increased group insurance costs, and outstanding technology bills. While the report didn’t break down the costs in each area, it noted that the “spending pressures” serve to offset much of the anticipated surplus. “After accounting for the supplemental budget pressures, the revised fiscal year 2024 surplus is projected to total $422 million,” GOMB noted in the report. All told, GOMB now expects FY 2024 to see just over $52 billion in revenues, up from the $50.6 billion when lawmakers approved the budget in May. GOMB’s report noted the main drivers of the increase – including the state receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in reimbursement for federal matching funds not properly claimed in a previous fiscal year – are likely “one-time” in nature and shouldn’t be built into annual budgets. Other surplus drivers include a $255 million greater-than-expected transfer from the income tax refund fund due to a strong tax filing season a year ago, good investment and interest returns, and strong corporate and sales tax performance. The one-time nature of much of this year’s surplus drivers plays into next year’s projected deficit, as GOMB anticipates revenues to decline to $51.5 billion, with expenditures growing to $52.3 billion. The main drivers of spending growth each year are the state’s public school and pension funding formulas. The school formula calls for an added $350 million each year. A recent report from the legislature’s Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability noted Illinois’ FY 2025 general fund pension payment is also expected to grow by $350 million, to about $10.2 billion. All told, that adds up to the $891 million projected deficit for FY 2025, although that number drops to $721 million when accounting for the statutory contribution to the state’s “rainy day” savings fund. That rainy day fund has been a major beneficiary of recent surpluses and is now at its strongest-ever balance of over $2 billion. Pension funds have also benefitted, with lawmakers and the governor adding $700 million to the funds beyond statutory requirements in recent years. Other recent surpluses have gone to pay down interest-accruing debt and to replenish the state’s unemployment insurance trust fund amid the crush of claims brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. As for the anticipated current-year surplus, we’re likely a few months away from knowing the full scope of any supplemental spending plan it will yield. Pritzker is scheduled to give his budget address to lawmakers on Wednesday, Feb. 21. After that, budget negotiations normally continue until the legislature adjourns and approves a budget in May.

This reflects a 2,829-person increase from the previous year—up 4.30 percent. This estimate is inclusive of more than 44,000 people experiencing an often-hidden form of homelessness: doubling up or temporarily staying with others. Homelessness is not one-size-fits-all and there are many ways one person can experience it. Someone may sleep in a shelter, on the street, at a train station, and double up with others all in one week. All these living situations should be considered homeless. In 2022, Chicago tallied 3,875 people experiencing street and shelter homelessness. The Point-in-Time count tallies people experiencing street and shelter homelessness on a designated night of the year—usually every January. The Department of Housing and Urban Development does not include people doubling up with friends and family who are considered homeless and therefore is not counting them in their annual estimates and does not include them in who is eligible for housing. CCH developed a method of estimating homelessness using American Community Survey data that includes those living doubled-up. Estimate Highlights: • Black and African American Chicagoans continue to disproportionately experience homelessness. Black and African American Chicagoans account for 53 percent of all people experiencing homelessness while making up only 29 percent of the city’s total population. • Hispanic and Latino/a/e/x Chicagoans far more often experience homelessness by couch-surfing. Of all Hispanic and Latino/a/e/x Chicagoans experiencing homelessness, 91 percent are in doubled-up situations. What is the solution? To address the lack of housing resources for households living doubled-up, CCH developed the Bring Chicago Home campaign to create a local, dedicated revenue source for housing. With flexible local funding, the city can provide housing for the full scope of people experiencing homelessness. For the past two months, housing advocates from the Bring Chicago Home coalition have been working with the Johnson Administration to land on a proposal that would raise the real estate transfer tax on high-end property sales and dedicate that to fund permanent housing and wraparound services – a step to addressing Chicago’s homelessness crisis.

MESKE macmeske@ibjonline.com News sources throughout the region are reporting U. S. Steel’s announcement today as up to 1,000 employees are expected to be laid off at the Granite City Works steel mill by late January 2024. Most of U. S. Steel-Granite City Works operations will go on “indefinite idle” as was noted in the WARN notice sent out to over 1,000 workers at the facility. The issuance of the WARN notice was confirmed by both U. S. Steel representatives and Madison County officials. The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act of 1988 is a U.S. labor law that protects employees, their families, and communities by requiring most employers with 100 or more employees to provide notification 60 calendar days in advance of planned closings and mass layoffs of employees. An estimated 600 of the workers notified are expected to be added to the company’s Granite City layoffs beginning Jan. 28, 2024, following the 400 workers were laid off in September 2023 with the idling of the “B” blast furnace. U. S. Steel officials said that while they had previously announced its decision back in September to temporarily idle Blast Furnace ‘B’ at Granite City Works, this WARN notice was being issued because it is now expected that the idling will last more than six months. Employees already on layoff with the previous announcement would stay on layoff; additional employees would be affected starting in late January. In an email correspondence received by the Illinois Business Journal from a U.S. Steel media spokesperson, it was noted, “U. S. Steel has indefinitely idled Granite City’s primary operations and will meet customer demand by leveraging the Company’s active iron and steelmaking facilities. This action was taken in order to help ensure melt capacity is balanced with our order book. Accordingly, the Company has sent the required notices to employees who potentially may be affected. We thank our employees for their contributions and will keep them informed throughout this process.” Following the company’s announcement, Illinois State Representative Amy Elik (R-Alton) responded, saying, “I am disgusted and saddened to hear U.S. Steel’s plans to potentially layoff up to 1,000 employees in Madison County. Granite City employees and their families have provided loyal, skilled labor to the steel industry for decades, and U.S. Steel is pulling the rug out from under them. U.S. Steel should be doing everything it can to keep the Granite City steel mill operating at capacity, and I don’t see the company making that effort. I am willing to work with anyone to help keep these jobs in Granite City. “My heart goes out to all the workers and families impacted, especially during the Holiday season. I join in the sadness and anger of the city of Granite City and the employees who have dedicated their livelihoods to the steel industry. I encourage employees impacted by this layoff to contact the Southwestern Illinois workNET Center located in Wood River at 618-296-4301 to receive job search assistance and potential training opportunities. If my office can be of assistance, please contact my district office in Alton at 618-433-8046,” Elik added. The Illinois Business Journal also asked Madison County Employment & Training Director Tony Fuhrmann how his department would be moving forward in working with the employees affected. He said, “With the 400 that were already laid off we worked with the union and held the Rapid Response in Granite City. I would anticipate the same process for the union employees. I haven’t seen the layoff list, but I think it may include non-union as well. We will work with the company to arrange events for those individuals.” Congresswoman Nikki Budzinski (IL-13) also responded to the news that there would be additional mass layoffs facing employees at the Granite City Works steel plant. Budzinski said, “Two months ago, U.S. Steel handed out pink slips to 400 workers as they blamed the United Auto Workers strike for reduced steel demand. Today, with strong steel prices and operations resumed at the Big Three automakers, U.S. Steel is planning to make these layoffs permanent while putting another 600 jobs on the chopping block. It’s clear that these layoffs were never about the market and always about targeting organized workers. U.S. Steel must be held accountable. “As U.S. Steel works to close up their union-represented shop in Granite City and move operations to a so-called “right-to-work” state, it’s clear that the company’s executives are more concerned with lining their own pockets than they are with the livelihoods of the workers who have built their company for generations. I will continue to closely monitor U.S. Steel’s Strategic Alternative Review Process as we maintain hopes that an American-owned company with strong labor relations can step in to better serve our highly-skilled workers and the Granite City community,” Budzinski further noted. This country is in shambles. What a pitiful place we call home. No good can come of this that’s for certain.'}]"

hickory.Survey maps dating as far back as 1821 indicate the area was part of a larger grove, and though records indicate such uses as cattle grazing and timber harvesting, there's nothing that states the area was deforested.Shepard posited that the disjunct points to an ancient forest “that existed on this Tinley moraine for several thousand years,” when the climate here was warmer.A worldwide weather phenomenon called the little ice age that cooled the climate for centuries starting around 1300 gradually forced many formerly native species south, he said, leaving these small relict populations behind where conditions and perhaps some hybridization allowed them to survive.There are other cases of disjunct populations that came to be accepted, such as prickly pear cactus, natives of the American Southwest that continue to hold on naturally in the Chicago area.His next step is trying to get a paper about the Tinley Creek trees published through the Illinois State Academy of Science, as it would add impetus to is protests against restoration practices that could result in the removal of the southern trees as weeds.In the meantime, he'll continue exploring south suburban

He’s a tree guy, and he wants to make sure the area’s ancient woodlands get some recognition too.Ancient forests in this part of the Prairie State?Indeed, he said. In fact, he contends there are tree populations in Will and south Cook counties that point to an era some 8,000 years ago when the climate here was warmer. A black maple tree shows off its fall color outside Academy Methodist Church in Harvey. Homewood resident Dave Shepard planted the tree there because “they’re like works of art.”On his forays into the woodlands over the last 40 years, he’s come across some trees that stand out from the rest, so Shepard, a Homewood resident who previously lived in Riverdale, went out of his way to get them some statewide credit.This year, those efforts were rewarded as two trees he nominated were declared Illinois Big Tree Champions, certified by Illinois Extension and listed on the Illinois Big Tree Register.Shepard, an environmental science professor at Moraine Valley Community College in Palos Hills who has also taught at Governors State University in University Park and South Suburban College in South Holland, found both of the newly crowned champions at Messenger Woods in Homer Glen.The new state champion black maple there stands 118-feet tall with a 32-inch thick trunk diameter, while the state champ jack pine tree is 83-feet tall with a 19-inch trunk diameter. Other factors, such as canopy spread, factor into the rating system.Much smaller, but still large enough to be a state Big Tree Champion, Shepard identified an inland serviceberry tree on the South Suburban College campus that’s 34-feet tall. Shepard’s three champions join a group of Chicago area giants that include 70-feet tall slippery elm at St. James at Sag Bridge Cemetery in Lemont and a National Champion Ohio buckeye growing near the Hyatt Lodge in Oak Brook. Private lots in Aurora are home to Illinois Champions American elm and American beech, and the Morton Arboretum in Lisle is home to three state champs. Others are in St. Charles and Geneva, and two champs are growing in Midway Woods in north Cook County.What makes Messenger Woods in Homer Glen such a good place is the thick layer of organic material that’s been allowed to build up at the oldest preserve in the Forest Preserve District of Will County.“It’s like walking on a water bed,” Shepard said. “It’s an old woods.”By his estimation, Messenger Woods dates back much further than its acquisition in 1930, and he speculated that Indigenous people were extracting sugar from the black maple trees there since prehistoric times.That long view, the connection with the distant past, is one of the reasons Shepard has for decades traveled off trail in search of interesting trees. It led him to the area’s only two populations of black maples, a tree more at home further north, according to information from the Forest Preserve District of Will County. Besides the Messenger Woods colony, another stand of black maples can be found in Black Partridge Woods near Lemont.“I’m always looking for stuff. I like identifying things,” Shepard said. “I get awe inspired when I look at the height of these things. It’s like its own world in there. When you walk into the woods, you can think better, you can pray better. You can commune better and you can see things, the way things were. It’s like going back in time.”The convergence of historical landscapes in the Chicago area, particularly in the south suburbs, also gives every outing the potential for discoveries, Shepard said. David Shepard, of Homewood, and Julianne Mason, restoration program coordinator for the Forest Preserve District of Will County, measure the trunk of a black maple tree in Messenger Woods in Homer Glen in July, 2020.One mystery that draws him back to Sweet Woods outside of Thornton was a sourwood tree first recorded by botanist Floyd Swink in 1956 that shows up again in the scientific record through specimens collected in 1973.“That’s exceptional,” Shepard said. “It’s a beautiful tree that turns red in the fall and has white flowers like a lily of the valley, but as a tree.”Shepard hasn’t been able to find that tree, but he thinks it could be an outlier, a relict from environmental conditions that existed long ago, as sourwood trees occur naturally in Illinois only at the state’s southern tip. Otherwise, it’s mostly native to the East Coast and Appalachian Mountains regions.The official assumption, Shepard said, is the sourwood was planted by someone years ago, but until he finds it and can investigate what trees are growing nearby, he’s not convinced.He is convinced of the importance of a grouping of tree species he found in Tinley Creek Woods east of Orland Park.“I found a disjunct, a relict population of southern trees. Trees you would normally see in Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas,” he said. “There’s a whole population of them.”The “15 or 16 species” including rock elm, scarlet oak, Nuthall’s oak, flowering dogwood and white basswood growing between Oak Park and Harlem avenues and 143rd and 151st streets aren’t trees that are supposed to be here.He collected specimens and put them on file at the Field Museum and proclaimed his discovery to the Chicago botany community.“They told me Cook County planted a bunch of trees from the South in 1940,” he said. “There’s no evidence of that. I’ve looked at this area for a long time and there’s no way anyone planted this.“They’re naturally occurring. Trees grow in forest associations. You can tell plantings by the forest preserves because they don’t go together in the wild. Back then, Cook County didn’t care what they put in. They used common trees that were easily available and easy to propagate.“These same trees growing here grow in the same type of locality 300 to 500 miles south of here. It’s hard to get to. It freaked me out when I saw it. They’re growing up together. You’d have to be a genius botanist to put this together.”Instead of celebrating the discovery, the trees were dismissed as “exotics, invasive species,” Shepard said.His research indicates the species not only aren’t invasive, they could predate many of the surrounding, native species of white oak and hickory.Survey maps dating as far back as 1821 indicate the area was part of a larger grove, and though records indicate such uses as cattle grazing and timber harvesting, there’s nothing that states the area was deforested.Shepard posited that the disjunct points to an ancient forest “that existed on this Tinley moraine for several thousand years,” when the climate here was warmer.A worldwide weather phenomenon called the little ice age that cooled the climate for centuries starting around 1300 gradually forced many formerly native species south, he said, leaving these small relict populations behind where conditions and perhaps some hybridization allowed them to survive.There are other cases of disjunct populations that came to be accepted, such as prickly pear cactus, natives of the American Southwest that continue to hold on naturally in the Chicago area.His next step is trying to get a paper about the Tinley Creek trees published through the Illinois State Academy of Science, as it would add impetus to is protests against restoration practices that could result in the removal of the southern trees as weeds.In the meantime, he’ll continue exploring south suburban forests and teaching his students about the great diversity in the area’s woodlands.“We need to preserve woods like these,” Shepard said. “They are historical documents of what was there before we were here.“A lot of my basis is this is God’s creation. We’re stewards of the land. That’s our job. We’re not creators, but we can destroy it.”Landmarks is a weekly column by Paul Eisenberg exploring the people, places and things that have left an indelible mark on the Southland.

a Rhodes Scholarship and an Obama-Chesky Voyager Scholarship and has had internships at both the White House and the U.S. State Department.While some would consider that a dazzling set of achievements for a lifetime, Petryk experienced them all in 2022.“I feel really lucky,” said Petryk, 20, the daughter of Ukrainian immigrants, after Niles West High School honored her as a distinguished alum at a recent Board of Education meeting.Born in Chicago and raised in Morton Grove, Petryk, currently is a senior at Northwestern University double-majoring in Economics and International Studies. As she closes in on graduation, Petryk is working as a research assistant at Northwestern’s Global Poverty Research Lab as part of an overall goal of one day working as a U.S. State Department attorney.Some of the first seeds of Petryk’s interest in law occurred when she was a Niles West High School student. She was the first freshman to make the school’s varsity Mock Trial team, according to her coach Jason Stanford.“It’s clear that she has been on the road to becoming a Rhodes Scholar since I met her (in) her freshman year,” Stanford said at the Board meeting.As he spoke that night, Stanford recalled about a conversation he had with Petryk competing on a team with all seniors.

618-939-3814 205 West Mill St.Waterloo, IL 62298 news@republictimes.net Saturday, June 1, 2024 January After a break for the holidays, the Waterloo Queen of Hearts jackpot grew to nearly $2 million. On the last day of the month, in front of a massive crowd that covered the Outsider tavern lot, several blocks of South Market Street and much of the east side of the Monroe County Courthouse grounds, a 12-round draw-down finally revealed the elusive Queen. Sam Houston of Red Bud chose card 28, which won him the eventual $1,886,536 jackpot. The pre-trial aspects of the Illinois SAFE-T Act, including no-cash bail provisions, were stayed just hours before they were set to go into effect. Following the passing of the Protect Illinois Communities Act, several law enforcement agencies throughout the state expressed their refusal to uphold the new gun control law. Monroe County Sheriff Neil Rohlfing said HB 5471 is a “clear violation of the Second Amendment,” and he and his department would not be enforcing it. The entire three-member board of police commissioners in Waterloo resigned when Norman Venable, Lonny Ludwig and Heather Garcia submitted letters of resignation near the end of the month in response to measures made by the city to have the commissioners take disciplinary action – including termination – against Waterloo Police Officer Dan Pittman and Sgt. Eric Zaber. Two years after closing their doors, and with extensive renovations finally finishing up, Gallaghers reopened its downtown Waterloo restaurant. The City of Columbia approved a ballot referendum seeking “home rule” status for the municipality. The City of Waterloo learned that loan funding for construction of its more than $30 million water treatment plant west of town has been reserved through an Illinois Environmental Protection Agency loan. Columbia residents met with representatives of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and local officials at 11 South to discuss FEMA’s preliminary flood maps and the impact of the proposed changes. The most impactful changes for some Columbia residents were found near the Carr Creek and Palmer Creek watersheds along Valmeyer Road and Quarry Road, respectively. The Waterloo Chamber of Commerce announced it has hired Christine “Chris” Herrmann as its new executive director effective Jan. 23. Paden Schultz, a 2021 Gibault graduate attending school at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, died suddenly on Jan. 30, 2023, just shy of his 20th birthday, which would have been Feb. 5. Longtime Waterloo High School and Waterloo Junior High School baseball coach Mark Vogel was officially inducted into the Illinois High School Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame. In 30 years at WHS, Vogel has 552 wins and two third-place state finishes. The Columbia High School boys and Waterloo High school girls basketball teams each won their respective co-hosted holiday tournaments. The CHS boys team won three total tournaments in January. The WHS and CHS cheerleading teams both earned trips to the IHSA state meet by virtue of winning at the sectional level in their respective classes. The Waterloo squad finished eighth at state with Columbia taking home second place. In its second straight state appearance, the WHS boys bowling team finished its season with a 15th place finish at the IHSA State Tournament. February Monroe County State’s Attorney Lucas Liefer and Monroe County Assistant State’s Attorney Jennifer Becker-Roscow were selected to fill two associate judge vacancies in the 24th Judicial Circuit which had been formed in late 2022. Later in the month, Ryan Webb was named as Liefer’s replacement. A heavy police presence descended upon a neighborhood in Dupo for an active shooter situation Feb. 26 afternoon after Dupo Police Sgt. Patrick Carrier was shot by a male suspect and 46-year-old Darryl T. Mantz was killed by gunfire. An ensuing standoff of several hours ended when the suspect, 40-year-old Reginald O. Allen of Dupo, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on his property. Several emergency agencies responded to a two-vehicle, head-on crash Feb. 10 on Bluff Road near Sand Bank Road in Columbia that resulted in the death of Monroe County resident Dennis Fitzwilliam and left another person in critical condition. Jennifer Sondag Eckenfels, 36, a lifelong resident of Valmeyer, passed away Feb. 23 following a recent cancer diagnosis. A special education teacher at Gardner Elementary School in Waterloo, Eckenfels touched the lives of many in the community, a fact made clear by the tremendous attendance at both her visitation and funeral Jeanette Gregson, a prominent figure throughout Monroe County known for her work in local journalism and countless other reasons, passed away Feb. 19 at the age of 95. The Monroe County Zoning Board of Appeals met to address non-compliance with a previously granted special use exception for Frances Gruber, who operates Freedom Lake campground at 5329 Sportsman Road near Waterloo Sportsman’s Club. The campground had been serving as a permanent residence for several individuals in recent years. Concerns were expressed because of the lack of property tax collected from these residences as well as a high volume of police and emergency service calls made to the property. Owner of The Truck Stop Columbia Bryan Scott addressed the Columbia City Council after a number of inspections revealed an estimated $80,000 in needed updates, leading Scott to abandon the business venture on Main Street. Before leasing the property, Scott said he approached the city and received a “great response” when he shared his ideas. “For the next eight months, I began a cycle of misinformation, debt, frustration, complaints and ultimately, disappointment,” Scott said. Many local residents saw the infamous Chinese spy balloon making national headlines last week flying high above Monroe County and surrounding areas Feb. 3 as it continued east. The balloon was eventually shot down by the U.S. military over the Atlantic Ocean off the South Carolina coast Feb. 4. The Waterloo Fire Department was joined by firefighters from Columbia and Valmeyer at the scene of a house fire at 8282 D Road Feb. 1. Waterloo Fire Chief Aaron Shive said the home was a total loss. All residents of the home were out of harm’s way and accounted for at the scene. Dupo High School celebrated 100 years of boys basketball with special ceremonies prior to home matches with New Athens. Dupo High School bowler Maddie Ehrhard, a junior, finished with a six-game score of 1,192 at the Belleville West Sectional to qualify for the IHSA state meet. March Weeks before the April election, several current and former City of Waterloo employees spoke with the Republic-Times about what was described as a “toxic” work environment, with many attributing the situation to then-mayor Tom Smith. Similarly, Waterloo Police Department Sgt. Eric Zaber addressed the Waterloo City Council March 21 to express his displeasure about how the city had handled his employment after he filed multiple grievances alleging retaliation and discrimination while serving on active duty with the force. Zaber filed for worker’s compensation last June, but he said that request was denied. Then on Jan. 1, he said his pay was cut without notice. A student protest over the presence of transgender students using Waterloo High School restrooms prompted heated conversation as a letter from the district and heavy attendance at a monthly school board meeting. The situation began March 17 in the morning when a large number of WHS students began to form a line outside of the nurse’s single-occupancy bathroom. For several months after the incident, Waterloo School Board meetings were held in the WHS auditorium to handle the crowds who wished to speak on the matter during public comment. The Columbia Fire Department responded to the report of a fully engulfed residential structure fire shortly before 2 a.m. March 7 in the Stonegate Estates subdivision. Upon arrival, heavy flames were seen shooting in the air, prompting mutual aid requests from such neighboring departments as Waterloo, Millstadt, Dupo, Prairie du Pont and Mehlville (Mo.). In all, about 75 firefighters responded to the scene. The home, which sustained heavy damage, belonged to Skip and Lori Weber. Organizers of the Waterloo Homecoming announced major changes to the celebration, including a change of venue from downtown Waterloo to the Monroe County Fairgrounds and the event being held on one day instead of two.

the West Side of Chicago, Illinois. It was somewhere between 8 and 9 p.m. last Wednesday, that I kept hearing loud noises that sounded like explosions/fireworks. I was on the first floor in the kitchen and there was something really annoying about those booms. Of course the first thing that goes through one’s mind is to question who in the heck is shooting fireworks in December? The second thing was that the sound was really different from what I’ve heard in the past, I came upstairs and went out on my second-story deck. I could tell that the sound was coming from south of North Avenue. I couldn’t see any kind of light explosions going off in the air, but I kept hearing the continuous sound. Boom … boom … boom. I began checking my Citizens and Neighbors apps. Both are usually good sources of information to find out what’s going on. And of course, someone had posted about hearing the loud booms. Other people joined in to concur and offer their opinions. Then people began trying to locate where the the sound came from. For reference, I live near North Avenue and Laramie. A lot of the people posting were in the Humboldt Park area. One person said they lived at Damen and Cermak! Someone else said they were at Armitage and Damen. Another was at Western and Fullerton. When a person told me they were at Oakdale and Laramie, I definitely became suspicious about what kind of explosions could have noise that traveled that far? And what would that be like for the next 4th of July? Others claimed it was an individual setting off fireworks near Kostner and 21st Street. I have heard fireworks my entire life. I’ve never heard of any where the sound was traveling for miles! Someone then posted a flyer claiming the Chicago Fire TV show was setting off controlled explosions. However, based on the addresses, that production is located in Blue Island. Plus the filming was supposed to be between 2 and 4 in the afternoon. It was now after 8 at night. Finally someone posted a video of the explosions from the front porch of their house. What I didn’t see was any rocket/missile/projectile going up into the air. Rather, the video just showed explosions occurring. Instead of the light particles falling to the ground, all one saw was a puff of white smoke that really didn’t disperse. I got a text from a friend who lives off Western and I-290. She said that the noise seemed to be coming from the east, then moved west. She went outside and felt that the air was strange. The noise eventually abated, but the curiosity of myself and others as to the origins did not abate. Someone reported that 911 was getting a lot a phone calls about the noise. So I presumed the following day there would be news reports that would clarify all the data in a factual information report. But guess what? None of the major newspapers or television stations reported on it. It was as if it hadn’t happened. But I have some wonderful sources and they hadn’t heard anything about it even on some of the sites the police tend to chatter on. Interesting. I understand that Rogers Park has also experienced loud noises prior to this. Did we have a close encounter here in the city? Or just like in the film Men in Black, what really happened is being erased from our memories through disinformation — or no information.

The hospital was also rated high performing for its treatment of heart attacks, heart bypass surgery and heart failure. Its work for patients with diabetes and kidney failure, those who need back surgery, hip or knee replacements or who have had a stroke also received high marks, the analysis said. Central DuPage Hospital in nearby Winfield was ranked No. 8 in Chicago and Illinois, gaining high performing marks in three specialties and 15 procedures and conditions. Among the categories for which it received high performing marks included its cancer procedures for leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma patients and its colon, lung and prostate cancer surgeries. It was also recognized for its treatments involving heart attacks, heart bypass surgery, transcatheter aortic valve replacement and heart failure. Care for patients with diabetes, kidney failure and stroke as well as maternity care for uncomplicated pregnancies and hip and knee replacements were high performing as well. However, Central DuPage’s scorecard for ovarian cancer surgery was listed as below average. Rush University Medical Center and Northwestern Memorial Hospital were among the top 22 hospitals in the country, according to U.S. News & World Report. They were the only Illinois hospitals to make the national list this year, tying for best in Illinois. Rush and Northwestern each had 11 specialties rank among the top 50 in the country this year, and University of Chicago Medical Center had 10. Northwestern had five specialties rank in the top 10 nationally, including cardiology, heart and vascular surgery; diabetes and endocrinology; gastroenterology and GI surgery; geriatrics; and neurology and neurosurgery. Rush had one rank in the top 10 nationally: orthopedics. In Illinois, 21 hospitals performed well enough to be ranked by U.S. News this year. Chicago’s Shirley Ryan AbilityLab was ranked as the best hospital for rehabilitation in the country for the 33rd consecutive year. This year, U.S. News opted to put less emphasis on expert opinions. Each year, U.S. News asks specialists to name what they believe to the best hospital programs, but those opinions were given less weight this year. More weight was given to objective measures and more data related to outpatient services were included, given that many procedures and services are increasingly being offered on an outpatient basis, officials said.

CARBONDALE – Six Southern Illinoisans were arrested for human trafficking on May 22 and 23. Human trafficking is the use of force, fraud or coercion to compel a person into commercial sex acts, labor or services against their will. ISP continues its multifaceted approach toward protecting those most vulnerable with its ongoing statewide human trafficking enforcement operations. The Illinois State Police Division of Criminal Investigation Trafficking Enforcement Bureau conducted the two-day human trafficking enforcement operation in the Carbondale area, focusing on identifying individuals seeking to engage in commercial sex acts. As a result of the operation, each of the following individuals were arrested and charged with indecent solicitation of a child, a class 3 felony; traveling to meet a child, a class 3 felony; and solicitation to meet a child (class 4 felony). Marlin Kellum, 28, of Murphysboro; Charles Kemp, 46, of West Frankfort; Kyler McGee, 23, of Anna; Justin Phoenix, 29, of Shiloh; Scott Strudwick, 35, of Murphysboro; and Robert Wilson, 32, of Carbondale. Participating in the operation with ISP were the Southern Illinois Enforcement Group, Southern Illinois Drug Task Force, Centralia Police Department and Salem Police Department. The Jackson County State’s Attorney’s Office also provided support for the operation and filed the above-mentioned charges. If you suspect human trafficking, contact the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888 or text *233733. For more information visit www.humantraffickinghotline.org.

Library officials are starting to contemplate additional physical changes, as well as assessing future community needs.Library board president Jim Clifton and executive director Ishwar Laxminarayan spoke at the Sept. 5 Lake Forest City Council meeting, providing an update on both past and future initiatives regarding the city’s library located at 360 E. Deerpath Road.Their talk followed the completion of the restoration of the library’s dome, which is more than 18 feet high and 30 feet wide. It was a project envisioned for years with the dome under a large tarp for years, but work did not begin until March.The dome repair had a final cost of $1,072,800, according to Laxminarayan. Crews placed a zinc-coated copper finish at the Deerpath building, where construction began in 1931 and the dome was last renovated in 1984.“It’s a gem of a building,” Third Ward Alderman Jim Preschlack said. “It needed some love and care. You’ve done some beautiful work.”With the dome project completed, library officials are dealing with both short-term and long-term issues.Regarding the immediate future, Clifton spoke of a goal to restore murals inside the building, and Laxminarayan adding the library will soon introduce an app for patrons.On a broader level, Clifton noted the “passion” he sensed from the community related to the dome project. With that high interest, officials now wait to see feedback they get through a recently completed community survey on what residents want to see at the library. Results are expected later this year, and Clifton expects that data will play a factor in library board decisions.“We have a lot of long-standing issues that we now have to address within the building itself, but also what the meaning of a library is in the 21st century,” he said. “We have to think more strategically in what role we play in the community.”Laxminarayan pointed to the 1,300 new families that have moved into the community in recent years.“The needs of the younger families might be different from those of the established residents,” he said. “They have moved from other communities where they have seen other libraries.”Laxminarayan also spoke of the changes in daily life that have occurred since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and how that might affect library services.“In a post-pandemic environment, we know that people want quieter spaces, meeting spaces and they also want a place to work from a remote location,” he said.Laxminarayan, who started as executive director in May, said after the results of the survey are in, he wants to engage in discussion with the community, including the possibility of focus groups and town hall meetings.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:57 pm The Morton Community Chorus is pictured here performing Handel’s Messiah at one of their previous concerts. The invitation to perform Handel’s Messiah at Carnegie Hall came as a surprise to Phil Witzig. Witzig, the director of the Morton Community Chorus, was just getting ready to start rehearsing the piece with his choir in September of 2022 when the email showed up in his inbox. The message was from Distinguished Concerts International New York (DCINY) requesting Morton Community Chorus come to New York City to perform at the historic Carnegie Hall on November 26, 2023. “It was very much out of the blue,” said Witzig. “I gotta be honest, I wasn’t sure it was legitimate.” So, Witzig decided to do a little research. He got in touch with someone from DCINY and found out that the invitation was, indeed, legit. Morton Community Chorus was chosen through a confidential audition process in which DCINY organizers reviewed past videos of the Morton Community Chorus that had been posted online and they liked what they heard. They researched us,” Witzig said. “And based on the quality of the production we’ve done in the past several years, they said they would love for our choir to participate.” Witzig was flattered, but at the same time, he had his doubts that such a trip would ever come to pass. Even though at the time it was still more than a year away, there was just so much cost involved and too much to consider during Messiah rehearsals and the upcoming holiday season. “I know that I didn’t have it in me to organize a trip to New York with everything else going on,” he admitted. “I didn’t think it would go anywhere.” Still, he told his choir about it, and to his surprise, they thought it was doable. They didn’t want to pass up this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. “This is the big Messiah performance in New York City,” said Witzig, “It’s not one of them, it is the big one.” Witzig said it was the treasurer of the group, Dorine Aberle, who offered to take it on as a project. “She really took it off my shoulders to organize and really began to make it happen,” he said. In all, there will be 30 singers from the Morton Community Chorus making the trip to the Big Apple. They will fly out from Chicago Thanksgiving morning and begin rehearsals on Friday, alongside about 20 other choruses around the nation and the world chosen to participate. After two and a half days of practice, they will take the stage at Carnegie Hall Sunday afternoon, November 26. Witzig said he and his choir are beyond excited to be making the trip. “It’s a dream come true and something that I really don’t deserve,” said Witzig. Philip Witzig was a business major, but always had a love of music and an interest in conducting. He was involved with the school band and different singing groups beginning in junior high and on through college. He got his start directing church choirs when he was in his late teens. He first directed a kid’s choir, then moved up to the high school choir, and then later, the men’s choir. Diane Simmons, long-time director of the Morton Community Chorus, took notice of Witzig’s directing, and in 2012, approached him about conducting the Morton Community Chorus, a spot that she held for more than 40 years, from 1967 to 2010. The chorus is made up of members from all over Central Illinois, along with five to 10 singers from out of state. The group has performed selections from Handel's Messiah annually since the late 1940s. It is the only standing choir still performing the piece in downstate Illinois on an annual basis. Since Witzig had been a singer in the Morton Community Chorus, and he had some conducting experience, he said yes to Simmons’ offer. But he quickly found himself very overwhelmed. The piece of classical music is very complicated to sing, let alone conduct. “That first year, I was almost sick with nervousness,” remembered Witzig. “I was thinking “why did I do this? Why did I get myself into this?” Even with the support from others, he was still fretting about the performance. So, he did what he always does when something bothers him. He leaned on his faith and asked God for help. His prayer was answered. “I was just thinking ‘I’m gonna mess this up, I’m gonna bring them in on the wrong count, and the whole thing is just gonna come to a big halt. But it didn’t,” he recalled. “I’m telling ya, God took over.” Now, in his 12th year of conducting Messiah, 61-year-old Witzig remembers well the emotions he felt that first year, when he thought it was all going to end in disaster. Turns out, he stated, it was his best conducting experience to date. “I’m being serious, I don't know if I’ve directed any better than that first year,” he said. Before Witzig performs alongside his choir in New York the Sunday after Thanksgiving, he will once again be on the directors block the Sunday before Thanksgiving at Grace Church in Morton (1325 E. Jefferson St) on November 19 at 2:30 p.m. This year the pre-concert prelude will be by organist Peter Wykert beginning at 2:10 p.m. There are no tickets and no assigned seating, so Witzig encourages concertgoers to arrive early for a seat. A free-will offering will be taken. For more information about the concert, soloists or the Morton Community Chorus in general, go to https://www.pjw.cc/community-chorus.html.

""It is to the freedom of the people of Illinois that we are addressing this law,"" Gov. J.B. Pritzker said May 10, referring to the state\'s semiautomatic weapons ban, ""their freedom to be at the Highland Park parade without getting shot and killed."" SPRINGFIELD — 2023 started with a bang in state politics and government. Quite literally. Before leaving the Illinois Capitol on Jan. 9 to attend Gov. J.B. Pritzker\'s second inaugural ball — a banging event in its own right thanks to the serenading efforts of crooner Bruno Mars — the Illinois Senate passed an assault weapons ban. The following day, the Illinois House passed the landmark gun control legislation and Pritzker, surrounded by advocates under the Capitol rotunda, signed it, making Illinois the ninth state in the nation to ban weapons of war. Before it passed his chamber, Senate President Don Harmon confidently proclaimed to those who would challenge the constitutionality of the measure that ""we\'ll see you in court."" Prescient words, it turned out, as the law was immediately challenged in state and federal court. Though upheld in state court and not blocked by the federal courts, the law is likely to face final review before the U.S. Supreme Court. Gov. J.B. Pritzker hugs gun control advocate Maria Pike after he signed comprehensive legislation to ban military-style firearms on Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2023, at the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield. Pike lost her son, Ricky, to gun violence. Advocate Delphine Cherry, third from right, who lost her children Tyesa and Tyler to gun violence, wipes away tears. The ban lists more than 170 types of rifles, shotguns and pistols as unlawful to be purchased or possessed — not to mention ""high-capacity"" magazines that carry 10 or more rounds for rifles and 15 or more rounds for pistols. Its passage, signing and the subsequent legal challenges were among the defining moments in state politics and government in 2023. Here is a look back at that and some of the other defining events and storylines this past year, in no particular order: When they couldn\'t thwart the policies of Pritzker and supermajority Democrats through the legislative process, opponents took to the courts. Several challenges were filed to the assault weapons ban signed in January. At the state level, three separate lawsuits were filed in downstate courts. Though these provided temporary relief to thousands of gun owners, they were quickly moved up the judicial chain, with the state Supreme Court in August ruling 4-3 that the law was constitutional. Republican state Rep. Dan Caulkins of Decatur, center, takes questions after a Macon County Circuit Court hearing on his lawsuit challenging Illinois\' semiautomatic weapons ban. Joining him are state Rep. Chris Miller, R-Oakland, left, and Perry Lewin, owner of Decatur Jewelry & Pawn. Federal lawsuits challenging the law on Second Amendment grounds are ongoing, but the courts have rejected pleas from the plaintiffs to halt implementation while they are ongoing. This means that come Jan. 1, residents who possessed these weapons before the law was signed will have to register them with the state in order to be grandfathered in. Otherwise, they will be breaking the law if they keep these weapons. The law moving forward full-steam ahead stands in contrast to last year, when the elimination of cash bail, slated for Jan. 1, 2023, was put on hold as the judicial process played out. The state Supreme Court in July ruled the provision, the centerpiece of the landmark 2021 criminal justice reform law known as the SAFE-T Act, to be constitutional. As of Monday, Illinois is the first state in the country to ban cash bail. After some ramp-up time, Illinois on Sept. 22 became the first state in the nation where pretrial detention is entirely determined by non-monetary factors, such as the danger or flight risk a defendant poses rather than a person\'s ability to afford cash bail. There have been some hiccups along the way, but the rollout overall has been fairly smooth. So far, it is safe to say the law did not lead to spike in crime akin to what\'s depicted in ""The Purge"" film series. It was quite a litigious year in state government. My bet is that it won\'t be repeated next year, at least to the extent we have seen in recent years. Partly, you can thank a change in state law. In June, Pritzker signed legislation requiring that constitutional challenges to state laws, rules and executive orders be filed in either Cook or Sangamon counties. The aim of the law, which passed with only Democratic votes, is to limit so-called “judge shopping” by downstate conservatives, who sought relief in recent years from statewide policies, such as the weapons ban and end of cash bail, set by liberal lawmakers largely from the Chicago area. It\'s a fair argument — most of these cases, such as lawsuits filed by former gubernatorial candidate Darren Bailey in Clay County seeking relief against COVID-19 emergency orders, end up in Springfield anyway. But state Rep. Patrick Windhorst, R-Metropolis, made a valid point, too, when arguing that those in his community, an Ohio River town that straddles the Illinois-Kentucky border, live closer to Nashville, Tennessee, than to Springfield. Illinois\' utility companies historically have gotten their way with state lawmakers and regulators. But they got a rude awakening on multiple fronts this year. Most recently, the Illinois Commerce Commission slashed project rate increases and outright rejected grid plans from both Ameren and Commonwealth Edison. It was stunning flexing of state regulatory muscle. “This is not business as usual,” Brad Klein, an attorney for the Environmental Law and Policy Center, told Capitol News Illinois\' Andrew Adams last week. “This is really a very significant change in Illinois.” Illinois Commerce Commission Chair Doug Scott (third from left) is pictured at a packed meeting in Chicago on Thursday as he reads a decision that will limit spending by two major electric utilities. The agency rejected grid plans from Commonwealth Edison and Ameren Illinois. Ameren and ComEd are regulated monopolies. It\'s essentially guaranteed that they will make money. But as the state moves to implement the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, which aims for 100% clean energy generation by 2050, it seems there is a determination to protect consumers from shouldering too much of the burden. And earlier this year, an effort to give Ameren a right of first refusal to build out new transmission lines in its service area fizzled due to lack of support from Pritzker. And ComEd, typically a major player under the Capitol dome, was largely sidelined due to the trials and subsequent convictions of two company executives and two lobbyists for conspiring to bribe former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan. With Madigan himself due to stand trial next year, 2024 could be another tough one for the utility giant. It was not a great year for companies that proposed constructing carbon capture and sequestration pipelines through Illinois. In October, Navigator CO2 Ventures withdrew its application with the ICC for certification to build a 292-mile pipeline that would have crossed 14 Illinois counties. In November, Wolf Carbon Solutions also withdrew its application for a 166-mile pipeline that would have crossed nine Illinois counties. In each case, ICC staff recommended that commissioners reject the applications. There was significant grassroots opposition from landowners and environmental groups. Whether the victory for those groups is permanent or temporary is an open question. After Pritzker signed the Reimagining Electric Vehicles in Illinois Act in November 2021, the state had largely reeled in minnows. But in September, Pritzker finally caught a whale as the state struck an agreement with Chinese company Gotion for construction of an EV battery plant in Manteno. It is expected to create more than 2,600 new jobs. The deal was struck in part using about $125 million of the $400 million ""deal-closing"" fund that lawmakers approved earlier this year to help Pritzker and his administration compete against other states vying for such large projects. Gov. J.B. Pritzker joined statewide and Kankakee County officials, Gotion executives, and local stakeholders on Sept. 8 to announce a new $2 billion Gotion lithium battery plant in Manteno. It\'s a feather in the cap for Pritzker, who has sought to position Illinois as the ""Silicon Valley of EVs,"" and good for the state\'s reputation as a place to do business, which has taken a beating over the years. In Bloomington a few weeks ago, Pritzker signaled that more deals were in the pipeline. There were several tests this year to Illinois\' status as a welcoming state, as elected officials worked to respond to the humanitarian crisis created with thousands of asylum-seeking migrants being bused to Chicago from Texas. It\'s been a strain on the relationship between the city and the state. And it has exposed tensions between Black and Latino elected officials as care for migrants grows more expensive and strains the finite state and city resources. That\'s often the'}]"

As was the case for many newpapers at the time, it promoted the issues it supported — in this case, the Democratic Party and the Daughters of Temperance.Despite taking on a partner, journeyman printer H.S. Humphrey, to help address financial problems, Sellon ultimately abandoned the enterprise — and his family — without warning in November 1850. Walter Givler sets type for the Naperville Clarion, which was owned by his father, David Givler. This photo is believed to be from the late 1890s or early 1900s.After Sellon’s sudden exit, Dr. C.C. Barnes and Charles Keith assumed his debts and went into partnership with Humphrey. The DuPage County Observer began publishing in January 1851. Humphrey sold his interest to Gershom Martin in April 1852, and he worked with Barnes and Keith for the two years before assuming sole ownership.But then, like now, readership was important. With fewer than 275 subscribers, the Observer was having a tough go and printed its final edition in 1854.Folk, however, still needed their news, and Keith returned to the business with the DuPage County Journal. Unlike its predecessors, the Journal included national and international news obtained through publisher’s exchanges, similar to The Associated Press or Reuters today.Keith soon partnered with J.N. Edson under the name Keith, Edson & Co. And when Keith left, E.M. Day took his place and ultimately became the sole owner and editor in 1856.All went well until 1857, when the newspaper’s office on West Chicago Avenue was swept away during a massive DuPage River flood.However, a new paper soon popped up. The Naperville Newsletter was published from 1857 to 1863 and unlike its predecessors, it had some competition covering the growing communityThe Naperville Sentinel was published from 1861 to 1862 by D.B. Birdsall, of Wheaton. It was succeeded in August 1863 by Robert K. Porter’s DuPage County Press, which lasted five years.David B. Givler bought the Sentinel, and its growing list of 300 subscribers, in February 1968 and renamed it the Naperville Clarion in 1869.The name change was necessitated by a change in the DuPage County seat, Naperville having lost the title to nearby Wheaton.Newspapers in small towns were typically about four pages long and published once a week. A one-year subscription cost $2.Because Givler could not make a living just publishing the Clarion, he also printed calling cards, invitations, stationary, handbills, posters and advertisements.Ohio born and raised in Copenhagen Corners, which is now part of Naperville, Givler was the Copenhagen Schoolhouse schoolmaster and later trained as a printer prior to the Civil War.After serving with the 7th Illinois Infantry, he returned home to farm and then worked as a warehouse clerk before going into the newspaper business, where he found success.Helming the paper until 1905, he sold the venture to his son, Rollo N. Givler, who ran the enterprise until his retirement in 1951, when the Clarion was sold. It continued to be published until the 1970s.Which brings us to the Naperville Sun, founded by Harold Moser in 1935 to compete with the Clarion. He sold it to Harold White a year later for the king’s ransom of $600.Born in 1913 to parents teaching English in India at the time, White and his family moved to Naperville at age 4 when his father was offered chairmanship of the English department at North-Western College, renamed North Central College in 1926.White graduated from NCC in 1935, bought the paper in 1936 and married Eva Anderson, whom he’d met at the school when she was studying for a teaching certificate, in 1937. Eva joined its the paper in 1938 and served as co-publisher until her death in 1990.Harold White was the Sun’s editor and publisher until March 1991, when he sold it to Copley Press. They sold it and its other suburban newspapers in 2000 to the Sun-Times Media Group, which in turn sold it to current owner, Chicago Tribune Media Group, in 2014.Andrea Field is the curator of history at Naper Settlement.

The Naperville Sun you’re reading today is just one in a long line of newspapers that have served the community since 1849. For much of the 19th century, the business was quite volatile with newspapers coming and going, some after a few months, others after a few years. Naperville’s newspaper history began when Charles J. Sellon took up an offer from a Chicago businessman to start a publication in the city in exchange for a free printing press. The first issue of Sellon’s DuPage County Recorder was published Dec. 1, 1849. It had a circulation of 500 — a big number for the time — but folded in just nine months.

located on the West Side of Chicago, Illinois. I was out in Country Club Hills this past Sunday morning. It was 4 in the morning and everywhere I turned, I saw police cars. Because the streets were empty, it was very noticeable that the police were out in full force. I jokingly posted in one of my Facebook groups about how safe I was because there were so many police. That’s when another person responded that CCH was on high alert because of rumors there was going to be a “teen takeover” at the Marcus theaters out there. That “teen takeover” didn’t happen. But their police department was prepared for it just in case. Well, a “teen takeover” did happen here in Chicago. It was the second time in a week around Roosevelt and Canal where hundreds of teens gathered. They were allegedly the ones who went into the 7-Eleven and tore it up. I watched a 30-minute video of their behavior just on the streets, and it was absolutely embarrassing. Thankfully the police did arrest a few of them. And with that arrest there should be a price to pay. This notion that there’s no such thing as personal accountability/responsibility has made the behaviors of a certain segment of young people absolutely atrocious. The police are telling them to go home and instead the kids are laughing and acting like they have no home training. Those arrested and their parents should become poster children for the price that needs to be paid because of bad behavior. There should be a severe monetary fine for an illegal group-convergence event. Just like we have a law that allows cars to be impounded when individuals are involved in “street takeovers,” where the cars are “drifting” and doing other dangerous stunts, cellphones should be confiscated during teen takeovers and held until the court date. They do it with driver’s licenses, why not do it with any electronic device the person is carrying that has access to the internet? It’s because of access to the internet that they learn where to congregate. We’ve seen numerous videos where teachers have confiscated cellphones and the young people have gone crazy. So imagine losing access to their phone for however long it takes for their case to go before the judge! Perhaps that is the wake-up moment both the kids and the parents need to realize the seriousness of what is going on. If teenagers do one thing well, it’s networking. And if they learn that one of their friends has lost their cellphone for three weeks or longer, maybe that’s the sobering message that will bring some of them to their senses.

Казвали ли сте си, че подобно развитие на технологии, медицина и всичко останало е просто налудничаво или поне, че няма да се случи в близките, има-няма 200 години? Предполагам сте, както и аз самия съм го правил често пъти. Но, ако се замислим реално и си припомним онези фантастични филми и книги, които сме гледали и чели преди години, няма ли да установим, че всъщност повече от дузина неща, които са описани вече са действителни?! Светът ни се развива със шеметна скорост, а постиженията в различни сфери се научихме да приемаме, като даденост. Например мобилните и смарт телефони – приемаме съществуването им и всичките екстри с които са снабдени, за повече от нормално, дори за естествено. Но да си призная когато бях дете, никога не съм и предполагал, че някой ден, ще притежавам машина, чрез която ще разговарям и комуникирам с хора от цял свят, ще пращам съобщения безплатно, ще мога да правя снимки и видео записи, да слушам музика, да преглеждам новините, да се ориентирам в градовете и да играя игри и т.н. Не съм мислил и че с едно флаш устройство, голямо колкото част от пъзел, ще мога да съхранявам тонове информация… Днес обаче всичко това е факт и се намира в най-близкия технологичен магазин. Затова сега, когато гледам, чета или слушам фантастични истории, вместо да подхождам към тях с насмешка, да ги заклеймявам като небивалици или да подхождам с недоверие, си задавам простичкия въпрос: „Защо не?“ Може би ще настъпи ден, в който понятието „фантастика“ няма да съществува, защото всичко онова, което е родило нечие въображение ще се е превърнало в реалност и няма да остане нещо, за което да си кажем, че е недостижима илюзия… Защо не? След като свикнахме с всички изобретения толкова лесно и за толкова кратко ги приехме като нещо нормално, че един дом не би бил такъв без тях, защо да не приемем, че фантастичното е подложено на риск да спре да съществува?Анализатори от “Thomson Reuters” направиха десет прогнози за предстоящите десет години на базата на патенти от цял свят. Експертите правят прогнозата, че технологията в света на биологията ще се промени страшно много и драстично само до 2025-а година, предаде БТА, цитиран от iNews.В периода, който прогнозират, ще е възможно да се декодира индивидуалната ДНК и да се предотвратяват болести, електрическите самолети ще са толкова разпространени, че всички ще се учат да пилотират. Учените определиха 10 най-авангардни области с най-много патенти на изобретения. Анализаторите казват, че не са се допитвали до магическа кристална топка, но са използвали нещо, което може да ѝ съперничи – става въпрос за цитирани научни трудове и патенти.„Като анализирахме настоящата научна и развойна дейност и търговските интереси, ние насочваме прожектора към някои от най-вълнуващите тенденции, които ще се оформят през следващото десетилетие“, каза Базил Мофта от организацията. На първо място учените слагат овладяването на деменцията от болестта на Алцхаймер и други невродегенеративни болести, защото за такива разработки се заделят все повече средства. След това поставят слънчевата енергия, която ще стане най-разпространената и самите къщи и сгради ще бъдат облицовани със соларни панели. На трето място те поставят лечението на диабет от тип 1, който ще бъде преработен благодарение на генното инженерство. Недостиг на храна и колебания в цените на храните казват, че няма да има. Спрямо това ще допринесат генномодифицирани култури, които ще се отглеждат на закрито с най-подходящото за тях осветление. След всичко това ще се усъвършенства електрическият въздушен транспорт благодарение на лекотоварни летателни апарати и нови технологии. Самолетите ще летят на малки разстояния и ще могат да излитат и кацат на много по-малки писти. Предвижда се, че след десет години свидетелствата за пилотиране ще са толкова разпространени, колкото са шофьорските книжки в момента. На шеста позиция анализаторите са определили дигитализирането на света от автомобили по домовете, които откликват на всяко желание, до уреди, които мислят самостоятелно. Дигитализацията ще е повсеместна.Всичко ще е сто процента биоразтворимо на базата на целулозата – това ще е нормата. И до тези десет години, до 2025-а година, ще можем да лекуваме рак без силно токсичните ефекти. Анализирането на ДНК при раждане ще бъде задължителна норма, то ще се прави и при годишния преглед, като по този начин ще се идентифицират заболявания. На десето място, но не по важност, разбира се, попада квантовото телепортиране. Макар и хората още да не могат да се телепортират в космоса, ще се прехвърлят други форми на материя. Ще видим колкото от тези прогнози ще се изпълнят. „Целта ни е да провокираме дебат сред научната общност и по света, като покажем какво се случва с науката“, обясняват авторите пред в. Daily Mail.Няма да се учудя, ако много от нещата действително се реализират, защото вече се носи мълвата сред подбрани хора в Америка, членове на елитни клубове, за разработването на различни продукти. В специална лаборатория, служеща на конкретния клуб, са разработили хапче, което регенерира клетки и органи. По този начин процеса на стареене се забавя и продължителността на живот се удължава. Вече са проведени тестове с животни – плъхове, кучета и котки, като тестовете дават положителни резултати. Например, учените са установили, че поемайки регинериращото хапче редовно, плъховете които са с продължителност на живот средно към шест години, живеят до дванадесет. В теста вече са включени и хора, но за ясен резултат ще е нужен по-дълъг период от време, макар да се твърди, че ако един седемдесет годишен човек, взема хапчето, регенерирането на органите, кожата, зрението и т.н. ще повлияе така, че той не само ще се чувства на четиридесет, но и ще изглежда на толкова. Разбира се, под въпрос стои дали „продукта“, така да го наречем, ще стигне до масовия консуматор, но дори и това да стане, цената му най-вероятно ще бъде подобна на това да си купиш лятна резиденция на луната. И все пак, всичко това дава надеждата, че света и хората ще се развият още и още и може би общото благо не е толкова далеч. За да разберем това със сигурност обаче ще ни се наложи да почакаме, поне още десетилетие… Стелиян Стоименовв.”България СЕГА”'}]"

August 2023, and 57 employees, both union and non-union, will lose their jobs as part of the closure. In addition, the college will lay off five people across three other departments – Administrative Services, English and Creative Writing, and Facilities. The job cuts come as the college tries to reduce the 2022-2023 $20.5 million deficit by a 2026 deadline from the Board of Trustees. “They’re long-time people that have been really hard workers for the college for a long time,” said Joan McGrath, administrative assistant in the Cinema and Television Arts Department and vice president of the United Staff of Columbia College, the union that represents staff employees. “It’s always really sad to see people lose their jobs, and especially people who have been part of the college community for so long.” First established in 1998, Columbia CS brought artists from different disciplines to teach after-school programs at Chicago Public Schools. According to the program website, it serves eight elementary and high schools across the city. Amina Norman-Hawkins, part-time faculty in the music department, began working with Columbia CS as a teaching artist at Jenner Academy of the Arts in Cabrini Green in 2007. In the time since, she has taught poetry and music, served as a program coordinator, and hosted annual student showcases. Norman-Hawkins said it was “empowering” to give kids the chance to “use art as a platform” to discuss what was important to them. The program also provided classes for parents. “When I taught in elementary schools that were really inner city neighborhoods, that in many cases were disenfranchised, I found us really providing not only a service for students, but also for their families,” Norman-Hawkins said. “We were not only engaging the students, but providing resources to families that really needed them.” Losing the program will mean a loss of connection to the wider Chicago community, Hawkins-Norman said. “Maybe the college doesn’t really know how valuable the program was to people,” she said. “To families, to the teaching artists, who worked with students in the classroom, who saw their eyes light up. Students who may start the semester, very quiet and shy and at the end of the semester, they found their voice and found their space.” Craig Sigele, academic manager for the communication department and president of USofCC, said he expected more layoffs than the ones announced on Thursday, Jun. 1. “I’m glad it was a limited number,” he said. “I feel badly for those who were eliminated, and grateful that we have a 90-day clause so these people can try to find new jobs, in a very good job market.” Laid off employees will receive two weeks of severance pay after their jobs officially end at the end of August.

eNewspaper Trending: The owners of Chicago restaurants Smoke Daddy, Frasca, Remington’s, the Perch Kitchen and Tap and others on the North Side are looking to open their first suburban location of Crosby’s Kitchen in Niles, according to the restaurant group. Plans call for the suburban eatery to be located on the site of Wildwood Tavern, which has closed permanently, its owner confirmed last week.Derek Rettell, co-owner of the Four Star Restaurant Group, said he had been eyeing the Wildwood site at 6480 Touhy Avenue for the American grill concept restaurant Crosby’s Kitchen. Rettell is planning major renovations projected to cost $3.5 million. To facilitate the deal, the Niles Village Board at its Oct. 24 meeting approved a tax increment financing deal worth $1.6 million to help cover the costs.The Niles Crosby’s Kitchen and its menu will be based on the original in Lakeview, said Rettell. The original eatery’s menu, which consists of salads, sandwiches, pork chops and ribs, will be bolstered with seafood. The Niles location will have a wood fire grill, which the Lakeview location does not have. Rettell said preparing fish over a wood fire grill is “simply phenomenal, and a flavor you can’t replicate on gas.”The Niles location will also have private dining areas for corporate and personal events. “We don’t have that luxury at the one downtown; it’s just too small,” he said.For the remodel, Rettell is interested in a complete makeover both inside and outside. He plans for an outdoor bar and fireplace and for the inside to have a classic, timeless feel.Mitchell Johnson, communications and multimedia coordinator for the village of Niles, told Pioneer Press that the new restaurant location falls within the Gross Point – Touhy TIF District, informally called the Touhy Triangle. The redevelopment agreement the village made with Rettell’s company provides for up to $1.6 million in “pay as you go” reimbursement from TIF funds.Recently, the village of Niles also entered into a $96 million “pay-as-you-go” TIF deal that the Village Board preliminarily approved on Sept. 26.Niles’ Finance Director John Melaniphy said at that time that TIF agreements, which many municipalities use to redevelop non-performing properties, are based on the principle that a redeveloped property has a higher worth, which will generate more property tax revenue. Melaniphy also explained that the developer has to build or improve the property first before getting reimbursed from TIF funds.Rettell said he decided to apply for TIF funds only after finding out that the restaurant is in a TIF zone.Wildwood Tavern owner and manager Mark Freedman told Pioneer Press in January that he closed Wildwood temporarily to remodel the space.

Restaurants are a risky business, he pointed out, and Four Star Restaurant Group had not yet bought the restaurant from Wildwood. He also pointed out that a business plan from Four Star Restaurant Group was not available on the village website. “You would be laughed out of a bank if you brought this proposal,” said Hanusiak.Hanusiak added that because of the ongoing development in Niles, the village should slow down on their use of TIF, so that schools, libraries and park districts can get more property tax revenue.

That\'s what the lead researcher in Project Censored\'s No. 1 story this year said. He wasn\'t talking about the climate catastrophe. He was talking about so-called ""forever chemicals,"" per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), linked to prostate, kidney and testicular cancer and additional health risks, and the study he led found unsafe levels in rainwater worldwide. Even though this story received some corporate media attention – in USA Today and the Discovery Channel – the starkly shocking bottom line clearly didn\'t come through to the general public. Have you heard it before? Has it been the subject of any conversation you\'ve had? No? Well, that, my friend, is the very essence of what Project Censored\'s signature top 10 list is all about: Exposing the suppression (active or passive) of vitally important information from the public, which renders the public unable to act in the way that a healthy democratic public is supposed to. They\'ve been doing it since Carl Jensen began it with a single college class in 1976, inspired in part by the way the Watergate story got this same sort of treatment until well after the election cycle it was part of. But there\'s a second story intertwined with the forever chemicals\' pervasive presence: the revelation that companies responsible for them have known about their dangers for decades, but kept those dangers hidden – just like fossil fuel companies and climate catastrophe. The intersection of environmental/public health and corporate criminality is typical of how certain longstanding patterns of censored news weave together across the years, even decades, and how the spotlight Project Censored shines on them helps to make sense of much more than the individual stories it highlights, as vitally important as they are in themselves. The themes in the No. 1 story – environmental harm and corporate abuse – so dominate the top 10 story list that they send another message as well, a message about the fundamental mismatch between our needs as a species living on a finite planet and a rapacious economic system conceived in ignorance of that fact. The climate catastrophe is just the most extreme symptom of this mismatch, but it\'s far from the only one. Corporate abuse figures into every story in the list – though sometimes deep in the background, as with their decades-long efforts to destroy unions in story No. 6. Environmental harms \'only\' show up in seven of the 10 stories. There are still other patterns here, to be sure, and I encourage you to look for them yourself because seeing those patterns enriches your understanding of the world as it is, and as it\'s being hidden from you. But this dominant pattern touches us all. The evidence is right there, in the stories themselves. click to enlarge 1. ""Forever chemicals"" in rainwater a global threat Rainwater is ""no longer safe to drink anywhere on Earth,"" Morgan McFall-Johnsen reported in Insider in August 2022, summing up the results of a global study of so-called ""forever chemicals,"" or polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. Researchers from Stockholm University and the Institute of Biogeochemistry and Pollutant Dynamics at ETH Zurich concluded that ""in many areas inhabited by humans,"" PFAS contamination levels in rainwater, surface water and soil ""often greatly exceed"" the strictest international guidelines for acceptable levels of perfluoroalkyl acids. They\'re called ""forever chemicals"" because they take so long to break down, ""allowing them to build up in people, animals, and environments,"" Insider reported. Project Censored notes, ""Prior research has linked these chemicals to prostate, kidney and testicular cancer and additional health risks, including developmental delays in children, decreased fertility in women and men, reduced vaccine efficacy and high cholesterol."" 2. Blurred lines between big tech and big brother ""Google – one of the largest and most influential organizations in the modern world – is filled with ex-CIA agents,"" Alan MacLeod reported for MintPress News in July 2022. ""An inordinate number of these recruits work in highly politically sensitive fields, wielding considerable control over how its products work and what the world sees on its screens and in its search results."" And more broadly, ""a former CIA employee is working in almost every department at Google,"" Project Censored noted. But Google isn\'t alone. Nor is the CIA. ""Former employees of U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies now hold senior positions at Google, Meta, Microsoft and other tech giants,"" Project Censored wrote. A second report focused on employees from Israel\'s Unit 8200, its equivalent of the CIA, which is ""infamous for surveilling the indigenous Palestinian population,"" MacLeod wrote. Using LinkedIn, he identified hundreds of such individuals from both agencies, providing specific information about dozens of them. ""The problem with former CIA agents becoming the arbiters of what is true and what is false and what should be promoted and what should be deleted is that they cut their teeth at a notorious organization whose job it was to inject lies and false information into the public discourse to further the goals of the national security state,"" MacLeod wrote, citing the 1983 testimony of former CIA task force head John Stockwell, author of In Search of Enemies, in which he described the dissemination of propaganda as a ""major function"" of the agency. Reinforcing that concern is big tech\'s history. ""As journalist Nafeez Ahmed\'s investigation found, the CIA and the NSA were bankrolling Stanford Ph.D. student Sergey Brin\'s research – work that would later produce Google,"" MacLeod wrote. ""Not only that but, in Ahmed\'s words, \'senior U.S. intelligence representatives, including a CIA official, oversaw the evolution of Google in this pre-launch phase, all the way until the company was ready to be officially founded.\'"" This fits neatly within the larger framework of Silicon Valley\'s origin as a supplier of defense department technology. 3. Toxic chemicals continue to go unregulated The United States is ""a global laggard in chemical regulation,"" ProPublica reported in December 2022, a result of chemical industry influence and acquiescence by the Environmental Protection Agency over a period of decades, according to reporters Neil Bedi, Sharon Lerner and Kathleen McGrory. A headline example: asbestos, one of the most widely-recognized toxic substances, is still legal in the U.S., more than 30 years after the EPA tried to have it banned. ""Through interviews with environmental experts and analysis of a half-century\'s worth of legislation, lawsuits, EPA documents, oral histories, chemical databases and regulatory records, ProPublica uncovered the longstanding institutional failure to protect Americans from toxic chemicals,"" Project Censored reported. ProPublica identified five main reasons for failure: • The chemical industry helped write the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act. The law ""allowed more than 60,000 chemicals to stay on the market without a review of their health risks"" and required the EPA to always choose the ""least burdensome"" regulations. ""These two words would doom American chemical regulation for decades,"" ProPublica reported. • The EPA lost its resolve. In 1989, after 10 years of work, the EPA was banning asbestos. But companies that used asbestos sued and won in 1991, based on a court ruling that they\'d failed to prove it was the ""least burdensome"" option. However, ""the judge did provide a road map for future bans, which would require the agency to do an analysis of other regulatory options ... to prove they wouldn\'t be adequate,"" but rather than follow through, the EPA simply gave up. • Chemicals are considered innocent until proven guilty. For decades, the U.S. and EU used a ""risk-based"" approach to regulation, requiring the government to prove a chemical poses unreasonable health risks before restricting it, which can take years. In 2007, the EU switched to a ""hazard-based"" approach, putting the burden on companies when there\'s evidence of significant harm. As a result, ProPublica explained, ""the EU has successfully banned or restricted more than 1,000 chemicals."" A similar approach was proposed in the U.S. in 2005 by New Jersey Sen. Frank Lantenberg, but it was soundly defeated. • The EPA mostly regulates chemicals one by one. In 2016, a new law amended the TSCA to cut the ""least burdensome"" language, and created a schedule ""where a small list of high-priority chemicals would be reviewed every few years. The first 10 were selected, including asbestos,"" ProPublica reported. ""The EPA would then have about three years to assess the chemicals and another two years to finalize regulations on them."" But six years later, ""the agency is behind on all such rules. So far, it has only proposed one ban, on asbestos, and the agency told ProPublica it would still be almost a year before that is finalized."" Industry fights the process at every step. • The EPA employs industry-friendly scientists as regulators.

apartment, and the next, Quanishia “Peach” Berry was gone. Their apartment had disappeared into a heap of bricks and steel far below, leaving Lexus Berry running by herself to a stairwell in the teetering building, panicked that she might never see her wife again. “The moment that we hit the door, it started to shake and rattle and literally — it all just happened in the blink of a second — the floors caved in, like collapsed,” Lexus Berry said Wednesday. “So as the floors were falling, and she was falling four stories down, there were still two stories above her falling and two stories falling above me. It was all crumbling.” The six-story building in downtown Davenport partially collapsed just before 5 p.m. Sunday, but it took hours before rescuers found Peach Berry trapped in the rubble and then determined one of her legs would need to be amputated to pull her free. Lexus Berry gave her assent. Doctors removed the leg and rushed her to a hospital, mindful that the remainder of the building could come down at any time. “It’s definitely something that’s like a miracle that she’s here,” Lexus Berry said. “Due to the circumstances, they had to make a judgment call. And that’s the best thing for her, honestly, because she’s still here.” As Peach Berry recovered in the hospital, crews in Davenport puzzled over next steps for the unstable structure, where three residents remained unaccounted for and officials feared at least two of them might be stuck in a mound of debris at the base of the 116-year-old building. Officials have said the building is continuing to shift and they need to bring it down, but they think any effort to find remains in the debris pile could cause the rest of the structure to collapse. More: Mother recalls terrifying phone conversation as daughter\'s Davenport building collapsed Davenport Police Chief Jeff Bladel said there were 53 tenants in the 80-unit building, and now most of them are struggling to find housing and start rebuilding their lives. They have not been allowed into the apartments to retrieve belongings, though crews were able to rescue some pets Tuesday. Toriana Hill and her 3-year-old son Nassir Gladney were among those who sought help Wednesday at a newly opened American Red Cross shelter several miles from the downtown building. They were in their top-floor apartment when their dog, Luna, began barking. Hill heard other booming sounds but figured they were from the busy street below, until neighbors began screaming. She checked the hallway and found the lights were out. Hill picked up her son and fled but debris blocked one staircase, forcing her to find another toward the back of the building. “It was bricks already falling so I’m like, ‘how the hell am I going to do this, how the hell am I going to do this?’” she said. “I just kept running. I kept running until I hit the first floor, and by the time I made it to the door, I don’t know if it was the police officer or the fireman snatched me up, but I was just happy I made it out.” Hill is looking for a new apartment and is hopeful she’ll find something soon. City officials didn’t release new details about its plans for the building Wednesday, but at about 6 p.m. the city released hundreds of pages of documents, including structural engineering reports, violation notices and resident complaints, according to the Quad-City Times. Among the documents was an inspection report by Select Structural Engineering, hired by building owner Andrew Wold to advise on building work, that described patches of brick façade that were separating from the building. The report noted bulging that needed to be secured to “keep the entire face of the building from falling away when the bottom area(s) come loose."" The newspaper also published comments by Ryan Shaffer, a co-owner of a masonry company that was doing work near the now-partially collapsed building. Shaffer said Wold asked him for a quote for work on the building but rejected it as too costly. In part, Shaffer said, the high cost was because of a need to support the building. “I said, ‘If we don’t do it this way exactly, I’m not putting my guys in there. Somebody is going to die,’ ” he said. More: Owner Andrew Wold fined $300 by city after Davenport building collapse Wold released a statement dated Tuesday, his first comments since the partial collapse, saying “our thoughts and prayers are with our tenants"" and that his company, Davenport Hotel, L.L.C., is working with agencies to help them. County records show Davenport Hotel, L.L.C. acquired the building in 2021 in a deal worth $4.2 million. The city later declared the building a nuisance due to numerous solid waste violations, and a judge ordered Wold to pay a $4,500 penalty after he did not appear in court. Tuesday, the city filed a new enforcement action against Wold, saying that he had failed to maintain the property “in a safe, sanitary, and structurally sound condition” before the collapse. The city is seeking a $300 fine. Emails sent to an attorney believed to be representing Wold have not been returned. On Tuesday, city officials said they feared that two residents were stuck inside the rubble and that it was too dangerous to search the debris. Protesters have been pushing to thoroughly search the building and debris before the city moves ahead with plans to demolish the rest of the structure. Officials had planned to begin staging the site for a tear-down as early as Tuesday morning but they delayed their efforts after a woman was found Monday evening. Fire Marshal James Morris said explosives will not be used on the building, which is near other structures and is “unstable and continues to worsen.” He said there will be an investigation into what caused the collapse but that it’s unclear so far whether a criminal investigation is warranted. Soon after the the Davenport Hotel, built in 1907 and listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, partially collapsed, officials said crews escorted 12 people from the building and rescued several others later.'}]"

Trending: Former President Donald Trump is receiving the vast majority of attention from Fox News and the two smaller conservative cable channels, making it vastly more difficult for Gov. Ron DeSantis and the other lagging candidates to get their messages to Republican primary voters.DeSantis, who is running a distant second place to Trump in public opinion polls, is faring even worse in the amount of exposure he’s getting on the cable channels that are a direct pipeline to Republicans.Trump had had more than 6½ times the candidate airtime that DeSantis received on Fox, Newsmax and OAN in June and July. The figures were reported Monday by Media Matters For America, a left-leaning organization that monitors conservative media.“Trump dominated the three networks’ candidate airtime,” Media Matters reported, receiving 32 hours and 28 minutes — more than half the total. DeSantis “garnered a comparatively paltry” four hours and 57 minutes.Overall, Media Matters found, 16 Republican candidates received 63 hours of interview time and live event coverage in June and July on the three right-wing channels.Trump has a commanding polling lead, though not quite as massive as the coverage advantage. He had more than 3½ times the level of support among Republican primary voters than DeSantis on Monday in the RealClearPolitics average of national public opinion polls.Air time on Fox, Newsmax and OAN is a valuable commodity for Republican presidential candidates. Conservative outlets, especially Fox, are a key source of information for Republican primary voters who will determine who their party nominates next year for president.“That does shape the way the viewers see who is a viable candidate,” said Robert Gutsche, an associate professor in the School of Communication and Multimedia Studies at Florida Atlantic University. Gutsche, co-founder of the MediaLab@FAU, wasn’t involved in the Media Matters analysis. On Fox, by far the biggest and most influential of the three channels, Trump commanded the most attention by a wide margin in June and July.The Trump advantage was not nearly as lopsided on Fox as on Newsmax, headquartered in Boca Raton, and OAN, which stands for One America News. The smaller channels have been attempting to attract voters by positioning themselves as more pro-Trump than the much larger Fox.Related Articles Politics | As Trump versus DeSantis contest rages, there’s another big Republican battle — Fox versus Newsmax Politics | Florida poll set out to find how voters get their news.

But lobby groups representing hospitals and nursing homes say they are steadfastly opposed to the legislation, arguing that a nationwide nursing shortage makes it impossible to comply with such a mandate. The proposed Safe Patient Limits Act, by Sen. Celina Villanueva and Rep. Theresa Mah, both Chicago Democrats, was introduced in February and was the subject of a joint hearing last week in Chicago by two House committees. It\'s an issue that has been discussed in the General Assembly since 2019 but has thus far failed to gain the necessary traction for passage. The latest hearing came just three weeks before lawmakers return to the Capitol for their fall veto session, which begins Oct. 24. ""Short staffing isn\'t a mere inconvenience. It\'s a dire issue,"" said Shaba Andrich, vice president of nursing homes for the SEIU Healthcare employee union. ""It\'s predominantly a Black and brown issue. In historically marginalized communities of Chicago, these issues are magnified. These communities that already face systemic under-investment are further deprived of adequate nursing care due to chronic short staffing."" The bill calls for setting a maximum number of patients that could be assigned to a registered nurse in specified situations. For example, in units with critical-care or intensive-care patients, the maximum number of patients per nurse would be just one. In units with pediatric patients, the bill would allow three patients per nurse, and in units with psychiatric patients, the bill would allow four patients per nurse. It also provides some legal protection for nurses, stating that they are to provide their services exclusively in the interest of patients, ""unencumbered by the commercial or revenue-generating priorities"" of a facility that employs registered professional nurses. Andrich, testifying before the committee last week, disputed the notion that there is a nursing shortage in Illinois. He said there is only ""a shortage of caregivers who are refusing to be overworked and undervalued and underpaid,"" and that the result of understaffing has direct consequences for patients. ""Such understaffing isn\'t merely an operational concern. It translates into real world consequences,"" he said. ""Seniors enduring falls, malnutrition, missed medication, avoidable hospitalization and, tragically, avoidable deaths."" Some of those who testified in favor of the bill accused hospitals and nursing homes of being more concerned about labor costs and profit margins than the best interests of patients. ""We need this legislation because hospitals are incentivized to reduce labor costs. This means less staff,"" said Jeanine Johnson, a critical care nurse at Ascension St. Joseph Medical Center in Joliet. ""Hospital executives see budgets and labor costs. Nurses see patients and their lives."" A.J. Wilhelmi, president & CEO of the Illinois Health and Hospital Association, a hospital trade group, said it\'s true that health care providers face significant financial pressures, largely because Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates have not kept pace with the rising cost of health care. But he said contrary to what the unions claimed, there is a significant and growing nursing shortage in Illinois, and the proposed Safe Patient Limits Act would put even more of a financial burden on providers. During his testimony, Wilhelmi cited a state survey into the registered nurse workforce that was conducted by the Illinois Nursing Workforce Center – which is a state agency that works to promote the nursing profession. Of the respondents to that survey, 27 percent indicated an intent to retire within the next five years. The IHA interpreted that and other data in the survey to suggest the state could see a shortage of 14,400 registered nurses by 2025. ""I\'m deeply concerned that many hospitals in the state, particularly safety net hospitals, critical access hospitals, will be unable to absorb the huge cost that ratios would impose,"" he said. ""And given the enormous financial pressures that Illinois hospitals already face, if this bill becomes law, they\'re going to have to make some tough decisions, like cutting back services, closing hundreds of beds, and eliminating jobs. And frankly, some of our hospitals might be forced to close."" Andy Allison, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, the agency that administers the state\'s Medicaid program, suggested that the key to solving the staffing issues in hospitals and nursing homes is to raise wages to make the jobs more attractive. He noted that last year, lawmakers passed a significant overhaul of the way the state reimburses nursing homes through Medicaid, adding roughly $700 million in the form of incentives to increase wages and hire more staff. Before those reforms were adopted, he said, Illinois was home to 46 of the 100 worst-staffed nursing homes in the country. As of March 31, he said, that number had dropped to 14. ""We hope that it becomes zero. We have a way to go,"" he said. ""But in the last five quarters – that is, through March 31 of this year – in that five-quarter period, total nurse staffing hours statewide are up 15 percent.""

Donate today. An explosive first half from NIU football (7-6, 5-3 MAC) helped the Huskies gut out a 21-19 victory over the Arkansas State University Red Wolves (6-7, 4-4 Sun Belt Conference) in the 2023 Camellia Bowl. A high-powered offensive attack in the first half and a shutdown defensive performance in the second half helped the Huskies snap a streak of seven consecutive bowl game losses. Saturday’s Camellia Bowl was the Huskies’ first bowl game victory since the 2012 GoDaddy.Com Bowl over Arkansas State. “We’re certainly excited about the win, it was our first (bowl game) win since 2011,” said NIU football head coach Thomas Hammock. “For these guys to walk off as champions, it’s everything for the seniors and it’s everything for the guys coming back.” The Huskies dominated the time of possession battle, holding the ball for over 40 minutes, while the Red Wolves possessed the ball for less than 20 minutes. NIU converted 9 of its 18 3rd and 4th down attempts, extending drives and burning time off the clock. Redshirt senior quarterback Rocky Lombardi was named the Bart Starr MVP of the Camellia Bowl. Lombardi finished with 200 passing yards, 1 passing touchdown and 1 rushing touchdown. “It means a lot to go out as a winner,” Lombardi said. “We’ve done a lot more winning than losing here – didn’t quite have the season we wanted, but we made it to a bowl game. We’re proud to be here, and we’re proud to be bowl champs.” Junior running back Antario Brown led the Huskie backfield with 25 carries for 132 rushing yards. FRANTIC FIRST HALF In a first half that featured a fake field goal, an onside kick attempt and turnovers from both teams, the Huskies went into the locker room with a 21-13 lead. NIU made a statement on its first drive, converting three third downs and going 75 yards on 11 plays to take a 6-0 lead. Lombardi connected with junior wide receiver Grayson Barnes for an 18-yard touchdown for the first points of the game. “Those plays (third down conversions) were all the quarterback,” Hammock said. “He made plays and delivered the ball in the spots that guys needed to make them.” After a one-play touchdown drive from Arkansas State to take a 7-6 lead, the Huskies answered back immediately with two touchdown drives – one on a fake field goal by redshirt sophomore kicker Kanon Woodill – to regain a 21-7 advantage. “It (Woodill’s touchdown) was more than I expected if I’m being honest,” said junior cornerback Javaughn Byrd. “I saw Kanon hit the hole and then I’m looking at the jumbotron and I see him keep running, so I got excited on the sideline. That was probably the most exciting play I’ve ever seen in my three years here.” SECOND HALF STALEMATE After a back-and-forth first half, the second half was the complete opposite, as the two teams combined for just 6 points in the final 30 minutes. “Credit to the defense, they did a good job helping us (the offense) out in the second half, keeping us out of trouble and obviously holding them under 21 points,” Lombardi said. Byrd, who accounted for the Huskies’ lone takeaway, said the Huskies’ defensive performance in the second half was a reflection of the work they’ve put in all season. “We take pride in going out there and playing together,” Byrd said. “We harp on that in practice all the time, our slogan is one motion. We go out there and communicate, make sure we’re all on the same page, and then our goal is just to dominate between the whistles every play. That second half was a reflection of all that put into one.” From the start of the second half until the final two minutes of the game, no points were scored. The Red Wolves broke through when redshirt sophomore wide receiver Corey Rucker scored his second touchdown of the game with 1:14 left to cut the NIU lead to 21-19. With an opportunity to tie the game with a successful two point conversion, the Huskies stopped Arkansas State’s attempt, holding on for a 21-19 victory. LOOKING FORWARD Hammock said winning the Camellia Bowl is significant for the future of NIU football. “Great momentum,” Hammock said. “We’ll add some pieces to get better, but I love the nucleus of our football team coming back.” Lombardi, who finished his seventh and final season in college football with a bowl win, expressed his gratitude for NIU football. “I try to reflect constantly throughout my career, at least I have the last couple years,” Lombardi said. “It’s definitely been a long one, I’m proud to be a Huskie and I’m happy that I’m here, but I’m ready to move on, it’s my time to be done and to move on.” Byrd said the Huskies will earn their respect no matter where they go or who they play. “As a team, we’re going to come in here and we’re going to earn our respect wherever we go,” Byrd said. “We’re not expected to be handed these things – we’re not expected to be put on these high pedestals.” The Northern Star is the student-produced, independent media at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Illinois, and is a limited public forum whose content is determined exclusively by its student editors.

signed HB 3882 into law, which allows undocumented immigrants the chance to obtain a standardized Illinois Driver’s License. Currently, undocumented immigrants were allowed the Temporary Visitor Driver’s License (TVDL) with a standard 4-year license that serves as a valid form of identification and remains compliant with the federal REAL ID Act. “This legislation is a significant step in eliminating the barriers to opportunity that many undocumented immigrants face,” said Governor JB Pritzker. “We’re ensuring every eligible individual can obtain a driver’s license, making our roads safer, decreasing stigma, and creating more equitable systems for all.” In partnership with Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias and the General Assembly, this legislation was passed to enhance road safety and protect all immigrants that are legally able to drive. Individuals must still pass a driving test, have valid insurance, present identification documents, and prove Illinois residency for at least one year. In 2013, Illinois became one of the first states to implement the TVDL program, and this advancement builds on that progress. More than 300,000 individuals currently have a TVDL. “TVDLs have become the ‘Scarlet Letter’ of an individual’s immigration status and sadly exposes them to discrimination or immigration enforcement,” said Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias. “This legislation allows immigrants to obtain standard driver licenses that will serve as authentic identification in Illinois. It will help prevent the stigma, instances of discrimination, and problems that TVDLs have been known to cause while making roads safer and enabling immigrants to use a standard license as identification for basic necessities like filling prescriptions or renting an apartment.” “This bill, which ICIRR drafted and worked hard to pass, is another step toward full inclusion of immigrants,” said Lawrence Benito, Chief Executive Officer of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. “More immigrants will be able to drive and use a valid identification card without fear of being singled out based on their status. We thank all of the community leaders and government allies who helped get this bill to the finish line.” Illinois has long stood as a safe haven for immigrants, and now joins numerous states with similar processes, including California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Colorado,” said Ricardo Estrada, Chief Executive Officer of Metropolitan Family Services. “Thanks to Representative Barbara Hernandez and members of the general assembly for their sponsorship and thanks to Governor Pritzker for his leadership and for making us all safer today. HB 3882 will be effective on January 1, 2024. Comments are closed.'}]"

Speaking of businesses, Surya acquired Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams—the 34-year-old heritage home brand that redefined American design with its focus on stylish, comfortable and eco-friendly furniture, per a press release posted on Facebook. Surya plans to restart manufacturing and assembly operations at the MG+BW facilities in Taylorsville, North Carolina. Earlier this year, it was reported that Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams—named after the two gay businessmen who founded the firm in 1989 before selling it in 2015—was shutting down all its operations due to a sudden loss of financing. The feminist news/opinion website Jezebel is shutting down after 16 years after its current owner, G/O Media, attempted to sell off the site, The Advocate noted. “We are making the very, very difficult decision to suspend publication of Jezebel,” G/O Media CEO Jim Spanfeller said. “Few decisions over the course of my career have been as excruciating, and I want to make clear this is in NO WAY a reflection on the Jezebel editorial team.

A lot of the alumni of the site now work at those publications.” Movement Advancement Project (MAP) co-founder and Executive Director Ineke Mushovic is stepping down, according to an open letter from Mushovic that is posted on MAP’s website. In part, she said, “After nearly two decades at the helm of MAP, I have made the difficult decision to transition out of my role as Executive Director. I love MAP and I’m profoundly grateful for the chance to make a difference, and most of all for the amazing people and colleagues I’ve had the privilege of getting to know and working alongside.” MAP Deputy Director and LGBTQ Program Director Naomi Goldberg will succeed Mushovic on March 1, 2024. MAP “is an independent, nonprofit think tank that provides rigorous research, insight and communications that help speed equality and opportunity for all,” per its website. Election offices in several key U.S. states have received suspicious letters, some containing the dangerous opioid fentanyl, The Advocate noted. This wave of threats, reported by the AP, has affected states such as Georgia, Nevada, California, Oregon and Washington. A striking detail in some of these letters is the inclusion of the Progress Pride Flag, linking political tensions with LGBTQ+-rights issues. The flag (as well as a pentagram that was included) is sometimes linked to leftist politics but also used by conservative figures to stereotype the left, making the sender’s intentions and political stances unclear. The Campaign for Southern Equality released a memo revealing that almost every state in the South now has a law on the books restricting access to gender-affirming healthcare for transgender youth. Families have reported that pharmacies are refusing to fill prescriptions, even when they can do so legally; providers are terminating care earlier than necessary; and that providers pause provision of care, they often do not resume care, regardless of litigation developments, among other things. A map of where bans have passed and where they are in effect or on hold pending litigation is at http://southernequality.org/styep/. The Trevor Project will no longer be active on X, formerly Twitter, per The Advocate. The organization said it was due to persistent concerns regarding the increase of hate speech and the company’s rollback of protective measures for transgender users. In a farewell statement on the platform, the organization said, in part, that it chose to “close its account on X given the increasing hate & vitriol on the platform targeting the LGBTQ community—the group we exist to serve.

Ruben Gallego has announced he’s running for bisexual U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema’s Senate seat, and he’s raised more funds than she has among Democratic donors, The Advocate noted, citing Politico. (Sinema—who switched from being a Democrat to an independent last year—hasn’t formally announced that she’ll seek reelection, but she has been raising campaign funds.) Sinema, who ran as a progressive, has reportedly disappointed many of her former supporters by being cozy with corporate interests, among other things. Also, if Sinema runs, Republicans fear she’ll take independent and moderate votes from Trump Republican Kari Lake, who has announced her Senate candidacy. The LGBTQ+ Victory Institute will induct former Texas State Rep. Glen Maxey, former Massachusetts state Sen. Jarrett Barrios and California State Senate President pro Tempore Toni Atkins into its LGBTQ+ Political Hall of Fame, a press release announced. The inductions will take place during the 2023 International LGBTQ+ Leaders Conference, which is happening Nov. 30-Dec. 2 at the JW Marriott in D.C. U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Massachusetts) took a firm stand on the House floor against a GOP-led housing appropriations bill that omitted critical support for The Pryde, an LGBTQ+ affordable housing initiative, The Advocate noted. The project had $825,000 in federal funding removed by the GOP majority on the House Appropriations Committee. “I oppose this legislation for the draconian cuts and dangerous provisions included in it,” Pressley said, adding, “It would seem with my colleagues across the aisle that the word freedom is selectively applied.” Philadelphia has become a safe haven for those seeking gender-affirming care, per LGBTQ Nation. Mayor Jim Kenney’s executive order will ban the use of city resources in investigations that would punish anyone seeking gender-affirming care in the city. It also states that if federal or state restrictions are passed regarding gender-affirming care, the city will de-prioritize enforcing these laws. Texas resident Fayaka Dunbar was recently acquitted of murder in the deaths of two drag performers, one a gay man and one a transgender woman, in Fort Worth, per The Advocate, citing the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. The two were shot in their home on Dec. 8, 2017. Jason Bradley, 35, a cisgender gay man who performed in drag as Bianca Davenport (also identified as Bianca Starr), died at the scene; trans woman London Starr, also known as London Watson, was left paralyzed and later passed away. Dunbar’s attorneys claimed the shooting was in self-defense because of a fight over payment for a sex act involving the trio and that he feared he would be killed. In Texas, transgender high-school student Max was awarded the lead role in his school’s production of Oklahoma!—but the role was taken away from him, per The Washington Post. An administrator told Max’s family that he would have to be recast because of a new policy that required Sherman High School students to portray characters that align with their sex assigned at birth, his parents said. Max’s parents and other families with students in the school’s theater program have been pushing for the roles to be restored and for the show to proceed as planned; however, the Sherman Independent School District sent a letter to families and staff saying that the production would be postponed until 2024. Gender-specific policies have affected a number of high school musical productions in states such as Florida, Indiana and New Jersey. More than 16,000 people have signed a petition criticizing the inclusion of LGBTQ+ content in the upcoming Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, according to The Advocate. The petition, launched by One Million Moms, alleges that the parade will display a “non-binary and transgender extravaganza,” potentially exposing viewers to what they call the “liberal LGBTQ agenda.” Tony winner Alex Newell and entertainer Justin David Sullivan—who are both noxnbinary—are slated to perform. In Texas, Sherman High School decided to proceed with its production of Oklahoma! as initially planned before the controversial decision to remove trans student Max Hightower from his role and to adopt a different version, per The Advocate. Trustees at the Sherman Independent School District voted for the superintendent to reverse course over the decision to revoke students’ parts based on their gender. Hightower’s father, Phillip Hightower, told the Dallas Morning News that he was glad about the outcome but added, “There still needs to be accountability.” In Utah, Provo clinical mental-health counselor Scott Dale Owen—who claimed to help counsel gay men—was arrested following a standoff with police after he failed to show up for a scheduled surrender, KSL reported.

Ron DeSantis’ aid again in his lengthy battle with the Walt Disney Co., approving a measure aimed at strengthening his hand in upcoming court hearings. On the eve of the final day of the two-month legislative session, the Florida Senate approved a bill (CS/SB 1604) Thursday intended to nullify development agreements which kept the company in command of its 25,000-acres in Orange and Osceola counties. The House approved the measure a day earlier, 75-34, breaking mostly along party lines. DeSantis signed the bill into law Friday, just hours after the Legislature adjourned the 2023 session. Disney vs. DeSantis timeline: What happened when Florida\'s governor took on the Mouse War of words: Disney accuses DeSantis of \'unconstitutional\' and \'retaliatory\' acts in lawsuit The Senate vote was 27-13 to approve what amounts to DeSantis’ latest swipe at the entertainment giant. Sen. Joe Gruters, R- Sarasota, was the only Senate Republican to vote against the legislation. Gruters chaired former President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign in Florida. DeSantis, who is expected soon to announce his candidacy for the GOP presidential nomination, is badly trailing Trump in most polls. But the governor’s clash with Florida’s biggest private employer has turned into both a political and legal siege, spanning state and federal courts and unfolding over almost a year and a half. The action Thursday came only a day after lawmakers gave final approval to a bill that would allow the state Department of Transportation to inspect Walt Disney World\'s monorail system, singling out the company for an exception to state law which allows Florida\'s largest theme parks to conduct their own safety inspections. The development fight stems from February, when Disney-allied board members on the Reedy Creek Improvement District, a special taxing authority, approved agreements which rendered meaningless an attempt by the governor to take over the district, created in 1967 to give the company broad, self-governing powers. DeSantis was enraged by the company’s opposition last year to a parental rights law limiting discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity, which critics condemned as “Don’t Say Gay.” In a special session of the Legislature earlier this year, DeSantis swung at Disney, getting lawmakers to authorize his recasting of Reedy Creek as the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, with appointees he later named. But Reedy Creek, just before the DeSantis takeover, enacted the development agreements as one of its last acts, keeping Disney in control of its vast holdings. The legislation approved Thursday seeks to scuttle that – allowing the new board of a special district whose membership structure had changed to abolish any development agreement approved by an earlier board in its last three months of existence. Disney has sued the governor in federal court, accusing him of retaliation and violating the company’s free speech rights. The Central Florida Tourism board has fired back with a lawsuit of its own in state court, seeking to “uphold and enforce” its recent action intended to void the agreements made by the earlier board. While the Senate vote came without much discussion, the House a day earlier traded views of the DeSantis-Disney contest. Rep. Anna Eskamani, an Orlando Democrat, dismissed the effort as a fruitless game of “whack-a-Mouse.” But Rep. Will Robinson, R-Bradenton, said there were serious policy matters in play. ""We’re dealing with a lame duck board that is saddling a new board with obligations,” Robinson said. John Kennedy is a reporter in the USA TODAY Network’s Florida Capital Bureau.

Want to purchase today\'s print edition? Here\'s a map of single-copy locations. Sign up for our daily newsletter here By now, we trust you’ve heard that Illinois’ minimum wage is about to go up by a buck an hour and gun owners who don’t register their assault-style rifles by New Year’s will be in violation of state law. But not all of the House and Senate bills autographed by Gov. J.B. Pritzker in 2023 made front-page headlines. Five days before 300-plus measures take effect statewide, here’s our rundown of some of the biggest winners and losers come Jan. 1, 2024. 1. Anyone who’s gone to pick up a prescription, only to be greeted by a “pharmacist is at lunch” sign. When they’re gone, SB 1889 allows for technicians, student pharmacists and other staffers to dispense prescriptions that have been verified by the pharmacist. 2. Top teachers in shorthanded schools. Under HB 3801, “hard-to-staff schools” can award annual retention bonuses of $4,000 to National Board-certified educators. 3. Car shoppers who don’t need a test drive. Starting next week, dealers will be permitted to sell vehicles over the internet (both new and used) — and even deliver them to your residence. 4. Veterans. Those who served can pick up a pet from an animal shelter without paying an adoption fee, under HB 2500. And SB 2005 requires housing authorities to grant preferences for homeless veterans. 5. Italians. The explorer who sailed the Santa Maria may be persona non grata in parts of Illinois, but Christopher Columbus’ homeland has a place: Starting in 2024, October shall be recognized as Italian American Heritage Month statewide. That’s welcome news in St. Joseph, which the U.S. Census Bureau says has the area’s highest rate of Italian ancestry (3.9 percent, beating out Mahomet’s 3.4). 1. Heartless hospitals. Under HB 3955, it will soon be against the law to delay medical care and screening in order to inquire about a patient’s method of payment or insurance status. And under HB 2719, hospitals must screen patients for public financial-assistance eligibility before turning them over to collections. 2. Principals who make like prison wardens. No more solitary confinement for student discipline, punishment, retaliation or any reason other than as “a temporary response to a juvenile’s behavior that poses a serious or immediate risk of physical harm.” 3. Distracted drivers. Come Jan. 1, drivers can no longer be pulled over solely for having fuzzy dice hanging above the dashboard. But they can now be stopped for livestreaming or videoconferencing while driving. 4. Vapers. Illinois becomes the 18th state to ban indoor vaping in public places, with first-offense fines of $100 for e-cigarette smokers and $250 for businesses looking the other way. 5. Protest crashers. The fines start at $500 for anyone who “performs an action with the intent of interfering with, obstructing or impeding a picket or other demonstrations or protests.” More than 300 new laws will take effect Jan. 1, ranging from a ban on book bans to the regulation of “deepfake porn” and prohibitions on videoconferencing while driving.
