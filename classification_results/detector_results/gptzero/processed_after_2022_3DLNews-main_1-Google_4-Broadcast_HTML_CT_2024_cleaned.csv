""And he responded with a grace and warm heart that anyone who knows President Biden would expect. Austin was diagnosed with prostate cancer in early December. He was hospitalized for the procedure on Dec. 22, and the next day he transferred his authority to his deputy, Kathleen Hicks. But neither Biden nor Hicks was aware he was in the hospital, or that he returned on New Year\'s Daywith complications. It was not until several days later that Biden learned he was in the hospital, and another week before the president was made aware of Austin\'s cancer treatment. But Austin did not answer a repeated question about whether any staff members knew of his hospitalization on Dec. 22 and if so, why didn\'t they tell the White House. His chief of staff, Kelly Magsamen, who would normally inform her White House counterpart, was sick with the flu at the time. She was not seated among the staff at the Pentagon on Thursday, though she would normally be in attendance. And another unnamed staff member told a radio dispatcher to send an ambulance to Austin\'s home but to make sure the ambulance did not have its siren or lights on. Austin said Thursday he did not direct his aide to say that. Magsamen has ordered a 30-day review of the communications breakdown. Another review is being carried out by the Pentagon\'s Inspector General. Some Democrats faulted Austin\'s secrecy and Republicans have been particularly critical. Rep. Mike Rogers, an Alabama Republican and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, wrote Austin a letter on Jan. 18, saying Austin promised transparency but failed to answer some of his questions. ""Specifically, I am alarmed you refused to answer whether you instructed your staff to not inform the President of the United States or anyone else of your hospitalization,"" Rogers wrote. ""Unfortunately, this leads me to believe that information is being withheld from Congress. Congress must understand what happened and who made decisions to prevent the disclosure of the whereabouts of a cabinet secretary."" Rogers said he would call a hearing of the full committee on Feb. 14 because of Austin\'s ""unwillingness to provide candid and complete answers."" Austin was dischargedfrom Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Jan. 15. He returned to work at the Pentagon this week. Austin also addressed the recent suicide drone attack by Iranian-backed militias that killed three American soldiers at a remote base in Jordan and wounded dozens more. ""The president will not tolerate attacks on American troops – and neither will I,"" Austin said, reading from prepared remarks. The Pentagon has prepared tiered strikes against militia groups in both Iraq and Syria that have targeted U.S. forces in at least 165 attacks since last fall. Those attacks are expected to begin any day now. Copyright 2024 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Israel, trying to work out terms for Israel to stop its military campaign in Gaza. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANTONY BLINKEN: That offers the prospect of extended calm, hostages out, more assistance in. That would clearly be beneficial to everyone. And I think that offers the best path forward. But there\'s a lot of work to be done to achieve it. MARTIN: The U.S. and Israel have been trading messages with Hamas. It is a slow negotiation, with Qatar passing notes back-and-forth. Qatar says the latest response from Hamas is, quote-unquote, ""positive."" And in Gaza, people in the streets are calling on Israel to accept it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting in non-English language). MARTIN: They\'re chanting, the people want peace right now. INSKEEP: NPR\'s Michele Kelemen is traveling with Secretary Blinken. She\'s in Tel Aviv. Hey there, Michele. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: Is a deal imminent? KELEMEN: Not imminent. You know, it took Hamas well over a week to respond to the latest deal that was on the table. Both Qatar and Egypt have had a tough time getting a timely response, in part because it\'s just hard to communicate with Hamas leaders inside Gaza as Israel continues to pursue them. But the Qataris say that Hamas has now agreed to kind of this framework of a deal. They\'ve offered what some are calling a counterproposal, and now we\'re expecting to see some more negotiations on those details. INSKEEP: OK. What is the framework, so-called? KELEMEN: It would be in phases, basically. The first phase would last about 45 days. That would be a period of calm. Hamas would release women and children and some elderly hostages that they\'ve been holding since October 7, and Israel would release some Palestinian prisoners. Now, Hamas wants prisoners who are serving life sentences in Israel out of jail. They also say they\'ve proposed some numbers, though that ratio of hostages to prisoners seems to be one of those issues that\'s still being negotiated. In other phases of the deal, we might see Israeli troops repositioning and Hamas releasing female soldiers, followed by male soldiers and the bodies of dead hostages. Israel says that Hamas is holding about 31 bodies - 29 of them were taken during the October 7 attack - and it believes that there are still about a hundred hostages taken that day who are still alive. INSKEEP: So negotiation over living hostages, over the bodies of hostages. And aside from that, isn\'t there a big disagreement about the longer term? KELEMEN: Yeah. I mean, Hamas wants a permanent cease-fire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to keep fighting Hamas until Hamas is destroyed. And the U.S. is basically just hoping that if there\'s a pause in fighting that\'s long enough, it could give everyone more room for diplomacy. And there are a lot of big ideas floating around about that, Steve. INSKEEP: OK, big ideas - does this include some path forward for a Palestinian state, a two-state solution? KELEMEN: Yeah, and a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel. Blinken was just in Saudi Arabia, and he says the crown prince is interested in pursuing that, but a couple of things are required first. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BLINKEN: An end to the conflict in Gaza and a clear, credible, time-bound path to the establishment of a Palestinian state. KELEMEN: Now, Prime Minister Netanyahu has repeatedly said he doesn\'t want a two-state solution, but Blinken knows that Israel does want normal ties with the Saudis and needs Arab states to support a postwar Gaza. So he\'ll be talking about all of that here with Netanyahu. INSKEEP: NPR diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen in Tel Aviv. Michele, thanks, as always, for your insights. KELEMEN: Thank you.

U.S. launched airstrikes over the past week in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, the idea was to send a message to another country: Iran. And the message, per the White House, is: rein in your proxy groups — groups that Iran funds, arms or otherwise supports. This prompts questions: is it clear Iran can do that? How much control does Iran have over the so-called ""Axis of Resistance""? Norman Roule — a 34-year veteran of the CIA, and a former mission manager for Iran for the Director of National Intelligence — speaks to All Things Considered host Mary Louise Kelly about these pressing questions. Roule says Iran isn\'t actually seeking to control the proxy groups, and it\'s not reasonable to expect that U.S. strikes will accomplish the goal of getting Iran to rein them in. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Mary Louise Kelly: Understanding there is a range, understanding that the Houthis are not Hezbollah, etc., broadly speaking, how much control does Iran have over its proxies? Norman Roule: Broadly speaking, Iran has sufficient control over its proxies to control or modulate their behavior because it controls their weaponry, their funding and it has significant political relationships with their key leaders. Kelly: And how do we know that? I mean, when the U.S. contends that Iran is providing money and weapons and intelligence, how do they know? Roule: Well, the evidence is significant, and it\'s even open information. We have literally tons of weapons made in Iran captured from boats originating in Iran or weapons that have been fired against U.S. and partner forces with made-in-Tehran nomenclature. These weapons are not available, for the most part, anywhere else in the world. They\'re not available in an open market. Likewise, Iran\'s leaders tout their support for all of the militias. There are frequent visits by militia leaders to visit Iran\'s leaders, and they broadcast these meetings. And last, the militia leaders thank Iran for their support. I suppose I should also add that, periodically, there is evidence that an Iranian is present in various militia meetings. Kelly: What about money trails? Is the CIA doing foreign asset tracking, that type of thing? Roule: The U.S. intelligence community has a robust and generally successful capacity to follow money. But when Iran provides its cash in bags of money delivered via aircraft couriers, that\'s obviously much more difficult to follow. What\'s more easy to understand is when significant sanctions are placed on Iran, we are able to determine — and proxies complain publicly —that their budgets are reduced because of sanctions pressures on Iran. Kelly: Characterize what kind of control Iran has. Like, does Iran control what and where these groups would target? Roule: Well, the control will vary by group and by actor, but I think it\'s important to begin with an understanding that control is not what Iran seeks. Iran seeks the product of militia actions, not the process of controlling them. And Iran\'s limited personnel that it applies to this target abroad means that it can\'t be there day by day. Your listeners may want to think of Iran as an arsonist that then subcontracts out to other arsonists it believes will be ideologically and energetically pursuing Iran\'s goals. And then Iran empowers them with money, political support, weaponry, training and lets them do what they do because their success is Iran\'s success. Loading... Kelly: Can we make this concrete? Is there an example you can think of where Iran told one of these groups, ""Hey, stop, knock it off,"" and they complied? Roule: There is reporting that during the U.S. presence in Iraq, that warnings by the United States, from then-Secretary of Defense Panetta, reduced the number of attacks Iran and its personnel were making against U.S. forces in that country. Kelly: So at the end of the day, these retaliatory strikes by the U.S. — you believe they have the potential of accomplishing the goal that has been laid out of getting Iran to rein in its proxies? Roule: No. And I don\'t think that that\'s something that\'s reasonable to expect. The goals of the strikes conducted by the U.S. will certainly degrade proxy capacity. There\'s no question about that, and that will improve the safety of our personnel in the region. They will, to a limited extent, disrupt proxy activity as proxies leave these areas because they don\'t want to be caught in the attacks. But none of these strikes touch equities important to the leadership of Iran or proxies themselves. Until that is done, you can\'t expect to shift proxy behavior. Kelly: And give us a little bit of a ranking — you know, there\'s Hezbollah; there\'s the Houthis; there\'s Hamas; there\'s groups in Iraq — in terms of which are most closely allied with Tehran. Roule: I\'m not sure that\'s a profitable way of looking at it simply because Iran has supported Sunni as well as Shia actors, the Taliban, al-Qaida — there\'s no question Iran has enabled their operations, but they would have the loosest relationship with Tehran. Lebanese Hezbollah would be the closest to Tehran as a large structure. But there were certainly some elements of the Iraqi militias, of which there are a number, who would be ideologically, of varying degrees, associated with Tehran. And of course, the Houthis would be the most distant.
