(QUEEN CITY NEWS) — It was nearly a year ago that a Dorchester County judge slapped a $11,307.36 sanction on Chief Mark Keel, the head of South Carolina’s top law enforcement agency for a list of discovery abuses arising from his agents’ decision to destroy a hemp farmer’s crop in September 2019. Dorchester County Circuit Court Judge Maite Murphy sanctioned Keel in February 2023 after listening to arguments from the farmer’s attorney that Keel, who heads the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED), kept discovery evidence from the farmer after the farmer sued SLED following the raid. Trent Pendarvis’ attorney, Patrick McLaughlin, told Murphy that SLED failed to disclose records showing what went on between state police agents, the S.C. Department of Agriculture, and the S.C. Attorney General’s Office in the weeks leading up to the raid. McLaughlin argued SLED and Keel failed to turn over documents, failed to disclose all communications and meetings related to the case, and gave incomplete responses to the farmer’s legal team. The judge agreed with McLaughlin, ordering Keel to pay the Florence attorney $11,307.36 for what Murphy described as “intentional, willful, and bad faith conduct,” according to the Feb. 28, 2023, order sanctioning Keel. “I find that Keel’s conduct regarding discovery in this case has been dilatory, prejudicial, willful, intentional and in bad faith and his responses have been false, misleading, and incomplete…Despite the clear and plain language of the rule requiring answers under oath, and the specific requests by the Plaintiff that requirement be complied with, Keel has failed to comply with Rule 33. The Plaintiff has served Keel with four (4) sets of interrogatories. During the hearing, Keel conceded to only producing Rule 33 verifications for two (2): the 2nd and 3rd set of interrogatories.” The judge also noted in her Feb. 28 order that Keel withheld “numerous communications” sent from the agency’s taxpayer-funded email server that contained Pendarvis’ name. “Emails in the record that Keel did not identify or produce, were sent from and to “sled.sc.gov” email addresses. Keel is the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the State of South Carolina. It is inconceivable that Keel does not have the knowledge and capability to execute a keyword/term search of his agency’s digital email archives to identify and obtain every email communication that would be responsive to the Plaintiff’s discovery requests. The record reflects Keel failed to do so,” Murphy wrote in the February 2023 sanctions order. On March 10, 2023, Keel asked Murphy to reconsider her sanctions. On April 5, Murphy issued a two-sentence order denying Keel’s request to reconsider the sanctions imposed against him and SLED. Keel had 30 days to comply with Murphy’s Feb. 28, 2023, order or be held in contempt of it. But at 4:07 p.m. on the final day to respond, Keel and his taxpayer-funded attorney, Andrew Lindemann, filed an appeal of Murphy’s orders with the South Carolina Court of Appeals. Keel’s appeal, among other requests, sought to have his name removed from the sanction order, replacing “Keel” with “SLED.” The S.C. Appeals Court and later the S.C. Supreme Court denied Keel’s request to undo Murphy’s sanction order, including removing his name from the filing. “The timing of the appeal is neither accident nor happenstance,” McLaughlin wrote in a May 8, 2023, motion asking the appeals court to dismiss Keel’s appeal. The farmer’s attorney argued SLED filed the appeal to further delay litigation that’s already spanned three years. “This appeal was intentionally filed right before that deadline for compliance to avoid the Appellant being in contempt of the trial court’s order and subject to further sanctions for that contempt. This appeal was intentionally filed in that improper manner despite this Court having previously instructed in Funny on the proper way to appeal such an order: be found in contempt pursuant to Tucker and appeal the contempt order,” McLaughlin wrote in the May 8 motion. “In a case in which the very order being appealed found Appellant to have engaged in conduct that was dilatory, prejudicial, willful, intentional, false, misleading, incomplete and in bad faith, resulting in clear, convincing and substantial evidence that the Respondent was prejudiced by having to unnecessarily expend substantial time and resources, this improper and frivolous appeal itself warrants sanctions,” McLaughlin wrote. The appeals court ultimately agreed with McLaughlin and handed down an order on July 10, 2023, dismissing Keel’s appeal, finding Murphy’s order “is not immediately appealable,” meaning Keel must first be found in contempt of the order before he could appeal. The appeals court order cited three S.C. Supreme Court cases establishing legal precedence that discovery orders are “interlocutory” and “not immediately appealable.” Keel and Lindemann filed a Writ for Certiorari, asking the S.C. Supreme Court to overturn the appeals court ruling, finding Judge Murphy made multiple errors in her sanctions order and to overturn the sanctions against SLED Chief Mark Keel. On Dec. 13, 2023, the S.C. Supreme Court denied Keel’s request to review his appeal. The case was sent back to Dorchester County and the Murphy sanction order imposed on Keel and SLED was reinstated. That order forced Keel to pay the $11,307.36 sanction and to hand over records withheld from Pendarvis. The S.C. Supreme Court order wasn’t made public until Dec. 27, 2023. The high court agreed with McLaughlin’s initial argument that Keel couldn’t appeal Murphy’s order until – and only until – he was found in contempt of it. Keel and Lindemann filed the appeal just before the deadline which could have placed Keel in contempt. “Petitioner (Keel) seeks a writ of certiorari to review the court of appeals’ dismissal of the underlying order of the circuit court on the ground that the discovery order was not immediately appealable. Because the court of appeals correctly held the discovery order was not immediately appealable, we deny the petition,” the Dec. 13, 2023, Supreme Court order stated. The order was signed by Chief Justice Donald Beatty and four other justices. The justices also ordered Judge Murphy to “amend” her discovery order to allow SLED to keep secret the contents of agents’ personnel files related to the Pendarvis raid – only releasing those records to attorneys in the Pendarvis lawsuit. Most of the information in a personnel file – except for information that would constitute an “unreasonable invasion of personal privacy” (S.C. Code 30-4-40(a)) – of public employees in South Carolina, including law enforcement officers, is a public record under the S.C. Freedom of Information Act. The S.C. Court of Appeals further solidified the public’s right to access law enforcement personnel files in a case titled ‘Burton v. York County Sheriff’s Office’ from 2004. In the Burton case, a newspaper filed a FOIA request for personnel files of a group of deputies suspended without pay, but the sheriff released only the hire date, rank and title, and salaries for each deputy. The court found the sheriff’s office illegally withheld the remainder of the files. The sheriff’s office claimed the information “was of a personal nature and disclosing it would constitute an unreasonable invasion of personal privacy,” according to the appeals court order. The court found the sheriff’s office’s use of the privacy exemption did apply to those law enforcement personnel files. “In the present case, we find the manner in which the employees of the Sheriff’s Department prosecute their duties to be a large and vital public interest that outweighs their desire to remain out of the public eye. The newspaper, in fulfilling its obligation to report on and hold to account those in public service, had a legitimate need to access the records Burton requested. Burton and the newspaper did not seek information regarding the off-duty sexual activities of the deputies involved. Rather, the access to information they sought and the trial court granted was focused on the performance of public duties by the Sheriff and his deputies and the response of the Department to allegations of misconduct by the deputies.” Beatty’s name is signed to the bottom of the Burton v. York opinion, confirming his concurrence with the opinion. However, as Chief Justice of the S.C. Supreme Court, Beatty signed off on the December 2023 order telling Judge Murphy to provide protection to the SLED personnel files, which appears to be in direct conflict with Beatty’s findings in Burton v. York. On Jan. 2, 2024, Queen City News emailed Beatty, asking him to explain the conflict in his two judicial decisions; the latest appearing to hold a SLED agent’s personnel file to a confidentiality provision where the state’s own open records law doesn’t provide any such protection. Beatty did not respond to our request to clarify his judicial positions on law enforcement personnel files. Murphy gave'}]"

passenger began yelling, acting violent to flight attendants, and attempted to open the plane's exit door, according to another passenger onboard. CNN reported Wednesday that an American man bit a female flight attendant, causing the flight to turn back to Tokyo about an hour into the flight. The airline told CNN the flight attendant had minor injuries and that the man was taken into custody by police in Tokyo. After the man was escorted off the plane, the flight took off again on its way to Seattle. KING 5 spoke to a man named Eiji Kawauchi who was on that flight as a passenger. He is an engineer who lives in Tokyo and was on his way to Seattle for a work trip. He said he woke up about an hour into the flight to a man screaming and being violent to a female flight attendant. Kawauchi said flight attendants and passengers eventually got the man to sit back in his seat. But Kawauchi said the man got up again and this time seemed panicked, and that he was trying to open the exit door of the plane. “He screamed ‘Call 911, help me get of off this plane!’” recalled Kawauchi. “And then he tried to open the emergency exit.” Kawauchi said about five passengers helped flight attendant to stop the man from opening the exit door. Kawauchi recalled one “strong American man” who he said was helping the female flight attendant and was keeping the man under control. After this incident, Kawauchi said the flight crew ended up having to use zip ties to restrain the man. Unruly passengers on planes have been more common since the pandemic. Last year in the United States, Federal Aviation Administration data shows there were 2,075 unruly passengers on planes. Dozens of those incidents had to be referred to the FBI. Kawauchi said he is thankful that the flight crew and passengers reacted in a way that kept everyone safe in a frightening situation. “Trying to open the exit gate, that’s pretty terrible, scary,” said Kawauchi.
