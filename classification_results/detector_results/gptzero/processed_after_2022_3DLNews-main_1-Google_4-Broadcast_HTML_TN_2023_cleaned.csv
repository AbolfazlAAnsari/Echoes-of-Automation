Author: Nathaniel Rodriguez This Florida Man tried to evade deputies through unconventional means when they attempted to arrest him for aggravated battery in October, the Polk County Sheriff’s Office said. The sheriff’s office said deputies went looking for Johnny Yates, 41, only to be greeted by a whiteboard with the message “Johnny Yates does NOT live here!” Seems legit, right? Well, the deputies didn’t think so. The sheriff’s office said deputies saw a person leaving the home, who then told them that Yates was inside with several other people. Author: Rachel Tucker Security screeners spotted a scaly surprise while scanning a suitcase at the Tampa International Airport: a 4-foot-long boa constrictor making its way through a x-ray machine. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said security officers found the snake curled up inside a carry-on bag in January. The passenger told officers the boa was her “emotional support pet,” a TSA spokesperson said. The agency checked with her airline, who confirmed the snake would not be allowed on the plane while loose inside a suitcase. Author: Rachel Tucker This Florida Woman was caught on camera emerging from the inside of a couch after a failed attempt to hide from deputies in November. The 39-year-old was wanted on a parole violation for the sale of fentanyl and unlawful use of a two-way communication device, according to the Citrus County Sheriff’s Office. Author: Nathaniel Rodriguez A Florida man discovered an unwelcome guest in his home after an invasive iguana decided to hide out in his toilet. “I don’t know if it was just looking for a spa day or what, but it’s huge,” the man said of the October incident. “I don’t know how it got there.” While he hoped for the iguana to be relocated, it likely wasn’t. Releasing captured iguanas is prohibited, per the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Author: Rachel Tucker This Florida Man led deputies on a chase that ended at their front door. A Columbia County deputy was assisting paramedics with a man “experiencing an altered mental state and possibly under the influence of drugs” in December. According to the sheriff’s office, the patient climbed into the front of the ambulance and sped off. The ambulance eventually drove onto the front lawn of the sheriff’s office operations center, bringing the chase to an end. Deputies didn’t have to go far to book the suspect into jail. Author: The Associated Press Though not about a specific Florida Man, this story concerned the October announcement of the “Florida Man Games,” which is promised to be “the most insane athletic showdown on Earth.” Contests in the inaugural “Florida Man Games” include beer belly wrestling and an “evading arrest” obstacle course. The latter event, according to organizers, will task contestants with outrunning actual police officers while being chased through yards and over fences. The competition is planned for next February in St. Augustine, Florida. Submit Δ Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The show was wonderfully curated, well-executed, and of course star-studded. I listened intently and was moved, frequently to tears (because I\'m a sap), by Prine\'s incomparable melodies and lyrics. But it got me thinking about something else. In the seats to my right were a couple of well-regarded songwriter friends from my generation. To my left were several other friends who are record label executives, managers- industry folks. It was as if the line between art and commerce could be drawn between us with a Ryman pew divider. We were all there because we love songs, and like John Prine, we have devoted our lives to music. Prine’s catalog cut through with straight-forward stories that underscored the need for zoomed-out acknowledgements of commonly felt feelings. With crystal-clear images and a jaunty melodic rapport, he knew how to sketch a thread from human heart to human heart. You can tell Prine’s work is the product of a mind shaped before the tech boom. He didn\'t write his songs wondering if he\'d go viral. He didn\'t have hashtags on his mind. He didn\'t write to a clock or a social media schedule. For those of us in the field today, however, there\'s no mistaking or escaping the brutal metrics of the social media marketplace. Dopamine hit shops like Instagram and TikTok serve up congratulatory likes or affirming shares - the coveted engagement - giving you that sweet, short-lived buzz that makes you think your art is valid. The rules of the almighty algorithms change like the weather, but we are made to feel that our numbers are commensurate with the effort we\'ve put into our art. My fellow independent artists and writers clearly feel beset by these forces, because just recently my community shared and re-shared a moving post by our hero Gretchen Peters, one of Nashville\'s most influential songwriters of the past 30 years. ""The music business has become increasingly, relentlessly demanding of artists,” she wrote. “The pressure to release new ""content"" (not a synonym for art), to churn out singles and albums and videos and reels and posts on a prescribed schedule, often utterly out of sync with the artist\'s internal one, isn\'t producing more or greater art. It\'s just increasing the noise and exhausting the artists.” And we aren\'t making this up. In 2020, Daniel Ek, the CEO and co-founder of Spotify outraged the creative community by telling Music Ally that recording artists ""can’t record music once every three to four years and think that’s going to be enough...The artists today that are making it realize that it’s about creating a continuous engagement with their fans. It is about putting the work in, about the storytelling around the album, and about keeping a continuous dialogue with your fans.” It does not feel good to have the man who controls our puny royalties from streaming tell us to make up the difference with volume. Gretchen seemed to rebut this directly in her statement: “We need better songs, not more of them,” she wrote. “We need artists who want to make art that lasts, not content that’s digested in the time it takes to scroll through your Instagram feed.” It\'s not as if I\'m unwilling to change and adapt. During the pandemic, I went to grad school to study songwriting and production at the Berklee College of Music. It was riveting to be back in school, mid-career, alongside writers and artists who grew up with YouTube and digital audio workstations (DAWs) on their iPads. I taught myself to use Logic (one of those DAWs) in 2017 - at 35 years old - when I wanted to make a record and didn’t have enough money. I’d always obsessed over melody and lyrics; many in my cohort had obsessed over plug-ins (audio effects), signal chains, and social media. We learned a lot from each other. Now, back in the clamoring chaos of the music business, I feel the relentless pressure to be everything all at once - the artist, the personality, the story, the writer, the language puzzle-solver, the melodic hook-maker, and the translator of meaningful things. At the same time, artists are expected to be entrepreneurs, marketers, merch sellers, travel planners, project managers. Sometimes we’re also the producer, engineer, video editor, tour manager, driver, graphic designer, and social media manager. Amid all this, how do we allow ourselves the space and time to focus on the actual work? I remember walking out of a co-write with Maia Sharp recently. We laughed at the punchy directives we know we’re up against. “Be good at everything.” “Feed the algorithm.” “Always be creating content.” Yet, this was my third 3-4 hour writing session with Maia over the course of a month, and all that time was devoted to one song. Because we wanted to get it exactly right. Because we both think it’s good and the work deserves and needs the time. The listener deserves the attention. I don’t know if it’ll trend. It’s about being human. Is that enough? At the forefront of our minds is the work itself; in the back of our minds is the temptation to compromise for the sake of fulfilling manufactured obligations that muddy the creative waters. Would I compromise if John Prine were in the room? At the Ryman, a wave of fear came over me as the stellar performances shepherded us through his life’s work, three minutes at a time. The gulf between Prine’s “gold standard” and the content machine could grow ever-wider if we allow benchmarks of quality to be redefined by fleeting commercial marketing ploys. It takes discipline and even courage to put the art first these days. But consider what we stand to lose if we don’t.'}]"

In a letter released Friday, the DOJ instructed state and Shelby County officials to stop enforcing Tennessee’s so-called aggravated prostitution statute. Advocacy organizations prompted the DOJ's investigation after filing a complaint last year. Federal prosecutors contend an aggravated prostitution charge unlawfully singles out HIV positive individuals for harsher penalties by raising a standard prostitution conviction from a misdemeanor to a felony and requiring sex offender registration. According to the DOJ, this is discriminatory treatment under the American with Disabilities Act, which protects people living with HIV or AIDS. “The aggravated prostitution statute does not require any individualized determinations. It is a blanket criminalization of people living with HIV, which is not grounded in current medical knowledge,” reads the letter the DOJ sent to officials, including Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti and Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy. Shelby County is specifically named because of its high number of aggravated prostitution prosecutions. According to a 2022 report from the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, nearly 75 percent of those listed on Tennessee’s sex offender registry for an aggravation prostitution conviction reside in the county. The DOJ says the law is outdated because of medical advances in treating the disease, noting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say “people living with HIV who are on treatment and have undetectable viral loads have effectively no risk of transmitting the virus to sexual partners.” The policy further stigmatizes individuals by forcing them to register as sex offenders, the DOJ outlines in the letter. The sex offender label limits where someone can work, live and even their ability to be around family members. In addition to directing Tennessee officials to cease enforcing the law, the DOJ also tells them to expunge the records of those with a past conviction. Failure to take action could result in a lawsuit, the department said. In a statement, Mulroy’s office said that DOJ’s findings predate him taking office but that he intends to fully cooperate with the department. Brandon James Smith, the chief of staff for Skrmetti, said his office would give the findings “appropriate consideration.” He added in a statement that the office looks forward “to finding out more about DOJ’s apparent cooperation with local activist organizations and private litigants related to this matter.” Aggravated prostitution came about in 1991 as lawmakers across the country scrambled for ways to curb the spread of the often misunderstood disease even as health advocates warned it would discourage testing. The state also passed a criminal exposure law in 1994 that makes it a felony for anyone not to disclose an HIV diagnosis to a sexual partner. (The legislature voted last year to end the sex offender registry requirement for an exposure conviction). The DOJ makes no mention of Tennessee’s exposure law. Still, advocates count the determination that the aggravated prostitution policy is discriminatory as a significant win. S. Mandisa Moore-O'Neal with the Center for HIV Law and Policy, the primary group behind the original complaint, said the news will help not only people in Tennessee but groups across the country who are trying to challenge their states' own so-called HIV criminalization laws. “In a moment where many state budgets are already tight, the possibility of new and often costly litigation may be the impetus to change these laws,” she said. Thirty-five states have some sort of HIV-specific criminal law and at least 12 have either modernized or repealed their statues in the last decade, according to the CDC.""}]"

Around 6 p.m. on Saturday, officers responded to the house in the 400 block of E. Oldham Avenue for a report of a shooting with a victim. The officer found a man who had been shot at least once. The victim was pronounced dead as a result of his injuries. According to KPD, Stefen White, 34 of Knoxville, has been charged with second-degree murder. He has since been booked into the Roger D.
