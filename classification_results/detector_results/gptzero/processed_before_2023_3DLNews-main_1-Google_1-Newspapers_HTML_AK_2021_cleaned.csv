The largest snowfall since March 2008 brought out the snowplows and shovels, and prompted the closures of the Gateway Recreation Center, Ketchikan Public Library and the Berth 3 COVID-19 drive-up testing center.

There should be conversations about decision-making on the part of not only pilots, but also within the management structures of those who employ them. Through all of its name changes and ownership upheavals, the most appalling constant in Ravn’s operation is that its planes have crashed. The FAA believes that even with devastating crash statistics, Alaska’s small population just does not and will not warrant the same degree of funding as the Lower 48. Between 2002 and 2019, at least 131 commercial aircraft accidents in Alaska involved Medallion star and shield recipients. The crashes raise questions about whether Medallion standards meant to reward safe air operators are meaningful. Watching the debate over President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee is infuriating because I know that my family's health care is at risk. Close review of Togiak, other recent crashes could reveal flaws in current programs. Although the number of accidents has been reduced, the Medallion Foundation’s programs have yet to fully solve problems plaguing Alaska aviation. Over the past few years the annual Valdez Fly-In has gone from being a popular statewide exhibition to an internet phenomena. Social media has helped spread the word of the impressive STOL (short takeoff and landing) competition and online videos have made stars out of both the pilot and aircraft participants. The event’s popularity led … Continue reading What brings pilots to Valdez? A new video offers some clues Shortly after noon on Aug. 19, 1929, a 6-year old girl watched an airplane fly low past her home near Wellton, Arizona.

The Lounge held a soft opening last week and will host members of the Palmer City Council for a ribbon cutting ceremony on Friday August 6. The Connoisseur Lounge is located directly across Evergreen Avenue from City Hall. “Being across from city hall too, I mean that speaks volumes as to the professionalism and kind of the way that we carry ourselves and we’ve been really well accepted in that regard because we’re very transparent and we want to play by the rules and come to the town of Palmer with respect and gratitude for them allowing us to be here,” said General Manager Katie Thomas. Thomas is a veteran of the cannabis industry, starting her career as a budtender for then medicinal marijuana in Colorado in 2012 and continuing to work at local dispensaries recently. Thomas teamed up with Connoisseur cultivation owners Matt Chambers and Trisha Torborg, a facility in Wasilla that was established in 2015. Just seven days after city of Palmer voters passed Proposition 1 by just 36 votes making marijuana businesses legal within city limits, Chambers and Thomas had a lease signed on the building they currently occupy. “July 22nd is when we got our inspection, June 23 is when we became in pending status and then with the inspection right after that itwas like from 0 to 100 because we were waiting for so so long and they gave us the go ahead and we kind of just opened our doors the next day because we had been waiting for so long,” said Thomas. Since marijuana became legal, more than two dozen cannabis businesses have sprung up in the Mat-Su Valley. Following the passage of Proposition 1, the Palmer City Council passed a pair of marijuana business regulations by 4-3 votes in May. “We want to be an asset to this community. We don’t want to be a hindrance, we want to be proactive on all fronts. That part of the reason why we’re going to be joining the chamber of commerce, we want to be involved as a team and do what we can keep this town great because this town for me is the last jewel of the Valley,” said Chambers. Chambers is a former construction industry employee who got into cannabis cultivation with Connoisseur in 2015, but had long been a proponent of its medicinal benefits. Chambers said that he made a believer out of his own father after using marijuana products to deal with his own pain. The small indoor space inside the Connoisseur Lounge is centered around a large glass case, displaying the various strains for sale. The display case resembles a jewelry display case and features faux jewels within the display. Thomas said that she hopes to provide “diamonds of the market” to customers in the luxuriously designed interior. “We want someone who would normally shop at a boutique or the older woman to be welcome in here and to feel drawn to come in here maybe because of the vibe or because they aren’t getting that expectation that they already know everything about cannabis.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 8:08 am Kelly Tshibaka is challenging incumbent Lisa Murkowski in the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate. The candidate sat down for an interview last week at the News-Miner, where she talked about the energy industry, her Trump endorsement and Alaska\'s future. Kelly Tshibaka wants Alaskans to know that she is a lot like them. The daughter of working-class parents who “fought their way out of poverty,” Tshibaka fished and four-wheeled with her dad, played ice hockey as a teen but then left Alaska for college and work, only to return to her home state. Now Tshibaka — who never before held elective office — has emerged as an up-and-coming challenger to incumbent Lisa Murkowski for U.S. Senate. “This is the race to watch in the next election cycle,” said Cynthia Henry, a Republican National Committee member active in the Alaska Republican party, which has formally backed Tshibaka’s candidacy, energizing the campaign. “Kelly Tshibaka is an impressive candidate who has strong support from Alaska conservatives,” said Henry, who is not personally endorsing either candidate. Tshibaka, a Harvard-trained lawyer who worked in Washington, D.C., for 16 years, is emphasizing her federal experience as well as her Alaska childhood and humble beginnings as central to her campaign. “I know how to make the government work for the people,” Tshibaka told the News-Miner. Tshibaka most recently led the Alaska Department of Administration for two years, resigning in 2021 to run full time for the U.S. Senate. Prior to moving back to Alaska in 2019, Tshibaka was the chief data officer for the inspector general of the U.S. Postal Service under Presidents Trump and Obama. She also served as acting inspector general for the Federal Trade Commission, counsel to the inspector general in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and in the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Justice. ‘I owe everything to this state’ Tshibaka’s primary bid is likely to be determined by how well she connects with voters in a state where the name Murkowski is synonymous with Republican politics. “I am only sitting here before you today as a candidate for the U.S. Senate, because my mom got an oil job,” Tshibaka said during a campaign stop in Fairbanks last week. “I owe everything to this state. “Lisa Murkowski owes everything to her dad,” Tshibaka continued, contrasting her own background with the incumbent’s during a 30-minute interview with the News-Miner. “My dad was not governor or senator,” Tshibaka said. “My dad was a maintenance guy at a telephone company. He is like so many other Alaskan dads.” Murkowski’s popularity with voters has withstood the test of time. She is the second most senior Republican woman in the U.S. Senate, where she has served since 2002. Murkowski initially filled her father’s unexpired seat in the U.S. Senate, where he served for two decades. When Frank Murkowski resigned to become Alaska governor, he appointed his daughter, then Alaska House majority leader, as his successor. Lisa Murkowski has won the U.S. Senate seat ever since. Early endorsement by Trump The 2022 Republican primary is shaping up like no other. Murkowski has yet to formally announce her candidacy, though she has a campaign committee that is raising money and support. Tshibaka’s campaign bid received an early endorsement from the Alaska Republican Party, followed by a personal endorsement from former President Donald Trump. Trump, who won Alaska in two presidential elections, backed Tshibaka in June, after meeting with her at Trump Tower in New York City. “Most of the conversation we had centered on his concern for Alaska and our projects,” Tshibaka said. “He was very concerned about our workers and our economy.” The Last Frontier has become a battleground for the continuing power and influence of Trump in Republican politics. He has not ruled out another run for president. Trump already vowed to defeat Murkowski for voting to impeach him after the Jan. 6 riot at the nation’s Capitol. The Alaska GOP censured Murkowski for the vote. “The party does not want Lisa Murkowski to be a Republican candidate,” Tuckerman Babcock, the former state party chair said, according to media reports. In Alaska, it’s jobs and the economy Tshibaka is framing her U.S. Senate bid as a David vs. Goliath battle. She quit her position as Alaska administration commissioner to campaign full time and tell her story as a “daughter of Alaska.” Her parents’ history included a period of hardship when they made a campsite their home, later moving to a trailer park and then to a starter home in Wasilla, as they secured stable employment. “The tent situation … that ended up being a homelessness situation for them because they thought it was short-term camping, but it ended up being a long-term problem that they couldn’t get out of,” Tshibaka said. “They had to fight their way into working class Alaska.” Her mom worked in Prudhoe Bay as the Alaska pipeline was built, and her father, a Vietnam war veteran, landed a maintenance job that he held until retirement. “My family’s story is an every Alaskan story,” Tshibaka said. “We understand how hard it is to be here, what it’s like to live here, and how critical [natural resource] jobs are to Alaska families.” Tshibaka is campaigning hard on building jobs and the economy, as Alaska confronts challenges that include a long-term decline in oil production and a net out-migration of working-age adults seeking better opportunities in the Lower 48. ‘Where did these regulations come from?’ Tshibaka says her focus is on expanding the economy and setting limits on government. “I grew up playing ice hockey,” she said, comparing the referees to government’s role. “The refs are necessary to call the fouls, regulate the play and make sure the games are fair. ""The problem we have now is that there are 200 refs on the rink, not two, and we here in Alaska just want to play the game. But we can’t,"" she said. ""They have the sticks. They are all over our puck. And we are trying to find out: Where did these regulations come from? Why are you all up in our business? We remember when we could play the game.” Tshibaka said she wants to bring Alaska back into the game as a competitor with strengths found nowhere else in the U.S. She envisions an economic future for Alaska focused on information technology and global security. Her ideas span the potential for developing large-scale cloud computing storage, which requires a cold, secure environment; building a federal intelligence community with a “second Pentagon” in Alaska; and expanding state mining operations for the metals that power smart technologies. Tshibaka has ideas for Interior Alaska. “I see incredible value in the geopolitical location,” she said referring to her own expertise working in national security. “We have underutilized that resource location for the intelligence community,” she said, noting the capacity, knowledge and support already in place at Interior military bases and at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ‘Energy-annihilating agenda’ Tshibaka is not giving up either on fossil fuels, saying that the U.S. handles production in a more environmentally safe and responsible way than most other nations. Tshibaka objected to Murkowski’s vote to confirm Deb Haaland as Secretary of the Interior, which she said enabled the Biden administration’s “energy-annihilating agenda and just kills oil and gas jobs across the state.” She criticized Murkowski for voting to impeach Trump, opposing Brett Kavanaugh for the U.S. Supreme Court and supporting the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. But Murkowski’s support for Haaland as Interior Secretary felt personal to Tshibaka, who said she screamed at the television when she heard the news. “She was the deciding vote to pass for Deb Haaland, who has a track record of opposing fossil fuel development in America,” Tshibaka said, “and we have seen that play out.” The decision hit home for Tshibaka. “That was my mom’s job. That was the difference in [my parents] getting out of poverty and making it into the working class,” Tshibaka said. “Those jobs represent a lot of Alaskans’ jobs and a lot of American dreams for Alaskans.” Contact Linda F.

Please give us a call at 907-561-7737 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Service | Privacy Policy WASHINGTON (AP) — When Republican Rep. Bill Posey of Florida ended an Oct. 21 House floor speech with a fist pump and the phrase “Let’s go, Brandon!” it may have seemed cryptic and weird to many who were listening. But the phrase was already growing in right-wing circles, and now the seemingly upbeat sentiment — actually a stand-in for swearing at Joe Biden — is everywhere. South Carolina Republican Jeff Duncan wore a “Let’s Go Brandon” face mask at the Capitol last week. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz posed with a “Let’s Go Brandon” sign at the World Series. Sen. Mitch McConnell’s press secretary retweeted a photo of the phrase on a construction sign in Virginia. The line has become conservative code for something far more vulgar: “Fuck Joe Biden.” It’s all the rage among Republicans wanting to prove their conservative credentials, a not-so-secret handshake that signals they’re in sync with the party’s base. Americans are accustomed to their leaders being publicly jeered, and former President Donald Trump’s often-coarse language seemed to expand the boundaries of what counts as normal political speech. But how did Republicans settle on the Brandon phrase as a G-rated substitute for its more vulgar three-word cousin? It started at an Oct. 2 NASCAR race at the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. Brandon Brown, a 28-year-old driver, had won his first Xfinity Series and was being interviewed by an NBC Sports reporter. The crowd behind him was chanting something at first difficult to make out. The reporter suggested they were chanting “Let’s go, Brandon” to cheer the driver. But it became increasingly clear they were saying: “Fuck Joe Biden.” NASCAR and NBC have since taken steps to limit “ambient crowd noise” during interviews, but it was too late — the phrase already had taken off. When the president visited a construction site in suburban Chicago a few weeks ago to promote his vaccinate-or-test mandate, protesters deployed both three-word phrases. This past week, Biden’s motorcade was driving past a “Let’s Go Brandon” banner as the president passed through Plainfield, New Jersey. And a group chanted “Let’s go, Brandon” outside a Virginia park on Monday when Biden made an appearance on behalf of the Democratic candidate for governor, Terry McAuliffe. Two protesters dropped the euphemism entirely, holding up hand-drawn signs with the profanity. On Friday morning on a Southwest flight from Houston to Albuquerque, the pilot signed off his greeting over the public address system with the phrase, to audible gasps from some passengers. Southwest said in a statement that the airline “takes pride in providing a welcoming, comfortable, and respectful environment” and that “behavior from any individual that is divisive or offensive is not condoned.” Veteran GOP ad maker Jim Innocenzi had no qualms about the coded crudity, calling it “hilarious.” “Unless you are living in a cave, you know what it means,” he said. “But it’s done with a little bit of a class. And if you object and are taking it too seriously, go away.” America’s presidents have endured meanness for centuries; Grover Cleveland faced chants of “Ma, Ma Where’s my Pa?” in the 1880s over rumors he’d fathered an illegitimate child. Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson were the subject of poems that leaned into racist tropes and allegations of bigamy. “We have a sense of the dignity of the office of president that has consistently been violated to our horror over the course of American history,” said Cal Jillson, a politics expert and professor in the political science department at Southern Methodist University. “We never fail to be horrified by some new outrage.” There were plenty of old outrages. “Fuck Trump” graffiti still marks many an overpass in Washington, D.C. George W. Bush had a shoe thrown in his face. Bill Clinton was criticized with such fervor that his most vocal critics were labeled the “Clinton crazies.” The biggest difference, though, between the sentiments hurled at the Grover Clevelands of yore and modern politicians is the amplification they get on social media. “Before the expansion of social media a few years ago, there wasn’t an easily accessible public forum to shout your nastiest and darkest public opinions,” said Matthew Delmont, a history professor at Dartmouth College. Even the racism and vitriol to which former President Barack Obama was subjected was tempered in part because Twitter was relatively new. There was no TikTok. As for Facebook, leaked company documents have recently revealed how the platform increasingly ignored hate speech and misinformation and allowed it to proliferate. A portion of the U.S. was already angry well before the Brandon moment, believing the 2020 presidential election was rigged despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary, which has stood the test of recounts and court cases. But anger has now moved beyond die-hard Trump supporters, said Stanley Renshon, a political scientist and psychoanalyst at the City University of New York. He cited the Afghanistan withdrawal, the southern border situation and rancorous school board debates as situations in which increasing numbers who were not vocally anti-Biden now feel that “how American institutions are telling the American public what they clearly see and understand to be true, is in fact not true.” Trump hasn’t missed the moment. His Save America PAC now sells a $45 T-shirt featuring “Let’s go Brandon” above an American flag. One message to supporters reads, “#FJB or LET’S GO BRANDON? Either way, President Trump wants YOU to have our ICONIC new shirt.” Separately, T-shirts are popping up in storefronts with the slogan and the NASCAR logo. And as for the real Brandon, things haven’t been so great. He drives for a short-staffed, underfunded team owned by his father. And while that win — his first career victory — was huge for him, the team has long struggled for sponsorship and existing partners have not been marketing the driver since the slogan.

Saturday, May 22, 2021. Mount Eyak is visible in the background. (Emily Mesner / ADN) A COVID-19 outbreak in the Prince William Sound community of Cordova among dozens of seafood workers and community members has shuttered a processing plant and triggered a mask mandate for city workers. The city with just over 2,800 residents is reporting almost 60 active cases, including workers at the Camtu’s Alaska Wild Seafoods plant, temporarily shut down during a lucrative salmon fishing opener this week. City leaders say Cordova’s example is an unfortunate lesson in the latest chapter of coronavirus, in which an infectious new variant is preying on people who choose not to get vaccinated. “I think the piece most people aren’t considering is this is not the same virus,” said city manager Helen Howarth. “It’s the same named virus on one level but it is not the same virus. And we all need to be very careful. It’s coming back at you again.” The city implemented a mask mandate for employees this week. Several seafood plants in Cordova employ hundreds of people. The new cases prompted fish processors in town to shift back to a closed campus for non-resident workers. The outbreak did not begin at the Alaska Wild Seafoods plant but was evidently spread to employees through local contact, according to a city statement. All Alaska Wild Seafoods workers quarantine for two weeks if they come from outside the community, officials say. But unlike others in town, the plant is not requiring workers to get vaccinated. Thirty-five of the plant’s 45 employees are fully vaccinated, according to information provided Thursday by Alaska Wild Seafoods president and CEO Camtu Ho. “We cannot push the vaccine 100%,” Ho said. “You cannot do anything if they say no, or please, I don’t want to do vaccination. We cannot do it that way.” Nearly half of the vaccinated workers tested positive for the virus, she said, along with additional unvaccinated workers. Most had few if any symptoms. Only one worker sought medical care, at her urging, because he’s older. Her workers are paying the price for people in the community who choose not to wear masks or follow other protocols, leading to community spread, Ho said. “It’s really hard for us.” Fishermen deliver salmon to the F/V Kelly Ann, tendering for Camtu's Alaska Wild Seafoods, before heading back to Cordova on Thursday, May 20, 2021. (Emily Mesner / ADN) Cordova is one of several areas in the state where COVID-19 cases are climbing. State health officials link the increase in cases to the more transmissible delta variant of the virus that causes COVID-19. Hospitalizations are increasing, too, from 10 or 15 patients at one time around the state last month to 72 as of Thursday, state data shows. Multiple hospitals in Anchorage were diverting patients last weekend due to high volumes of both COVID and non-COVID patients. The state reported “notable” case increases in Anchorage, Sitka, Kenai Peninsula Borough, Chugach Census Area, Juneau, Fairbanks North Star Borough, Matanuska-Susitna Borough and Kodiak Island Borough. [Sitka grapples with spread of COVID-19 as Alaska sees continued rise in cases] The return of the virus in Cordova took people by surprise, Howarth said. Vaccinated people who contract it don’t usually know they’ve got COVID-19 — health experts say the vaccines minimize the severity of most illness — but they can spread it. Unvaccinated people started showing up at the medical center. “By the time people started presenting with symptoms, obviously, it had taken off,” she said. As of Thursday, there were 58 people with active COVID-19 infections in town, down from 70 earlier in the week, according to the city’s dashboard. Last summer at this time, before vaccine became available, Alaska’s waterfront communities weathered the coronavirus pandemic with closed campuses at seafood processing plants and strict policies for workers. Still, the virus crept in. Some of the state’s largest outbreaks centered on seafood processing, especially as community spread grew, infecting residents who worked in the plants. This summer, with broad vaccine availability, was supposed to be different. Alaska officials announced in February they would give seafood industry workers from other states equal access to COVID-19 vaccines, a policy shift made in the aftermath of the outbreaks that flared in plants and offshore processing ships. The plants that vaccinated all of their employees are doing fine, Howarth said. “The plant that didn’t have 100% vaccinated is not doing well.” All of the employees at Trident Seafoods, which hires up to 500 people at two Cordova plants, are vaccinated, according to Trident spokesman Shannon Carroll. The company requires it. OBI Seafoods, with 223 employees, also has a 100% vaccination rate at the Cordova plant, according to an email from spokeswoman Julianne Curry. Ho said her workers at Alaska Wild Seafoods feel well enough that they keep calling, asking when they can come back. She said the plant hopes to reopen next week. “We are losing money ... but we are caught,” she said. “We want to make sure we do the right thing.” Zaz Hollander is a veteran journalist based in the Mat-Su and is currently an ADN local news editor and reporter.
