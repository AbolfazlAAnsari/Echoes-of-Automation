Thanks for liking this song! We have added it to a personal playlist for you. by Ali Elabbady December 11, 2023 Some albums start off with a bang. Sufjan Stevens’ 10th album, Javelin, begins with a mournful sendoff. Wistfulness sets in almost immediately on “Goodbye Evergreen,” and the waves of loss and grief continue throughout. The album arrived shortly after fans received the heavy news of Stevens’ bout with Guillain-Barre Syndrome, as well as the passing of his life partner Evans Richardson (which occurred in April of 2023). For long-time listeners, these details are significant on a human level, but his personal life is far from the only lens that serves Javelin’s material. Over his career, Stevens has shown his brilliance by shaping his own difficult emotions into art that provides more-universal guidance through those feelings. Javelin isn’t any one mood, though. It also revisits memories of joyful times with the straightforward lyrics of “My Little Red Fox,” and “Running Start.” Like a groundswell of emotional support, small choir of femme vocalists bring these genuine reflections to life. It’s a comforting entrance into the unknown world of what’s left and what happens next after a permanent, untimely ending. Stevens reflects on conflict during the album’s title track, and “So You Are Tired,” when love doesn’t feel so new, and certain actions start to feel out of place. “S**t Talk,” with incredible guitar work courtesy of Bryce Dessner of the National, ruminates on things left unsaid or undone, and seeks to not hold grudges, or leave anger to linger. The moments of the unknown yearning and longing are delivered in “Will Anybody Ever Love Me?” – arguably one of Stevens’ most emotionally affecting songs in a catalog loaded with them. “Genuflecting Ghost” is steeped in tribute and memory, standing as a testament to those one has lost. Throughout, Stevens moves through emotions and memories with an astute awareness, backed by arrangements that twinkle with each strum of guitar strings. The songs swell slowly to emotional climaxes, as if each one is a proper welcome or farewell to each lingering thought. Sonically, Javelin has lots of reminders along the way of what has made listening to every release in his discography a wonder-filled experience. Borrowing a line from author Flannery O’Connor, Javelin reminds the listener gently, “everything that rises must converge.” And reverberations of his past work converge beautifully here. Direct and earnest as ever, Javelin evokes the intimacy of Seven Swans, Carrie & Lowell, and the multi-volumed Convocations. Stevens is able to pull the listener into different worlds here. However, the synth work echoes the electronic maximalism exercised on The Age of Adz and The Ascension, and helps certain songs reach their emotional crescendos without overpowering the album’s intent. Javelin provides a listener with the best of each stage of Sufjan Stevens’ evolution as a singer/songwriter. Even in the midst of great personal struggle, it has him operating at the peak of his artistic powers.'}]"

Grossberg served as head of booking guests on recently fired Fox News host Tucker Carlson’s weeknight prime-time show. Prior to that, she was a producer for Fox host Maria Bartiromo’s Sunday morning show. She was fired after filing her litigation on March 20 in federal court in Manhattan. Fox said her legal claims were “riddled with false allegations against Fox and our employees.” In seeking unspecified monetary damages, Grossberg claimed she was subjected to a hostile and discriminatory work environment. She accused Fox of defamation, gender and religious discrimination, and pay equity violations. Grossberg also said Fox intimidated her and fraudulently induced her to make false statements in her September 2022 deposition in the Dominion lawsuit. On April 18 Fox agreed to pay Dominion $787.5 million to settle the voting-technology company’s defamation lawsuit in Delaware. Less than a week later, Fox announced it had parted ways with Carlson. Grossberg could have been a key witness had the Dominion case gone to trial.

As Consequence notes, the German metal band Chaver announced their new album, Of Gloom, back in July. It’s coming out on September 22 and features an image of a purple spider with a round drop of purple blood above it. Doja’s album, also due September 22, features an image of a purple spider with a tear-shaped drop of blood above it. Chaver’s album cover was created by artist Dusty Ray, who’s designed all their albums. Ray apparently designed Doja’s album cover, too. According to Consequence, Ray shared a tweet announcing it, though it appears to have been deleted. And speaking of being deleted, Doja Cat has now apparently deleted her Instagram post announcing the album, which she’d posted on Tuesday. Her website still has the spider image, however.
