State quarterback Bailey Hockman (16) scores a touchdown on a 4-yard run during the first half of N.C. State’s game against Florida State at Carter-Finley Stadium in Raleigh, N.C., Saturday, Nov. 14, 2020. After returning from a solid win against an injured Florida State team, the Wolfpack will continue its streak of home games and take on the No. 21 Liberty Flames as the Pack tries to push its home record to 4-1. NC State (5-3, 5-3 ACC) will try to defend its own turf against undefeated Liberty (8-0). The Wolfpack currently has a strong winning record at home, only dropping one game to a highly ranked Miami in a heart-wrenching 44-41 loss. Liberty will be the Pack’s second ranked opponent in a game played at home, as the Flames’ top-25 status this year is a first in school history. This is also the Liberty Flames’ first full season as a part of the Football Bowl Subdivision, after joining last year. Liberty has seen many firsts this season, not only is it now a ranked squad, but it collected a win against Syracuse, its first win against an ACC school. The Flames managed to do it again, taking down Virginia Tech about two weeks later in a close 38-35 game, a team NC State failed to beat this season. With a perfect 8-0 record, Liberty will look to wreak havoc on the Wolfpack with its high-scoring offense. Throwing for 1,645 yards this season and 15 touchdowns, quarterback Malik Willis will bring an offensive threat that NC State has not seen this season. With a 97.8 last weekend against Western Carolina, he had the best total quarterback rating in the country. On top of his noteworthy statistics, Willis has been included on USA Today’s Heisman Watch List, currently naming him one of the best quarterbacks in the nation. As impressive as Liberty’s stats are, the NC State Wolfpack is a force to be reckoned with. Redshirt junior quarterback Bailey Hockman has helped carry the team through the season after redshirt sophomore Devin Leary’s frightening leg injury against Duke. Hockman threw for a season high last week with 265 yards and two touchdowns against his former Seminoles squad. NC State’s defense will need to gear up for this matchup, with Liberty averaging a whopping 40.5 points per game. In addition to the points they put on the board, the Flames offense has only thrown one interception all season. However, Liberty has yet to see a defense like NC State. The Wolfpack has tallied seven interceptions this season, plus 24 total sacks and six forced fumbles. Having dealt with other highly rated quarterbacks such as Miami’s D’Eriq King, the Pack will be prepared to handle whatever Liberty can throw at it. While the Liberty Flames are truly on fire this season, NC State has a real chance to hand this hot team its first loss. Liberty has a threatening stat sheet, but the Wolfpack has one thing that will make a real difference: a better schedule. While the Flames have taken down two ACC teams this season, NC State’s recent ranked matchups such as UNC-Chapel Hill and Miami will prepare it for this week's tough battle. This will no doubt be a close game and a tough battle for both teams, but if NC State can enter this matchup going full steam ahead, it will have a chance to catch this opponent off guard.

headlines and other important local and national news sent to your email inbox daily. North Carolina had a slight increase in weekly unemployment insurance claims last week. Claims have gone up the past two reports from the U.S. Labor Department. Initial unemployment insurance claims in North Carolina jumped to a seven-week high of 11,468 on Monday, the state Division of Employment Security reported Tuesday. The last time there were more daily UI claims was 12,796 on Nov. 2. The seven-day range had been 2,286 to 7,346. By comparison, the daily filing peak was 34,706 on March 30. The increase comes as three state and federal unemployment benefit program are set to end — potentially temporarily — on Saturday. Congress passed Monday the $908 billion COVID-19 relief package that includes a $300 federal extended UI weekly benefit for up to 11 weeks, and a one-time $600 per individual stimulus payment. The federal PEUC (pandemic emergency unemployment compensation) and PUA (pandemic unemployment assistance) programs will expire Saturday. As of 10 a.m. Tuesday, those programs have combined to pay $1.49 billion to North Carolinians. There's an expectation that it may take until mid-January for the $300 weekly UI payment to begin, which means those currently receiving payments from the PEUC and PUA programs may lose funding for two or more weeks. Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at progressive think tank The Century Foundation, said the estimate for North Carolinians is an average $6,376 in PEUC benefits and an average $5,446 in PUA benefits when including the one-time stimulus funds. Distribution of the $600 payment could begin next week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday. It is expected to be similar to the $1,200 payment in that taxpayers already with direct deposit will receive it sooner. PUA benefits are primarily for independent contractors, self-employed people and people with short work histories who became unemployed because of COVID-19. It is available for people who have to be at home to care for a child whose school has closed because of the virus. The N.C. Division of Employment Security said about 47,000 North Carolinians would be affected by the expiration of the PEUC and PUA programs. Altogether, there have been 2.96 million state and federal UI claims during the pandemic. Of those, 1.38 million are claims for regular state unemployment insurance benefits. Some federal programs require filing additional state claims. About 31.5% of the 4.37 million North Carolinians considered part of the state’s workforce as of mid-November have filed a state or federal unemployment claim. North Carolina surpassed over the weekend the $9 billion threshold for state and federal UI benefit payments to unemployed and furloughed individuals. Nearly 79% of the payments since late March, or $7.09 billion out of $9.02 billion, have come from federal funds. After $8.16 billion in state and federal UI benefits were paid from late March through Sept. 30, there had been just $842 million since Oct. 1. DES began reporting Oct. 23 the statewide totals from the temporary $50 increase in regular state UI payments. Payments were at $124.7 million as of 10 a.m. Tuesday. The increase is estimated by DES to benefit between 15% and 20% of current UI claimants. The extra benefit is scheduled to end after Saturday. Currently, North Carolinians can draw up to 12 weeks of regular state UI benefits over a 12-month period. The number of weeks will expand to 16 for new claimants in January, under a sliding scale in the state's unemployment benefits law. Regular state UI payments are at $1.79 billion, with only about $97 million being paid out since Oct. 1. Most unemployed and furloughed North Carolinians exhausted their 12 weeks of regular state UI benefits well before Oct. 1. The state had $3.85 billion in the state UI Trust Fund in mid-March. State legislators said Sept. 2 that between $2.9 billion and $3 billion remained in the fund at that time. The third COVID-19 relief bill added $87 million. The current federal extended benefits program has paid out $190.2 million overall. Those payments were reduced on Oct. 10, going from up to 9½ weeks to up to six weeks. Those benefits are available to certain UI claimants who have exhausted up to 12 weeks of regular state UI benefits and up to 13 weeks of federal PECU payments. The federal payments include $589.8 million from a projected $716.6 million from six weeks' worth of federal Lost Wages Assistance funding. There have been just $19.3 million in payments since Oct. 1. The largest federal UI program — the federal $600 weekly benefit supplement — was allowed to expire by Congress on July 26. That program has paid $4.83 billion. 336-727-7376 @rcraverWSJ Sign up now to get the most recent coronavirus headlines and other important local and national news sent to your email inbox daily.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 8:21 pm Thanks to this year’s legislative exercise in gerrymandering, the newly formed 13th congressional district now stretches across all or part of 10 counties, including Alamance, Caswell, Chatham, Davidson, Davie, Iredell, Lee, Person, Randolph, and Rowan. What hasn’t changed is the political make-up of the district, which, like its predecessor, remains strongly Republican. That’s why incumbent Congressman Ted Budd elected to stick with the new district, and this time around, he is being challenged by Democrat Scott Huffman. Budd is a businessman from Davie County, and Huffman is a Navy veteran and small business owner from Rowan. Earlier this month, the two men appeared together for a taping of Triad Today. What follows are highlights of that discussion: JL: Experts predict a huge surge in COVID-19 cases this Fall. Should Congress enact a nationwide mask mandate? TB: Absolutely not. Individuals are smart. We know a lot more than we did since February. People can be sensitive to their situation. If they have someone sick at home, someone with a co-morbidity, then certainly there’s a sensitivity for a mask, but there are other situations where it’s not necessary, and I want to leave it up to individuals’ intelligence. SH: Absolutely, because if the death of 214,000 Americans are not enough to convince this President and Ted Budd that we need to wear a mask, then obviously, science and the experts should. Almost 400 people in this district have already died from this pandemic. JL: Speaking of health care, do you support Medicare for All? SH: Absolutely, because if anything, this pandemic has shown that so many people have lost their health care due to no fault of their own because we don’t have leadership in Washington telling people to respect science, listen to the evidence and wear a mask. So yes, we need to make sure everybody has health care; that way, they can go to the doctor, get the services that they need, and not worry about going in debt if they don’t have health care. TB: Absolutely not. I don’t think it’s actually merciful. Look, the bottom line is, we want more people to have access to really high-quality health care at an affordable price. I don’t think that defining people below the poverty line is a very merciful way, which is what Medicare/Medicaid does. Also, a lot of great doctors that everyone needs access to don’t take Medicaid. JL: Senators Warren and Schumer have proposed that we forgive college student loan debt up to $50,000. Do you support that proposal? TB: I think we need to be very intelligent when people take on debt. I think they need to understand how they’re going to repay it; for example, is the degree they’re actually taking on debt for going to be able to repay itself?

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:00 am GRAHAM – The state Department of Justice dropped a suit to fire two Alamance County magistrates after nine months of COVID delays and investigation of allegations they tried to get a judge charged with drunk driving. Alamance County Historic Courthouse Alamance County Chief District Court Judge Brad Allen Sr. petitioned to have magistrates David Crabbe and Amelia Knauff suspended with pay and ultimately removed from office in October claiming they conspired to follow Allen to a restaurant or bar, wait for him to leave, and tap his bumper causing an accident in hopes he would be charged with driving while impaired to “have him out of the way.” Leslie Dismukes, the NCDOJ prosecutor who handled that petition, said the “DWI scheme” was largely dismissed as a joke, but a joke Dismukes called “insubordinate, “inappropriate” and “in poor form” but not a reason to remove them from office. Knauff was also accused of scheming to bug the Magistrate’s Office to get proof of whether or not Chief Magistrate Bobbie “Jean” Nance was working the hours she claimed. Again it appeared to be loose talk. “One individual did not believe it was a joke, but the rest of them did,” Dismukes said. But Knauff did file a petition for the SBI to investigate Nance, spoke to the District Attorney about starting an investigation and wrote a letter to two judges detailing some of the issues she saw in August of 2019. “I’m not sure how that letter affected this process,” Dismukes said. While she was critical of Crabbe and Knauff’s attitudes and in some cases work performance, Dismukes also said the petition and investigation highlighted serious divisions among people in the Magistrate’s Office and a need for more training and formal policies on getting things done, giving magistrates feedback on their work and holding people accountable. Magistrates in North Carolina are considered independent judicial officers — judges, though not necessarily lawyers — nominated by the county clerk of superior court, appointed by the senior superior court judge and supervised by the chief district court judge. They are generally the first judge people see when arrested. They set initial bonds, accept bond payments, issue arrest and search warrants, approve involuntary commitments and perform weddings among other things. Both Crabbe and Knauff were reappointed to four-year terms in January of 2019. Dismukes said that was the time to deal with job-performance issues so she focused on issues raised since their renewals, which took a number of allegations out of her consideration. Allen conducted his own investigation interviewing many people from the Magistrate’s Office and the court system about Crabbe and Knauff, Dismukes said. The SBI followed up with at least 15 of those people because the petition against them brought up potential criminal issues. The tones of those two sets of interviews were very different, Dismukes said, as the SBI investigating the magistrates made it clear this was more serious than “office gossip.” In the end there were no criminal charges. “The evidence ultimately found it was basically talk in the workplace that was inappropriate but not criminal,” Dismukes said. Crabbe and Knauff were also charged with coming to work late, leaving early and unexcused absences, some of which Dismukes said would be hard to prove because the Magistrate’s Office did not keep a log of who was in the office and when. Other instances could be excused for medical reasons. And yet others seemed to be conflicts over an unpopular system of 12-hour schedules that could have been handled better, but did not amount to firing offenses. There were problems, Dismukes said, with errors in some court records and failure to follow procedures that also seemed like more like training issues than reasons to fire. Dismukes was critical of some of the allegations brought about Knauff’s personal life. Most of them happened outside of work, but there was one incident where she had a loud personal argument at the office. While calling it a bad incident, Dismukes said the man Knauff was arguing with sought her out at work and if the roles were reversed, a man in her position probably would not have been blamed or shamed on the record. “If it does not occur at the workplace and it does not interfere with your work I believe it is completely unfair to air someone’s personal issues in a public forum without proof of that, and I did not find proof of that here,” Dismukes said. “I think the inclusion of that in a public document was a bridge too far.” The dismissal does not let Crabbe or Knauff entirely off the hook, though. Dismukes seemed to wish there was an option like censure short of firing the magistrates in state law. The petition can be refiled, and ongoing personal and professional conflicts with Nance could amount to insubordination that could stand against them if the case was refiled or when they are up for renewal again in 2023.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:41 am At top, Food Lion employees, members of the Orange Partnership for Alcohol and Drug Free Youth, and members of the community award Food Lion No. 198 with a Responsible Alcohol Seller Award. Above, staff of Pueblo Viejo receive their recognition. For the past few years, the Orange Partnership for Alcohol and Drug Free Youth has presented the Responsible Alcohol Seller Award to a local business that has gone above and beyond to do its part in reducing access to alcohol by teens and underage community members. These efforts often include requesting IDs at the time of purchase of alcohol and training employees on policies and methods for deterring underage sales. This year, the coalition was so impressed with the work of local businesses that it chose for the first time to honor two companies: Food Lion No. 198; and Pueblo Viejo. The awards presentations were held Nov. 17 in two separate events at the store locations. Gayane Chambless, who is program director for the coalition, said honoring two companies was the best thing to do given the level of commitment shown by the two companies, particularly during the pandemic. “The restaurants were so responsive,” Chambless said. “They wanted to get guidelines from Alcohol Law Enforcement (ALE), learn what are the best practices in a pandemic world. I shared that with the coalition and they were, like, you know, it’s been so hard on the businesses, yet here they are wanting to make sure they are implementing best practices. The coalition members were so impressed that they put public health above revenue.” Pueblo Viejo frequently reached out to the Orange Partnership for Alcohol Drug Free Youth for assistance on training new employees and creating new policies. The restaurant was recognized for its “commitment to do this right and keep the community safe, especially our youths.” Food Lion No. 198 was chosen because of changes the store made after failing a compliance check in 2018 as a result of inconsistent ID checks. The company’s policy requires ID checks for anyone who appears under 40 years of age. Food Lion went further and had its Customer Service Manager approve alcohol sales. The result has been highly effective in its work to end alcohol sales to minors. The Orange Partnership has been working in some shape or form as a community coalition since 2008. The organization was borne out of an initiative from the Orange County Health Department from their community health assessment that identified underage drinking was happening. “One of the things that was noted was access was so easy,” said Chambless. “When we started looking at that — in 2011 and 2012 — we found that only about 30 percent of the stores in Hillsborough were actually checking IDs. That made us aware of how easy that access is. We first shared that information with the businesses themselves. What we saw was perhaps they needed staff training or a closer look at policies. We also shared the information with law enforcement and they realized they needed to do more compliance checks. Through those efforts we have since 2014 seen significant increases in checking IDs, especially if someone looks under 40-years-old. The increase now is an average of 97 percent of Hillsborough stores. It’s significant.” One thing that is certain is once kids know about a store that doesn’t check IDs, word spreads quickly. By partnering with businesses to help create consistency for checking IDs, the sale of alcohol to minors declined significantly. The Orange Partnership wanted to recognize companies for their efforts. “The businesses often don’t hear about the good they are doing,” Chambless said. “They often only hear people complaining. Truth is, the majority of people really do appreciate what the stores are doing. There are community members who have gone into stores to thank them. But we wanted to recognize those businesses in a more public way. Not just though the coalition. We talked with Mayor Tom Stephens at the time and they were very much on board with the recognition efforts. Hillsborough Police Chief Duane Hampton, Mayor Weaver, the commissioners — they’ve all been very supportive of these efforts and recognize that it creates a healthier community for our kids.” The pandemic has placed added emphasis on the role of the coalition. While sales at restaurants and bars has been greatly cut, data collected by the Orange Partnership has shown alcohol sales — not including wine and beer — has increased in Orange County by more than 40 percent from March to October this year. The increase in alcohol at home coupled with middle schoolers and high schoolers being at home for virtual learning has created a different kind of challenge. “The increase of what’s in the home is a concern,” Chambless adds. “We have been doing some surveys and the preliminary data is showing that its is significantly easier for them to access alcohol. Not enough is being done to secure alcohol in the home. How do you lock it up? Well, you’ve got the liquor cabinet, but what about the beer? Most kids might not drink wine, but they might. When parents are having to work inside or outside the home with middle school and high schoolers who are home learning virtually, if the parents aren’t home monitoring, it’s even more important to secure that.” One unexpected way businesses are benefitting from the pandemic has been the wearing of face coverings. Chambless said the masks have made it easier to avoid the guesswork and simply require a show of IDs from everyone purchasing alcohol. “There’s no guessing for the clerks. It’s hard and it’s often a judgement call. It really is best practice to just check IDs regardless of age. It reduces the store’s potential liability,” she said.

Open. The fish collected prize money totaling $80,506 and was the family’s first win in 42 Open tournaments. The 42nd U.S. Open King Mackerel Tournament had to overcome a few obstacles, so it wasn’t a big surprise the winners had to overcome some too. One of the biggest obstacles was a friend who also wanted to win the prestigious tournament and caught a larger fish late the first day. Another was a knot that slipped. Fortunately neither was terminal. Andy Broadwell of Southport and the crew of the Nauti Lady took the early lead, slipped to second place after Tracy Aman of Boiling Springs Lakes and the crew of the Sling N Bait weighed later on Friday, and then caught a slightly larger king on Saturday to reclaim the lead and hold on for the win. The perseverance of the Nauti Lady crew was a performance fitting for any comeback story, but fits this tournament perfectly. The tournament had to overcome near complete destruction of the docks in Southport Marina by Hurricane Isaias in early August plus implement and monitor COVID-19 restrictions and protocols. Home of the Open since 1979, the marina took a direct hit, so the event was moved to Dutchman Creek Park. This worked surprisingly well, considering the tournament drew a near-record 521 boats. Andy Broadwell didn’t have time to prepare as he usually does. He got put off his game plan early when he began looking for bait with plans to pre-fish a little the weekend before, and his younger son, Garrison, got a hook stuck in his head. After that it became a situation of show up and fish for the normally well prepared fisherman. Friday morning the Nauti Lady crew caught bait and fished near the bait school for a while before heading down the beach to look for an uncrowded spot to anchor. A friend called and said he had seen a big king free jump near the Cape Fear Ship Channel, so they headed there and dropped anchor. “We had only fished about 10 minutes when the first king hit,” Broadwell said. “It looked nice, but not like a fish to take in early, so we tied back up to our anchor and put the lines back out. Once we had baits back out, I opened the fish bag and measured the fish. It wasn’t huge, but was bigger than I had thought, so we decided to take it and weigh it when the scales opened at 11. That’s a nice thing about this tournament – that they allow weighing multiple fish, so if you’re close and want to weigh one early, you can and then go back fishing.” The first fish weighed in the tournament held the lead at 37.20 pounds until late Friday. The Nauti Lady crew didn’t think it would hold the lead, but were hoping. They weren’t surprised when Tracy Aman and the Sling N Bait crew weighed their 37.75-pound king just before 4 p.m. and bumped them to second. When the Nauti Lady headed in to weigh, they left their anchors in place with anchor balls floating, so they could return to the same spot. Unfortunately, when they returned the anchor balls were not there and they didn’t have a second anchor aboard. Broadwell doesn’t suspect anyone tampered with them, but that the rough seas worked quickly tied knots until they loosened. He had an anchor, anchor ball and line at home, so a quick trip to the store for chain and shackles got them going again. “We went back to the same spot first thing Saturday morning, but people must have figured out where we were and it got crowded,” Broadwell said. “We lasted there until about 9:30, then pulled the anchor and headed down the beach looking for somewhere that wasn’t crowded. There was a big school of bait just about off Big Hill and I remembered all the kings they used to catch at Long Beach Pier, so we anchored right in that school of bait. Still, fishing was pretty slow and we were about to accept we would have to settle for second again, when we got a big strike a little before 3 p.m.” The fish cooperated and they landed it pretty quickly. This fish was 50 inches long, with a 24-inch girth. The question now was if it would be heavy enough? They pulled the anchor and headed for the scales. Years of fishing have made Andy Broadwell a good judge of fish size and the scales confirmed this fish was just more than a pound and a half heavier than their Friday fish. It weighed 38.85 pounds and moved them back into the lead. They weighed at 3:36 p.m. so they would only have to watch a handful of boats weigh to see if this king would hold up and give the Broadwell clan their first U.S. Open win in 42 attempts. It held for the win and the jinx on a Broadwell winning the Open had ended. This fish also earned Top Lady Angler prizes for Lauren Broadwell, Lily Broadwell and Heather Phelps. There has been a Broadwell fisherman competing in every U.S. Open since the tournament began in 1979. This began with Andy Broadwell’s father, Boyce, and grandfather, Lonnie, at the first event. Andy Broadwell fished it with them for the first time in 1981 when he was six years old. The 2020 Nauti Lady crew was stacked with Broadwell fisher folk. It began with Andy Broadwell, included his brother, Adam and Adam’s daughter, Lily, plus Andy’s wife Lauren and sons, Fisher and Garrison. They were joined by Chad Phelps, Andy’s partner in the Nauti Lady, with his wife, Heather, and son, Camden. These nine folks were the largest fishing team anyone at the Open could remember and they got the job done. Andy Broadwell jokes that they have to have a large boat so everyone can go fishing. Adam Broadwell fought Friday’s fish, while Chad Phelps had the angling duties Saturday. Andy Broadwell was the gaff man on both, while his older son Fisher ran the boat. Theirs is a team and family oriented effort and after years with miscues and near misses it paid off – big time – to the tune of $80,506 in total winnings. That plan of showing up, catching bait and going fishing worked – and it worked well. Lonnie and Boyce Broadwell have passed, but their legacies continue. There is a special “Friends of Boyce Broadwell” prize awarded to the 56th place finisher in honor of Andy’s dad, Boyce Broadwell. The Southern Kingfish Association (SKA) awards the “Lonnie Broadwell Senior Angler Award” each year to the Top Senior Angler in the country in honor of Lonnie Broadwell, Andy Broadwell’s grandfather. Now, there is a fourth generation of Broadwells fishing the Open and they are winners. Special congratulations to Lily, Fisher and Garrison Broadwell and may they become keepers of the flame. Of special note is that Andy Broadwell gave credit to his dad and granddad for introducing him to fishing and being sure he learned to do it right. He is instilling that same love for the sport in his sons. Broadwell said there were many fishermen that invited him along as a youngster and young man and he had learned from them all and wanted to thank them all. Tracy Aman and the Sling N Bait crew had a tough time at the Open. Sure, they finished in second place and collected $53,557, but it was tough. This isn’t about being in a smaller boat, with a smaller crew, but catching a fish that bumps your lifelong friend from the lead, then holding the lead until the last hour of the tournament before getting bumped to second place. “At least it was one of my friends,” said Aman. “We wanted to win – bad, but it just wasn’t to be. We knew it wasn’t a huge fish, but the tournament was nearly over and we were hoping. There’s still a pit in my stomach, but it helps a little that the folks that beat us were the ones we bumped to second the day before. They are friends too. Once I knew it was over, I called Andy to congratulate him.” Aman’s tournament story is substantially different than Broadwell’s. He said he had been doing a little preparation for several weeks. He had found some fish pre-fishing and thought he had something going, but then the weather became a factor. Aman said that even with his pre-tournament work, he has a small boat and doesn’t enter unless the weather is fishable. One trait of the Open is that usually when the wind blows hard, it is coming from the north and the water for a mile or so off the beach is calm enough to fish. When Aman got the weather'}]"

and how far our athletes have come. We share a close bond with our athletes and their families and we miss that the most about not being in the gym.

Yost | Nov 1, 2020 | News The sight of a lot of Guilford County Schools buses lined up is pretty common and almost never raises eyebrows. However, on Saturday, Oct. 31, when 74 buses were used to establish a security perimeter at a Jill Biden “Get Out The Vote” rally in Greensboro, Guilford County Schools ended up with a huge controversy on its hands. The move upset Trump fans, school board members, social media users and many others who wondered if school system dollars were going toward partisan political events. The matter blew up on Facebook after one poster shared pictures of the buses and asked for an explanation. Others who attended the event at the Greensboro Coliseum saw the buses and called local media outlets to complain. Guilford County School Board Member Anita Sharpe said on Sunday, Nov. 1 that she’s very disturbed by the fact that the buses were used without her and other school board members being notified. She said that, even though she’s a school board member, she was told nothing about the plan. She said she was told she wasn’t informed due to “security concerns” but she added that she had been cleared twice by the US Secret Service and she said certainly someone could have given a heads up to the school board. She added that other school board members had also had security clearances granted by the Secret Service. Sharpe said that, instead, it seemed to her to be another instance of a lack of communication by Guilford County Schools Superintendent Sharon Contreras. “I’ve made a public records request about this,” Sharpe said Sunday, Nov. 1, the day after Biden’s rally. “That is how I have to get all of my information.” Sharpe said it made no sense for school board members to be kept in the dark about something like this. “What did they think was going to happen when people saw all those school buses parked there?” she asked. She said that, on Saturday morning, people began texting her and sending her pictures of the buses and asking questions. “At the time, I had no idea,” Sharpe said, adding that “John Q. Public might see that and think that Guilford County Schools is supporting Biden.” She also said she has requested information about the cost. She said she’d heard that the Secret Service was going to reimburse that money to the school system, but she knew none of the details. On Facebook, Joanne Smith Gilbert posted pictures of the buses (see above) and wrote, “I’m curious. Was this taxpayer funded? Paid for by the Biden campaign? An in-kind contribution by our Superintendent? What was the approval process and who authorized? Someone needs to do some explaining please.” School Board Member Pat Tillman, who posted a Facebook comment conveying what he’d heard on the matter, wrote, “I’ve been told this is handled through the US Secret Service. No campaign called GCS [Guilford County Schools]. Apparently, this is a common security practice of US Secret Service. The US Secret Service called and the US Secret Service reimburses school districts all over America.” Share: No question about it. Guilford County Schools DOES support Biden. Who paid for the Drivers and Fuel for the buses. I am sure that our Mayor approved it ,if not bill her. The current Supt needs to be shown the door . . . .ASAP, and there’s no need to have a national search for a replacement. Something smells at the school system, and I’ll bet some of the board members knew about it and decided to not inform the public. It’s called the DEA, ask the Coop about it. Why am I not surprised at Pat Tillman’s comment. I’ve never heard of school buses being used by the secret service to protect any candidate or surrogate candidates in all my years This should have NEVER been done without the school boards authority. As usual the superintendent answers to no one! How much longer do we have to deal with this tyrant?! Yes, Your Superintendent knew about it and supported it. Yes, your local government run liberal social justice child indoctrination centers endorse Biden. Yes, they broke numerous laws in this little fiasco. Now, what are you people on the board going to do about it? #defundtheschoolboard #partisanbs In all my years I’ve never heard of school buses being used as security or any other reason for a political campaign. Another example of Democrats using public equipment and facilities, not to mention payroll, for their own benefit. Especially since they didn’t even bother to ask the school board. Who did they call and who gave them the okay to use the buses? If buses are a good way to control access, then hire buses from private companies. I am sure they could use the money more than the school district. Funny I’ve not seen school busses at Trump rallies. Secret Service– That’s B.S. Where did Mr. Tillman get his facts this time? Interesting! I hope you guys will continue to research the truth. Were voters transported in any of the buses? Ms Contreras needs to be hard at work for the children of Greensboro or move on. What else can happen when Democrats are in charge of activities in a city/county? Superintendent Contreras made that wonderful decision to bus voting children to vote. Now buses and drivers are allowed for a political event.Hiw much more has to happen before someone is shown the door and asked to leave.Maybe the Queen of the school system has been given the liberty to use taxpayer money as she wishes. Can you people began to see she takes liberty’s that all of the school board is not in favor. Also when the superintendent waste money like that why should she be give more money to squander. I guess this superintendent does not report to the school board,or almost all school board is in on it.understand why county commissioners are Leary to give school board money to promote political events.I guess the logical thing to do would be to invite the opposite party the same opportunity. Contreras is NOT the sole person in charge of the Guilford County schools. It is impossible to believe that she did not know of this beforehand. She does not understand the chain of command and that she works for the school board. Her time has come and gone several times on similar issues such as busing students to the polls last spring. We must have a separation of powers and responsibility with the school system. We bus them to and from school, we feed them even when school is not is session all the while their parent gets money from the government to feed them. What is next? Housing them? It is time to clean house with not only the superintendent but the entire school board. If it walks like a Biden, talks like a Biden, looks like a Biden—-it’s a Biden. It is easy enough to find who is responsible. I saw some wake-up TV today the 2nd. Jam-packed with the same-ol’-same-ol’. Haven’t seen the Idiot Box since then, I’m afraid to look. Halloween is gone, but not the scary polys. Oh, I forgot. It is now “open season’ on Medicare all the way to Pearl Harbor day. Haven’t seen many XMAS ads, as the polys bought it all up—–BUT WAIT! See what tomorrow brings. Sigh. I have some novel ideas. Turn off the Idiot Box. Break out a book, or some CDs. Meet up with your friends and neighbors. Play with your children, or grandparents. hear that, folks? According to the school board, the Secret Service reimburses the school board for its use of the buses. Keep in mind the Trumps still haven’t paid over a dozen cities across America for hosting rallies – even dating back to 2015. Who’s really offering America the better deal? All the false outrage in the world can’t change the facts. That is a bunch of bull about the secret service sets this up. The superintendent set this up and she should pay. What do you expect from a Demoncratic Greensboro Government. Don’t hold your breath while waiting for reimbursement. Don’t think the Secret Service should pay for this. If the secret service pays this, who funds the SS. OF COURSE WE THE TAXPAYER DOES! Should be the Biden campaign that pays and they should have plenty of money since J. Biden has mostly stayed in the basement and out of public view. The fact our Superintendent is playing political games in the middle of a pandemic is representative of her repeated stunts that she pulls without knowledge or approval. The secret service could contract with any number of entities to provide vehicles for security. Bad form and more evidence Contreras is a political hack and very unprofessional. This is one of the reasons I voted NO on additional school tax. This'}]"

Server Edy Hayden opens her paycheck on the Hops Burger Bar patio on Spring Street on Dec. 23. Even after some employees confronted management after finding out about the latest COVID-19 on Dec. 16, the restaurant wasn\'t shut down, she said. “We were all expected to go to work even though there wasn’t enough time for us to go get tested and get our results back,” said Hayden, who has worked at the restaurant for two years. GREENSBORO — Employees of a local restaurant chain are demanding changes to its coronavirus protocols after they learned of fellow workers testing positive through social media and word of mouth. Lillian Thorne, who works at Hops Burger Bar on Spring Garden Street, said employees are upset that management had not informed them of the cases. “When (employees) brought that to management’s attention, they threw around excuses like HIPAA, that they weren’t allowed to tell us that someone had COVID,” Thorne said. “(Employees) responded: ‘We don’t need to know who has it. We need to know that it’s present at our workplace.\'” See correction at the bottom of this story. HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, includes restrictions for sharing private medical information. However, guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say restaurants should immediately inform staff, customers and health officials of any confirmed cases of COVID-19. “They couldn’t really give us any reason as to why they weren’t more urgent about communicating with us,” said Thorne, who has worked at Hops for about a year and a half. Hops is a popular restaurant with three locations in the Triad. Money.com put it at No. 18 on a list of the 20 Best Burger Spots in the U.S., based on Yelp.com reviews. Even after some employees confronted management after finding out about the latest case on Dec. 16, the restaurant wasn\'t shut down, said Edy Hayden, a server at the Spring Garden location. North Carolina workers who feel they are being exposed to hazards on the job, may file a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Division by calling 800-625-2267 or at online via the N.C. Department of Labor website at https://www.labor.nc.gov/safety-and-health/occupational-safety-and-health/safety-and-health-complaint-or-concern. “We were all expected to go to work even though there wasn’t enough time for us to go get tested and get our results back,” said Hayden, who has worked at the restaurant for two years. Employees refused to return to work the following day, forcing managers to run the restaurant until after it was cleaned, Thorne said. David Essa, a co-owner at Hops, said the company has already made some changes and is working closely with the Guilford County Health Department. “We definitely acknowledge that we have made some missteps in this process,” he said. “I hear my employees loud and clear and take these concerns very, very seriously.” The company has hired a consultant “to make sure that we develop and implement a new COVID action plan which will be introduced to our employees and staff at all of our locations,” Essa said. The workers also have asked for paid sick leave. “That is absolutely 100% part of what is being dealt with in our plan,” Essa said. Since the start of the pandemic, companies large and small have struggled with what they should disclose about COVID-19 cases to their employees. However, those who advocate for workers rights say the failure of companies to share information about cases could lead to further spread among workers and their families and potentially death. Hayden, 22, said the new Hops COVID-19 action plan is overdue. “We’ve closed down before,” said Hayden, referring to a companywide closure in July after two employees at the Lawndale Drive restaurant tested positive for the coronavirus. “That’s when the first plan was written,” she said. But that plan doesn’t address notifying employees of positive cases and contact tracing, she added. Hayden also said the company hasn’t been offering weekly updates to employees and customers — something she said was promised in the July plan. Neither Hayden nor Thorne, who are roommates, has returned to work because another roommate has tested positive for COVID-19 forcing them to quarantine. Their tests related to the restaurant work have come back negative, they said. ""A lot of my co-workers\' (tests) have been coming back negative,"" Hayden said. Thorne, 22, said 16 employees have signed the list of demands, which includes paid sick leave and more transparency when COVID-19 cases arise. The company has already addressed some concerns, such as replacing physical menus with digital menus easily seen on cellphones and tighter restrictions on temperature checks for people entering the building. It also is paying for rapid COVID-19 tests for employees. A lot of employees are hopeful that management will meet their demands, said Thorne, who works as a host and food runner. She remains skeptical, however. “They’ve had since March to come up with a thorough COVID plan of action in preparation for (a time when one or more employees contracted the virus),” she said. “With the track record here of them not having transparency and open communication, I just don’t likely think that’s a possibility.” Thorne said there is fear among some employees that making demands and speaking out will cause retaliation. She noted that some employees are getting fewer hours on the schedule while others aren\'t getting any work at all this week at the Spring Garden location, which temporarily began limiting its service to curbside and delivery. The Lawndale and Winston-Salem locations are still offering dine-in services.

Defined by the American Psychiatric Association as ""health conditions involving changes in emotion, thinking or behavior,"" mental illness affects millions of Americans, often disrupting their social lives, personal relationships, and school or career performance. Although many of them have found relief through professional treatment, many, many more never will—but not because treatment is not possible. It is in most cases, but a variety of factors prevent all too many sufferers from getting the help they need or even seeking it out in the first place. Now is an especially dangerous time. Instances of mental illness and its most negative outcomes—most notably suicide—were already on the rise for the past two decades before the pandemic struck. But the coronavirus crisis—and the stress and uncertainty that came with it—have led to dramatic spikes in the number of people seeking help with problems involving their mental health and well-being. America\'s mental health crisis is now and has for a long time been aggravated by widespread misinformation and ignorance about mental illness and the people who struggle with it. The nature of mental illness is widely misunderstood, as are its causes, consequences, and potential treatments and outcomes. Those who suffer from mental illness battle not only the condition itself, but public perceptions and attitudes that are commonly unhelpful, often harmful, and usually rooted in misinformation. The following attempts to rectify some of that by presenting the most current and accurate information on the most pressing aspects of mental health in America. Stacker developed a list of 25 key facts about mental health by using data and expert information from sources like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Mental Health America (MHA), the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), and the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA). These are the facts about mental illness and the millions of Americans who suffer from it. About one in five American adults struggle with mental illness, according to the CDC. That’s about 43.4 million people 18 and older. About one in 25 adults—nearly 10 million Americans—grapple with serious mental illness that impairs their daily lives. About 20% of children have suffered from what the CDC classifies as a “seriously debilitating mental disorder,” most commonly an anxiety, behavior, or mood disorder. Three out of four cases of chronic mental illness begin by age 24 and half begin by age 14. In the words of the APA, “Mental illness does not discriminate.” It can and does affect individuals from all socioeconomic backgrounds, races, religions, sexual orientations, genders, geographic locations, cultures, and ages. Women are significantly more likely than men to struggle with mental illness, including serious mental illness, according to NIMH, particularly in cases of depression. Mental illness is most prevalent in young adults 18-25 and individuals from multiracial backgrounds. Mental illness can be caused by genetics, life experiences, environmental factors, stress and trauma, individual biochemistry, drug and alcohol use, traumatic brain injury, or any combination of them all, according to MHA. In many cases, it\'s not possible to trace the exact source of an individual\'s condition. Depending on the condition and the individual, mental illness may or may not include red-flag symptoms like a decline in hygiene, significant weight loss or gain, a sudden increase in drug use or reckless behavior, or a departure from reality in the form of paranoia, delusions, or hallucinations. Symptoms of mental illness are complex and can vary widely depending on a variety of factors, but extended periods of sadness or lethargy are common symptoms, according to NAMI, as are radical changes in sleeping habits, personality, or behavior. A sudden increase in episodes of overwhelming panic or fear could be a warning sign, as could thoughts of self-harm, extreme changes in sex drive, and a withdrawal from friends and social activities. Affecting more than 40 million adults—about 18% of the population—anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the United States, according to the ADAA. That includes conditions like generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobias, and panic disorder. Those who suffer from an anxiety disorder are much more likely than the general population to also suffer from depression, and vice versa. About half of the people diagnosed with depression will also be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Mental illness can take many forms beyond anxiety disorders and mood disorders like depression and bipolar disorder. Among the most common are eating disorders, personality disorders, behavioral disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance abuse disorders, and psychotic disorders like schizophrenia. People who struggle with serious mental illness are at a greater risk for cancer, diabetes, and other chronic diseases, according to the NAMI. Roughly one in five struggle with substance abuse at the same time as mental illness. NAMI estimates that at least 8.4 million Americans serve as caregivers for adults with mental or emotional illness. On average, they spend 32 unpaid hours per week providing care. Caretakers are impacted most directly, but the realities of America’s mental health crisis affect virtually everyone—particularly when sufferers don’t receive adequate treatment. Individuals with mental illness account for one in eight emergency room visits, according to NAMI, and one in five homeless people have a serious mental illness. Seven out of 10 youths in the juvenile justice system have at least one mental illness and 20% of adult jail inmates suffer from serious mental illness. According to MHA, the LGBTQ+ community is one of America’s most vulnerable populations, with 39% reporting mental illness—twice the adult national average. It is important to note that being gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender is not a mental illness, nor does sexual orientation contribute to mental illness. Hostile societal attitudes, rejection from families and communities, bullying, discrimination, and even violence that LGBTQ+ individuals disproportionately endure can degrade mental health and exacerbate existing mental health issues. LGBTQ+ adolescents, teens, and young adults are among the most at-risk groups in the country, and are far more likely than their heterosexual peers to experience mental illness. They’re also more likely to be discriminated against when seeking treatment and to experience negative conditions that disproportionately affect the mentally ill, such as homelessness, unemployment, substance abuse, and violent or sexual predation. Despite widespread misinformation to the contrary, mental illness can be managed and mitigated, according to the APA, through a program of evaluation and diagnosis followed by treatment. That treatment could include psychotherapy, prescribed medication, and hospital or residential treatment. The APA also notes, ""The vast majority of individuals with mental illness continue to function in their daily lives."" According to MHA, 56% of adults and 61.5% of youths with mental illness do not receive any treatment. Contrary to a common stereotype, however, it’s often not for lack of trying. Millions of Americans of all ages report giving up after repeated attempts to get help in vain. Aside from the actual conditions themselves, the biggest challenge facing many people with mental illness is the deeply entrenched social stigma that surrounds it. Misinformation is accepted as truth among large segments of the population, and uninformed negative attitudes and perceptions about mental illness and the people who suffer from it are common. Among the most common stigmatizations are that a person with depression is just lazy or sad, that a person with bipolar disorder is just irrational or lacking self-control, that substance abuse disorders are the result of character flaws or individual weakness, that people with anorexia should “just eat,” or that a person diagnosed with a mental illness can’t hold a job or function in society, none of which are helpful or true. The stigma that surrounds mental illness can and does have disastrous consequences by increasing anxiety, stress, depression, and feelings of hopelessness and isolation in people who are already suffering. It can encourage shunning from friends, co-workers, classmates, and even family members, and it can lead to bullying, harassment, and difficulty securing housing or employment. Perhaps most importantly, stigma often prevents those who need help and treatment from seeking it. Social stigma leads many to incorrectly assume that people with mental illness can’t maintain healthy relationships, excel in academics, hold jobs, and be productive members of society. The truth, however, is that when they receive the treatment they need, they tend to be more productive at work, absent less often, and require less individual spending on medical and disability costs than the general public. Stigma also surrounds the treatment of patients, particularly when it comes to psychiatric medications, which many write off as ""happy pills"" that simply drug patients into a state of numbness. The truth is that when used in conjunction with therapy and other treatments, psychiatric medications have proven to be effective and beneficial for large percentages of the patients who take them.

Marty Sharpe, chief technology officer with Catawba County Schools, stands in a computer server room displaying a K-64 Chromebook. Marty Sharpe, chief technology officer with Catawba County Schools, checks out one the newest K-64 Chromebooks for Catawba County students. Marty Sharpe was hard at work when a package arrived at his office. It was a stolen Catawba County Schools Chromebook that had been recovered in Virginia. “It was found in Fredericksburg, Virginia, in the middle of a street,” Sharpe said. He’s the Chief Technology Officer at Catawba County Schools. He\'s worked for the school system since 1999. This year has completely flipped the ‘school’s out’ slogan to school being in! Here’s some tips on how to turn your home into the best educational environment it can be. Buzz60’s Chloe Hurst has the story. “This is just one reason we pushed for Chromebooks for all staff and students, as we can lock them remotely with a message that it was reported stolen or missing with our address,” Sharpe explained. This is one example of how county schools have been proactive about the use of technology in their district. When Sharpe began working in the Catawba County Schools Technology Department, they were on the cutting-edge. “When I first started in the department as the Instructional Technology Facilitator, it was under Terry Bledsoe. Terry was the CTO — he actually started this department,” he explained. “He was pretty much a visionary in the state. Not just with the technology piece — that existed in the ‘80s — but he started this thought of integration of technology.” In other words, Sharpe said Bledsoe didn’t want to simply put devices into teachers\' hands; he was interested in training staff to use technology in the classroom. Jeff Tice knew this was easier said than done. “Though there were certainly a few early-adopting pioneers, on average teachers approached using technology with an understandable bit of trepidation,” he said. Tice is the Director of Technology for Hickory Public Schools, and has been with the system since 1994. “While teachers were working hard to incorporate new tools into their instructional experience, their amazing ideas and creativity were sometimes hamstrung by very slow computers and internet connections,” Tice explained. “Streaming video was not yet mainstream, and YouTube had not yet been born. Teachers did the best they could to incorporate professional development, related to technology, into their already busy work schedules.” One way school systems helped teachers with this was by employing Instructional Technology Facilitators. Angie Sigmon, a 20-year veteran in education, is the facilitator for Newton-Conover City Schools. “I supervise our five Digital Learning Facilitators. These five facilitators are housed at five of our seven schools,” Sigmon explained. “We meet weekly to collaboratively plan the implementation of district initiatives and develop professional development. We also use our meeting time to stay abreast of the latest research around digital teaching and learning.” Sigmon keeps up with the weekly meetings along with a slew of other responsibilities specific to technology, such as overseeing Canvas, Google Classroom, and Schoolnet — online tools that connect students and teachers. “Classrooms have changed tremendously over the past 20 years,” Sigmon admitted. “Students are now equipped with a school-issued device that can be used anywhere and anytime for learning.” Although technology has continued to progress for students, it started slow. “During my first year of teaching, I believe I had two desktop computers in my classroom. My students mostly used these devices to take reading assessments,” Sigmon said. She was a classroom teacher for 14 years and an instructional coach for three years before entering her current role. With the integration of technology into classrooms in the early 2000s, Sharpe said the technology department for Catawba County Schools was tasked with jumping a massive hurdle: cutting off access to non-educational, inappropriate materials. “It was extremely difficult,” Sharpe admitted. “You didn’t have nearly the amount of vendors or people who were oriented towards K-12. There were firewalls and filters out there for businesses, but education is a lot different from a manufacturing business.” Sharpe said that changed around the 2010s. “Everything exploded once you started seeing smartphones and other personal devices,” he said. Tice agreed. “I would say that if you’re older than 30 years old, the progress of technology should be pretty evident,” Tice said. “There are far more computers and other digital devices in the home than there were 20 years ago. Substantially more people, schools and business are connected to the internet.” To prevent students from accessing non-educational materials, CCS and many other school systems had firewall protection and filters. “When I first started (in the department), we were a little more stringent.

This structure, accessed through the county schools\' website homepage, also has a feature where folks can instant message a technology department employee. “We knew that we would have so many more technical issues at home,” Sharpe said. “We could not manage the amount of phone calls we would have gotten. You’re talking about 15,000-16,000 students — multiply that by parents, by grandparents — there was no way we could’ve managed that.” Sharpe says the future of technology in schools is bright. “I love thinking about what’s coming next,” he said. “One of the things we actually implemented a few years ago was VR (virtual reality).

Augmented reality is the rendering of digital images or data onto real-world objects. “This augmented reality is more engaging,” Sharpe said. “It’s not a book or a video, it’s about seeing it in your environment.” Tice’s vision for the future of technology in education is similar. “Teachers, in my opinion, will always be the instructional visionaries, guiding student instruction, while at the same time, exploring with them!” Sigmon also sees potential. “I can visualize a future where students are asked to be creators rather than consumers of knowledge, a future where teachers have the ability to help students explore their passions while mastering content standards,” she said. Sharpe says education has only scraped the surface of machine-learning. “It’s amazing how fast technology updates and changes,” Sharpe said. “It’s up to us, to educators, to adapt to those changes and to see how to utilize this technology and put it in the hands of students to provide a quality education and with opportunities to make a difference in the community and create careers.” Emily Willis is a general assignment and education reporter at the Hickory Daily Record.

After hearing this news, I was saddened. I am not a musician, but I do love music. And Eddie Van Halen was one of my favorite musicians. I distinctly remember the first time I heard the talents of Eddie Van Halen. It was spring, 1978. I was 15, hanging out at a neighborhood friend’s house with a group of other teenagers. At some point, my friend announced that he wanted to play an album (these were the days of vinyl records and turntables) that had just been released by a new band called Van Halen. The first song on this band’s debut album was “Runnin’ With The Devil,” and when this song blasted out of the stereo speakers, I was amazed and blown away. It was a distinctive guitar sound and a combination of hard rock and rebellious lyrics. From that point until now, I have been a huge Van Halen fan. One of the most memorable entertainment events of my life remains the time I had the opportunity to score a front-row seat to watch Eddie Van Halen and his band perform live in 2004 in Greensboro, NC (but that’s another story for another day). Most people remember Eddie Van Halen for his guitar skills. Rightly so, he was one of the greatest lead guitarists ever in a rock-and-roll band. The rock-and-roll moniker “guitar god” may fit Eddie more than any other guitarist of his time. His ability to make a guitar sound unique, and to play it in ways it had not been played before, inspired countless young men and women to pick up the instrument in hopes of learning. Every guitar student wanted to learn how to play an Eddie Van Halen song (usually “Eruption”) and he was - and still is - an inspiration to both guitar novices and masters. While Eddie Van Halen was both a great musician and an inspiration to other musicians, there are aspects to his life story that can serve as a lesson to those of us who are not musicians, but who spend our days in more traditional forms of work and business. When we take a deeper look into Eddie Van Halen’s career, we find that his work embodied specific traits necessary for any individual or organization who wants to succeed at a high level. He was one of those rare artists who taught all of us, artists or not, how to be better at what we do. “I’m not a rock star. Sure, I am to a certain extent because of the situation, but when kids ask me how it feels to be a rock star, I say leave me alone. I’m not a rock star. I’m not in it for the fame. I’m in it because I like to play.” Eddie Van Halen Eddie Van Halen loved to play the guitar. If he had not become a lead guitarist for one of the biggest bands in the world, there’s no doubt he would have still spent his career and made a living by playing the guitar. But Eddie was not just any guitarist; he was a great guitarist, and it was his love of playing that allowed him to achieve that level of success. When we love what we do, and when we find great satisfaction in a skill, a talent or an environment, it’s hard not to succeed. It is the love and passion for our work that drives us to become better and gives us the optimism and fortitude to move forward in the face of difficulties. Certainly, every individual talent or skill set may not be easily translated into a profitable or successful career. But the importance of enjoyment in your career or work cannot be understated. Those who love being with others should find a career working with people. If your passion is being outdoors, seek opportunities that take you outside on a consistent basis. If sales excite you, it doesn’t necessarily matter what you sell as long as you are selling. It’s obvious Eddie Van Halen possessed a high level of natural musical talent, but it was his love of playing that allowed him to channel his focus and energy into being the best and succeeding at the highest level. “I started doing all kinds of weird stuff on the guitar, which became part of my playing. I started doing harmonics and tapping on the guitar and pulling off strings and doing all this weird stuff that no one had ever done before.” Eddie Van Halen Eddie Van Halen was an innovator. From his early teenage years through the remainder of his life, he continuously searched for new ways to create different sounds from his instruments. There are numerous stories about the guitars he tore apart to build new ones, the modifications he made to equipment such as amps and pedals, and how he constantly tinkered and tried new things to create unique sounds within his music. He even received two patents for his inventions. Many of his experiments and innovations were made by him working alone, with no certainty if an idea would result in success or failure. And while a number of his ideas occurred when he was just starting out, many more were created after he had realized tremendous success. From a business and career perspective, innovation and continuous improvement make a significant impact on how we sell a product, deliver a service, or if we find continual success within our work and careers. Great careers and the best companies are the result of constant experimentation, continual innovation, and rejecting the acceptance of defined norms. Eddie Van Halen’s long and successful career was a direct result of his desire to create something better than what presently exists. For those of us who do not make our living as an artist or musician, it is equally important that we shun complacency and embrace the spirit of innovation and continual improvement. While we may throw away a few proverbial guitars in the process, we will never improve otherwise. “To hell with the rules. If it sounds right, then it is.” Eddie Van Halen Eddie Van Halen understood the necessity and importance of change. His band remained relevant, creating new music and playing sold-out shows, for almost 40 years. No band, organization or company exists for that long without undergoing and accepting change. Over his career, Eddie’s music evolved. He was not afraid to experiment with his sound and the product he provided his audience. In the mid-1980s, after lead singer David Lee Roth left the band, Van Halen recruited Sammy Hagar as lead singer. In their first subsequent album, Van Halen’s music had a different sound. Many critics and fans said the band had abandoned their hard-rocking roots and long-time base, and predicted the album and the band would eventually fail. But the four albums ultimately produced under the Sammy Hagar era combined to sell over 27 million copies, a staggering number. Furthermore, the band continued to perform live, selling out shows around the world, while playing a mixture of both older and new music until just a few short years before Eddie’s death. This success was not by accident. Eddie believed in himself and his ability to discern good music. He refused to live in the past and hold on to a product that had been relevant years before simply because it was safe. Change is difficult and elicits a high level of uncertainty. But change is necessary for long-term success. Business entities and professionals must continually evaluate their offerings, gauge what their customers need or desire, and make the difficult decisions necessary to remain relevant. As a Van Halen fan, I love the music they first released when I was a teenager. But I equally love the music they released after I graduated from college, and I appreciate their ability to create both at the right times. Eddie Van Halen was a great musician and an amazing guitarist. But he is unique for more than just his ability to play lead guitar in a rock-and-roll band. Brian T.

3:42 pm Friday, April 17, 2020 By Submitted article Diet and Exercise David Crocker So many folks these days, try to make healthful food choices, but that might be harder than you think. Have you ever chosen one food item, over another, because of health claims on the label? You may have been hornswoggled. Many food labels can be perplexing, some misleading, and others, just downright dishonest. Get the latest news sent to your inbox Today, I like to clear some of the confusion regarding misleading phrases manufacturers assign to food labels. This claim really doesn’t mean much, in fact the Food and Drug Administration doesn’t even define it. “All natural” just means the food doesn’t contain added colors, artificial flavors or synthetic substances. These food products may still contain preservatives, high fructose corn syrup and sodium. Also, with regard to some supplements, don’t believe something is safe just because it’s labeled “all natural” or “herbal”. By definition, arsenic is “all natural”, and hemlock and mistletoe are “herbal”, but all of them are poisonous. This is a very misleading allegation. When the dangers of saturated and trans fats were recognized, “fat free” food items became extremely popular. Problem is, these products sometimes hold as many calories as full fat versions. The reason? To make these foods more palatable, they contain added sugars. Always check labels for calorie content, then compare to their full fat constituents. To be considered “sugar free”, a food product must contain no more than 0.5 grams of sugar per serving, but that’s just half the story. Sugars are just one form of carbohydrate. Just because these foods don’t have added sugars, doesn’t mean they don’t contain other carbohydrates, like starches. Remember, all carbohydrates, except fiber, are converted into glucose (sugar) by the body. Also, many “sugar free” foods have just as many calories as the original. Manufacturers will often add sugar alcohols such as mannitol, xylitol and sorbitol. These are sweeteners that have half the calories of regular sugar, but if taken in high amounts can cause diarrhea. These artificial fats are created in an industrial process that adds hydrogen to liquid vegetable oils to make them more solid, to give foods a longer shelf life. Trans fats raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol, lower your HDL (good) cholesterol levels, increase your risk for developing cardiovascular disease and stroke. They’re also associated with higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. By law, if food has no more than 0.5 grams of trans fats per serving, it’s allowed to have “0 trans fats” on the label. Now that might not seem like much, but 1 gram of trans fats is considerable. Check the ingredients for the words “hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils or shortening”. If those are on the label, the product contains trans fats. The term “free Range” refers to food from animals that have access to outdoor areas, or animals who have free access to graze or forage for food. Problem is, since the U.S. Department of Agriculture does not define the term “free range”, there are no requirements for the amount, duration and quality of outdoor access. For those who purchase ethical food, know that all organically raised food is automatically “free range” (certified organic standards require this), but all food raised free range is not necessarily organic. “Multigrain” simply means there are several kinds of grain in a product, according to the Whole Grains Council. When shopping for healthful breads and crackers, look for the words “whole wheat” or “whole grains”. Whole grains (which include popcorn, wheat, oatmeal, brown rice, rye, quinoa and barley) have more fiber and other nutrients than grains that have been refined, a process that strips away the most healthful portions of the grain.

9, 2020 By Mike Barnhardt For a few weeks in 1977 or 1978, I lived with a poster of Ayatollah Rohollah Khomeini of Iran on the wall. I didn’t put it there. My college roommate did. I wasn’t offended, but I wondered why a teen-age or early 20s young man would want a photo of an old bearded man on his wall. I favored my poster of Farrah Fawcett. It was more colorful, and had a much more pleasing typography. My roommate found it disgusting, pornography, and proof that America was going straight to hell. More on that later. The recent news concerning Iran and increasing tensions got me to thinking – and worrying. It was the fall of 1976, and I was a new student at Chowan College in Murfreesboro. I was also the editor of the school newspaper, and soon after arriving I found myself covering a protest by Iranian students. Going by memory, I think they were complaining that they weren’t being treated the same by the community and the college as the American students. It turns out that American colleges and universities have helped educate tens of thousands of Iranians over the years – and still are. Some say that’s great, some say the opposite. I never understood why those students would pick Chowan, which at the time, had 50 or more students from the Middle East among its student population of just over 1,000. And being a college owned by the Southern Baptist Convention which required weekly chapel (Christian) sessions, I wondered how these Muslims could survive there, especially since most only spoke broken English. I guess if they couldn’t understand what the pastor was saying, it wasn’t so offensive. How they managed to understand what professors were saying is another story. But they were there. Fast forward about a year, and I came to school in the fall with a new roommate. I can’t remember his name, but he was from Iran and prayed almost all of the time. He chastised us Americans for not praying, for wanting to party, and for not understanding his position. It took me three weeks to get the college to put him in a room with another Iranian, and me in a room with another American. Some research into what these Middle Easterners did after attending college here found some disturbing results – worse than those airline schools who trained the pilots. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed also went to Chowan – in 1983 – and later graduated from NC A&T. He was one of the masterminds of the 9/11 attacks. Chowan was a Christian-founded school run on Christian principles, but it had a liberal entry policy. The school also did not require the standard English proficiency test that most international students faced. Most, according to reports, paid their tuition with cash. I’m not going to lie, we weren’t nice to those students. They didn’t like us, and we didn’t like them. It had nothing to do with politics, but more with lifestyles. Many called them “Abbie Dahbies.” There rooms were sometimes flooded by Americans, at other times trashed. I did make one friend at Chowan from the Middle East. He was from Jordan. He called me Jimmy Carter and I called him King Hussein. He was a great guy, and we enjoyed each other’s company. Even before he enrolled at Chowan, Mohammed had joined the Muslim Brotherhood. And soon after he left A&T, he became involved in a jihad against Russia. His terrorist activities after that are well documented. I’m not trying to put a blame here on Chowan. Although I didn’t and don’t understand why a Christian school would allow foreign students of different religions (Or why those students would want to go there in the first place). I applaud the school for trying to be a more diverse community, if that was the goal. No blame on Muslims or Iranians, either. After all, there are some self-proclaimed Christians here who are evil. A big country, I’m sure that not all Iranians want the United States destroyed; and vice versa. I would like to say that I wish I had treated the Iranians I met in the mid-1970s with more respect, but I can’t. Respect is a two-way street, and the ones I met had no respect for my way of life. So there. And according to Mohammed after his capture, our college hijinks against his kind did not affect his opinion of the United States. He didn’t like our government’s cooperation with Israel. He said that his interactions with Americans just confirmed his opinion that the United States “is a debauched and racist country.” I do know one thing. If someone prefers a poster of Ayatollah Khomeini over one of Farrah Fawcett, it’s time for an investigation. – Mike Barnhardt'}]"

Asheville students, faculty and staff protest UNC System policy that would remove DEI initiatives By Xavier Hooper Contributor [email protected] Downtown Asheville is practically bare with the exception of construction workers and the few homeless people occupying the streets and parks. Most other homeless people are in safe conditions, under quarantine, thanks to local shelters. “We’re not letting anybody else come in that hasn’t been here since the beginning of the pandemic. We are in isolation and have had roughly 135 people sheltered in for the last four weeks. We’ve been providing service to them including showers and meals,” said Michael Woods, executive director of the Western Carolina Rescue Ministries. Due to the risk of possible exposure to COVID-19 outside of the shelter, the organization is not letting anybody else come in, even those who were already in the shelter from the beginning. “We’re not closed. If people leave, they can’t come back. People need to make decisions to stay without any promise of the Coronavirus going away. We did a screening and we still do checks on everybody daily. There’s a large number of people here with compromised health including about 40 people over 70 years old and around 20 children,” Woods said. Those who have left the shelter or just couldn’t make it in time are out in the streets, dealing with the implications brought on by the Coronavirus. To Tony Edwards, a homeless man in Asheville, the shelters are seemingly closed. “No churches open. None. Not one. Rescue missions, homeless shelters, all closed. I tried getting into a shelter today and couldn’t get in. They’re not taking nobody. I sleep wherever I can,” Edwards said. “We would look closed to someone out on the street. We’re not closed. We just can’t take in anyone new. And that’s just not us, that’s every shelter in the state,” Woods said. However, the shelters operating under Asheville Buncombe Community Christian Ministry are still taking in new residents as long as they prove to be healthy and virus-free, according to executive director of the ministry Scott Rogers. “We are still taking in new residents as some move out with jobs and homes. We require evidence of having a prior two weeks of demonstrating healthy quarantine and behavior, or residents must self-quarantine in-house for two weeks upon arrival,” Rogers explained. The organization acted promptly at first notice from the CDC in regard to COVID-19. These guidelines included three phases: prevention, mitigation and quarantine/isolation. “ABCCM moved swiftly in the beginning by adopting CDC guidelines. We developed a new strategic plan that covered all three phases within 72 hours of the CDC announcement on Mar. 9 about how serious the situation was and is,” Rogers said. ABCCM has so far avoided any signs of contamination within their facilities, proving their preventative measures successful. According to Rogers, the organization follows the CDC’s guidelines very strictly. This includes cleaning common areas every hour instead of the recommended two hours and cleaning all doorways and entrances every 15 minutes. There is also a nurse who works with team leaders to run checks on the health status of all residents four times a day. “The Veterans Restoration Quarters capacity is 250 men and Steadfast House at 50 women and children are at full capacity. To date, we have had about 20 men and 12 women tested and all have come back negative,” Rogers said. With 300 people at ABCCM, 140 at WCRM and 110 at the Salvation Army, about 550 beds are filled in Asheville, meaning about 95 percent of Asheville’s 580 homeless persons are quarantined, according to the last Point-in-Time count on Jan. 29. According to some homeless people, there doesn’t seem to be any evidence of contamination within the homeless community outside of the shelters. “It hasn’t affected me physically or anybody I know out here, but I know to keep my distance,” said Asheville local Joseph Hughes Jr., who has been homeless for 15 years. “I don’t know anybody who has it. A lot of homeless people out here are healthy. Very healthy. I have a lot of health issues but I know God protects me,” Edwards said. According to Rogers, both the city and county have refused to help any of four shelters in town, including the two at ABCCM, the WCRM and the Salvation Army. The city did, however, agree after four weeks of requests from all shelter providers, to open the Civic Center to house up to 50 beds for those who are at high risk. Buncombe County also has a contract with four hotels containing 270 beds which can be used for quarantine and isolation of any homeless people, health care workers, first responders or others who may need to be isolated from their families. “The City does not see its role in providing health and human services as this is the traditional role of the County who administers all health and human service funds from the federal and state governments. While we would all like these leaders to do more for our particular vulnerable populations and bring in more resources to meet our particular priority, they are doing a good job with what they have and what they know to keep us all safer and are to be commended, in my humble estimation,” Rogers said. While giving out more than 500 meals a day in take-out containers, the Western Carolina Rescue Mission not only feeds those within their shelter, but also others outside of the shelter, homeless or not. ABCCM also feeds people in and outside of the shelter, amounting to more than 1,100 donated meals a day. According to an executive director report sent out to the ABCCM board on Mar. 31 by Rogers, projected meal costs were expected to rise from 85 boxes of food a day to 120 boxes of food a day through April and beyond as a result of the pandemic. The report also notes the cost of purchasing 1,000 boxes of food is $30,000, at $30 a box. This means it would take roughly 12 days to go through 1,000 boxes of food, or $30,000 if the number of food boxes needed per day were to remain at 85. At this rate, the organization is donating over $70,000 worth of meals alone per month. The number of food boxes needed daily have since gone up. Donations can be made to both WCRM and ABCCM to help provide services to homeless people in the Asheville area.

The calendar, a now annual publication by this newspaper, is full of photos that depict life across the Roanoke-Chowan area. Those photos were solicited from September through the end of October with the cash grand prize awarded to the photographer whose work was chosen for the calendar’s cover. Lauren Bright accepts a $250 check for snapping the 2021 Calendar cover photo from Roanoke-Chowan Publications Editor Cal Bryant. Staff Photo by Holly Taylor That honor was earned by Lauren Bright of Sunbury, a fifth-grade math teacher at Buckland Elementary School. The award-winning photo was of her father, David Swink, and her son, Carter Lee Bright, as they relaxed on a boat this past summer while enjoying the view of a setting sun over the lake. Bright’s work also landed her two other photos inside the calendar: a snow scene in January and her son playing in a mud puddle (April). Other local photographers whose work was published inside the calendar were Lauren Harrell of Ahoskie (February; a cardinal on a tree branch ), David Spruill of Gatesville (March; an owl perched in a tree), Grace Woodard of Murfreesboro (May; flowers and plants blooming at Chowan University), Courtney Jones of Eure (June; softball game), Maegan Watson of Gates (July; her daughter smelling a sunflower), Sarah Matthews of Aulander (August; her daughter preparing for a school day), Jonathan Jones of Eure (September; Merchants Millpond State Park), Kayla Pope of Aulander (October; her child sitting among pumpkins), Brandy Tinkham of Colerain (November; her child on a toy tractor), and Beth Jones of Askewville (December); her child decorating a Christmas tree). Lauren Harrell also had a photo published. There were a total of 97 photos submitted; all were judged by the staff of Roanoke-Chowan Publications. Additional copies of the calendar are available at the Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald office located at the intersection of Main Street and Catherine Creek Road in downtown Ahoskie. Cal Bryant, a 40-year veteran of the newspaper industry, serves as the Editor at Roanoke-Chowan Publications, publishers of the Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald, Gates County Index, and Front Porch Living magazine.'}]"
