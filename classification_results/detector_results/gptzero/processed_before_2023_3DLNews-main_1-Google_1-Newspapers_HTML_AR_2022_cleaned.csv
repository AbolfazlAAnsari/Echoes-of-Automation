extension soybean agronomist for the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture. “Corn is at reproductive stage, farmers are trying to get rice flooded and irrigation to cotton and soybeans, we’re spreading it pretty thin already. It’s just a struggle on where we need to pump. “I hear guys talking about 1980,” Ross said. 1980 had 15 straight, 100-degree-plus days at Little Rock — 10 of which were at or above 105 degrees — and 42 100-degree days for the year. Jarrod Hardke, extension rice agronomist for the Division of Agriculture, said that for the upper 75 percent of the Delta, “it’s been anywhere from the 25th of May to the 4th of June since they’ve had a measurable rain.” Frequently, the July Fourth weekend is marked by significant precipitation — dubbed a “million-dollar rain.” This year, it was a no-show for most of the state. “The dynamic here becomes a multi-crop issue. What do we do when it’s this dry?” Hardke said. “Decisions have to be made. Do you have the water and the pumping capacity to move over and irrigate soybeans as opposed to keeping water on your rice? “We were at this stage a week ago and it’s probably going to get more serious very quickly,” he said. In a normal growing season “it can take a week or 10 days to get the initial flood on,” Hardke said. “Now in that same field; it’s 14-21 days this year. It’s double the amount of time just to do the initial flood.” Even with row rice, pushing water across a field has become difficult. “Between what is used by plants and evaporation to dry air, the water is disappearing faster,” he said. “If a 2-inch rain came across the Delta, it would be huge, but it still wouldn’t be enough.” For soybean growers, the drought impact varies depending on what stage their crop has reached. Those who planted later are faced with seeds that aren’t germinating or have small plants. “There are a lot of beans just planted, to soybean plants that are 5-6 inches tall,” Ross said. “Typically, we don’t irrigate small beans. We can kill or drown them. They don’t have the capacity to withstand the flooded conditions for an extended period of time. “It’s a hard decision. We’re telling them they can either watch them dry up and die, or irrigate and maybe lose some of your stand, but still have moisture in there to get what’s not coming up to come up,” Ross said. The news in Monday’s crop report from the National Agricultural Statistics Service wasn’t good for soybeans. In Arkansas, 10 percent of soybeans were classified as poor-very poor. “If 10 percent of Arkansas’ soybean crop is rated ‘poor-very poor, that’s the equivalent of about 320,000 acres,” said Scott Stiles, extension economist for the Division of Agriculture. Hot nights — when lows don’t drop below the 70s — are worrisome for soybean, corn and rice farmers whose crops are in the reproductive stage. “Photosynthesis happens during the day and generates a lot of energy,” Ross said. “Night time is when the plant does the hard work of filling pods, making seeds and filling those seeds.” Without cooler temperatures, plants struggle. “Small changes make a world of difference in our progress,” Hardke said. “If we can drop into the low 90s during the day and near 70 at night, with partly cloudy skies, it can make a huge difference in the overall health of our crop and in our irrigation progress.” While Arkansas farmers have access to groundwater, irrigation isn’t free. The pumps run on diesel fuel. “Fuel costs are a concern and although diesel prices have backed off, the current cost per gallon is still 76 percent above last year at this time,” Stiles said. “In recent weeks, diesel prices have been double what they were last year.” Higher petroleum prices are also making poly pipe more expensive. This tubing is connected at one end to a pump and the other end sprawls across the top of crop rows. Holes are punched in the tubing, allowing water to flow out at calculated rates. “Many growers report the cost per roll of irrigation pipe being around 25 percent more expensive than last year,” he said. Ross said if one “starts factoring in diesel prices and that commodity prices have dropped in the last 10 days, hopefully a lot of people have some of those $15 beans booked. “A bunch of us were banking on that July Fourth ‘million-dollar rain’ and most places didn’t get it,” Ross said.

In a brief condolence telegram to Gorbachev\'s family published by the Kremlin the day after his death, the Russian leader said that Gorbachev ""led our country during a period of complex, dramatic changes,"" and offered his ""sincere words of sympathy and support."" Putin\'s first public comments on Gorbachev\'s death were a sharp contrast with his policies, which have sought to undo much of his predecessor\'s legacy of more personal and political freedoms. Putin has also called the end of the Soviet Union -- which Gorbachev presided over -- the ""greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century,"" and is now waging a war in Ukraine to recapture what he sees as lost Russian lands, a war whose possibility Gorbachev once dismissed as ""absurd."" Gorbachev ""deeply understood that reforms were necessary, he strove to offer his own solutions to urgent problems,"" said Putin, who noted ""the great humanitarian, charitable and educational work"" of Gorbachev\'s wife, Raisa. The condolence note allowed Putin to appear as a statesman above the political fray, but it quickly became clear that Gorbachev would not be venerated by the Kremlin. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin\'s spokesperson, said that the format of Gorbachev\'s funeral -- such as whether it would receive state honors -- had yet to be determined, and would depend on his family\'s wishes, according to the Interfax news agency. By contrast, on the day in 2007 when Gorbachev\'s successor, Boris Yeltsin, died, Putin, who succeeded him, declared a day of national mourning on his funeral. The ceremony was broadcast live on state television and the lowering of Yeltsin\'s coffin was accompanied by an artillery salute. On Wednesday, Gorbachev\'s daughter, Irina, told the Interfax news agency that her father\'s funeral ceremony would take place Saturday, in the grand hall of Moscow\'s House of the Unions. Flanked by white Corinthian columns, the grand hall has been the site of many high-profile ceremonies, including the funerals of Vladimir Lenin, Josef Stalin and other Soviet leaders. Gorbachev will be buried next to his wife at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow, his daughter said. Peskov said that the Kremlin was not sure whether Putin would attend the ceremony. In comments reported by Interfax, Peskov was more forthright than Putin about Gorbachev, calling him ""an extraordinary and unique person"" while also labeling him a ""romantic"" who naively believed that a post-Soviet Russia could be friends with the West. Since his early days in the Kremlin, Putin has worked hard to undo Gorbachev\'s signature policies such as glasnost, meaning openness and transparency of government and free discussion of its work. However, Putin has been careful never to condemn Gorbachev\'s legacy in full, arguing that he had to preside over a Soviet system that could not be fixed. For his part, Gorbachev, too, never criticized Putin to an extent that questioned his legitimacy as Russia\'s ruler. GORBACHEV PRAISED BY WEST U.S. President Joe Biden praised Gorbachev for being open to democratic changes. Gorbachev won the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize for his role in ending the Cold War. ""After decades of brutal political repression, he embraced democratic reforms. He believed in glasnost and perestroika -- openness and restructuring -- not as mere slogans, but as the path forward for the people of the Soviet Union after so many years of isolation and deprivation,"" Biden said. Biden added that ""these were the acts of a rare leader -- one with the imagination to see that a different future was possible and the courage to risk his entire career to achieve it. The result was a safer world and greater freedom for millions of people."" Reactions from Russian officials and lawmakers were mixed. They applauded Gorbachev for his part in ending the Cold War but censured him for the collapse of the Soviet Union. Oleg Morozov, a member of the main Kremlin party, United Russia, said Gorbachev should have ""repented"" for mistakes that went against Russia\'s interests. ""He was a willing or an unwilling co-author of the unfair world order that our soldiers are now fighting on the battlefield,"" Morozov said, in a reference to Russia\'s current war in Ukraine. Lech Walesa, the leader of Poland\'s pro-democracy Solidarity movement in the 1980s and the country\'s president from 1990-1995, had a more nuanced view of Gorbachev. He said he ""admired, even liked him, but did not understand [him]."" ""He believed to the last that communism could be reformed, but I, on the contrary, did not believe it was possible,"" Walesa told the Wirtualna Polska media. Walesa added: ""He knew that the Soviet Union could not last much longer and he was doing everything he could to prevent the world from bringing Russia to account for communism. And he was successful there."" World leaders paid tribute to a man some described as a great and brave leader. In Germany, where Gorbachev is considered one of the fathers of the country\'s reunification in 1990 and is popularly referred to as ""Gorbi,"" former Chancellor Angela Merkel saluted him as ""a unique world politician."" ""Gorbachev wrote world history. He exemplified how a single statesman can change the world for the better,"" she said, recalling how she had feared that Russian tanks might roll into East Germany, where she lived, as the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. In Asia, Gorbachev was remembered as a leader with the courage to bring change. China recognized Gorbachev\'s role in healing relations between Moscow and Beijing. Gorbachev had been an inspiration to reformist thinkers in China during the late 1980s, and his visit to Beijing in 1989 marked a watershed in relations between the sides. ""Mr. Gorbachev made positive contributions to the normalization of relations between China and the Soviet Union. We mourn his passing and extend our sympathies to his family,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said. However, China\'s Communist Party leaders also regard Gorbachev\'s liberal approach as a fatal display of weakness and his moves toward peaceful coexistence with the West as a form of surrender.
