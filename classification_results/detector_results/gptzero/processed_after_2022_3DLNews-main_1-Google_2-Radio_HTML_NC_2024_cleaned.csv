Photograph courtesy of Kenan Institute for Ethics at Duke University. In 1898, Wilmington was North Carolina’s largest town and home to a thriving multiracial democracy in post-Civil War America. But in November of that year, with support from white elites across the state, a white supremacist mob stormed through the town, slaughtering Black residents, burning their homes and businesses to the ground, and driving the biracial coalition government from power. It was our nation’s only successful coup. The lead-up to this tragic event, the massacre, and its aftermath is carefully chronicled by the two-time Peabody Award-nominated podcast Scene on Radio from the Kenan Institute for Ethics at Duke University. The new season is Echoes of a Coup by host and producer John Biewen and audio producer and assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, Michael A. Betts, II. ""Early in our interviews, we had an opportunity to talk to David Cecelski,"" says Betts. ""Cecelski did his really great job of framing the space."" ""If you had looked out on the water, that\'s almost all you would have seen. African American sailors on ships. African Americans from flat boats carrying cargo down vessels. African Americans guiding the largest ships that could come into North Carolina, into our ports and back. African American stevedores hauling goods on and off of vessels,"" Cecelski said in the podcast. ""It was an African American maritime world, and because of that, a deceptively sophisticated world politically."" An armed mob pauses for the camera in front of the Daily Record, the town\'s Black newspaper, in Wilmington in November of 1898. After burning the office, the mob began killing African Americans. Photograph courtesy of the New Hanover County Public Library. Producer John Biewen says many of those seamen were free Black people from faraway places, who spoke multiple languages, and who brought with them information from around the world. But he adds the freedoms of the high seas were in conflict with the law of the land. ""They were, as [Cecelski] describes, Black people giving white men orders on boats,"" says Biewen. ""And so you had in the antebellum South laws forbidding those free Black sailors to even speak to enslaved Black people in places like Wilmington. So that tells you a lot about the fear that slaveholders and other elites had about slave revolts, and about information getting to people."" By 1898, Wilmington was a post-Civil War society in many ways living up to the ideals laid out in the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments: no slavery, full citizenship, and the right for Black males to vote electing Blacks to prominent offices including aldermen and finance board. There were also Black Magistrates, School Committeemen, and Postmasters. ""And it says a lot about the sophistication and the kind of cosmopolitan nature of Wilmington in the 19th century that I think most of us just, you know, have never had that picture drawn for us before,"" says Biewen. But Betts says for many people, these were not welcome outcomes of democracy. ""What you see is you see elite whites go, ‘We are losing a power hold. We don\'t have access to the community cash grab like we did at one point,\' because we\'ve got this Fusionist politics happening at the time. We\'ve got poor whites who are realizing that they have material needs that aren\'t being met by the Democrats at the time — remember Democrats are the Conservative Party at the time —and they become concerned about their health and their money and their personal well being,"" he says. ""And that\'s what allows Fusionism to kind of start to take off."" On November 6, 1898, four days before the coup and massacre, an op-ed appeared in the New York Times from the Wilmington Star meant to rally support against the multiracial Fusionist — that is Republican and Populist — city government of Wilmington. The article “North Carolina’s Negroes” chronicles Black-held offices and the author concludes, “If they make such a showing in a few years, what may we not look for if their party triumphs and they get on top again?” ""You end up with this fusionism that is very, very successful in ‘94 and ‘96,"" says Betts. ""And would have been in ’98, had the Democrats not come up with this white supremacy plan."" And that plan he says was borrowed from what states like Mississippi had already been doing to ensure disenfranchisement of Black people: ignore the recent constitutional amendments, assert white power, and in the case of Wilmington, take back all Populist and Republican-held political offices by any means necessary. The day before the election, at a Democratic rally in Thalian Hall, that sentiment was echoed strongly in a fiery speech by former Democratic congressman Alfred Moore Waddell who called on the whites in attendance to resort to violence if necessary to prevent Blacks from voting. The election was held on November 8, and the Democrats, after a yearlong white supremacist propaganda campaign, voter suppression efforts, ballot stuffing, and other measures had won. But Biewen says that election was for state and federal offices only. ""The local election was not happening until the spring of 1899,"" says Biewen. ""And the white supremacists decided they weren\'t willing to wait that long and try to vote out the fusionist government locally in Wilmington — the mayor and council of aldermen. The following day supremacist leaders called for a meeting of white men to, as they put it, “conduct white supremacy.” Biewen says some 600 men signed what was called a White Declaration of Independence. ""And that said we will no longer be ruled by men of African origin ever again,"" says Biewen. ""And that led to a march into the city where the building of the Daily Record, the Black-owned newspaper, was burned, was set on fire. And then some white men went into neighborhoods and started shooting into the homes of Black people. They started shooting Black people on the street. And so there was a massacre of somewhere between 20-some and up to perhaps several hundred Black people. We\'ll never know how many."" That was the violence and white supremacy part of November 10, 1898. Next came the coup. ""And then a mob of a couple hundred armed men descended on city hall and informed the leaders of the city government that they were out, that they were to resign,"" he says. ""And new white supremacist people were put into the mayor\'s office and the city council at gunpoint. As with so many horrifying episodes in U.S. history, white America enforced a long silence about Wilmington 1898, or straight up lied about it. More than a century later, North Carolina did own up to what happened in Wilmington. But the state and the nation have done very little to make it right or less wrong."" Betts says the paltry efforts that have been made to redress the horrors of 1898 stand in sharp contrast to the extent to which North Carolina has gone to rewrite the history of the coup and turn the page. It’s a pervasive, nefarious, centuries-old tradition that he says continues in the media to this day. ""So, we wrote that the vast majority of the white protesters at January 6 were mild and meek,"" says Betts. ""And we wrote that the vast majority of Black protesters at the George Floyd uprisings'}]"

Navalny, a Russian native, gained admiration from the opposition after voluntarily returning to his home country from Germany, where he had undergone treatment for what was proven to be an attempt to poison him with a nerve agent, in 2021. Navalny said he was poisoned in Siberia in August 2020, however, the Kremlin denied having attempted to kill him, claiming there was no evidence that he was poisoned with a nerve agent.'}]"

two years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and this weekend Russia secured an important win. Its forces occupied a strategically important town in Ukraine's east. LEILA FADEL, HOST: Now, Ukrainian soldiers spent months defending it, but they're running low on ammunition and weapons. The White House blames Congress for holding up military aid, and Ukrainians fear more losses without more support. MARTÍNEZ: Joining us now to discuss all this is NPR's Joanna Kakissis, who is in central Ukraine. Joanna, first tell us about this town and why its occupation by Russia is significant. JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: So, A, the town's name is Avdiivka. And in Ukraine, it's been a symbol of resistance. Russia has been attacking Avdiivka for 10 years, ever since Russian proxies occupied part of eastern Ukraine back in 2014. The Russians really stepped up their attacks on Avdiivka last October, destroying nearly the entire town and driving out nearly all of the 30,000 residents. Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated his soldiers on the Kremlin website, and now Putin can tout this battlefield gain ahead of next month's presidential elections. Ukrainians, of course, are heartbroken. They're on edge. The capture of Avdiivka sets up Russia for more gains in eastern Ukraine. MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. And the White House noted that Ukraine's lack of ammunition played a role in Russia's takeover of Avdiivka. Is that what Ukrainians are saying, too? KAKISSIS: Yes. Many are saying that. A Ukrainian lawmaker told me Ukraine is being held hostage by election-year politics in the U.S. She's referring to how Republicans in Congress have been blocking a military aid package to Ukraine. And at the Munich Security Conference this weekend, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, look, we do not have enough weapons, and we will lose if we can't get more soon. Meanwhile, Russia already had a much bigger arsenal than Ukraine, and now it's getting even more weapons from Iran and North Korea. The Ukrainian soldiers defending Avdiivka also said that they were outgunned by the Russians, and on land that's flat with no cover for them. The 110th Mechanized Brigade defended Avdiivka for two years, and they shared some videos with NPR of soldiers talking about the withdrawal. Here's a soldier identified by his military call sign Munch. He's heard here through an interpreter. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MUNCH: (Through interpreter) The exit from Avdiivka was difficult, to put it mildly. Everyone knows the Russians have no problems with the supply of ammunition, no problems with firepower. So they shoot everything at us. Everything possible was flying there. KAKISSIS: Munch also mentioned how over months of intense fighting, the Russians would just send wave after wave of soldiers. No matter how many Russian soldiers were killed, there were always more coming. Ukrainian soldiers were about to be encircled in Avdiivka, so military chief Oleksandr Syrsky decided that the human cost of keeping them there was just too high. MARTÍNEZ: So does the fall of this city signal that maybe Russia is gaining momentum in this war? KAKISSIS: Well, in the short term, I think the answer is yes. In Munich, Zelenskyy said Ukraine is trying to build its own arsenal, but also said Ukraine cannot defend itself from Russia alone. Here he is. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: Please do not ask Ukraine when the war will end. Ask yourself, why is Putin still able to continue it? KAKISSIS: Zelenskyy is once again asking the West to not see this as only Ukraine's war, but one that will grow much larger if Russia keeps winning. MARTÍNEZ: That's NPR's Joanna Kakissis in Dnipro, Ukraine. Joanna, thank you. KAKISSIS: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTÍNEZ: Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, says his government won't be swayed by international pressure and is still making plans for an offensive in southern Gaza, in the town of Rafah, for the stated goal of eliminating Hamas. FADEL: But Rafah is where more than 1 million displaced Palestinians have fled, squeezed up against the Egyptian border. It's the last place so many have sought refuge from the Israeli military campaign, and much of the world is warning against the invasion because of the toll it will take on civilians. MARTÍNEZ: For more on this, we called on NPR's Greg Myre in Tel Aviv. Greg, we've been hearing about a possible Israeli operation in Rafah for weeks now - for a couple of weeks. How likely is it, and where would people go if this happens? GREG MYRE, BYLINE: Yeah. The Israeli leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, says this is still his intent, that he won't allow any part of the Hamas military force to survive in Gaza. He says that would essentially be a win for Hamas and a loss for Israel. Now, Netanyahu has called for both a military plan and a blueprint to evacuate these more than 1 million civilians, most of them living in tents. But there's been no word of such a plan, and it would be extremely complicated. So the thinking is, before any Israeli military operation takes place, we're likely to see efforts to evacuate civilians on a large scale. We're not seeing that now. And many of these displaced say they simply have nowhere else to go. MARTÍNEZ: All right. Now, after more than four months of this, how much damage has the Israeli military done on Hamas? MYRE: Well, it's been quite considerable, Israeli officials estimate - and this is just an estimate - about 10,000 Hamas fighters have been killed and a similar number injured. We can't independently confirm this. And Hamas refuses to give figures. But if accurate or reasonably so, this is probably half or more of the Hamas fighters. We've also seen an almost complete halt to the Hamas rocket fire coming out of Gaza into Israel. But Hamas shouldn't be underestimated. This is the analysis of Chuck Freilich, a former deputy national security adviser in Israel. CHUCK FREILICH: We've been so surprised by their capabilities since the war began, the vast, vast tunnel network, which is just mind-boggling, their rocket capability. I would be cautious in saying that they probably don't have too much in Gaza. They may have, and they have a lot more than we thought. MARTÍNEZ: So, Greg, given all that, I mean, what's the war looking like on a day-to-day basis in Gaza? MYRE: So we're seeing the Israeli tanks and other armored vehicles continuing to gain ground, but they're still facing resistance from Hamas. Israel says this is largely small-scale resistance. Hamas is no longer fighting in larger, organized unit. And the main fighting is in the southern city of Khan Younis. Israel says it's in control, but not full control. Khan Younis is about 7 miles north of Rafah. This is the distance separating the main Israeli force from the last major stronghold of Hamas, as well as all those displaced Palestinians. MARTÍNEZ: Now, Benjamin Netanyahu says his goal is to destroy Hamas militarily and politically. So far, does that seem realistic? MYRE: Well, on the military side, Israel has made progress. It controls most of Gaza. It says it's defeated 18 of the 24 Hamas battalions. So, if accurate, that means Hamas has been badly weakened but not destroyed. On the political side, the Hamas leadership, both internal leaders in Gaza and external leaders, are still intact. And the group has long had public support in Gaza. So it seems politically, it's still reasonably strong. MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR's Greg Myre in Tel Aviv. Greg, thanks. MYRE: Sure thing, A. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTÍNEZ: Construction is underway on a controversial state military base camp in Eagle Pass, Texas. FADEL: The base that was authorized by Governor Greg Abbott will span 80 acres and house up to 2,300 National Guard soldiers. Their mission is to secure the Texas-Mexico border, and the project represents the latest escalation in a tug of war between the Biden administration and Texas over who controls immigration on the border. MARTÍNEZ: Texas Public Radio's Pablo De la Rosa is here with us to share more. Pablo, so why is the state building this base? PABLO DE LA ROSA, BYLINE: So this is another step of many over the past three years of just continuous expansion on the governor's border security mission, Operation Lonestar, to deter migration on the border. But more than anything, it's a really big leap towards making that mission much more permanent. So it's a big move. But we've seen him challenge the federal government's exclusive purview on immigration enforcement from the very beginning of Operation Lone Star. You know, he's greatly expanded the militarization on the border, deploying barriers which some have called dangerous in the water, deploying heavily armed tactical marine units on the water. So we first heard about this from Governor Abbott when he spoke about the new military base from the construction site on Friday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GREG ABBOTT:""}]"

bartender admitted to doing so while attempting to rob them of less than $150. Thomas Routt Jr., faces two counts of first-degree intentional homicide, armed robbery and felon in possession of a firearm in the February 1 deaths of Gina and Emerson Weingart, the Elkhorn Police Department announced on Friday (February 16) via CBS 58. Routt, a freed parolee who previously served several years in federal prison, opened fire at the Sports Page Bar before swiping between $120 and $140 from a cash register. A witness told police that Routt was playing a video game machine for about 30 minutes before pulling out a gun and ordering the Weingarts and a third person not to move. “The eyewitness said Routt brandished a handgun and pointed it at Gina, the bartender, and ordered them not to move,” police said CBS 58. “The eyewitness said they instinctively got up off their barstool and Routt pointed the gun at the eyewitness and ordered the eyewitness not to move"" before opening fire, taking the money and following the third victim outside and shooting them as they fled. Routt was arrested by the Walworth County Sheriff\'s Office on February 4 while on parole for arson. “Routt subsequently admitted to shooting both Emerson and Gina Weingart and following the eyewitness out the back door and shooting at the eyewitness as they fled,” police said via CBS 58. Gina and Emerson Weingart were identified as the victims fatally wounded in the Sports Page Barr shooting by Jordan Barr, the owner of the sports bar, who described the shooter as a ""coward."" ""Our bartender, Gina, and her husband Emerson, both dear friends of ours, were taken from all of us this morning,"" Barr wrote on the business\' Facebook account. ""The Sports Page Barr staff and regulars have always been more than a tight knit group, a family. Before Gina joined our staff, her and Emerson started coming in and very quickly became close with all of us, staff and patrons alike. ""When I eventually offered Gina a part time job, they were already a part of the family. Their lives were just beginning, and I believe I speak for our entire Sports Page family by saying we are absolutely devastated by what happened. It is a despicable act of violence that has shaken all of us to our core."" Emerson\'s father, Jeff Weingart, told WIS that his son would sit at the bar while Gina worked her part-time shift. “It’s gut-wrenching,” Jeff said. “Somebody saw them. Somebody saw them. I don’t care, you don’t pull something like that off. I can’t believe that it was just her and him in the bar. So somebody saw them, and somebody had to give a description of them, and somebody had to see the car when he drove away, and they better find him.” Elhorn is located about 40 miles from Milwaukee and has an estimated population of 10,000.'}]"
