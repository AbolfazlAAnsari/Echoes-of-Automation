(WWLP) – January brought all the snow we missed in December, but will this trend continue? Massachusetts made up for the lack luster snowfall in December, but the new year is showing we could snow much later than usual. Winter didn’t start off with the snow we know and love. Instead 50-degree days and above average rain ended 2023. Then on January 7th, Westover Air Reserve Base recorded over 11 inches of snow. Even with multiple days of heavy snow, Jackie Concklin of Westfield says this winter could be worse, “This is nothing, usually there’s a lot of snow.” While some may think this winter has been lackluster, we’ve received above average rain and snowfall in the month of January. This could continue into February. The Climate Prediction Center expects temperatures across the northeast to be warmer than average in the next eight to fourteen days. These warmer temperatures won’t guarantee no snow. Most snow days this year have had above freezing temperatures. Not only does that make for wetter snow, but also much heavier snow.

Austin\'s unannounced hospitalization, which was not disclosed to the media or Biden and other senior administration officials for days, raised major questions about transparency and communications within the Biden administration.

But I\'ve learned from this experience, taking this kind of job means losing some of the privacy that most of us expect. The American people have a right to know if their leaders are facing health challenges that might affect their ability to perform their duties even temporarily,"" Austin added. Austin last took questions from the media more than one month ago on Dec. 20 when he visited the USS Gerald R. Ford, an aircraft carrier operating in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Two days later after returning to the United States, Austin underwent surgery to treat prostate cancer, a procedure which required general anesthesia and an overnight stay. His surgery and hospital stay, as well as his diagnosis with prostate cancer in early-December, was not revealed to the president and to senior administration officials until after the New Year when he was hospitalized a second time for complications from the surgery. Video above: Lloyd Austin says he\'s \'still recovering\' Austin remained in the hospital for two weeks, leaving on Jan. 15. He then worked from home until this past Monday, when he returned to the Pentagon for a bilateral meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. At the time, Austin said, ""I feel good and recovering well, but still recovering."" Biden acknowledged earlier this month that Austin’s failure to notify him about his hospitalization was a lapse in judgment. Austin’s chief of staff, Kelly Magsamen, directed a 30-day review of the Pentagon’s processes and procedures for notifying senior national security leaders and the White House when the Defense secretary needs to transfer authorities to the deputy secretary, which was required during Austin’s hospitalization. The Defense Department Inspector General launched a separate investigation of whether the Pentagon had the appropriate policies in places to ensure an effective transfer or power and duties.
