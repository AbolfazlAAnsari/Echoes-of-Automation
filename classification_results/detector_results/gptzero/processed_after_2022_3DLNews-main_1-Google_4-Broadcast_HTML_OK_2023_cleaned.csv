(WAVY) — Deja Taylor, the Virginia mother of the 6-year-old boy who shot his first-grade teacher in January, has been sentenced to 21 months in prison for using marijuana while owning a firearm. Taylor appeared in a U.S. District Court on Wednesday to receive her sentence, the first measure of accountability for January’s shooting. She pleaded guilty in June to federal charges of using drugs while having a gun and lying about her drug use when purchasing the weapon. On January 6, Taylor’s 6-year-old son shot his teacher Abby Zwerner at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, using his mother’s gun. Police say the boy fired one shot at Zwerner in her first-grade classroom. The bullet went through her hand and into her chest. She is still recovering from her injuries. Court documents show police found marijuana in Taylor’s home after the shooting. Federal prosecutors in Virginia argued in court filings that Taylor’s “chronic, persistent and … life-affecting abuse extends this case far beyond any occasional and/or recreational use.” “This case is not a marijuana case,” they wrote. “It is a case that underscores the inherently dangerous nature and circumstances that arise from the caustic cocktail of mixing consistent and prolonged controlled substance use with a lethal firearm.” Taylor’s attorneys had asked the judge for probation and home confinement, according to court filings. They argued Taylor needs counseling for issues that include schizoaffective disorder, a condition that shares symptoms with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. They also said she needs treatment for marijuana addiction. “Addiction is a disease and incarceration is not the cure,” her attorneys wrote. Through a plea agreement, Taylor was set to serve between 18 months to two years in federal prison. Taylor also pleaded guilty to state charges of child neglect. She has a court hearing in December on the state charges. Taylor’s grandfather has had full custody of her son, now age 7, since the shooting, according to court documents. Taylor’s son told authorities he obtained the gun by climbing onto a drawer to reach the top of a dresser, where the firearm was in his mom’s purse. Taylor initially told investigators she had secured her gun with a trigger lock, but investigators never found one. Immediately after the shooting, the child told a reading specialist who restrained him: “I shot that (expletive) dead,” and “I got my mom’s gun last night,” according to search warrants.

(KING) - A Washington state college student is dead and two others are in the hospital after being found with “symptoms consistent with carbon monoxide poisoning” inside a student housing unit. An Evergreen State College residential manager called campus police around 8:30 p.m. Monday when the students inside unit 305 would not answer the door. An officer ended up kicking down the door and, once inside, started performing CPR. The officer and two of the students inside the unit were taken to the hospital. A third student died. He was identified as 21-year-old Jonathan Rodriguez by the Thurston County coroner. It’s believed that the incident was a case of carbon monoxide poisoning. Student Jacob Benjamin, who lives next door, says he watched paramedics remove one of the students who was unconscious. He believes the person was Rodriguez. “They picked him up, and he was naked and unresponsive. His eyes were wide open,” Benjamin said. “It was a lot. I didn’t know them personally, but I didn’t have to.” Executive Vice President Dr. Dexter Gordon says the school is offering support to staff and students impacted by the incident. “It is devastating news for us, and we’re seeking to make sure our students are safe,” Gordon said. The college says it’s fully cooperating with the Washington State Patrol to find out what happened and to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Investigators are focusing on a carbon monoxide alarm that went off earlier in the day, bringing a contractor out to the unit where Rodriguez died. “That’s scary because I’m wondering, ‘Well, are the monoxide alarms working in the dorms?

MUSKOGEE, Okla. — An Oklahoma college serving native and indigenous students for over 100 years could soon be closing its doors for good. Leaders at Muskogee’s Bacone College have a final plea they want their community to know, before the campus heads to auction next month. “Unless someone steps up to the plate and says, ‘we gotcha,’ we’re going to be going down a road nobody knows the outcome of,” Bacone College Interim President Dr. Nicky Michael said. Michael says there is a distinct possibility students at the college will not have an academic home by 2024. “We’re just kind of blown away by all of it,” Michael said. She’s blown away — by the fact she says no one told her or the college’s lawyers a judge recently ordered the college’s campus to be sold at auction next month, the result of an ongoing lawsuit. “We read it in the newspaper, the same as everyone else,” she said. Lawyers for the company MHEC, LLC allege in their lawsuit the college never paid them for HVAC improvement work they performed at the campus several years ago. Michael says the college’s previous president hired to the company to do the work, but they were only supposed to perform the work once the college had set aside all the money it needed to pay the company. This all happened before Michael worked at Bacone. She says it\'s her understanding the previous president allowed MHEC to start and complete work before the college had the proper funds in place. She also says the work wasn’t done well, and to this day several buildings on campus do not have functioning air conditioning. Despite that claim, earlier this year a Muskogee County judge ruled in favor of MHEC, ordering the college to pay them over $1 million for the work completed. Michael says the college doesn’t want to fight the issue further, and has made it clear it would be willing to work out a payment plan with MHEC. “If we were to just take a little more time and get a little more support, we have access to ways to make sure that they get paid,” Michael said. But after a judge’s Nov. 15 order, that payment will come in one, immediate lump sum — in the form of whatever the highest bidder pays when the campus goes to sheriff’s auction on Dec. 14. Michael says she’s really hoping the city, or a tribe, or any combination of groups could step in to save the school. “We want support of the City of Muskogee,” she said. “We want the support of the state of Oklahoma, we’re the oldest college here. We would love the support of tribes.” But if it comes to it, Bacone is prepared to make sure students get the education they came for, even if it’s not on campus. “Our back-up plan is to go online,” Michael said.

Senate Bill 544, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Willis Curdy, revised the state’s laws related to material considered harmful to minors and the distribution of that material on the internet. The bill was signed into law by Gov. Greg Gianforte on May 19 and the law goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2024. Part of SB 544 requires websites where a substantial portion is considered adult material to verify the person’s age before allowing access to the site. The law defines “reasonable age verification methods” as a government-issued ID or “any commercially reasonable method that relies on public or private transactional data to verify the age of the person attempting to access the information is at least 18 years of age or older.” In a statement, Pornhub said it was specifically making the decision to block access at this time due to the government ID age verification requirement, saying, “While safety and compliance are at the forefront of our mission, giving your ID card every time you want to visit an adult platform is not the most effective solution for protecting our users, and in fact, will put children and your privacy at risk.” SEE MORE: Pornhub owner agrees to pay $1.8M to resolve charges SB 544 passed with strong majorities in both houses of the Montana Legislature with members of both parties voting in favor.
