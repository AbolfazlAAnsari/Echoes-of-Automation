News Graphic: Little Lucy, a missing 6-month-old puppy, was found safe and was reunited with her adoptive family. The Haller family had adopted the black lab mix on Jan. 11 from a local animal shelter, the day of a major snowstorm followed by days of sub-zero temperatures. After just a few hours in her new home, Lucy escaped and ran away. The Hallers went looking for her, first in their car and then with flashlights on foot when it got dark. They also posted their plight on Facebook, and within the hour people in the area were spreading the word all over social media. The Hallers put flyers up around town and kept searching. Lisa Haller told the News Graphic that even strangers were out looking for the lost puppy. “I was driving…and I saw a guy in a pickup truck and said, ‘Hey, I lost my dog. Did you see her?’ And he said, ‘Oh, Lucy? I’m looking for Lucy, too.’ ” As days went by — and got colder — Lisa Haller feared the worst. “About halfway through the week, especially after four days of no sightings and with this kind of weather, I just thought there’s no way she survived, that she probably got frostbite and maybe succumbed to a coyote or froze to death,” she told the News Graphic. “It was really emotionally devastating.” A week later, a neighbor called and said, “I have Lucy.” Another neighbor had spotted something dark in the bushes next to her house and discovered that the puppy had dug herself a hole against the house. The one neighbor told the other neighbor who then called the Hallers. Other than being dehydrated and noticeably thinner, Lucy was fine. A veterinary exam found no signs of frostbite or organ failure. Lisa Haller told the News Graphic, “Our family is amazed and grateful for the outpouring of support for the community. She would not have been found without all the help, social media, flyers, searching and prayer. We would love to spread the word to never give up hope in searching for a lost pet.” In Luke’s gospel, Jesus tells the story of a lost sheep that wandered away from the flock and how the Good Shepherd leaves the 99 sheep that are safe in the field to search the countryside. “When he finds it, he joyfully puts it across his shoulders and carries it home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together to celebrate. ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep,’ he says” (Luke 15:4) When Lucy was returned to her home, the Hallers didn’t punish her. They celebrated — the whole community celebrated. It reminded me of three things: The relentless searching of the community to find a lost puppy in a snowstorm and freezing temperatures is but a fraction of the extent Jesus goes to find those who are lost. Not lost puppies, but lost people. He rejoices when someone who was lost is found. Sometimes people don’t want to encounter Jesus because they’re afraid. But no one needs to be afraid of the One who died for them. People who are lost don’t need to fear being found — a party and a celebration awaits. The Bible says so. Lisa Haller said, “Never give up hope in searching for a lost pet.” If God cares about a little puppy, how much more does he care about us? So, never give up hope — spread the word.

Grace Stephens November 20, 2022 The Lady Toppers cut off the Wi-Fi Wednesday as they took down the Lousiana Tech Lady Techsters 64-59 at Diddle Arena. “We had a lot of contributions tonight,” Head Coach Greg Collins said. “And I felt like the second half was more like how we have played and it was nice to see some shots go in finally.” Despite being without their top scorers, guards Acacia Hayes and Destiny Salary, the team returned from a 19-point first-half deficit to earn a much-needed win in conference play. The team still sits at fourth, moving to 14-10 (5-4 CUSA). Junior guard Alexis Mead scored 20 points tonight while grabbing eight rebounds, seven assists, and five steals. Senior guard Teresa Faustino added 11 points, five rebounds, and four steals. The two guards accounted for half of WKU’s total steals. The Lady Toppers forced 21 turnovers with 18 of those being steals. Adding 20 points off those turnovers helped WKU rally back in the second half. The team created mayhem on the court by forcing contested shots and turnovers, allowing them to erase a deficit and close out a game. It was a very low-scoring first quarter for both teams, with LA Tech staying at 10 points for about four minutes before ending the quarter on a 5-0 run. WKU started hot, shooting 50% from the field, before falling flat. In the second quarter, the struggles continued, with the team shooting 30.8% from the field. The Lady Techsters pulled away by as much as 19 in the quarter. Mead led the team in scoring into the half with eight points and five rebounds. The second half was a completely different story. WKU outscored LA Tech 19-8 in the third quarter, holding them to just 3-9 from the field. The defense led the comeback, forcing eight turnovers. The Lady Toppers will return to Diddle Arena when they host Jacksonville State on Saturday at 2 p.m. The game can be watched on ESPN +'}]"

Featuring towering dual 45-foot-tall, 36-inch-wide Vendome Copper and Brass Works column stills, the facility claims the title of the largest all-new independent distillery in Kentucky. The $250+ million project has a production capacity of up to 8.5 million proof gallons or 150,000 barrels of whiskey annually, contributing more than 60 new jobs to the local economy. It\'s the first commercial distillery in the historically dry county since the 1800s. Situated on a 210-acre site, the facility comprises a more than 50,000-square-foot distillery, along with two 20,000-square-foot rickhouses. Plans are underway to expand with a total of 24 aging warehouses by 2030. Additionally, a visitor center featuring a tasting room and restaurant is set to open later this year. Currently, the company is aging nearly 17,000 sourced barrels of whiskey onsite. Design of the distillery was led by Morris Workshop Architects of Lexington. The construction was managed by Doss and Horky Construction of Danville. The project was supported by the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development. Ray Franklin ""Staghorn\'s vision for Garrard County Distilling Co. is to craft the finest whiskeys and spirits in the world at scale to make an immediate impact in the market,"" said Ray Franklin, Staghorn founder and president. ""To support this goal, we will be hiring nothing but the best in the business, respecting long-honored traditions and craftsmanship to assure our products are nothing short of remarkable."" Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear commended Staghorn\'s substantial investment, recognizing its positive impact on Lancaster, Garrard County, and on Kentucky tourism. ""Garrard County Distilling Co. is Staghorn\'s first distillery, and the dedication and size at which they are entering the category is a true testament to the worldwide appeal of bourbon from our great commonwealth,"" Beshear said. Garrard County, which was dry until November 2023, was previously home to about ten small distilleries in the 1800s, when it was an important railroad hub for hemp, flour, and whiskey. The distillery property was formerly owned by Revolutionary War hero James Speed. Onsite production will utilize water drawn from the Lancaster Public Spring aquifer, first tapped by settlers in 1776. Whiskey will be crafted using proprietary yeast and grain sourced locally from within 50 miles of the distillery. Barrel resources will be provided by Independent Stave and ZAK Cooperage. The company will soon announce its head distiller. Garrard County Distilling Co. will be home to All Nations Whiskey, which is available in select markets nationwide, in addition to several yet-to-be-announced whiskey and spirits brands. All Nations Whiskey was named from the poster hung in bars during Carrie Nation\'s temperance crusade in the late 1800s. The tongue-in-cheek posters read: ""All Nations Welcome Except Carrie."" Travelers to the distillery on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail will be able to visit Carry\'s Garrard County birthplace home, which was transported and reconstructed stone-by-stone on the site. ""Communities across Kentucky have benefited greatly from the recent bourbon boom, and now I am pleased to say Garrard County will as well,"" said Garrard County Judge/Executive Chris Elleman. ""Working in close cooperation with Staghorn, we will be bringing more than 60 jobs to the local economy, as well as increased commerce for vendors supporting the facility and tourism dollars. It is a great win for the county."" by Staff January 17, 2024 11:08 AM Subscribe Copyright Smiley Pete Publishing © 2016 Smiley Pete llc. All rights reserved.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:53 pm SOUTH LAUREL — A Bowling Green man was arrested earlier this week by police following an incident which occurred at a motel off of KY 770 in southern Laurel County. Richard Bill Logsdon, 45, was charged with second-degree Disorderly Conduct, third-degree Assault (Police Officer), fourth-degree Assault (Domestic Violence), three counts of third-degree Terroristic Threatening, Menacing, and Public Intoxication. According to the Laurel County Sheriff’s Office, on Wednesday evening, LCSO Deputies Austyn Weddle and Byron Grimes were called to the scene of a motel after receiving complaints of a belligerent individual outside. Upon arrival, Dep. Weddle learned that Logsdon had been shoved to the ground by a bystander for allegedly beating his own mother. The altercation left Logsdon with a head wound, which required stitches. Police say that as they attempted to place Logsdon into custody, he resisted by kicking officers and threatening to kill them once he was released. Additionally, Logsdon allegedly made vulgar remarks to hospital staff when being treated for his head wound. Logsdon was arraigned in Laurel County District Court on Friday and remained at press time lodged in the Laurel County Detention Center with a $25,000 bond.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:53 pm Among the indictments returned by a Laurel grand jury on Jan. 30 were two people charged with sex offenses involving minor age children. Kylin Dewayne Hutton, 24, of Corbin Manor Apartments in Corbin was charged with first-degree rape, first-degree sodomy and second-degree persistent felony offender. The indictment states that Hutton had sexual intercourse with an 11-year-old on June 12 last year. The persistent felony offender charge stems from a prior conviction in Knox Circuit Court in 2019. Stephen Travis Howard, 43, of Pebble Creek Drive in Hyden, KY, is charged with first-degree rape, two counts of first-degree sexual abuse, second-degree fleeing or evading police and second-degree persistent felony offender. Those charges stem from incidents occurring from May 1 through Sept. 30, 2023, in which he allegedly had sexual contact with a 7-year-old. The second charge of sexual abuse involved an 8 ½ year old child. The fleeing and evading charge stems from an incident on Sept. 28, in which Howard refused to stop for police in a vehicular chase. Howard has a prior fleeing and evading police felony conviction in Leslie County from 2021, which constitutes the persistent felony offender charge. Other indictments included: • America Gray, 24, of Todd Road in London, is charged with second-degree forgery. According to the indictment, Gray forged the name of a Laurel Circuit Court Deputy Clerk on jury excuses. The indictment claims that Gray forged the signature of a deputy clerk 86 times between June 1 and Nov. 24, 2023. • Louie Smith, 41, of Pittsburg School Road in Pittsburg, KY, is charged with failure to comply with sex offender registration on Dec. 15. He is additionally charged with first-degree persistent felony offender, having two prior felony convictions in Laurel County in 2013 and 2022. • Trevonte Lamont Harris, 21, of New Orleans Drive in Lexington and Raeqwon Javon Harris, 25, of Thornberry Court in Lexington, were named in a five-count indictment that included first-degree trafficking in controlled substance and trafficking in misrepresented controlled substance on Sept. 18. The trafficking charge claims the two had Fentanyl in their possession. The second charge states they were ""distributing Fentanyl while misrepresenting the identity of the Fentanyl being distributed as a legitimate pharmaceutical product. Other charges were operating a motor vehicle without an operator\'s license, failure to wear seat belt, improper display of registration plate. Raeqwon Harris was also charged with second-degree persistent felony offender, stemming from a prior felony conviction in Fayette Circuit Court for trafficking in a controlled substance in 2019. Any indictment is an accusation only. A defendant is presumed innocent and is entitled to a fair trial at which government must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'It has been a year since the chapel service that didn’t end. On Wednesday, Asbury students and faculty gathered in Hughes Auditorium to remember and celebrate the events that took place on their campus last year. As of Feb 8, a year has passed since a few students decided to stay behind after chapel in Hughes. These chapel services take place three times a week and typically last 50 minutes. This one, however, lasted roughly 384 hours. What started with a small group of students continuing to pray and worship after the seats of Hughes Auditorium cleared turned into a sixteen-day event that brought an estimated 50,000 visitors to the small town of Wilmore. These visitors waited in lines that wrapped around the perimeter of campus, waiting to answer the question: “What was happening in Hughes?” A year later, members of the Asbury community continue to ask themselves that same question. “It is a story that we are all still learning, and it is a story that is still being written,” said Asbury faculty member Jeannie Banter. At the time of the events last February, the sentiment echoed by Asbury University’s students and staff was one of wonder and amazement. This sentiment remains consistent, even a year after the events took place. “Two realities are true at the same time,” campus pastor Greg Haseloff told students at the anniversary celebration. “The Outpouring of the spirit of God was beautiful. And we are still figuring it out a year later.” He addressed students, saying that we are still working out the story’s “complete meaning.” Asbury University has had a history of revivals, including the most well-documented in 1970, known to have lasted 144 hours. Some 53 years later, Asbury found itself in familiar yet starkly new territory. The addition of international media coverage and the immediacy of social media made it so that the story unfolding at Asbury was quickly spread all across America and beyond. Students’ words, songs, and prayers went out to the world. The truly jarring events began when the world came to them. Visitors began showing up from everywhere: South Korea, The Netherlands, Uganda, and beyond. Christian and secular news outlets arrived with cameras and microphones. It started locally, but soon, pictures of Hughes Auditorium appeared in The New York Times and Time Magazine. Tens of thousands of strangers poured into the Asbury Community. It was amazing. It was also frightening. “We kind of felt like we were in a lifeboat,” said Sarah Baldwin, Vice President of Student Life at Asbury. At a lunch event, Baldwin and much of the ministry team and PR team of the university shared some of the details of how they managed the unprecedented events. One of the primary points of discussion among the PR team was the decision to stop live-streaming the services and asking that visitors not record inside Hughes. The team highlighted the intensely private nature of some of the stories being shared. Asbury’s Vice President of Enrollment and Marketing, Jennifer McChord, spoke alongside Abby Laub, the Director of Strategic Communications. Through tears, McChord said they “didn’t want Asbury to be seen as advertising something so personal.” The year anniversary of the celebration highlights the complexity of the events, even 365 days after they took place. Christian and non-Christian media were both baffled by these events. Aaron Griffith wrote in a piece for Time Magazine that “it’s hard to know what to do. It’s hard because, by definition, a revival transcends our human understanding and comprehension.” Zach Meerkreebs, pastor-in-residence at Asbury University, spoke in the chapel the day the Outpouring began. Over the past year, he has served as a prominent figure in helping the public begin to understand the Outpouring. “It was hard,” he said. He described the challenges of the past year and how they have stretched him, and he knows that they have stretched students. “Christ did not come to cancel our humanity,” Meerkreebs said. “So I have to sleep. I have to eat. God didn’t come to make us superheroes.” He reflected on his own struggles to navigate the past year. “It has been disorienting, but it doesn’t mean that it was a bad thing that happened,” As the voices of Asbury itself have reflected, the events of February 2023 are not simple. It would be difficult to argue that 50,000 visitors on campus is not an intrusion on the lives of students and staff. During those sixteen days, some students spent their days in Hughes with their hands raised. Other students, including many Christian students, stayed in their dorms trying to block out the 2 a.m. shouts from outside their window. Meerkreebs touched on the complexity of the response, saying, “I think it’s worth remembering and celebrating with an immense amount of grace and gentleness for those that don’t want to celebrate.” The complexities are infinite, and a year later, thoughts and feelings are still just as messy as they were during the midst of it all. The anniversary chapel was a celebration. It was also an acknowledgment of the events and the different responses to them. In a benediction to the students after the anniversary service, Meerkreebs left Asbury with a prayer and a challenge: “Fall back in love with the ordinary.” It was not an attention-grabbing message or a revved-up cry for the Spirit’s return. Each statement on Hughes’s stage echoed the idea that spirit was still present, even after crowds dispersed. It was a challenge to bring our memory of the extraordinary into the ordinary parts of our lives. One year later, there is still no clear answer as to why or how this occurred. All anyone can seem to agree on is that something happened. Whether someone believes it was the Holy Spirit or merely a sociological phenomenon, Asbury and the rest of the world are still processing what happened last February. Maybe Haseloff put it best during his anniversary statement when he said, “The story is still unfolding.” Your email address will not be published.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:35 pm Clara Brown is a celebrated entrepreneur, philanthropist, and pioneer. American History and Culture When you think of miners, the last thing that likely comes to mind is a woman, but if history has ever taught us anything, it just might be that you can be anything you set your mind to being. So, it should come as no surprise that one former Logan County resident was not just a miner, but she was an entrepreneur, a pioneer, a community leader, a philanthropist, an abolitionist, and a member of Colorado’s Women’s Hall of Fame. Born in early 1800s in Fredericksburg, Spotsylvania County, Va., Clara was born into slavery. At the young age of nine, she came with her mother and their enslavers to Kentucky, ending up in Logan County. Although the law of the era forbid it, Clara married about 1818 to an enslaved man named Richard. Together, they had four children — Richard Jr., Margaret, Paulina Ann, and Eliza Jane, who were twins. But married life and being a mother would be taken from Clara when the family was separated at a sale after their enslaver, Ambrose Smith, died in 1835. Finally, Clara’s freedom was granted according to Kentucky state law by George Brown’s heirs, the owner from whom she took her surname, after his death in 1857. This meant that Clara had no choice but to leave the state within a year or risk being re-enslaved. With her freedom, her first task was trying to locate her family to be reunited with them. Clara’s search ended in heartbreak when she discovered her husband and daughter Margaret both died while still enslaved, and her son Richard Jr., was untraceable since he had been sold many times over. Having lost daughter Paulina at a young age to drowning, that only left Eliza Jane to search for. Having no family left to locate, Clara headed West with a wagon train, where she served as a cook and midwife to pay her passage. Her travels took her to Fort Leavenworth, Kan.; St. Louis, Mo., and finally to Denver, Colo. Shortly after arriving in Denver, Clara relocated to Central City, which is in Gilpin County, and opened the first commercial laundry operation. She also sold meals to settlers in the area. Through hard work, Clara saved enough to acquire Denver and Boulder-area housing and mining properties worth around $10,000 (the equivalent of $369,573.49 in today’s money) by 1865. Clara was known for providing housing and food for the townspeople, acts that earned her the nickname “Aunt Clara.” Through all of this personal success, Clara never stopped hoping to find her last remaining child. Finding herself working for Colorado’s Republican Governor Frederick Pitkin, Clara helped former enslaved men and women establish themselves in her new home state. In this new position, Clara’s search for her family began once more in Kentucky, but her search was initially unsuccessful. However, Clara is credited with helping 16 freed men and women relocate to Colorado from her first trip to Kentucky. She was also known to have paid passage for 26 family members from Kentucky to Colorado. In 1882, her search led her to finding Eliza Jane and a granddaughter, Cindy, in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Acknowledgements of Clara’s work and community contributions began in 1884 when she was the first woman voted into the Society of Colorado Pioneers. Clara died Oct. 23, 1885. Denver May John Routt and Colorado Governor Benjamin Eaton attended her funeral. The Savannah Courier in Savannah, Tenn. paid tribute to Clara on its front page issue dated Jan. 7, 1886. In it, it was said of Clara that “She was the only female member of the Colorado Pioneer’s Association and was the pet of that body, number over 400 people.” It went on to say, “In an early day she was engaged in numerous noble charities, turned her home into a school, a hotel, and general refuge for those who were sick or in poverty. If those who made her home their home were able to pay her for what they received, she accepted it; if not, it did not matter.” More than a dozen books have been written about Clara’s life and legacy. Other memorials to Clara include a chair in the Central City, Colo Opera House, a stained glass window in the Colorado State Capitol rotunda, and a bronze statue of her in the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. In 2017, a short documentary titled “Clara: Angel of the Rockies” was filmed. The most recent accolade bestowed upon Clara was her induction into the Colorado Business Hall of Fame in Jan. 2022.

Chance of rain 50%. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:25 pm Special counsel Robert Hur Robert Hur promised a ""fair, impartial, and dispassionate"" investigation when the veteran prosecutor was appointed special counsel a year ago to look into allegations that Joe Biden mishandled classified documents. Hur, in his final report released this week, absolved Biden of any criminal wrongdoing, but ignited a political firestorm with his disparaging comments on the president\'s mental state. Hur\'s remarks about Biden\'s poor memory in his nearly 400-page report were attacked as ""gratuitous and inappropriate"" by the White House and seized upon by Republicans to push claims that the 81-year-old president is ""unfit"" to hold office. Hur, a Republican, was named by Attorney General Merrick Garland in January 2023 to look into Biden\'s alleged mishandling of classified materials after serving as vice president to Barack Obama. Announcing the appointment of a veteran of the Donald Trump administration to carry out the delicate probe into a sitting Democratic president, Garland said he was ""confident Mr Hur will carry out his responsibilities in an even-handed and urgent manner."" ""I will conduct the assigned investigation with fair, impartial, and dispassionate judgment,"" Hur said in a statement at the time. ""I intend to follow the facts swiftly and thoroughly, without fear or favor, and will honor the trust placed in me to perform this service."" A graduate of prestigious Harvard College and Stanford Law School, Hur worked as a law clerk to former US Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist. He served as an assistant US attorney in Maryland from 2007 to 2014 and as a senior aide to then-Justice Department deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein from 2017 to 2018. In comments to The Washington Post at the time, Rosenstein welcomed the appointment of his former deputy to look into Biden\'s handling of classified documents. ""Rob understands the need to ignore the politics and focus on what matters,"" Rosenstein said. ""He\'s not going to be influenced by partisan political considerations."" In 2017, Hur was appointed by Republican president Trump to be the US attorney for Maryland. He was confirmed unanimously by the Senate and served as the state\'s chief prosecutor until Biden took office. In his report released on Thursday, Hur said Biden had ""willfully retained"" classified documents but the ""evidence is not sufficient to convict"" and no criminal charges should be brought. Hur also described Biden as a ""well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory"" who allegedly could not remember when his son Beau died or the dates of his vice presidency. Biden defended himself in a surprise appearance before reporters on Thursday, saying ""my memory is fine,"" and Vice President Kamala Harris attacked Hur\'s comments on Friday as ""clearly politically motivated"" ahead of the November election expected to pit Biden against Trump once again. cl/acb Originally published on doc.afp.com, part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange.

The good news is we escape the dark hours of winter, but there are some side effects even if spring can\'t get here soon enough. What is daylight saving time saving? Hint: it may not actually be time or money Here\'s what you need to know about DST in 2024: Participating states turn clocks forward an hour on the second Sunday in March during the spring. Daylight Saving Time ends on the first Sunday of November in the fall of each year and that\'s when states turn clocks back an hour. In the U.S., clocks will officially spring forward at 2 a.m. Sunday, March 10, 2024. We lose an hour of sleep when the clocks ""spring forward"" and are turned ahead at 2 a.m. for one hour when Daylight Saving Time begins. In the fall when DST ends, clocks ""fall back"" an hour in November. That is when people gain an hour of sleep. Clocks fall back on Sunday, Nov. 3 in 2024. In an interview with Time Magazine, author Michael Downing cited his book, ""Spring Forward: The Annual Madness of Daylight Saving Time,"" to explain how Amtrak and the railroads were the main reason clocks change at 2 a.m. for DST. There were no trains leaving the station at 2 a.m. on Sundays in New York City when Daylight Saving Time was established. ""Sunday morning at 2 a.m. was when they would interrupt the least amount of train travel around the country,” Downing said. Why does daylight saving time exist?: Unpacking the century-long beef over DST As of July 25, 2022, the U.S. Department of Transportation noted that only Hawaii and parts of Arizona do not participate in daylight saving time. The Navajo Nation is the lone exception in Arizona. The territories of American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands also do not participate. According to the website, states may exempt themselves from observing daylight saving time by state law in accordance with the Uniform Time Act, as amended. Kentucky first observed daylight saving time in 1918, when the Standard Time Act established daylight saving time to conserve electricity during World War I. After the war was over, daylight saving was no longer national law and became a local option. Between 1918 and today, Kentucky observed daylight saving time for 75 years, according to timeanddate.com. For a while, cities across Kentucky were inconsistent, with some observing the time change and others not. But starting in 1970, Time and Date AS has tracked observance of daylight saving time in Kentucky every year. Over the years, researchers have tried to tie your body getting an hour less of sleep that night to a variety of issues, including an increase in car crashes and health problems such as heart attacks and strokes. In 2019, Kentucky Republican Reps. Bart Rowland of Tompkinsville and Brandon Reed of Hodgenville pre-filed a bill to do away with resetting clocks every six months and instead use daylight saving time all year long. To do so, however, requires authorization by the federal government. Under federal law, states are allowed not to observe daylight saving time, with Arizona and Hawaii being the lone states to do so. States are not allowed to stay on daylight time throughout the year. Despite the Sunshine Protection Act being unanimously approved by the U.S. Senate in 2022, there is no permanent end in sight. The bill was not signed into law by the U.S. House of Representatives, citing other priorities that needed to be addressed before tackling DST, according to The Hill. Thus, the bill has not been signed into law by President Joe Biden. Rep.

Showers and a possible thunderstorm during the evening will give way to cloudy skies after midnight. Low 66F. Winds SSW at 5 to 10 mph. Chance of rain 80%. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:06 pm Two men wait outside Washington Street Community Warming Center in Paducah to secure a bed for the night in this Jan. 29 photo. The Safer Kentucky Act, a wide-ranging crime bill, has been approved by the Kentucky House of Representatives and is now on its way to the Senate. The bill cracks down on the fentanyl epidemic in Kentucky and increases the charges for repeat offenders of violent crimes. It also proposes a newly created charge called unlawful camping. That charge would make it illegal for homeless people to sleep anywhere not designated for sleeping or camping. Homeless people could face up to 90 days in jail and $250 in fines for the second offense and every one after. That’s because unlawful camping would be classified as a class B misdemeanor. One Paducah organization that works closely with the city’s homeless population said this bill would only hurt the community — not help. Jim Trimble describes homelessness as a bigger issue than some may think. As co-founder and pastor at Community Kitchen, Trimble sees people from all backgrounds searching for help with housing. “A lot of them are just displaced, or they’ve got chemical and substance dependency or they’ve got mental challenges. They’ve just kind of fell through the loopholes,” Trimble said. Washington Street Community Warming Center does offer shelter for up to 25 people, but only on nights when it’s cold enough. Trimble said there needs to be a year-round solution. “It’s just a Band-Aid. It’s an essential that they have, feeding them, but they need some much more to move toward that independent living,” said Trimble Trimble said the Safer Kentucky Act doesn’t fix the homelessness problem; the only way to solve it is by giving people the resources to get back on their feet. “We need a designated place for individuals to begin to get some skillsets — life skills, learn skills, work skills, budgeting skills,” Trimble said. Trimble has a message for lawmakers proposing the Safer Kentucky Act. He asks them to help agencies create these spaces to get people the help they need. “Maybe put a pot of money into that place and to have coaches available for them,” said Trimble. Four state representatives from west Kentucky — Chris Freeland, Richard Heath, Mary Beth Imes, and Wade Williams — are sponsors on the bill. The Sun reached out to all four representatives multiple times Monday to hear their response to the criticism. Freeland was the only one to respond, saying, “We want to do everything we possibly can to help people in that situation…This just helps these bigger cities, like Louisville and Lexington, deal with the situation and get a handle on it.” If the Senate also passes the Safer Kentucky Act, it will move to Gov. Andy Beshear’s desk for approval or veto. If he vetoes the bill, the House and Senate can choose to override his decision. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular images.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:53 pm CATLETTSBURG An Ashland man was sentenced to eight years in prison for brutally beating a woman in early 2023. James D. Mills, 27, was booked into Boyd County Detention Center Feb. 28 after Boyd County Sheriff’s deputies responded to a residence on the 1800 block of Ponderosa Court and located a bloodied woman. In the arrest citation, the deputy reported blood was present on the front door of the home and throughout the walls, couches and bathrooms. “The entire house was in dismantle,” the deputy reported. According to previous reports, Mills was seated on the couch inside the residence on the officers’ arrival. Deputies interviewed the injured woman on scene, who, according to court records, presented fresh bruises, swollen eyes and was actively bleeding. Although she originally told officers she was dragged off the porch by a dog, she later admitted it was Mills who caused her injuries by beating her while under the influence and continuing the assault when she attempted to leave. During his arrest, Mills was accused of irate behavior and kicking the patrol car’s door into the arresting deputy’s face, causing a laceration to his eye. Mills was indicted on charges of first-degree assault, third-degree assault on an officer and simple possession of an unspecified drug. On Thursday in Boyd County Circuit Court, Mills appeared for final sentencing after reaching a plea negotiation with prosecutors. Per the agreement, Mills was sentenced to eight total years for his convictions of second-degree assault, third-degree assault on an officer, drug possession and possession of drug paraphernalia. Whitney Davis, Mills’s appointed attorney, said Mills did not wish to give any final statement during the hearing.

Madden converted three field goals and Lewko splashed another “3”. But it was also the Hornet defense that was bringing them back. Hancock County limited McLean County to just seven third quarter points while trimming the margin to six points to begin the fourth. Revelett found his form again during the final eight minutes as the Cougars closed out the game with an 18-13 run. Hancock County shot 50% from the field. They were 3 of 6 from beyond the arc and 10 of 18 from the line. McLean’s shooting stats were not posted. They made 14 of 17 foul shots. Lewko finished with 13 points, two rebounds, one steal and one block. Madden had 12 points, seven boards and two steals, Morris had nine points, four boards, five assists, one steal and one block, Shultz had five points, two boards and two steals, Payne had four points, four boards, one steal and three blocks, Camden Lucas had two points, two boards and two steals, Tyce Boling had two points and one board, Keegan Wilson had one point, one board and two assists, and Cooper Jones had one point and one steal. Revelett led McLean with 16 points. Meade County’s defense was stifling in the first half of a 59-42 win over Hancock County during a varsity game played at HCHS Friday. Wilson scored inside and later hit from beyond the arc, but that was it offensively for the Hornets and the Greenwave won the first quarter 10-5. Peyton Johnston converted a 3-point play and Trevor Ling knocked down a “3” as Meade won the second frame and led 24-13 at the half. Morris, Lucas, Wilson and Jones all scored two points each for the Hornets as they fought to stay close to their district rivals. Hancock County increased its offensive output in the second half, but Meade County did as well. Three’s by Lewko and Shultz in the fourth were countered by 9 of 11 foul shooting from the visitors down the stretch. Hancock County shot 31% from the field. They were 3 of 11 from long range and 13 of 20 from the stripe. Meade County shot 38% from the field. They made 5 of 22 shot from beyond the arc and were 18 of 28 from the foul line. Wilson led the Hornets with 13 points and three rebounds. Payne had six points and three boards, Morris had six points, six boards and two steals, Shultz had five points and two boards, Lucas had four points and four assists, Madden had three points, eight boards, three assists and four steals, Lewko had three points and three boards, and Jones had two points and two rebounds. Johnston and Hayden Shouse led Meade with 17 points each. By Steve Wimmer In what format do you prefer to read Clarion Special Editions/Sections? View Results'}]"

a spirits store, bourbon lounge, and wine and cheese bar is opening soon at 211 Rosemont Garden. Managing member Megan Winfield and her husband, manager/owner and West Sixth Brewing co-founder Brady Barlow, are opening Cibon, which pays homage to a favorite weekend wine/charcuterie cafe hangout from their time living in Rochester, New York. They asked the former owner for permission to use the name of the now-shuttered café, and she agreed, even sending them a Cibon sign, Barlow said. The well-traveled couple has visited nearly 40 countries over the past two decades and want to bring their favorite food and beverage experiences and gift items from around the world to a Lexington audience, they said. “It’s not going to be froufrou,” Barlow said. “It’s going to be nice, the furnishings are going to be nice, but it’s not the kind of place you’re going to have to wear a blazer to get a cheese plate.” Hopes were to open by Valentine’s Day, but it will be a bit longer to get everything “just so,” Barlow said. They’ll be offering wine and food pairings, rare bourbons, some beer, and local and imported food as well as food-related gifts, including favorites gleaned from their trips. “We try to see the local flavor of every place that we go,” Barlow said. In other local food and beverage news: After operating as a home bakery for several years, Wild Lab Bakery is moving to a new location, according to co-owner Andrew McGraw, with plans to open a storefront at 819 National Ave. in February. “We outgrew our home bakery and are excited for this opportunity to expand our operation so we can bake for more farmers markets and walk-in customers,” McGraw said. The shop will be open Wed.-Sat., with sourdough loaves, bagels, cookies, and coffee available for walk-ins; there will be no need to pre-order. “We hope to expand the menu once we have our feet under us,” he added. Open since September 2017, Midway-based Brown Barrel is expanding not only to Frankfort, but to Georgetown. Owner J.P. Gibson says he’s always had his eye on those towns, but the ideal buildings only came available recently, and nearly the same time, so he leapt at the opportunities. The Frankfort location at 204 W. Broadway should open mid-February, and Georgetown at 135 E. Main St. in early March if not sooner, Gibson said. The restaurants will have the same menu and atmosphere of fine dining in a fast-casual atmosphere that diners have come to love at the original location, he said. Among the top-selling sandwiches is a salmon BLT on a brioche bun with sorghum apple cider glaze and crispy bacon; other favorite items include beef skewers with a loaded potato cake and port wine reduction, and blackened chicken ravioli. Gibson said one key to success has been daily features at lunch and dinner, whether it’s an elk filet, sea bass, halibut, lobster, or another special entree he and the chefs have cooked up. He said the restaurant is whatever you want it to be — whether it’s fine dining, a tasty sandwich, or game-day apps. “I think that’s why we’ve been popular is we’ve been so versatile,” he said. The Mediterranean and halal restaurant Yaffa Grill has opened at 98 Finley Dr. in Georgetown, with menu items including kebabs, shawarma, falafel, beef, lamb, fish and vegetarian entrees, hummus, soup, sides, and baklava. Open every Saturday, Ghost Fox Winery has opened a tasting room at Chrisman Mill Rd. in Nicholasville after Ghost Fox purchased and renovated the former Chrisman Mill Winery. Ghost Fox Winery offers white wines that include oaked chardonnay and spicy cucumber, and reds that include cabernet and merlot. The winery has already earned three medals in the 2023 Kentucky Commonwealth Commercial Wine Competition, according to its Facebook page. Golden Flame Hot Wings has opened at 141 Rojay Dr. Chocolate Holler, the coffee and chocolate shop on Old Vine Street which announced a closure late last year, has now reopened under new ownership. Representatives from Old Vine Bistro, located in the same shopping center, announced that owner Larry Dean has decided to close the restaurant and retire from the service industry. “You’ve seen him as a part of the infamous A1A, Wines on Vine, Chathams, OV Bistro, and many others,” an announcement read. “After a lifetime of great times with great friends, he’s going to take a break!” Buffalo Trace has released a collaborative bourbon label with country music great Chris Stapleton, called “Traveller Whiskey.” The libation’s tasting notes describe its aroma as having “complex aromas of vanilla, aged fruit, and buttery shortbread, rounded off by caramel and a touch of oak,” with a palate with light sweetness “followed by spice, toasted nut and oak flavors, and a robust finish.” A few restaurants recently announced their closure, including Broussard’s Delta Kitchen in Georgetown, which closed Dec. 24 after a five-year run. On a Facebook post, the popular restaurant cited the cost of supplies, labor, and the fact that the lease was up. Another restaurant that closed its doors is Kismet at the Burl Arcade, which began as a pop-up, officially opened in 2020 and closed Jan. 21, 2024. “Thank you Lexington for the love and we can’t wait to see what the future has in store for us,” their Facebook farewell post said. The Social Vegan at Greyline Station announced its closure recently, characterizing it as not a goodbye but a “see ya later.” Its website notes that the restaurant has expanded to Tallahassee, Florida, with plans to become the first national vegan restaurant chain in the United States. According to the Lexington Herald-Leader, Osaka Japanese Restaurant is opening a second location this year in the Great Acres development off Leestown Rd. Cosmic Fry owner Katrina Buster recently announced on social media plans to open a new restaurant this spring at 1987 North Broadway with burgers, ice cream, all-day breakfast and special events. After several years operating as a food truck with a location inside the Pasta Garage incubator, Moody Mike’s will soon be providing vegan fare at Broomwagon Coffee + Bikes, a north Lexington coffee shop that recently closed the restaurant arm of its operation.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:43 pm The US Supreme Court appeared poised on Thursday to toss out a state court ruling that would bar Donald Trump from running for president again. During two hours of high-stakes arguments, both conservative and liberal members of the nation\'s highest court expressed concern about having individual states decide which candidates can be on the presidential ballot this November. It is the most consequential election law case to reach the court since it halted the Florida vote recount in 2000 with Republican George W. Bush narrowly leading Democrat Al Gore. The question before the nine justices is whether Trump is ineligible to appear on the Republican presidential primary ballot in Colorado because he engaged in an insurrection -- the January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol by his supporters. Colorado\'s Supreme Court, citing the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, ruled in December that Trump, the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican nomination, should be kicked off the ballot because of his role in the January 6 attack on Congress. Jonathan Mitchell, a former solicitor general of Texas representing Trump, denied that the events of January 6 constituted an insurrection and said only Congress can disqualify a candidate. ""The Colorado Supreme Court\'s decision is wrong and should be reversed,"" Mitchell said, adding that it would ""take away the votes of potentially tens of millions of Americans."" Jason Murry, representing Colorado voters who brought the case, countered that the 14th Amendment clearly bars anyone from holding public office if they engaged in ""insurrection or rebellion"" after once pledging to support and defend the Constitution. The 77-year-old Trump, speaking to reporters in Florida, said he hoped for a ruling in his favor. Pointing out his dominance in Republican opinion polls, he said: ""Can you take the person that\'s leading everywhere and say, \'Hey, we\'re not gonna let you run?\' You know, I think that\'s pretty tough to do, but I\'m leaving it up to the Supreme Court."" Colorado and more than a dozen other states are to hold their presidential nominating contests on March 5 -- also known as ""Super Tuesday"" -- and the court is expected to issue its ruling before then. Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, expressed concern over what he called the ""daunting consequence"" of upholding the state court ruling and warned it could lead to ""disqualification proceedings on the other side."" ""I would expect that a goodly number of states will say \'Whoever the Democratic candidate is, you\'re off the ballot,\'"" Roberts said. Justice Elena Kagan, a liberal, and several other justices, three of whom were nominated by Trump, appeared to be skeptical about leaving ballot issues to individual states. ""I think that the question that you have to confront is why a single state should decide who gets to be president of the United States?"" Kagan said. ""Why should a single state have the ability to make this determination not only for their own citizens but for the rest of the nation?"" ""Different states can have different procedures,"" Murray replied. ""Some states may allow insurrectionists to be on the ballot."" Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative, said disqualifying Trump would have ""the effect of disenfranchising voters to a significant degree."" ""The reason we\'re here is that president Trump tried to disenfranchise 80 million Americans who voted against him and the Constitution doesn\'t require that he be given another chance,"" Murray replied. About 20 demonstrators, some carrying signs reading ""Trump Is A Traitor"" and ""Remove Trump,"" protested outside the Supreme Court. The high court has historically been loath to get involved in political questions, but it is taking center stage in this year\'s White House race. Besides the Colorado case, the Supreme Court may also agree to hear an appeal by Trump of a lower court ruling that he is not immune from criminal prosecution as a former president and can be tried on charges of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election. Trump was impeached by the Democratic-majority House of Representatives for inciting an insurrection but was acquitted by the Senate. cl/acb Originally published on doc.afp.com, part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 6:06 pm Kim Thompson is happy her adult son, who is intellectually disabled, lives with her. “I want him at home,” the Louisville woman said of her son, Forest Thompson-Bell, 27. “I want to be very clear about that.” But Thompson, 54, is among thousands of Kentucky parents or other caregivers who worry about what will happen when they die or become unable to care for disabled adult children because of age or infirmity. “It’s a constant worry,” Thompson said. “As we all age, we tend to think about what’s going to happen when we are no longer capable of working or supporting them.” Now, Thompson and other advocates are joining a fight to end long wait lists for help through Kentucky Medicaid for programs that provide activities, personal care, daily living assistance, and, when needed, residential care in a supervised setting such as a group home. Their goal: convince the Kentucky General Assembly to fully fund such programs over the next eight years and eliminate the wait list that now numbers nearly 13,000 individuals, some who face decades waiting for aid. For example, at the current rate, it would take 168 years to serve the more than 8,000 people waiting for the program known as “Michelle P.,” which pays for day programs, supported employment and other activities. “These are people with disabilities who deserve to have these services and the state is not making them available to them,” said longtime human needs advocate Sheila Schuster. The programs currently serve about 33,000 people and openings are rare, usually occurring when a client dies. To start cutting the wait lists, the proposal’s price tag for the next two budget years alone is $211 million — $60 million in state money and the rest from the federal government which provides about 70% of the funding, according to projections worked out by advocates. That would add 3,180 new slots over the next two years, with more slots contemplated in every biennial budget through 2032. Schuster acknowledges it could be a “big fight” for that amount of money in the current legislative session where lawmakers will adopt the state’s next two-year budget. But with the state sitting on a record budget surplus of $3.7 billion, Schuster said she and a group called Advocates for Reforming Medicaid Services, or ARMS, believe it’s time to start. “We do have the money if we’re willing to spend it,” said Schuster, executive director of the group Advocacy Action Network. Parents afraid to die Currently, 12,723 people are on wait lists for six state Medicaid programs, known as “waivers,” that provide special services for individuals with intellectual, physical or developmental disabilities, brain injuries or other limitations. The longest: 8,398 are waiting for a slot in the “Michelle P. waiver,” named for a young woman who served as the lead plaintiff in a federal lawsuit that successfully led Kentucky in 2008 to expand such Medicaid services. Mary Hass, an advocate for individuals with brain injuries, said older parents are afraid of dying without a plan to care for disabled children. She recently spoke with one mother, 92, whose daughter, in her 50s, is on a wait list for help. Another parent’s young adult son will be in his 90s before he’s eligible for help, based on the current wait list, said Hass, chair of the Brain Injury Association of America-Kentucky chapter. “None of us is going to live forever,” Hass said. The ARMS group has found an ally in state Sen. Whitney Westerfield, a Christian County Republican, who adopted its proposal in his Senate Bill 34, a sweeping measure to provide more services to help families, especially with young children. Westerfield said he included the ARMS proposal after learning about the lengthy wait lists for individuals with disabilities. “I had no idea until about a year ago that we had waiting lists that were many, many, many years long,” he said. “That’s unconscionable that there are Kentuckians who need this help, deserve this help and who are eligible for this help that aren’t getting it for most of their lives or all of their lives.” And Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, announced last month he is including 750 new slots to reduce the wait list in his two-year budget proposal to the General Assembly — a significant increase over the 50 or so slots per year the state has added in recent budgets. Advocates said Beshear’s plan is a start but much more is needed to make a meaningful dent in the lengthy wait lists. And with a Republican supermajority in control of both chambers, it’s unclear how much legislative leaders are willing to commit even as they try to limit spending to allow for a third cut in the state income tax in future years to eventually eliminate Kentucky’s income tax. Schuster said advocates are preparing to make their case to lawmakers. “I’m going to say we have a fighting chance,” she said. “We know they have the money.” ‘What’s the plan?’ Advocates also say they are seeking better management of the wait lists spread among six different programs. They acknowledge there likely is some duplication among the 12,723 people now waiting for slots in the various programs administered by the Cabinet for Health and Family Services. Some families sign up for several waiting lists in hopes of getting services through one. For example, they may sign up for the Michelle P. program which pays for services in the community, such as adult day centers or supported employment. Meanwhile, they sign up for a separate program known as Supports for Community Living which pays for full-time residential living in a small group home or assistance in the individual’s home. And some may already be getting help through the Michelle P. waiver while waiting for the residential program. “There are people in that waiver whose needs are being met,” said Steve Shannon, a mental health advocate and member of the ARMS coalition. “However, they are living with aging parents who at some point can no longer provide the support. What’s the plan at that point?” “Most folks would feel better knowing they have an option,” added Shannon, who represents Kentucky’s community mental health centers. Advocates say lawmakers question the accuracy of the wait list numbers because of potential duplication and they agree the state needs a better system of keeping track. “I think we have to do a better job of waiting list management,” Shannon said. ‘Why can’t Kentucky keep up?’ In Louisville, Forest Thompson-Bell leads a busy life, said his mother, Kim Thompson. With financial help from the Michele P. waiver he attends a day program. He’s learning job and life skills. He’s in a choir for individuals with disabilities and participates in Special Olympics, where he excels in competitive cheerleading, his mother said. He’s also enrolled in a performing arts program where he’s learning the basics of theater, playwriting, acting and directing. “He’s quite busy,” Thompson said. Thompson said she’s grateful to have a flexible schedule that allows her to get her son to all his activities and medical appointments as well as advocate for her son and others with special needs. But Thompson said her ongoing concern is what happens when she can’t do that anymore. An assurance Forest has a slot in the program that covers residential care would ease that concern for her and many other parents, Thompson said. “Ideally, I would like the waiting list to end today,” she said. “As an advocate, I would say we really do need to look at how this got backlogged in the first place. Why can’t Kentucky keep up?” Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles. Sign up now to get our FREE breaking news coverage delivered right to your inbox.

Stephen Chase Randolph, 34, of Harrodsburg, and the other four defendants were convicted following a bench trial before U.S. District Judge Jia M. Cobb on Friday, Feb. 2, according to a Department of Justice press release. Randolph and four other defendants—Ryan Samsel, 40, of Bristol, Pennsylvania; James Tate Grant, 31, of Cary, North Carolina; Paul Russell Johnson, 38, of Lanexa, Virginia; and Jason Benjamin Blythe, 28, of Fort Worth, Texas—were convicted of civil disorder. Randolph and Samsel were found guilty of assaulting Capitol Police officer Caroline Edwards with a deadly or dangerous weapon—a metal crowd control barrier. Randolph was also convicted of an additional felony charge of assaulting, resisting, or impeding another officer. In addition to the felonies, the defendants were convicted of a misdemeanor charge for committing an act of physical violence on Capitol grounds. Following the verdict, Samsel and Grant were held in custody, while Randolph and the other two were allowed to leave. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for June 13, according to the Department of Justice. According to evidence presented during the trial, Randolph and the other four defendants participated in the first breach of the restricted Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, 2021, and led the initial attack on the United States Capitol Police. Their attack paved the way for thousands of rioters to storm the Capitol grounds, prosecutors say. At about 12:50 p.m., Samsel approached the first of two barricades police had set up, opened a section, entered the restricted grounds, and approached the Capitol via the Pennsylvania Walkway. This, federal prosecutors argued, marked the first breach of the restricted perimeter. Randolph, Johnson, Blythe and others in the crowd followed them past the first barricade and approached officers standing behind the second barricade, according to the press release. Randolph was joined by some of the other defendants in lifting a linked metal bike rack barricade off the ground. driving it towards Capitol Police, striking one officer in the face. According to the press release, the officer was thrown backward and slammed their head twice: first against a metal handrail, then against the stairs, losing consciousness and suffering a concussion. Another officer was driven several feet backward by the metal bike rack barricade until the back of their body ran into the stairwell and handrail behind them. Prosecutors say Randolph jumped over the barricade and grabbed an officer, joined by two other defendants. Capitol Police forced Randolph and the others to release the officer and back away. According to the press release, when the barricades were down, the defendants and the rest of the rioters quickly overwhelmed the police. The rioters, including Randolph and the other four defendants, then walked to the Capitol building. All five defendants remained at the Capitol for hours, according to the press release. Randolph, a resident of Harrodsburg, was arrested by FBI agents on April 20, 2021. Federal agents were able to track him down because of his online history. On images of the Jan. 6 attack, agents described Randolph as wearing a gray Carhartt toboggan, a black jacket with a breast pocket on each side and stitching detail on each sleeve, a gray turtleneck, black gloves with a red stripe, and jeans. The FBI was able to match those images with images from an Instagram account that apparently belonged to Randolph’s girlfriend, as well as other social media accounts. When the FBI photographed Randolph standing outside his workplace on March 3, 2021, he was wearing the same hat he’d been pictured wearing during the Capitol assault, according to the court documents. According to a statement of facts filed by the FBI, undercover agents visited Randolph at his place of work on April 13. “I was in it,” Randolph is quoted as telling the agents. “It was f*****g fun.” A week after being interviewed by undercover operatives, Randolph was arrested by FBI agents executing a federal search warrant at a house on East Lexington Street.

Roberts, Kenergy Board Rep. for Hancock County Brent Wigginton and GRADD Rep. Colie Smith examine maps of the county that show numbers of those with no internet and with low internet speed. A BEAD (Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program) Stakeholder Meeting was held on Friday, January 12th at the Hancock County Administration Building. It was the beginning step in applying for some of the funding that will be available soon statewide through the Federal Infrastructure Act. Every state will be receiving money for broadband, and Kentucky will be getting $1,086,172,536.68, to be used for underserved and unserved areas. Judge-Executive Johnny “Chic” Roberts, Kenergy Board Representatives for Hancock County Brent Wigginton and Richard Basham, both representing the HC Industrial Foundation, and Regional Resiliency Coordinator/Economic Development Specialist with GRADD Colie Smith began the process at this meeting, of identifying more exact numbers of what areas don’t yet have internet, and that have slow internet speed, in an effort for Hancock County to receive the maximum amount possible of this funding. “Basically, it is a new pot of money coming down from the federal government to the state, all states, but KY is getting over a billion dollars to where internet providers can apply to bring it to unserved/underserved areas,” Roberts said. “At some point in the process, what we’ll want folks to do is be able to say, ‘My internet service provider is this, and this is supposed to be my service but after I did my speed test I’m not getting that service.’ And, we’re going to challenge these (existing) maps. There’s always been a question about who actually has the service that these maps show. They may show that an area of the county is covered, but in reality they’re not because if you’re in a census block where somebody has a certain amount of service, then they assume that everybody in the block is covered.” Any internet service provider that wants to provide to these unserved/underserved areas can apply for some of these dollars statewide, whether it be AT&T, Comcast, Conexon Connect, TDS and any other company involved in wired broadband (this excludes wireless). “What their hope is,” Roberts continued, “is they would be able to get some of that money for this Kenergy region for the underserved areas. That would help expedite the Kenergy/Conexon project, which is underway. We finally have people in Hancock County that are now connected. Conexon is still committed to going to every place in Hancock County that has a Kenergy meter. This is just money to help them finance their project. And, if another provider gets some of that money, there might be a little competition going on in that area. Which would, ultimately, help the consumer. But Conexon is still committed to doing their whole project. Their commitment is, if you have a Kenergy meter in Hancock County you’re going to be offered this service. For Kenergy/Conexon – this joint venture/partnership, it’s about a $150 million dollar project. That’s for the whole Kenergy region. So what monies they can get back would help alleviate some of that pressure and maybe help expedite the whole project.” For more details on the Office of Broadband Development’s Five-Year Action Plan for expansion of high-speed internet in Kentucky (informed by data and research and local coordination with local leaders, community, and industry partners), please visit the website: digitalequity.ky.gov.

The two most prolific offenses in Conference-USA clashed for the first time this season and the Hilltoppers made the Bulldogs look like nothing more than a pup. This marks only the second conference loss that LA Tech has suffered this year, with the first coming against the Sam Houston Bearkats on Jan. 6. The two teams came into the game sitting among the top of Conference-USA in rebound statistics, with the Bulldogs only 0.1 rebound behind the Hilltoppers in first. However, when it came down to it, Western Kentucky’s ability to bring down the boards was a driving factor in their win. “I thought our guys did a really good job on the backboard.” Head Coach Steve lutz said. “They’re the number one offensive rebounding team in the league. For us to out-rebound them and have 13 offensive rebounds was obviously key to us winning the game.” First Half In true WKU fashion, the Hilltopper defense started poorly against the second-best offense in C-USA. After a difficult first six minutes of gameplay, WKU found themselves on the wrong end of a 21-9 score. Not only were the Bulldogs scoring big from long range, they were doing it incredibly efficiently as well. Louisiana Tech found themselves sitting at 7-11 from the field, and 4-7 from beyond the three-point line. On the other side of the ball, the Hilltoppers opened their campaign with a shocking 4-18 performance from the field. It wasn’t until just after the halfway point in the half that the tides began to shift. Thanks in part to a 25-9 run led by WKU guard Enoch Kalambay, the Hilltoppers found themselves with a 40-37 lead heading into the locker room. It seemed obvious that WKU had been doing their homework, as they successfully eliminated the threats. Isaiah Crawford, the second-highest season scorer in C-USA, and Daniel Batcho, the fourth-highest season scorer in the conference combined for six points through the first 20 minutes WKU’s Kalambay had nine points in his 12 minutes on the court, as well as five rebounds. The guard was also a perfect 4-4 from the charity stripe. Dravon Mangum was the ‘Man on Fire’ for La Tech through his 20 minutes on the court. The forward’s 14 points were the most points he has had since March 2023. Team First Half Statistics: WKU: 13-31 FG, 2-6 3FG, 12-13 FT | 23 Rebounds: 17 Defensive, six Offensive. LA TECH: 13-32 FG, 5-19 3FG, 6-9 FT | 15 Rebounds: 12 Defensive, three Offensive. Second Half The Hilltoppers picked up right where they left off in the first half, as they opened up with a 6-0 run. However, LA Tech wouldn’t go out without a dogfight. The Bulldog offense followed suit with their very own 9-3 run, bringing the game within three with just over 12 minutes to play. However, no run would be enough for the Bulldogs as the teams mirrored each other, and the Hilltoppers came away with a three-point victory, proving that you can teach old dogs new tricks. LA Tech’s Magnum and Jordan Crawford both shared career-high games with 23 and 22 points respectively. On the other hand, the Hilltoppers struck defensive gold when it came to locking up Batcho. After fouling out with under a minute left, the 6-11 Frenchman took his trip to the bench with only six points to his name. “I thought our guys did a good job collectively on Batcho.” Lutz said. The Hilltoppers were once again led by Don McHenry. The guard’s 18 points were accompanied by six rebounds, three assists, and two steals while shooting 7-13 from the field.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:25 pm Patricia Bullrich Bullrich, known for being tough on crime, has in fact reintroduced rules she first brought in during a previous stint as security minister in 2018 Argentine President Javier Milei\'s government on Friday relaxed the rules around the use of firearms by security forces, allowing them to shoot someone to prevent a serious crime, or in self-defense. In recent years, security forces ""have risked their lives in a way that has reached a limit,"" said Security Minister Patricia Bullrich, unveiling the new protocol on Thursday, which was published in the government gazette Friday. ""We need to protect those who protect us."" Bullrich, known for being tough on crime, has in fact reintroduced rules she first brought in during a previous stint as security minister in 2018. She did so after a policeman was charged in the 2017 death of an 18-year-old thief who was shot in the back by police while fleeing after mugging a tourist in Buenos Aires. The officer was later found guilty of homicide and sentenced to two years in jail in 2021. The re-introduced measures allow the legitimate use of firearms ""when other non-violent means are ineffective"", ""in cases of self-defense or defense of others, and imminent danger of death or serious injury."" Security officers can also shoot ""to prevent the commission of a particularly serious offense which represents an imminent danger to life or physical integrity."" The measures had been scrapped by the center-left government that took office in 2019 and replaced with rules obliging security forces to act ""proportionally"" when faced with a threat while ""respecting and protecting human life."" Milei, 53, is a libertarian outsider and political newcomer who swept to the presidency on a wave of anger by Argentines furious with an economic crisis, and worsening crime. Bullrich said the protocol will apply with immediate effect to nautical police, particularly on river borders in the north of the country where they are often faced with organized crime. They will also be equipped with heavy weapons, she said. Details on the rollout to other security agencies will be announced soon. Sabina Frederic, the security minister who in 2019 ditched the measures, slammed the protocol as one which ""enables the trigger-happy,"", and gives the police, rather than the courts, the right to ""define what is or is not a crime."" edm-pbl/lab/fb/bgs Originally published on doc.afp.com, part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:53 pm Isaiah Martin (in blue-jean jacket) stands next to public defender Charles Oppenheimer as he gets a 40-year sentence Thursday for murdering his own mother. GREENUP Greenup County Circuit Court Judge Brian McCloud told a teenager he has “done great harm to so many people” and exhibited no remorse as he announced a 40-year prison sentence for Isaiah Martin, 17, for the murder of his own mother. According to previous reports, Martin stabbed and shot Thersa Martin to death in June 2022. Thersa was 49. Penny Nichols, Isaiah Martin’s girlfriend, was sentenced in January to 40 years in prison for her role — conspiring to murder Thersa Martin. Nichols supplied her boyfriend with the gun. Troy Breeze, assistant Commonwealth’s attorney in Greenup, read three victim impact statements submitted by Cullen Martin, Kelsey Martin and another family member. The first statement, from the relative not in the immediate family, indicated that Isaiah was “happy, well-loved and baptized.” “He was taught right from wrong, and he knew right from wrong,” the statement read. “There are no words to describe what he’s done to our family.” Cullen Martin, Isaiah’s brother and Thersa’s son, said losing his mother has caused depression, stress, anxiety, grief, a lack of sleep and other emotional adjustment issues being addressed by therapy. “Through threats he made, I suffer from existential fear that he will finish his and his girlfriend’s plans of killing my wife and I,” Cullen Martin wrote. Cullen said Isaiah also threatened to harm Cullen’s friends and other family members. Billy Martin, Thersa’s husband, had died in 2021. “With the murder of my mother, I’ve lost the only family I had left after my father had passed away the prior year,” Cullen wrote. “Isaiah can act innocent, but he’s very manipulative. … He shows no remorse for killing our mother. It was just to satisfy the urges of himself and his girlfriend, Penny. “No one deserved to be killed in such a horrific manner, let alone a loving mother,” Cullen added. Kelsey Martin, Cullen’s wife and Thersa’s daughter in-law, viewed Thersa as her own mother. “My heart breaks for my husband; we’ve not been able to sleep being afraid of (Isaiah) and Penny getting out,” Kelsey wrote. “It makes me sick to my stomach. Someone who could do something so awful should be locked up forever.” Kelsey said she sometimes forgets Thersa is gone, and she’ll pick up the phone to call her or send her a message. “She’ll never get to see her grandbabies,” Kelsey Martin wrote, adding she and Cullen plan to have children of their own in the future. “We’ll never get to laugh together again. … A piece of my heart is gone.” Kelsey Martin, in her statement, said Isaiah Martin deserves the 40-year sentence, “that way my husband and I can live a happy life and not have to look over our shoulders to see what will happen next.” Following the impact statements, McCloud gave Isaiah Martin — short and slender, wearing a blue-jean jacket and blue jeans — if he wished to say anything. Public defender Charles Oppenheimer said Martin wished to remain silent. “The court’s going to sentence you to the full amount,” the judge said. “Son, you’ve done great harm to so many people. I don’t think you’ve shown any remorse. As you stand here right now, it looks like you’re smirking at me. … I hope in your 40 years, you’ll understand the destruction you’ve caused to so many people. Take him away.” A final sentencing will take place just prior to Martin’s 18th birthday — which is Aug. 1. It is set for July 25, 2024.
