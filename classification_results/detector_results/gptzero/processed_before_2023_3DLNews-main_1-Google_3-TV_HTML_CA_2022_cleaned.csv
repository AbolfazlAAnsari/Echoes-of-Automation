story was originally published by CalMatters. One in five Latinos in California live in poverty, the highest of any demographic group. Black students trail all other racial and ethnic groups in reading and math proficiency. And Native Americans are worse off today, with an average life expectancy eight years shorter than a decade ago. Despite a suite of well-intended policies aimed at improving education, health and economic outcomes for disadvantaged groups, California’s racial inequalities aren’t getting smaller. Often, they’re growing. That’s prompting some researchers to rethink how they approach policymaking. Generally there have been two approaches to tackling inequality: One known as universalism pushes for every worker to receive the same benefit, such as Social Security and minimum wage. The other is known as targeted policy because it proposes to benefit disadvantaged groups, such as affirmative action to get more students of color into college or Medicaid, which provides health insurance to the very poor. But both have shortcomings, says Stephen Menendian, research director at UC Berkeley’s Othering & Belonging Institute. Targeted policies that distribute the bulk of benefits to specific groups are less popular and can exclude other groups also in need of support. Meanwhile, universalism fails to address existing disparities between different groups of people. Menendian is one proponent of a hybrid approach called targeted universalism. Supporters say it is more complex and requires more planning but it holds promise to address racial, class and geographic inequality. Some say it could even reduce partisanship. But few understand this novel policy approach and fewer know how to implement it. So might targeted universalism work? Targeted universalism is a middle ground between universal policies that treat everyone equally and targeted policies that often exclude many. john a. powell, director of the Othering & Belonging Institute at UC Berkeley (who prefers not to capitalize his name) conceived of targeted universalism to rethink the process governments use to create policy. The approach entails setting universal goals for an entire population, but using targeted policies to help different groups achieve that goal. The universal goal is intended to generate a sense of inclusion while allowing room for targeted solutions to overcome barriers that different groups might face. Supporters say that by blending these two approaches, policymakers may be able to generate better outcomes. Implementing targeted universalism is an intensive, five-step process outlined in a 2019 primer authored by powell, Menendian and Wendy Ake. The first step is to form a coalition of stakeholders who agree on a universal goal in response to a social problem – poor access to quality health care, for example. The coalition, in steps two and three, then assesses how the general population and subgroups broken down by race, class, gender and geography fare relative to that universal goal. In step four, the coalition identifies the barriers different groups might face. That could be a lack of transportation for one group while another group may lack access to quality medical care. For example, various studies show Black and Hispanic patients tend to receive inferior care relative to white patients. While the initial goal is universal, step five establishes targeted policies. That could include more public transportation funding in rural communities or racial bias training for doctors. Each group would get varying levels of support tailored to its needs in achieving that goal. The process involves a lot of planning, said Menedian, but “it’s the right way to do things.” The idea has gained some traction across the country with a few demonstration projects that embody targeted universalism. King County, Washington, deployed targeted universalism across various departments starting in 2016. One of the various targeted policies the county came up with called for investing more in neighborhoods where poor transportation reduced access to education, healthy food and jobs. The program is set to wrap at the end of the year but no findings have been published yet. The Chicago Public Schools Office of Equity handed out targeted universalism forms to school administrators and teachers, empowering educators to set their own universal goals, assess their students and develop customized solutions. It’s also too soon to tell how that project is working out. Currently, targeted policies can exclude groups that don’t qualify for social services even though they may need support. For example, food stamps beneficiaries must have less than $2,001 in their bank accounts. That leaves those with slightly more cash ineligible for support even if they need help buying groceries. It also stokes resentment and opens the government to criticism for valuing one group over the general public, said Menendian. Universalist policies, however, can exacerbate disparities by using a one-size-fits-all framework that fails to address differences between groups. For example, universal health care may give everyone insurance, but that doesn’t help a rural community without a hospital nearby, nor does it address a high rate of asthma in a community with high traffic and poor air quality. Targeted universalism is so new that not much is known about it. The governor’s office, as well as a number of state lawmakers, declined to comment, saying they weren’t familiar with the concept. Sara Kimberlin, senior policy analyst at the California Budget & Policy Center, finds targeted universalism compelling. She said it’s helpful for thinking about how to address a common goal by looking at individual circumstances, “so you’re actually moving everyone toward the same goal.” Menendian acknowledges that states aren’t designed to work within the five-step process but is hopeful that small demonstration projects may eventually influence statewide policy.

For the past year, the House committee has been investigating the most violent attack on the Capitol since the War of 1812 to ensure such an assault never happens again. Lawmakers hope to show that Trump\'s effort to overturn Joe Biden\'s election victory posed a grave threat to democracy.

Stepien, a longtime Trump adviser, has kept a relatively low profile compared with many others in the former president\'s orbit. He previously served as White House political director and also national field director for Trump’s 2016 campaign. Instead of his live testimony, the panel relied on Stepien’s previously recorded interview with the panel, given behind closed doors, about what the campaign team was telling Trump as he lost the election. A longtime Trump ally, Stepien had been subpoenaed to appear at the open hearing. Stepien and senior adviser Jason Miller testified that the festive mood at the White House on election night turned as FOX News announced Trump had lost the state of Arizona to Biden, and aides worked to counsel Trump on what to do next. They pushed back against Rudy Giuliani who was encouraging Trump to declare himself the winner. FILE - Campaign manager Bill Stepien stands alongside US President Donald Trump as he speaks with reporters aboard Air Force One as he flies from Manchester, New Hampshire to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, Aug. 28, 2020, following a campaign rally. Stepien, who remains close to Trump, oversaw the ""conversion"" of Trump’s presidential campaign to a ""Stop the Steal"" effort, according to a subpoena issued by the committee last fall. He was to face questions about what those in Trump\'s inner circle were telling the president about the election results. Stepien is now a top campaign adviser to the Trump-endorsed House candidate, Harriet Hageman, who is challenging Cheney in the Wyoming Republican primary election. Before aligning himself with Trump, Stepien had worked in New Jersey for former Gov. Chris Christie, a longtime Trump friend turned critic. Kushner testified that he told Trump the approach Giuliani was taking was not one he would take. But the president pushed back and said he had confidence in the attorney. And Barr, who had previously testified in last week\'s blockbuster hearing that he told Trump the allegations being raised were bull——, revealed in gripping detail how was ""as mad as I\'d ever seen him"" when the attorney general explained that the Justice Department would not take sides in the election. Monday\'s hearing also featured other live witnesses, including Chris Stirewalt, a former Fox News Channel political editor who declared on Election Night that Arizona was being won by Biden. Stirewalt testified in person at the hearing and discussed making the Arizona call — a moment that prompted ""anger and disappointment"" in Trump’s inner sanctum at the White House, according to campaign aide Jason Miller. Stirewalt explained that the network, along with others, had expected that there would be a so-called ""red mirage"" at the beginning of the evening as in-person Republican votes came in, and many of the mail-in votes that would be counted later on would lean Democratic. He noted it happens every election. Chris Stirewalt, a former political editor for FOX News Channel, made the election night call that President Joe Biden won Arizona – a moment that prompted ""anger and disappointment"" at the White House. Trump had not only exploited that pattern to make false claims of fraud but contributed to it in his campaign to call mail-in voting into question. ""We had gone to pains, and I’m proud of the pains, we went to, to make sure that we were informing viewers that this was going to happen because the Trump campaign and the president had made it clear that they were going to try to exploit this anomaly,"" Stirewalt said. During the first hearing last week, the House panel probing the attack showed violent video of the siege and showed clips of testimony examining the weeks beforehand in which Trump pushed falsehoods about widespread fraud in the election he lost. New video of the Capitol Riot, including alleged crimes by the Proud Boys and others, shown at the congressional hearing on June 9. This version includes some censored profanity. Committee members said Sunday that they’ve uncovered enough evidence for the Justice Department to consider an unprecedented criminal indictment against the former president. RELATED: The Capitol Riot evidence video: A harrowing American moment, repackaged for prime time The hearing featured never-before-seen video testimony from Trump’s family and close aides, many of whom were interviewed by the committee remotely. There was a gasp in the hearing room when Rep. Liz Cheney, the Republican vice-chair of the committee, read an account from inside the White House. When Trump was told the Capitol mob was chanting for Pence to be hanged for refusing to block the election results, Trump responded that maybe the mob was right, that he ""deserves it,"" Cheney said. Vice chair Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., outlined what the committee has learned about the events leading up to the Jan. 6 riot putting blame on former president Donald Trump for riling up insurrectionists. Monday’s hearing was the second of seven hearings scheduled to examine what happened on Jan. 6 and the events that led up to it. While the basics of the attack on the Capitol are well known, the committee is trying to tell the story of how it happened, and how to prevent it from ever happening again, for history. The committee has conducted more than a thousand interviews with people connected to the siege and collected more than 140,000 documents. Cheney said the third hearing on Wednesday will focus on how Trump pushed for the Justice Department to ""spread his false stolen election claims in the days before January 6."" Senior Justice Department officials refused, telling him his claims were not true. RELATED: Ethics charges filed against Rudy Giuliani over Trump'}]"

This storywas originally published May 25, 2022 by CalMatters. The man at the gun show lifted a 2.2 pound rifle and pulled back the stock with an audible ""chock,"" presenting it to the YouTube segment’s host. ""When we set out to produce a small firearm for children in an AR-looking package, we were pretty sure we needed to have a ‘wow factor’ in the safety area,"" Eric Schmid, owner of Wee 1 Tactical, said in a video uploaded in January. What Utah-based Wee 1 Tactical produced was a smaller model of the AR-15, called the JR-15. Schmid was in Las Vegas in January to promote the smaller weapon, which the company pledges will look and feel ""just like Mom and Dad’s gun."" Schmid demonstrated a safety pin intended to keep the weapon’s trigger locked. He and the host noted that it would likely prevent small children from operating a firearm without their parents present. ""It takes a lot of tension to be able to pull that out,"" said host Barret Kendrick. ""Your 12-year-olds are gonna unlock it really quickly,"" Schmid replied. A bill that passed out of the Assembly on Thursday night would make the marketing of firearms to children and those not legally allowed to possess them a civil liability. AB 1594 would allow lawsuits against gun manufacturers based on their marketing, one of the few exemptions to a federal ban on such lawsuits. The bill is now in the hands of the Senate. Brought by San Francisco Democrat Phil Ting, the bill is an attempt to ensure that gun manufacturers can’t object in state court to lawsuits that target their marketing – an argument Smith & Wesson made in a San Diego court last year. The proposal is similar to a bill passed last year in New York – one that survived a legal challenge from guns rights advocates in federal court on Wednesday. ""Unfortunately, it seems like not a day goes by before there’s another tragic mass shooting,"" Ting said. ""We have guns in the hands of the wrong people and we have an industry that takes no responsibility for empowering killers in our community."" The bill alleges that some gun manufacturers market and sell ""increasingly dangerous new products,"" from ghost guns to bump stocks, which give them an unfair business advantage over ""more responsible competitors."" If passed, the bill would allow the Department of Justice, county attorneys, city attorneys and the public to sue over those practices. Among the practices singled out in the bill are: The bill is part of a larger wave of more than a dozen gun control laws proposed by California Democrats ahead of today’s deadline to move bills from their house of origin.On Wednesday, one day after a man killed at least 21 people with an AR-15 in a shooting at a Texas elementary school, Gov. Gavin Newsom singled out some gun marketing tactics at a press conference rallying support for AB 1594 and other gun control measures. ""You’ve got folks out there manufacturing and marketing an AR-15 for babies. For babies,"" Newsom said. ""And their logo is a pacifier with the baby AR-15. These are extremists. They need to be called out."" Newsom seemed to be talking about the JR-15 and Wee 1 Tactical’s logo, which is two skulls with a target in one eye and a pacifier in each mouth. One skull has a mohawk and the other has pigtails. Lawsuits against gun manufacturers are prohibited by the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, a 2005 law that the NRA said at the time was ""the most significant piece of pro-gun legislation in twenty years."" President Joe Biden has said repealing the law is among his administration’s top priorities, though his Justice Department continues to defend the legislation in court. The federal law allowed for six exceptions in which lawsuits are allowable against gun manufacturers. One of them is for manufacturers who violate state or federal laws governing the marketing or sales of guns. The marketing exception to the law allowed parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre to successfully sue Remington Arms last year. A state lawsuit in San Diego after a 2019 shooting was allowed to proceed last year on the same basis. The survivors of the shooting at a San Diego area synagogue argued that Smith & Wesson used marketing ""that attracted impulsive young men with military complexes who were particularly likely to be attracted to the unique ability of AR-15 style weapons."" Smith & Wesson responded that the federal law shielded them from such lawsuits, but a San Diego County Superior Court judge disagreed, citing the marketing exception. Michael Schwartz, executive director of San Diego County Gun Owners, said the bill and others brought forward by Democrats this session are a threat to gun ownership rights throughout California. ""If fully realized and implemented, it’s an enormous threat to gun rights,"" Schwartz said. ""There’s no way to stop anyone from using a product illegally. But you wouldn’t sue Ford for someone drinking and driving."" When it comes to the JR-15, singled out by Newsom, Schwartz said marketing is still directed to the people who can purchase the guns, the parents. And, he said, previous laws around regulating the marketing of age-limited products like tobacco don’t apply to guns. ""I don’t know what the perceived fear is, but I’m not afraid that kids are gonna get addicted to an AR-15,"" Schwartz said. ""It’s the most popular long gun in the United States because it functions in all kinds of situations.""
