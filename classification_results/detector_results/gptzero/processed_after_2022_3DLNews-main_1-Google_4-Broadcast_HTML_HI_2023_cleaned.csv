The time has come to “shut down the Federal Department of Education,” former Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday. But what would it mean to actually shutter the massive agency? Killing the Department of Education (DOE) is easier said than done. Conservatives have said since the creation of the department they want to get rid of it. From President Ronald Reagan and his education secretary to President Trump and his own, Republicans have decried the department’s existence but failed to abolish it. That is because the decision to do so is not only up to the president but would have to go through Congress. “There would have to be some legislation to specifically outline this, but I do think it would need to have the support of the executive branch and, obviously, this is a Cabinet-level agency, so I think having the president — would have to take a leadership role and help to make sure that the proposal is carefully crafted,” said Jonathan Butcher, the Will Skillman Senior Research Fellow in Education Policy at The Heritage Foundation, which supports nixing DOE. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) proposed such legislation in 2021 and reintroduced it earlier this year. “Unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. should not be in charge of our children’s intellectual and moral development,” Massie said two years ago. “States and local communities are best positioned to shape curricula that meet the needs of their students. Schools should be accountable. Parents have the right to choose the most appropriate educational opportunity for their children, including home school, public school, or private school.” DOE did not respond to The Hill’s request for comment. DOE has an enormous number of responsibilities, including handling student loans, investigating complaints against schools and tracking education progress across the country. None of the 2024 candidates during Wednesday’s debate detailed how they would handle eliminating it, but conservatives have longed to see many of its tasks either completely eliminated or absorbed into other departments. “For example, the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Education. I think that any duplicate responsibilities that it shares with the Department of Justice should be eliminated, and then the rest of that office should go to the Department of Justice,” Butcher said. On student loans, Butcher says the elimination could lead to the federal government getting “out of the business of awarding student loans and then for what remains it would be moved to the Department of the Treasury.” Even after ridding themselves of DOE, the GOP candidates indicated they would still focus on implementing national education policies. “I’ll also shut down the Federal Department of Education. And when I was governor, we doubled the size of the largest school choice program in America, and we’ll give school choice to every family in America when I’m in the White House,” Pence said. In his opening remarks for his confirmation hearing, current Education Secretary Miguel Cardona had embraced the various challenges he would have to take on as the head of the department. “I look forward to sitting at the table with the vast, diverse community of people who have a stake in education: students, parents, teachers caregivers, advocates and state, local and tribal leaders and the dedicated career staff at the department,” Cardona said. Conservatives argue that eliminating the Education Department would cut costs and bureaucratic red tape for states. “There’ll be considerable savings, both in terms of salaries as well as other expenditures for programs that may not even be effective,” Butcher said.

The economy's bad. It depends on who you ask — and increasingly which party is in the White House when you ask. It was yet another strong jobs report Friday, exceeding expectations. Almost 200,000 jobs were created last month and unemployment dropped to 3.7%, which is near full employment. People are also spending at a record rate this holiday shopping season — 200 million people shopped between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, higher than expectations and the most ever. They spent a record $38 billion on holiday items during that short stretch, up 8% from a year ago. And they're expected to spend nearly $1 trillion holiday shopping this year, according to the National Retail Federation. Both Gallup and the Pew Research Center found just 1 in 5 rated the economy as either excellent or good. Inflation, which has led to higher grocery and gas bills than Americans would like, is partially to blame for souring their moods. But there's more going on here. There is a huge divide by party on the question of the economy, and there's a stark switch that's been taking place when there's a new administration. And this party-line view of the economy is particularly noticeable among Republicans. For example, according to Pew, in 2016 when former President Obama, a Democrat, was in office, just 18% of Republicans thought the economy was either good or excellent. But in 2020, with Trump, a Republican, in office, that jumped to a whopping 81%. And this year, with Biden in the White House, Republicans' positive views of the economy tanked to just 10%. Consider: During Obama's tenure, the economy was still recovering from the Great Recession, but unemployment by the time Obama left office was at 4.7%. By February 2020, just before the pandemic hit, unemployment dropped to 3.5%, a decline to be sure, but not to the extreme that would explain Republicans' 63-point increase under Trump when inflation was flat. Democrats were more optimistic about the economy during the recent Democratic presidencies, but not to the extent of Republicans' wild swings. In 2016, 46% of Democrats had a more positive than negative view of the economy, according to Pew. In 2020 under Trump, Democrats grew more pessimistic, but only by 7 points. In 2023, they declined further to 28% — still 18 points higher than Republicans, but nowhere near as bullish as Republicans were under Trump. While Republicans have had sharper changes in economic outlook and a lot of that may be politics, the fact that Democrats have also declined in their views of the economy does show that it's not all about politics. The fact is inflation is one of those things people can see — they see it on massive signs at gas stations and on their grocery bills. Overall inflation after the pandemic began to rise and hit a high of 9.1% in June of last year. But food inflation was an even higher 11.4% last summer. That meant that things like steak, bacon, eggs, cheese, potato chips, coffee, ice cream and cookies were more expensive. All are household items and noticeable every time someone checks out at the store. Overall inflation and food inflation have both come down significantly since the start of the year, from 6.4% overall to 3.2% in October and from 10.1% to 3.3% for food. There's been an especially sharp decline in food inflation since the summer, but that hasn't necessarily meant prices have come down much, if at all, and Biden isn't seeing any political benefit — 67% disapproved of Biden's handling of the economy in the latest Gallup survey, which is similar to other recent polls' findings. Housing costs in many parts of the country remain high, and one of the reasons for inflation coming down is because the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates substantially, making the ability to afford a home significantly more difficult. The economy, but more specifically how much stuff costs, is always going to be top of mind for voters. And there's no easy solution politically. Biden and his campaign team have to hope that inflation continues to recede, the Fed starts to lower rates, and people feel a loosening of the pinch on their wallets in an election year, because right now this issue makes Biden especially vulnerable for reelection.

Jeremy most recently traveled the country documenting protests & civil unrest. The investigating non-profit \'Fire Safety Research Institute\', contracted by the Hawaii Attorney General, is still accepting Phase 1 evidence at Maui@UL.org to build a definitive timeline for August 8th. The AG commissioned investigation is still in Phase 1 with the Maui Police Department yet to fully participate. Subpoenas were issued to MEMA and the county water supply agency. LAHAINA (Island News)-- As 2023 comes to a close, the people of Maui are still awaiting the completion of Phase 1 of the Lahaina Fire Investigation. The Office of the Attorney General announced one month ago that it was ""aggressively"" pushing the investigation forward. ""Critical facts are still needed,"" Attorney General Anne Lopez wrote in a press release regarding the pending completion of Phase 1 of the Lahaina Fire investigation. Derek Alkonis, of the contracted non-profit group ""Fire Safety Research Institute,"" told Island News that investigators have been active on Maui since August and have been able to access community in affected zones- and responders who were in the field on August 8th. The task at hand involves parsing hours of video footage and radio communications. ""From MPD and MFD, via spoken word over the radio or written down from the dispatcher. And so, all of that is time stamped,"" Alkonis said of cataloging process. The AG office announced that it had issued subpoenas in late November to the Maui Emergency Management Agency and Maui County Water Supply and Public Works agencies. And as for police and fire? Alkonis told Island News that investigators are ""having technical discussions with the firefighters. And we\'ve done all of the fire department-- and we\'re looking forward to meeting with the police officers and the members of MEMA and the water department soon,"" he said. How are investigators accessing primary source evidence? The best way, Alcona says, is air-dropping phone-to-phone which preserves the metadata. If video evidence is on Android, it may involve directly emailing a clip to preserve the timestamp to MAUI@UL.ORG For example, a clip shot by Debbie Schultz-Peterson is significant by its original Android timestamp, it shows 5:24 p.m. and that Highway 30 north was still closed. To preserve the metadata the clip had to me either texted or emailed to Island News- but could not be uploaded to google drive, or the timestamp would reset. Another big question, will all county agencies comply as investigators expect they will? ""There\'s a lot of requests that are going out- and so information we\'re still waiting for. They have been providing what we\'ve asked for,"" Alkonis said, ""Obviously we don\'t want to relive this experience, and so to learn from it, we need to understand the preparedness efforts and the response efforts."" Of nearly a dozen survivors who had submitted evidence to Island News in the first two months after the fire, only one party confirmed that they had been in contact with the AG contracted investigation.

Editor/Digital Producer HONOLULU (Island News) - The year 2023 brought highs and lows to our islands; some lives changed forever. Here are some of the top stories that shaped Hawaii in 2023: Maui wildfires On the morning of August 8, wildfires ripped through Lahaina and Kula, leaving residents and tourists running for their lives. Fueled by peak wind gusts exceeding 80 miles per hour and dry brush, the fires burned approximately 1,000 acres, and nearly 2,200 structures burned to ash. The fire left over 7,000 residents without a home and has claimed 100 lives. Hope and community came to light as residents and visitors set up food and supply hubs for affected residents. People worldwide donated millions to private foundations, nonprofits, and GoFundMe accounts. The effort to house fire victims remains top of mind for state and federal officials as they struggle to find long-term housing and work quickly to rebuild Lahaina and Upcountry Maui. We remember the lives lost in the fires. Maui County officials have begun releasing the names of the people who have been confirmed as fatalities, after notifying their family members. The following is a complete list of all of the names that have been released so far. Maui County officials have begun releasing the names of the people who have been confirmed as fatalities, after notifying their family members. The following is a complete list of all of the names that have been released so far. Governor Green announces emergency proclamation related to an aggressive housing plan On July 17, Gov. Green declared a state-wide emergency because of the lack of affordable housing for Hawaii residents. Later, he signed the proclamation to fast-track the building process for state and affordable housing projects to create 50,000 new houses over the next three to five years. The plan drew criticism from environmental and cultural groups who protect Native Hawaiian burial sites. A legal challenge by a community-led group was dropped in October after Green revised the proclamation to address their concerns. Skyline launches The long-awaited city rail transit system opened to the public in June with the opportunity to ride for free during the July 4th weekend. Over 71,000 passengers took a ride during the opening weekend, but the City has seen significant dips in ridership since then. Currently, the rail goes between Kapolei and Halawa. The Department of Transportation Services plans to extend the rail to the airport and Middle Street in two years with the ultimate goal of getting to downtown Honolulu. Call to action In February, McKinley High School junior Sara Yara was struck and killed by a driver on a marked sidewalk on Kapiolani Boulevard on her way to school. The suspect, Mitchel Miyashiro, then drove off without stopping to help. Miyashiro was arrested later but was released pending further investigation. Yara\'s death created a massive call to action for safer roads and steep penalties for drivers. It was later revealed that Miyahsiro had 164 traffic violations and was driving without a license. State officials, the Honolulu Police Department, and senators rallied at the intersection to raise awareness for pedestrians, speed limits, and cautious driving. Within weeks of the hit and run, the Department of Transportation began installing speed humps and a red light camera at the intersection where she was killed. Miyashiro was arrested and charged with negligent homicide in December, ten months after the incident. On June 17, Richianna DeGuzman was shot in the head in Maili while out with friends and taken to the hospital in critical condition. Six months later, the 17-year-old is defying all odds and has slowly made progress through intense therapy. Her attacker has not been located or identified. Increased shootings on the Waianae coast have made headlines this year, and DeGuzman\'s is no different. Her mother, Susan Mahiai, has been a staunch supporter of ending gun violence, and the community, including area state senators and representatives, are joining her. Peace rallies, sign waving, and calls for holding people accountable for their actions have occurred up and down the Waianae Coast since the incident. Hawaii\'s idol Kahuku native Iam Tongi catapulted to stardom after winning the 21st season of American Idol. Friends, family, and fans rallied behind the 18-year-old throughout the season with neighborhood watch parties, street celebrations, and the star-studded homecoming concert right before the finale. Wearing a sea of Kahuku pride red, thousands of fans watched Tongi, joined by Jack Johnson, Common Kings, Spawbreezie, and other guests. Justice prevails Bernard Brown was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after being convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend, Moreira ""Mo"" Monsalve, eight years ago. Police say the advancement of technology and cell phone evidence was essential in Brown\'s indictment since Monsalve\'s body was never found. Albert ""Ian"" Schweitzer, one of the three men convicted in the 1991 rape and murder of Dana Ireland on Hawaii Island, was exonerated after new DNA evidence in the case cleared him and his brother, Shawn, of the murder. A hearing is scheduled in January to exonerate the third man, Frank Pauline, posthumously. The case remains unsolved. Hailey Dandurand and Stephen Brown were sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole for the death of Telma Boinville. Dandurand and Brown were found guilty of murdering Booinville while she was cleaning a Pupukea vacation home in December 2017. The killers first kidnapped and tied up her young daughter Makana. The girl was eight at the time. The couple later stole the victim\'s truck to get away. Within hours it was spotted at the Mililani Walmart where the couple was placed under arrest. The Eddie when go The Bay called the day for the 10th ever Eddie Aikau Big Wave International, where an estimated 50,000 spectators flocked down to the valley to watch top surfers ride the massive 40-foot wave faces. For the first time, female surfers competed in the contest and joined the likes of reigning champ John John Florence and Kelly Slater, who gave up his spot for a first-time alternate. But it was another alternate who took the crown. The North Shore lifeguard, Luke Shepardson, was said to be on a lunch break with a near-perfect score. After a win and quick celebrations, Shepardson returned to the stand to finish his shift to ensure everyone got home safely.

In November 2021, authorities say Trevor Jacob, 30, took off from the Lompoc City Airport in Santa Barbara County in his single-engine Taylorcraft BL-65 on a solo flight purportedly destined for Mammoth Lakes. In a YouTube video documenting his flight, Jacob said he intended to fly over the Los Padres National Forest to spread someone’s ashes. But once over the mountains, his propeller appeared to stop spinning. “Holy s—,” he said. “I’m over the mountains and I … [got] an engine out.” With a parachute already strapped to his back, Jacob jumped out of the plane, gripping a seflie stick to record his descent. He landed and proclaimed, “I’m just so happy to be alive,” according to the YouTube video, which Jacob posted in December 2021. Meanwhile, cameras mounted inside and outside of the aircraft showed it descending over the hills and eventually crashing into dry brush. “Thank you, God. Thank you, universe. Thank you, higher power, for watching over me,” he said after hiking to the wreckage. He then left the forest and flagged down a driver. Many viewers on YouTube initially noted that the video appeared to be staged — and the Federal Aviation Administration eventually came to the same conclusion, revoking Jacob’s pilot’s license. On April 11, the FAA sent a letter to Jacob informing him that he had been banned from flying as a result of the stunt, according to a copy of the Emergency Order of Revocation obtained by Nexstar. He was also prohibited from applying for new certification for a year. “Your actions … were careless and reckless so as to endanger the life and property of another,” the letter read, in part. The FAA detailed several pieces of evidence that suggested the stunt was staged, pointing to portions of the video that showed the following: Jacob wearing his backpack prior to the propeller stopping; Jacob opening his plane door prior to the propeller stopping; Jacob making no attempt to contact Air Traffic Control; Jacob making no attempt to restart the engine; and Jacob grabbing a selfie stick to film himself parachuting from the plane, among other suspicious behavior. The FAA also noted that Jacob made no attempt to glide his plane toward a safe landing spot, despite there being “multiple” suitable areas for such a landing within gliding distance, the letter said. Prosecutors say Jacob then waited two days to report the crash to the National Transportation Safety Board, which told him to preserve the wreckage. But he stalled the investigation by telling NTSB officials that he didn’t know where the plane went down, according to the Department of Justice. More than two weeks after the crash, he and a friend flew a helicopter to the crash site and airlifted the wreckage to Rancho Sisquoc in Santa Barbara County, where it was loaded onto a trailer attached to Jacob’s pickup truck, officials said. “He then cut up and destroyed the airplane wreckage and, over several days, deposited the detached parts of the wrecked airplane into trash bins at the airport and elsewhere,” the U.S. Department of Justice said. Jacob, a former Olympic snowboard cross competitor who competed in the 2014 Sochi Games, pleaded guilty in June to one count of destruction and concealment with the intent to obstruct a federal investigation. According to the plea agreement, Jacob had secured a sponsorship from a company that sold various products, including a wallet, which he intended to promote in the YouTube video. “It appears that [Jacob] exercised exceptionally poor judgment in committing this offense,” prosecutors argued in a sentencing memorandum. “[Jacob] most likely committed this offense to generate social media and news coverage for himself and to obtain financial gain.

The president sought to make the case that America is the “essential nation” that can simultaneously support its allies, deter adversaries and rally other nations behind the cause of global democracies. “American leadership is what holds the world together. America’s alliances are what keep us safe,” Biden said. “American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with. To put all of that at risk if we walk away from Ukraine and turn our backs on Israel—it’s just not worth it.” Biden further sought to impress on the public how allowing Ukraine or Israel to come under siege would represent a grave threat to democracies around the globe and would embolden America’s enemies. “History has taught us that when terrorists don’t pay a price for their terror, when dictators don’t pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death, and more destruction,” Biden said. “They keep going, and the cost and the threats to America and the world keep rising.” He also delivered a warning to Hamas over humanitarian aid leaders agreed to allow into Gaza after such aid was not allowed in over the last 10 days as food and water ran out, saying it was imperative that it reaches Palestinians in need. “If Hamas does not divert or steal these shipments, we’re going to provide an opening for sustained delivery of lifesaving humanitarian assistance for the Palestinians,” the president said. The president said he would send Congress a supplemental funding request on Friday that would include an “unprecedented commitment to Israel’s security.” The package, which will reportedly total $100 billion, will also include money for Ukraine, as well as allies in the Indo-Pacific and humanitarian aid. Biden delivered just his second primetime address since taking office in the wake of terrorist attacks in Israel carried out by Hamas, a militant group that controls Gaza, that killed more than 1,400 Israelis and has left thousands of Palestinians dead or injured in subsequent strikes on Gaza. Biden’s address came one day after a whirlwind trip to Israel, during which he met with Israeli government officials and survivors of the Hamas attacks and delivered remarks announcing humanitarian aid to Gaza while offering steadfast U.S. support for the Jewish state as it prepares an offensive. The visit to Tel Aviv was the second time this year Biden has traveled to a war zone. The first came in February, when he made a covert trip to Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky one year after Russia first launched its invasion in February 2022. While there is bipartisan support in Congress for supporting both Israel and Ukraine, a small minority of House Republicans have grown increasingly opposed to providing additional aid to the Ukrainians, suggesting it is not in the interests of the United States. That opposition would make it difficult for Biden and his team to push through an aid package that provides funding for both allies over the next year. Further complicating matters, the House has been without a Speaker for more than two weeks since the ouster of Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.). Without a Speaker in place, the House would be unable to pass legislation. The White House previously sent a supplemental funding request in August that included a total of $24 billion in military, financial and humanitarian assistance for Ukraine. That same request also sought roughly $4 billion total in supplemental funding for border and migration efforts. Biden is facing additional criticism from a small group of progressive Democrats who have called for the president to insist on a ceasefire that would halt the Israeli airstrikes on Gaza to protect Palestinian civilians. Biden has held back on this move, with administration officials saying Israel is acting in its self-defense to degrade Hamas’s military infrastructure, and go after its leadership in the Strip. Biden in his speech sought to address that criticism saying, “the United States remains committed to the Palestinians’ right to dignity and self determination. The actions of Hamas terrorists don’t take that right away.” White House officials believe the conflicts abroad have allowed Biden to lean into foreign policy, an area where he is particularly comfortable given his decades in the Senate and eight years as vice president. But it is also a politically challenging matter given divisions in the Democratic Party and the uncertainty engulfing Congress. Polling has also shown a gradual decline over time in public support for Ukraine aid, and initial surveys have suggested not all Americans are pleased with Biden’s approach to the Israel-Hamas conflict. A CBS News poll published hours before Biden spoke found 44 percent of Americans approve of Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict, while 56 percent disapprove. The poll found 61 percent of independents disapproved of Biden’s approach. The poll found 44 percent of Americans believe Biden has shown Israel the right amount of support, compared to 32 percent who said he had not shown enough support. Twenty-four percent said Biden had shown the Jewish state too much support. Updated 9:06 p.m. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

HONOLULU (ISLAND NEWS) -- One of the latest digital crimes to be on the lookout for starts with the theft of smartphones - but can lead to a hijacking of so much of your life. Experts and law enforcement say it happens when a criminal has access to your unlocked phone, whether that\'s done on the sly - or as part of a brazen robbery. On an otherwise normal day in October of this year, Island News Midday producer Bre Jackson was at her desk when her phone sent an alert. ""It said my Trusted Phone Number had been changed on my Apple ID. I was at work, I was here. And I knew immediately what happened,"" she recalls. She knew, because she used to work at Apple and heard dozens of these stories before. What happened was, a thief took her backup iPhone, then took command of all her accounts, including her Apple ID and her iCloud. Her life became his life. ""He has control of my WhatsApp account. He did that pretty quickly. He tried to get my CashApp,"" Jackson says, ticking off a list of all the things he has colonized. Experts say this is happening across the continent and the world: Thieves stealing people\'s smartphones, then using them to drain victims\' bank accounts. But CrimeStoppers and the Honolulu Police Department say Jackson\'s is the only report of its kind on Oahu so far. Jackson says, ""He did make multiple charges. According to Honolulu Police, it\'s up to a felony, so, thousands [of dollars.]"" Island News Tech Expert Ryan Ozawa says often, victims are unwitting accomplices in their own crime, trusting strangers with their phones. ""You hand them your phone. You think they\'re typing in their Instagram handle so you can connect with this cute guy or gal. But while they\'re doing is disabling all of your security on your phone,"" he says. Or sometimes crooks snatch the phones from victim\'s hands and run off. Not Jackson. She lost her digital life after she lost her apartment in an October fire. Authorities didn\'t allow her to go to her unit because it was unsafe. But not everything was destroyed, and a looter found her spare phone and her list of passwords. Most damning is when he took over her iCloud account. ""He changed my name to his name to John Doe. When he changed his name it sent me the email."" It\'s about so much more than money. It\'s her safety (""I can\'t use Location or he\'ll know exactly where I am. He has all my stuff. I can\'t even download apps on this phone."") and her memories. ""I could wipe this phone and have a fresh device, but all those pictures are going to be gone. Being able to see them, even if blurry, remembering what it used to look like, is kind of better than not having it at all,"" Jackson says through tears. It\'s frustrating. ""I feel vulnerable,"" she admits. And she\'s not sure when or how this ultimately ends. [To donate to Jackson\'s Go Fund Me, click here.] Ozawa summarizes the broad problem of when thieves have unfettered access to your unlocked phone: ""Whether you\'re using iCloud on an iPhone or Google Cloud on an Android, you\'re giving them access to everything that your phone backs up. Years and years of photos. Yes, your Venmo account. Yes, your bank accounts. Anything you put in your notes that you don\'t put a password on; all of that stuff. It\'s basically opening up the treasure trove that is your cloud storage."" It\'s happened to enough people that Apple rolled out a Stolen Device Protection feature in its iOS 17.3 beta that would require extra steps to access details on an iPhone. Ozawa explains, ""They\'re making it so that even if you unlock your phone and handed it to somebody, they can\'t go into your settings and immediately turn stuff off. When you make this change, it doesn\'t let the change take effect for an hour and then after an hour it says, \'OK, one more time. What was that password?\'"" But in the end, the best protection might not even be technology based. ""When you\'re holding your phone, you just need to be more careful about your surroundings,"" he suggests. It falls back to good old fashioned common sense and situational awareness.
