The news station reported that Wilton Police Department, with the assistance of the Maine Office of Cannabis, was at a location in the Wilton area performing a follow-up inspection at a licensed cannabis facility on Weld Road. While authorities were there, they got word that there was another building on the same piece of property that was not licensed to be growing marijuana, according to WGME. Inspectors decided to check that building out while they were there, and that's when they found more than 1200 illegally grown pot plants, the news station reported. WGME said that Wilton PD along with the Maine Cannabis Office, destroyed all of the unlicensed plants. They say that the combined value of all the plants was north of $1,000,000. The news station also went on to report that the owner of the property is not connected to the marijuana grow facility. This indicates that the owners of the plants likely rent or lease the property for their operation. At this time, the names of those involved are being withheld from the public while the investigation is ongoing by state officials.

A wearer of many hats, Kristie is a long-time DJ for ‘Daydream Nation’ on the WERU Community Radio in Orland, Maine. From small-town grocery clerk to working in a fish market, owning her own shoe store, being an Arts Educator at a local theater, a lobster fisher, and an antiques seller, Kristie has done it all. Most of all, Kristie is a collector. Of stories, of emotions, of dolls, of feelings, wigs, mannequin parts, record albums, memories, beauty, laughter, vintage clothing, scallop shells, barnacles, and hermit crabs. She is an observer, as well. She has been writing poetry since childhood, and taking pictures forever with her old Nikon and other cameras she’s amassed over the years. Her latest book, “Sea Witch: Photographs, Poems and Forget Me Nots from a Mainer Growing Up” (Seaport Books, Nov 2023) is filled with images and words of the sea, nature, folk art, dolls, loss, grief, love, acceptance, rage, music, and life. Kristie Billings comes from a long line of lovers of the sea: fishermen, clamdiggers, and sardine packers. The ocean is home. She is a poet, a photographer, and a year-round swimmer. She is currently living in Ellsworth, Maine, and a native of Stonington, on Deer Isle. A great lover of music, art, and life, Kristie is drawn to beauty, even in the most ordinary, mundane way. She is drawn to what others may pass by, unnoticed.

It happened so subtly and at a private event, but quite honestly, the impact and good vibes from it deserve to be shared on a public platform, because we all need a person like this, whether it's in our personal lives or at the workplace. Recently, Maine broadcasters from both radio and television were brought together at the Portland Sheraton at Sable Oaks in South Portland, Maine, for the Maine Association of Broadcasters Annual Convention and Awards Gala -- or MABs, for short. (The irony about the name of the event is that it contains the word 'annual,' but due to the status of the world, this was the first time the event happened since 2019, which made it an even more special evening.) One of the highlights of the MABs this year was finally getting the chance to honor inductees into the MAB Hall of Fame from not just this year, but the past few years as well, one of which was NEWS CENTER MAINE icon, Cindy Williams. After being hyped up and introduced by her former co-anchor, the recently retired Pat Callaghan, Cindy took the podium and went on to sing her former colleague's praises, including one very touching moment where she mentioned a special part of their over three-decade partnership inside Maine households everywhere. We were able to finish each other's sentences, and if there came a point during a story where he could tell I was becoming emotional and unable to finish the story, he would pick up the rest, and in turn, would also pick me up. And that's when this beyond sweet and almost fully unnoticed moment between two Maine reporters happened -- but it wasn't between Cindy and Pat (although, that was obviously very touching, as well.) For years, Cristina Frank and Kathleen Jordan both brought viewers Maine's Total Coverage every weekday morning on WMTW, until recently when Kathleen moved to afternoons and evenings, and Cristina was joined every morning by returning reporter Jessica Gagne. However, with years of early mornings together under their belts, the bond was (and still clearly is) there between Cristina and Kathleen, proven to each other and the keen-eyed author of this article sitting behind them at the MABs. Because after Cindy made the comment about Pat picking her up during tough situations in broadcasts, Cristina turned her head back toward Kathleen while reaching for her hand, and the two not only interlocked hands but exchanged smiles as if to both show each other the appreciation for both picking the other up in times of need during their own broadcasts. And, quite honestly, we should all be so lucky to not only have co-workers like that in our lives -- those people who are always there to lift you up in times of need when the goin' gets tough -- but truly, we should all be so lucky to have people like that in our lives in general.

(AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson, File) Photo: Associated Press By MIKE STOBBE AP Medical Writer NEW YORK (AP) — The proportion of U.S. kindergartners exempted from school vaccination requirements has hit its highest level ever, 3%, U.S. health officials said Thursday. More parents are questioning routine childhood vaccinations that they used to automatically accept, an effect of the political schism that emerged during the pandemic around COVID-19 vaccines, experts say. Even though more kids were given exemptions, the national vaccination rate held steady: 93% of kindergartners got their required shots for the 2022-2023 school year, the same as the year before, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a report Thursday. The rate was 95% in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic. “The bad news is that it’s gone down since the pandemic and still hasn’t rebounded,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, a University of Colorado pediatric infectious diseases specialist. “The good news is that the vast majority of parents are still vaccinating their kids according to the recommended schedule.” All U.S. states and territories require that children attending child care centers and schools be vaccinated against a number of diseases, including, measles, mumps, polio, tetanus, whooping cough and chickenpox. All states allow exemptions for children with medical conditions that prevents them from receiving certain vaccines. And most also permit exemptions for religious or other nonmedical reasons. In the last decade, the percentage of kindergartners with medical exemptions has held steady, at about 0.2%. But the percentage with nonmedical exemptions has inched up, lifting the overall exemption rate from 1.6% in the 2011-2012 school year to 3% last year. Last year, more than 115,000 kindergartners were exempt from at least one vaccine, the CDC estimated. The rates vary across the country. Ten states — all in the West or Midwest — reported that more than 5% of kindergartners were exempted from at least one kind of required vaccine. Idaho had the highest percentage, with 12% of kindergartners receiving at least one exemption. In contrast, 0.1% had exemptions in New York. The rates can be influenced by state laws or policies can make it harder or easier to obtain exemptions, and by local attitudes among families and doctors about the need to get children vaccinated. “Sometimes these jumps in exemptions can be very local, and it may not reflect a whole state,” said O’Leary, who chairs an American Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious diseases. Hawaii saw the largest jump, with the exemption rate rising to 6.4%, nearly double the year before. Officials there said it’s not due to any law or policy change. Rather, “we have observed that there has been misinformation/disinformation impacting people’s decision to vaccinate or not via social media platforms,” officials at the state’s health department said in a statement. Connecticut and Maine saw significant declines, which CDC officials attributed to recent policy changes that made it harder to get exemptions. Health officials say attaining 95% vaccination coverage is important to prevent outbreaks of preventable diseases, especially of measles, which is extremely contagious. The U.S. has seen measles outbreaks begin when travelers infected elsewhere came to communities with low vaccination rates. That happened in 2019 when about 1,300 measles cases were reported — the most in the U.S. in nearly 30 years. Most of the cases were in were in Orthodox Jewish communities with low vaccination rates. One apparent paradox in the report: The national vaccination rate held steady even as exemptions increased. How could that be? CDC officials say it’s because there are actually three groups of children in the vaccination statistics. One is those who get all the shots. A second is those who get exemptions. The third are children who didn’t seek exemptions but also didn’t get all their shots and paperwork completed at the time the data was collected. “Last year, those kids in that third group probably decreased,” offsetting the increase in the exemption group, the CDC’s Shannon Stokley said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.
