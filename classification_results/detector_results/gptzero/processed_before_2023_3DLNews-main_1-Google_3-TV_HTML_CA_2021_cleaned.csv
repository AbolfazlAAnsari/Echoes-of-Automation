5 Example video title will go here for this video Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video SAN DIEGO — It seemed just like a regular night on December 23, 2020, when Barbara-Lee Edwards signed off at CBS 8 after anchoring the 11 p.m. newscast. CBS 8's Marcella Lee sat down to talk with her about that night and how her life has changed since her final broadcast. Here is a transcript of that conversation. You can also see the extended interview here. Marcella: What do you remember about that night, December 23, 2020? Barbara-Lee: It was such a regular night. I finished the series [of newscasts] and we said goodbye to each other. And I took some pictures… because I look at Instagram and I look at that last picture I posted at work, never knowing how my life was going change in a matter of hours. I came home and I was just putting things away and I bent down to put a pair of shoes back and this incredible pain spread across the top of my head and down the back into my neck, like I'd never felt before. The doctor came back in and said you have a significant amount of blood on your brain. Marcella: People hear bleeding on the brain and they think aneurysm or stroke. What did you have? Barbara-Lee: This is very similar to that. But with a stroke or an aneurysm. It's an artery. This is a vein. So it's just that's the difference. It was called technically a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Marcella: And when you did more research into this, it's not something that is often survivable. Barbara-Lee: No, I think over half the people that suffer them don't survive. Marcella: You're still healing, you're still recovering. Barbara-Lee: My challenge now is if I had to work under something that was a pressure situation [or] time-sensitive, that I would struggle with - which is pretty much our job description. Can I operate at the level I was operating at before? No. Marcella: What year was it when you started? Barbara-Lee: That was 2001. That was my dream job. That job that I had. That was it. I loved it. I got to do some incredible things. I think the highlight of my career was being invited to the White House to interview President Obama one-on-one. I mean, that's just such a rare moment in a journalist's career. Not everybody gets to experience that...and I did. I got to go to New York once and host a show with Anderson Cooper, that was pretty cool. Yeah, it was fun. I work with Komen. I work with the Heart Association. And I've done so much work with the Humane Society. And I miss our Pet Friends segments when they would bring an adoptable pet. I miss that a lot.

A post shared by Barbara-Lee Edwards (@barbaraleenews8) Marcella: You have had so much support from viewers in the community. I know they've reached out to you directly. What do you want to say to them? Barbara-Lee: Thank you. The support I got from viewers has been absolutely overwhelming and heartwarming. And I got cards and messages. Because I didn't know for so long what the future held for me. And the station let me take my time. I wasn't able to answer some of their questions. I had a lot of people reach out to me and tell me about their experience with brain injury to which I also found very heartwarming and supportive.

The comments from Fauci come as the US Covid-19 death toll approaches 500,000 and the country nears a full year in its fight against the virus.

""As we get into the fall and the winter, by the end of the year, I agree with (President Joe Biden) completely that we will be approaching a degree of normality,"" said Fauci, who serves as Biden\'s chief medical adviser. Mask-wearing is critical to slowing the spread of the virus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which says they can help protect both the people wearing them and those around them from transmitting the virus. The Biden administration has been pushing mask-wearing more aggressively than the Trump administration did, with the President signing an executive order last month mandating interstate travelers wear a mask and requiring masks on federal property. Biden also challenged Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days of his presidency to reduce the spread of the virus.

When people encounter Karen Collins\' intimate depictions of Black history through miniatures, they tend to go silent and stare in awe — a fact the folk artist feels embarrassed to admit, even after more than 25 years of running her mobile African American Miniature Museum. But it\'s easy to be mesmerized by the intricate detail in her handcrafted dioramas, placed inside shadowboxes built by her husband Eddie Lewis. Made in 1998, one diorama brings to life a scene with Martin Luther King Jr. inside of a church. Standing at about five inches tall, a clay King delivers a passionate sermon to about a dozen clay churchgoers dressed in suits and ornate hats with Bibles in their laps and teeny fans in hand. Other details help paint the vibrant picture of an electric church service — the collection plate with overflowing tiny coins, colorful windows, a choir in resplendent robes. Although the viewer does not know the exact message King is delivering, the earnest faces in the group conveys the importance of the moment. Collins\' shadowboxes fill the living room of her Compton home. Next to King is a scene depicting Malcolm X teaching inside a Harlem mosque. ""Unite and Do For Self,"" reads a miniature sign on his podium. In another shadowbox, Collins displays a collection of anti-Black symbols that represent the violent racism and stereotyping Black people have faced in the U.S., including mammy figurines and a ""picaninny"" sign popular in the 1920s. Another chronicles the history of entrepreneur and activist Madam C.J. Walker, from her days as a laundress in St. Louis, to the success of her cosmetics and haircare business. Collins estimates that her collection spans some 60 works, including shadowboxes and other exhibition pieces. Since the 1990s, she has used her collection to teach people Black history — from the horrors of the Middle Passage to America to the triumphs of Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar. She especially hopes to reach Black children, whose culture is often flattened or erased in history books. ""The children have to know the whole truth, that they belonged to some of the strongest people in the world,"" the 70-year-old says. Raised in Indianapolis, Collins\' love of small things began at a young age. Although she wanted a dollhouse growing up, her mother, a single parent raising five children, could never afford one. ""When I became an adult and had my children, it just came to me. I have to have a doll house,"" she recalls. At 40, she purchased her first — a pink and white, four room Tudor with light wooden shingles. ""I started buying furniture for it, tea services and decorated it. It was just wonderful."" But a personal tragedy, the devastating incarceration of her son, the eldest of two children, in the early 1990s, drove Collins to use her newfound art form for justice. She wanted to teach Black children about their lineage. ""For me, the museum was a way to turn the negativity into something positive and share the stories of our ancestors\' strength and perseverance through hardship,"" said Collins in a Google blog post. (In 2020, the tech company commissioned the artist to create a diorama paying homage to the Greensboro sit-in). ""I want young people to learn about those that came before them who sacrificed to help make the lives they live today possible."" She quit her job as a preschool teacher. ""I\'m sure I had a breakdown,"" she says. ""But that saved my life, working on all these little, small things. When I was doing that, I wasn\'t worried about him."" In 1995, she launched the African American Miniature Museum and began showing her work across L.A. at Leimert Park\'s California Jazz and Blues Museum, the Museum of Tolerance, Oran Z\'s Pan-African Black Facts & Wax, and other cities, including Indianapolis\' Madam Walker Legacy Center. She also took her project to schools, libraries, churches and community centers. Collins remembers her first school visit to George Washington Elementary in 1999. ""I was ecstatic and so were they,"" she says. ""They were so receptive and observant."" Collins cried when the students, inspired by her work, later presented their own dioramas showcasing their culture and history. As a self-taught folk artist, Collins learned her craft through trial and error. She spends about four to five hours on each doll, connecting the parts using pipe cleaners. She also found that Black miniature dolls were difficult to come by and would often be much more expensive so, to learn how specific items were built, she reverse-engineered other miniature pieces. She printed itsy-bitsy Jet and Ebony magazines at photo labs. And her husband helps her make the items she can\'t find in stores such as bookshelves, tables and chairs. To create a scene for a diorama, Collins first dives into research, spending as much time as she can to learn about specific moments in history. The goal is to make the work believable. One of her most powerful is a large shadowbox depicting the European slave trading post, Elmina Castle, in modern-day Ghana. Inside a smaller box made to look like a dirt dungeon clay figures are bound in chains. Their faces are pained. ""I had to rebuild the Elmina castle where they were captured and just imagine how scared those people were under those conditions,"" she says. After years of self-financing and toiling away on the museum with her husband, Collins felt on the verge of giving up. ""Artists need recognition,"" she says. But recent awareness and appreciation of her work has given Collins a bigger platform. In 2018, she was included in the Library Foundation of Los Angeles\' exhibition, ""21 Collections: Every Object Has a Story,"" and commissioned to make dioramas she had been brainstorming, including one on homelessness in L.A. and another paying tribute to the Black Lives Matter movement. The exhibition at the downtown Central Library is where Joshua Garrett-Davis, an associate curator at the Autry Museum of the American West, first encountered Collins\' art. Garrett-Davis thought Collins would be a perfect fit for an upcoming project — renovating a long-term gallery dedicated to popular culture depictions of the West at the Autry. Although miniatures are a common medium showcased at the museum, ""we didn\'t have anything telling African American stories in that form,"" he says. The curator was struck by the narrative nature of Collins\' art and dedication to her community. ""We wanted to bring more voices and different types of stories that are rooted in the American West,"" Garrett-Davis says. ""Hollywood movies are very important, but a lot of people didn\'t have access to telling their stories through Hollywood."" The Autry commissioned Collins to make new dioramas depicting Black stories from the West. Her work will be included in the museum\'s updated ""Imagined Wests"" exhibition which is scheduled to open spring 2022. One of Collins\' dioramas depicts Exodusters, the African Americans who migrated westward to Kansas and other states in search of a better life after Reconstruction in the late 1800s. Under blue skies, the clay families seem to rejoice as they unload their wagons. In another Exoduster shadowbox, a group takes a break from their travels, celebrating with music around a campfire. Collins wanted to portray the elation the Exodusters must have felt. ""It was hard work getting from the South to wherever they went,"" she says. ""They were together as families and they all looked after each other … that was joyful coming from bondage."" Another diorama focuses on Bass Reeves, a former slave and one of the first Black U.S. deputy marshals west of the Mississippi. ""He was a bounty hunter, excellent shot, just really a character that was known all over the West,"" Collins says. Black cowboy Bill Pickett, who created rodeo steer wrestling, or bulldogging, and the Compton Cowboys, a group that fights stereotypes through horseback riding, are spotlighted in other dioramas. Garrett hopes visitors will get a new perspective through Collins\' work. ""It\'s amazing and powerful and draws you in,"" he says. The craft of miniatures continues to fade though — L.A.\'s Carole and Barry Kaye Museum of Miniatures, once one of the largest contemporary miniature collections in the world, closed in 2000 and Collins says most miniature shops have closed across the city. Collins and her husband are also growing older, making it more difficult to move the collection of dioramas to various events and exhibitions. The artist longs more and more for her own community space, where she can display her works permanently. ""That\'s my dream, to have a museum where the kids can come and maybe have a little'}]"

similar institutions in California and elsewhere in the United States. In June, the U.S. launched its own investigation into the long history of abuse and loss of life at hundreds of boarding schools for Native American children run by the federal government from the mid-1800s through much of the 20th century. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary, said she wants the investigation to focus closely on cemeteries and possible burial sites at or near the schools. The recent discoveries of more than 1,000 unmarked graves at Indigenous residential schools in Canada has drawn attention to the troubling legacy of similar institutions in California and elsewhere in the United States. In June, the U.S. launched its own investigation into the long history of abuse and loss of life at hundreds of boarding schools for Native American children run by the federal government from the mid-1800s through much of the 20th century. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary, said she wants the investigation to focus closely on cemeteries and possible burial sites at or near the schools. For more than 100 years, the U.S. government forcibly relocated tens of thousands of Native American children to boarding schools under an assimilation program meant to suppress their languages, beliefs and identities. Historians estimate that by the early 20th century, more than three-quarters of all Native children attended one of more than 350 of these schools, including several in California. Last month, the United Urban Warrior Society-California Chapter (UUWS-CC) called on Gov. Gavin Newsom to begin an immediate investigation of all Native American boarding schools in California. ""These crimes committed against California Native Children while forced and kidnapped to attend these California Native Boarding Schools must be acknowledged by the Christian Churches and their institutions that ran them and held accountable for the crimes they committed against our Children from 1850 to the 1960s,"" the group wrote in its letter. The letter references Newsom\'s 2019 apology to California Native people, and the Truth and Healing Council that he established to help clarify the historical record and begin the reconciliation process. ""California must reckon with our dark history. California Native American people suffered violence, discrimination and exploitation sanctioned by state government throughout its history,"" Newsom said in the statement. ""We can never undo the wrongs inflicted on the peoples who have lived on this land that we now call California since time immemorial, but we can work together to build bridges, tell the truth about our past and begin to heal deep wounds."" Three large Native American boarding schools operated in California: the Fort Bidwell Indian School, the St. Boniface Indian Industrial School in Banning, and the Sherman Institute in Riverside, founded as the Perris Indian School in Perris. A cemetery at the Sherman school contains the graves of students who died there and were not returned to their families, often due to lack of funds, according to the UUWS-CC. Earlier this week, KQED Forum\'s Mina Kim discussed the troubled history of Native American boarding schools with several experts on the topic. Guests included: This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Help me understand the genesis of these schools in the 1800s. What ideology informed them? What was behind their creation? Lindsay Montgomery: The schools became a key part of the federal government\'s approach to the ""Indian problem,"" as it was called at the time during the 1870s, under the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant. Grant is saying to himself, and other Christian-minded folks, that we need to come up with a better way to deal with the remaining Native population. What he comes up with is what\'s called the Grant peace policy. And education was a fundamental part of that policy because it was believed that education was this humane way of assimilating Native people into the larger American society and making them self-sufficient citizens who wouldn\'t need government funding to be able to thrive within the dominant white society. What was life like for children at some of these schools? Lindsay Montgomery: Richard Henry \u200b\u200bPratt [who founded the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania and once proclaimed, ""Kill the Indian, and save the man""] was one of the innovators of the outing program. The outing program happened primarily during the summer months where students would be sent out to live in white homes to work as domestic laborers. During the 10-month school year, they followed a regimented curriculum. They had to do daily chores. They had to do daily drills, in military style. They had to have regular classes in things like reading, writing and arithmetic. They also had a daily prayer. They had to do daily Bible readings. They went to church and they also did a lot of physical labor. In very rural reservations, where a lot of these boarding schools were, students would be doing metalworking, they would be out harvesting crops, women would be learning how to needlepoint, or what was called domestic arts. Probably the most traumatic moment for many students was their first entry into these boarding schools, where they were systematically stripped of all outward appearances of ""Indianness."" Their hair was cut. They were given a new outfit. They were made to take baths. They were given new clothes. Often their shoes or clothes were too small and they couldn\'t fit in them properly. There\'s many stories from these boarding schools of students who were permanently disfigured, had disfigured feet, because they were made to wear these small shoes. What were the schools in California like? William Bauer: So there were two sets of boarding schools in California: the on- and off-reservation boarding school[s]. One [of the latter] was the Sherman Indian Institute, which is located in Riverside, California [now Sherman Indian High School]. There was also a boarding school located on our reservation in Mendocino County. There was another boarding school up on the Hoopa Valley Reservation as well. The Sherman Institute was kind of modeled after the Carlisle model: When students came to school, they might have their hair cut. They were often dressed in military uniforms and then asked to do military drills around the school grounds. There was an emphasis on English-only instruction. And there was an outing program where in the summer, students would go work throughout Southern California. Many boys would spend their summers working on citrus farms in and around Riverside. Girls would be domestic servants for people in Anaheim and other cities. Why did children die at these schools? Lindsay Montgomery: Unfortunately, in boarding schools like Carlisle, students would die for various reasons. A lot of it was associated with tuberculosis and other infectious diseases like cholera. Influenza was a common cause of death. A lot of it also stemmed from long-term malnutrition. Students often had very meager meals. There\'s a variety of reasons why we know only a fraction of how many Native youth actually passed away in these boarding schools. One is that many students were sent home if they began to show symptoms of sickness like tuberculosis or influenza. And so many of these students would die either in transit back to their home communities or soon after they arrived. Some people saw the schools as an opportunity to learn English. Could you talk a little bit about the complexity of this legacy? William Bauer: This is not to minimize or downplay the trauma, the deaths that are associated with [the schools], but some people were able to at least try to get what they wanted out of the school experience. When the off-reservation boarding schools were created, Native leaders, especially those from the Great Plains, wanted children to go to these off-reservation boarding schools where they could learn to read and write in English. One of the most important reasons for that is that they wanted people to be able to read and write the treaties with the United States. The United States has a long history of defrauding and violating treaties that they have with Indigenous nations. Native leaders understood that if they could have children read English, they could have their own people reading treaties and help defend themselves. And some Native people saw these schools as opportunities to get skills. There was a shift in the 1920s and 1930s away from the purely vocational training to other types of education, like training Native people to go into clerical work, what we would consider to be white-collar work. Native people saw, especially in the mid-20th century, that these schools were a place to gain skills that they otherwise couldn\'t get in rural reservation schools in the United States. Some of these schools are still open, right? Lindsay Montgomery: Today there are several boarding schools that remain open. There\'s about'}]"
