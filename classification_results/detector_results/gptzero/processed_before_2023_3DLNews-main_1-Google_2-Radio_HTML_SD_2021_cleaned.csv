It’s been a great run with plenty of offensive fart jokes, junior-high comedy and enough free concert tickets given away that when laid end to end, they’d reach all the way to Uranus! Why is he leaving? Very simple actually – he knows too much and will be entering the witness protection program for his safety. (At least that’s what he told management here at the radio station) Robbie – it’s been a blast having you around and we’ll all miss you, well – most of us will. Good luck in what lies ahead. Don’t be a stranger! Growing up watching “The Muppet Show” and “Looney Tunes,” I always wanted to create something that combined sketch comedy, my lack of knowledge on subjects like love and relationships and real anecdotes about my life and family to create a “concoction of hilarity!” So, what will you hear on The Robbie Owens Show? Ya never know! One day, my (drunk) Uncle Melvin will crash the show and use me as a therapist/life coach! The next day, I could be calling the North Pole to talk with Santa’s chief elf! The next day I could be hopping on “The Spirit Phone” (my invention) and call my Grandma Olive Whiskerchin in the afterlife to see what her and her celebrity friends are up to! I think the beauty of my show is that you never know what you’re gonna hear! So, strap yourself into the emotional rollercoaster known as The Robbie Owens Show every weekday afternoon from 2PM – 7PM and get ready to “feel.” robbie.owens@mwcradio.com This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.'}]"
