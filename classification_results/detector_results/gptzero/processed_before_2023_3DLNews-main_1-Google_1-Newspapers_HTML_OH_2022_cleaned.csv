Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 4:54 pm reporter Kozlowski Ashtabula County Commissioner Casey Kozlowski has been elected as the secretary of the County Commissioners Association of Ohio, according to a press release from the commissioners. Kozlowski will serve as secretary and a member of the CCAO executive committee starting at the beginning of 2023. “I’m certainly honored to have been elected by my fellow colleagues to serve as Secretary of the County Commissioners Association for 2023.” Kozlowski said in the press release. “A great deal of what happens in Columbus impacts us at the local level and it is imperative that we have a voice in leadership advocating for the issues that are important to counties, especially that of Ashtabula County. I’m appreciative of the support I have received and look forward to continuing my work with the association and for counties in this new leadership post.” This year will be Kozlowski’s eighth on the CCAO Board of Directors. In a phone call Wednesday, Kozlowski said the position puts him on the leadership team of CCAO. “This role will mean taking part in conversations that help set the stage for where the association hopes to take its organization, but also our policy initiatives at the state level,” he said. It will also mean that Kozlowski will be more involved with the day-to-day operations of CCAO, he said. The position is a one-year term, but in the past elected officers have moved through the elected roles, Kozlowski said. “We’ll see where this position takes me.” The CCAO performs legislative advocacy, and provides a variety of services to counties throughout Ohio, according to its website. Kozlowski was first elected to the Ashtabula County Board of Commissioners in 2014, and was re-elected in November, defeating for Ashtabula County Sheriff William Johnson to retain his seat. Kozlowski also previously served in the Ohio House of Representatives, from the 99th district, and was a member of the Pymatuning Valley Board of Education.

Wynonna Judd remarked that throughout their lives, their music had kept them together. “Music is the bridge between mom and me, and it it bonds us together,” she told the AP. “Even in the not easy times.” TheJuddsreleased six studio albums and an EP between 1984 and 1991 and won nine Country Music Association Awards and seven from the Academy of Country Music. They earned a total of five Grammy Awards together on hits like “Why Not Me” and “Give A Little Love,” and Naomi earned a sixth Grammy for writing “Love Can Build a Bridge.” The Judds also performed at the halftime of the 1994 Super Bowl, along with Travis Tritt, Clint Black and Tanya Tucker. The Judds sang about family, the belief in marriage and the virtue of fidelity. Because Naomi was so young looking, the two were mistaken for sisters early in their career. She was also known to prefer flashy stage outfits, full of sparkles and rhinestones, over casual boots and cowboy style clothing. They first got attention singing on Ralph Emery’s morning show in early 1980, where the host named them the “Soap Sisters” because Naomi said she used to make her own soap. After the success of “Mama He’s Crazy,” they won the Horizon Award at the 1984 CMA Awards. Naomi started her speech by saying “Slap the dog and spit in the fire!” Naomi Judd was open about her health struggles, as well as severe depression and anxiety. In her memoir, “River of Time,” she described her diagnosis of hepatitis C, which she said she unknowingly contracted during her time as a nurse. She said that by 1995, her doctors had told her she was completely free of the virus. In the memoir, she described feeling like she had lost her identity when she returned home after a 2010 reunion tour, isolating herself at her home and dealing with crippling panic attacks. She also said that she had been dealing with trauma from childhood sexual abuse. She was admitted to a psychiatric ward at a hospital and spent time in an outpatient treatment program. Daughter Ashley Judd is an actor and humanitarian known for her roles in such movies as “Kiss the Girls,” ″Double Jeopardy” and “Heat.” Strickland, who was a backup singer for Elvis Presley, was married to Naomi Judd for 32 years.

November, Americans over the age of 18 are encouraged to go and perform their duty as citizens of this country by voting for who will represent them in the federal government. Nationwide, all of the seats in the house of representatives were up, along with 36 state governorships as well. There were also 35 seats up for reelection in the Senate, not including many other local and statewide offices. The Democrats were able to hold on to their majority in the Senate, practically speaking. They were able to bring their total to 48 seats and two independent seats that historically align with them. Currently, 49 seats belong to the Republican party. The Democrats were able to flip the Pennsylvania Senate seat when current Lieutenant governor John Fetterman defeated Republican TV personality, Dr. Mehmet Oz. The Georgia Senate election ended in a too-close margin. Now, incumbent Senator Raphael Warnock (D) and former football player Herschel Walker (R) will face each other again in the runoff election in December. Regardless of who wins, the Democrats will hold on to control of the Senate until the next election. The Republicans were able to regain control of the House for the first time since 2018. They hold a total of 220 seats, gaining eight seats in the midterm. As of now, two seats haven’t been called. Current Speaker of the House, Nancy Peloi, is expected to be succeeded by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy from California. Of the 36 governorships up for election, 18 went to the Republican party and 18 went to the Democrat party. The Democrats flipped Arizona, Maryland and Massachusetts, while the Republicans flipped Nevada. In Ohio, with Senator Rob Portman retiring after the end of his current term, the senator’s seat is up for grabs. The Democrats nominated state representative and previous candidate for President in 2020, Tim Ryan. The Republicans nominated author and commentator, J.D. Vance. Ryan has defined himself as more of a moderate Democrat. His positions covered immigration reforms, clean energy and affordable healthcare. Vance is self-described as a “true conservative.” His positions include supporting illegalizing abortion, gun rights and other “America-first” policies. Donald Trump endorsed Vance for the race, despite Vance being critical of the former President in the past. In the end, Vance won the election to succeed Senator Portman. For Ohio’s governorship, incumbent Governor Mike DeWine went up against Mayor of Dayton, Nan Whaley. DeWine has received criticism from both sides of the political aisle. Members of his own party have criticized him for his mandates and restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats have criticized him for passing strict abortion laws and legalizing concealed carry. Whaley, during her mayorship, presided during the 2019 Dayton shooting. She also worked to decrease unemployment rates and combat the opioid crisis. She has received criticism for raising taxes and fees, as well as a high poverty and crime rate, in Dayton during her tenure. In the end, DeWine was reelected to serve a second term. Out of the 15 seats in the House of Representatives for Ohio, 10 went to the Republican party and five went to the Democrat party. Many were expecting a “red wave.” This is due to the many polarizing policies of the Biden administration, as well as the rising inflation rates that have occurred in the past year. While the Republicans performed well in certain states (notably Florida), they performed nationally below expectations in certain battleground states. Those on the right credit a lower voter turnout, or even voter fraud, as reasons why the wave wasn’t as large as expected. Those on the left credit former President Donald Trump losing influence. It’s clear that Trump still has influence in the Republican party, especially given how many of his endorsements were nominated and even won. Trump’s influence over independent voters seems less significant, though. Even within the Republican party, rising stars like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Arizona Gubernatorial Candidate Kari Lake seem to be gaining national popularity. Candidates like them may become the future of the Republican party. View all posts You must be logged in to post a comment.""}]"

Protesters rally at the Ohio Statehouse in support of abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade on Friday, June 24, 2022 in Columbus, Ohio. The Supreme Court on Friday stripped away women’s constitutional protections for abortion, a fundamental and deeply personal change for Americans' lives after nearly a half-century under Roe v. Wade. As hundreds of Ohioans seeking abortions were turned away in the days following the June 24 overturning of Roe v. Wade and the nearly immediate implementation of Ohio’s Heartbeat Law, Dr. David Burkons of Shaker Heights said he was most concerned for patients he had to turn away. Burkons owns three abortion clinics in Shaker Heights, Cuyahoga Falls and Toledo. “We had a 15-year-old sexual assault victim,” Burkons told the Cleveland Jewish News June 29. “She was in on Friday. And at the time, we told her ‘Well, you’re lucky you got in now.’” Burkons Burkons said the clinic then had to call the patient to let her know she was ineligible for an abortion following the implementation of Ohio’s Heartbeat Law. “The girl apparently became suicidal,” Burkons said. “So hopefully they can get to wherever they need to go. … That takes money, it takes time to go to these other states (where abortions are allowed).” He said the closest open abortion clinic to Northeast Ohio is in Pittsburgh and that it may entail an overnight stay. “There’s a vindictiveness in the small-mindedness of Ohio that they put the law into effect in like four hours,” said Burkons, adding that he is considering opening clinics across the border in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Freda Levenson of Shaker Heights, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, is working to reverse the Heartbeat Law for a second time. ACLU and other plaintiffs had challenged the Heartbeat Law in federal court after it was passed in 2019. Burkons' clinics, the Northeast Ohio Women's Center and the Toledo Women's Center, are among the plaintiffs. After Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost won a court order from U.S. District Court Judge Michael Barrett to dissolve the injunction on the Heartbeat Law June 24, the same group of plaintiffs sued again, this time in the Ohio Supreme Court. “The (Ohio) constitution is similar to the federal constitution,” Levenson said. “But it’s importantly different. And it’s clear that it provides higher protection for bodily autonomy than the federal constitution.” The Heartbeat Law makes no exceptions for rape, incest or other factors, but it allows a doctor a legal defense if the mother’s life is in danger by pregnancy. Levenson Levenson requested Yost and other defendants file a response by 3 p.m. June 29. That request was made, she said, based on the dire situation many people have found themselves in. “Ohio was thrust back into bad old days, where abortions were only virtually unobtainable that the majority of abortions in Ohio suddenly became unlawful,” she said, adding that there are no exceptions to the Heartbeat Law for rape or incest. Yost responded at 3 p.m., saying in a statement, “Races don’t start at the finish line, and lawsuits don’t start in the final court. Aside from filing the wrong action in the wrong court, they are wrong as well on Ohio law. Abortion is not in the Ohio Constitution.” If doctors are prosecuted for performing abortions, they may use as a defense that the mother’s life was in danger, Levenson said, but it is not an exception to the law and it will not stop the doctor from getting prosecuted. Blau Rabbi Benjamin Blau, spiritual leader of Green Road Synagogue in Beachwood who is also president of the Modern Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America, said he spoke June 25 at Shabbat services about Orthodoxy’s middle ground regarding abortion. “Judaism believes that both are vital,” said Blau, adding that his views align with Orthodoxy on this issue. “In a perfect world, I’d like the two to match up. … It would be simpler from one perspective to have more things be legal and our community educate what we think is appropriate, but I don’t know if that’s a realistic stance to take.” Blau also said a law that makes no exception for a mother’s life or psychological factors, is “not consistent with Jewish law.” “If there are no exceptions,” he said, “that’s very problematic.” Sebo Pointing out that Judaism takes into consideration the well-being of a pregnant person, Cantor Kathryn Wolfe Sebo of The Temple-Tifereth Israel in Beachwood said she felt her Jewish rights were “being stamped on.” “I’m devastated and shocked that my mother and I have had more reproductive rights in our lifetimes than my 30-year-old daughter has right now,” she said. Werber Rabbi Lauren Werber of Temple B’nai Abraham in Elyria spoke similarly, saying she was disturbed. She also noted that Jewish tradition going back to Torah does not subscribe to the belief that life begins at conception. “A mother’s life is of paramount importance, and her well-being and psychological health are part of that,” Werber said. “So Jewishly, it’s very disturbing to have a law that doesn’t allow us to live our ethics.” Vann Rabbi Alison Vann of Suburban-Temple Kol Ami in Beachwood wrote her congregants following the U.S. Supreme Court decision, as did many rabbis in Northeast Ohio and beyond. “Reform Judaism firmly believes that making decisions about how and when to build one’s family is fundamental human and individual right,” Vann wrote June 27. “Further, it is a human right to be able to make medical decisions and to have access to comprehensive health care without government interference. This case stands as an affront to human rights and a violation of our religious freedom.” She included in her writing links to websites of three organizations: National Council of Jewish Women, Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and the National Network of Abortion Funds. Colker Ruth Colker, Distinguished University Professor and Heck Faust Memorial Chair in Constitutional Law at the Moritz College of Law at The Ohio State University in Columbus, called the Supreme Court decision devastating. “From a Jewish perspective, I think there’s another really important point,” she told the CJN June 27. “This court has allowed a vocal Christian minority to make its point of view the mandatory law of the land with respect to the meaning of personhood, for all people, irrespective of their religious points of view. “Just today, the court said it was OK for a football coach to go into the center of a football field and engage in so-called voluntary prayer with his players,” Colker said, referring to the Kennedy v. Bremerton School District case. “It’s really such a rough time for those of us who care about civil liberties.” Leland A day before the decision was announced, Ohio Rep. Dave Leland, D-Columbus, told the CJN that voters have options. “The most important point is that people are not powerless in this,” he said. “People can elect the kind of people to the Ohio General Assembly that won’t pass legislation like this, if that’s what they want to do. This is not something that’s preordained. … We can still control our own democracy.” Weinstein Ohio Rep. Casey Weinstein, D-Hudson, said there are two so-called trigger bans pending in committee in Ohio’s Legislature, one in the House and one in the Senate. Those trigger bans would ban abortion in Ohio, he said. “This is a deeply personal attack on privacy, on women, on choice, on freedom, on health,” Weinstein told the CJN June 24. “It’s extreme. It’s a massive, big government overreach into our personal lives and liberties. And I will not stand for it.” Choose from the options below. In a 6-3 ruling, Justice Samuel Alito wrote in his majority opinion that the 1973 decision was “egregiously wrong from the start,” as well as a 1992 decision in “Planned Parenthood v. Casey” that affirmed that right, stating: “We hold that ‘Roe’ and ‘Casey’ must be overruled.”The post Jewish organizations split on Supreme Court decision to overturn ‘Roe v. Wade’ appeared first on JNS.org.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 5:00 am News Editor Students, faculty and staff voiced their concerns about a lack of diversity, equity and inclusion within the College of Nursing at the African American Cultural & Resource Center in a forum held on Nov. 9. A recent letter shared on social media expressing racist and genocidal rhetoric has sparked a conversation about diversity and inclusion at the University of Cincinnati (UC), especially within the College of Nursing. Students, faculty and staff voiced their concerns about a lack of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) within the College of Nursing at the African American Cultural & Resource Center in a forum held on Nov. 9. Dr. Anne Gakumo was appointed the endowed chair of diversity, equity and inclusion at the College of Nursing in October of last year and quickly learned there was much work to be done. ""In my experience since being appointed last year, I learned that we have work to do in addressing structural racism and bias,"" Gakumo said. ""We have been discussing such issues openly as a college this year as we develop our strategic plan around our DEI efforts."" Desa Dorsey, a nursing instructor in the College of Nursing, has been waiting to speak out for a long time. She believes the college minimizes African Americans and lacks the appropriate culture of DEI. Dorsey has spoken to students who have voiced concerns about the equity and cultural competence in the admissions process and the admissions committee, how diversity is defined and how Black students are recruited. ""Complaints have been made by students and faculty, students have voiced concerns regarding equity and cultural competence in the admissions process,"" Dorsey said. Furthermore, Dorsey said, they\'ve lamented ""how diversity is defined, and how Black students are recruited (to name a few) over the years."" Dr. Karen Bankston, professor emerita at the College of Nursing, earned her Ph.D. from UC in 2005. When she graduated, the program lacked diversity as Bankston was one of the three black students in her Ph.D. cohort and the only graduating student from that class. Since then, Bankston believes the college has improved its recruitment of Black students at the graduate level. ""Faculty across universities are struggling with how to incorporate discussion about truth, reconciliation, and justice and its effect on learning outcomes,"" said Bankston. Yet Dorsey\'s students and colleagues still say more work is needed. ""Racial discrimination and microaggressions are experienced by Black people in the College of Nursing, as elsewhere on campus,"" Dorsey said. ""Students have expressed the desire for more Black faculty, staff and students to create a sense of belonging and community."" Meagan Lamkin has dedicated her life to tackling this subject. Lamkin is head of the Coalition for Anti-Racist Action (CARA) and has collaborated with Dorsey on several occasions. Hired to ""broaden participation in undergraduate research,"" in 2016, Lamkin soon learned about the ""microaggressions and unconscious bias,"" realizing how ""they interact with the primary pathway into research."" Eventually, Lamkin created CARA, a ""cross-campus network staff and faculty working to support calls to action by Black-led organizations."" Despite discussing ""issues brought to our attention,"" and ""exploring solutions,"" most, according to Lamkin, haven\'t been resolved. UC is not the only nursing institute to struggle with racial disparities in its facilities. In 2019, the Cincinnati Herald found that of the advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) in Cincinnati, 85.7% were white and only 6.6% were African American. Similarly, a survey by the American Nursing Association found that 92% of respondents had experienced racism in their profession. While 72% of Black respondents said racism was an issue in nursing, only 29% of white respondents agreed. The College of Nursing at UC has improved diversity over the past decade, growing from an 8% Black student body in 2011-12 to 13.5% in 2021-22. In fact, the College of Nursing was awarded the INSIGHT award for Excellence in Diversity in 2015, doing so annually since then. Dorsey believes these awards hold little value, especially given the college of nursing\'s ""ongoing underrepresentation of Black students, staff and faculty."" Despite the positive increases in recent years, diversity and inclusion practices have ways to go at the university, according to a statement issued by Eva Fried, assistant professor at the College of Nursing and director of its nurse-midwifery program. ""What I will say is that the College of Nursing has many opportunities to address racial bias, including in the visual environment, admissions, curriculum, faculty hiring, and accountability,"" said Fried. ""For example, evaluations of faculty, staff, and curriculum could include evidence of racial bias or activities to address/redress racial bias."" Gordon Gillespie, interim dean at the College of Nursing, was unaware of any complaints about Nursing\'s admissions process.

NILES — Ann Wittenauer of Niles said she doesn’t usually make returns the day after Christmas, but this year’s unusual circumstances brought her to Boscov’s on Monday morning to return a sweater. “We postponed Christmas because of the snow,” Wittenauer said. She said the family didn’t want her husband’s elderly mother out in the weekend’s bad weather. When she was wrapping gifts, she noticed the sweater she bought for her daughter had a defect, and since the celebration was stalled, she had time to return it and look for another. Wittenauer seemed confident that she would find a replacement present at Boscov’s. “It’s my fourth time in the store — it’s huge! They have a lot to choose from.” While Monday was no Black Friday, as morning turned over to afternoon, the Eastwood Mall slowly filled up with day-after-Christmas shoppers and many seeking to make “happy returns.” Monday may have seen some extra traffic as people took advantage of the observed holiday and the mostly-clear roads. “It was a day off, so we decided to spend it together,” said Kathleen Schrecengost of Fowler, who, with her husband, Gary, stopped at Boscov’s to exchange a coat with damage to its pocket for an identical one. Melissa Scattino of Girard and her daughter, Alissa, were also at Boscov’s making returns — “Not for me,” Scattino said, “just for the kids and my mother.” Scattino’s mother didn’t like the color of a piece of clothing she was gifted, she said. She was on her way to Boscov’s jewelry counter next and then to Dick’s Sporting Goods to sort out some gifts for her kids. Like Schrecengost, Scattino said she doesn’t usually return gifts the day after the holiday, but it seemed like a good day to do it since she was off work. “They made it very easy here,” Scattino said. At Reyers, a few returns and exchanges had been done before noon, but the 136-year-old shoe retailer was expecting fewer returns compared to previous years, said owner Mark Jubelirer. “Historically, Reyers has gotten close to 10 to 12 percent returns,” Jubelirer said. “We don’t think returns will be as high over this particular holiday because so many of the purchases were fur-lined slippers or warm-lined boots, which were in high demand and tend to fit correctly.” Jubelirer said that as a retailer, it’s understood that a certain amount of holiday purchases will be returned. He said Reyers has a “liberal” return policy, which, for the most part, is if an item is returned unworn, the buyer is refunded in full. Unworn, current-styled shoes are placed back into the inventory to be resold, he said. Most retailers allow unused items to be returned to the store or exchanged with a receipt within 30 to 90 days of purchase for a full refund. Common exceptions are gift cards, perishable foods, personalized items and face masks, which can’t be returned. Some stores also do not allow returns on significantly discounted items. Returning items purchased online may come at a cost, though — a growing number of retailers are charging a shipping fee for items returned by mail. JCPenny charges an $8 return fee that is subtracted from the refund amount for online orders returned by mail, according to its return policy. “UPS will ship your order back to JCPenny for the flat $8 fee. This has been significantly discounted and will cover your entire return from a single order,” reads the policy. Dillards’ return policy notifies customers that they will be responsible for return shipping charges for online orders, and Foot Locker charges a $6.99 “smart label” fee for online orders returned by mail, except when merchandise is being returned because it was damaged. Other retailers that require the customer to cover the cost of return shipping or pay a fee include Ulta, Kohl’s, Big Lots and PetSmart. Most retailers, however, do allow online purchases to be returned in store for free, and some major stores, like Target, still offer free shipping on returns. The Eastwood Mall Target customer service desk was busy on Monday, with several shopping carts filled with returned items before 11 a.m. The carts labeled “toys” or “clothes” waited to be restocked as a steady stream of customers approached the desk to make returns or exchanges. avugrincic@tribtoday.com Today's breaking news and more in your inbox GIRARD — After meeting with engineers from MS Consultants, city officials are discussing the need to address ...

This will be your home now.” The old man asked Peter how much all this was going to cost. “Why, nothing,” Peter replied, “remember, this is your reward in Heaven.” The old man looked out the window and right there he saw a championship golf course, finer and more beautiful than any ever built on Earth. “What are the greens fees?” grumbled the old man. “This is Heaven,” St. Peter replied. “You can play for free, every day.” Next, they went to the clubhouse and saw the lavish buffet lunch, with every imaginable cuisine laid out before them, from seafood to steaks to exotic desserts and free flowing beverages. “Don’t even ask,” said St. Peter to the man. “This is Heaven, it is all free for you to enjoy.” The old man looked around and glanced nervously at his wife. “Well, where are the low-fat and low-cholesterol foods, and the decaffeinated tea?” he asked. “That’s the best part,” St. Peter replied. “You can eat and drink as much as you like of whatever you like, and you will never get fat or sick. This is Heaven!” The old man pushed, “No gym to work out at?” “Not unless you want to,” was the answer. “No testing my sugar or blood pressure or…” “Never again. All you do here is enjoy yourself.” The old man glared at his wife and said, “You and your bran muffins. We could have been here ten years ago!” That old man may have hit on something when he complained about his bran-muffin diet and having to take care of his body for so many years! The reality of that is beginning to come home to roost! I used to make fun of people who spend their days organizing their schedules around their doctors’ appointments. Since our move to Florida, my bride and I have discovered that we pay more attention to our doctors and their advice than ever. We all are very busy, and the great majority of the busyness is due to the various doctors’ appointments we are driven to keep. I guess that is because we are getting older. Most of our friends here are in the same boat. Within the past couple of months, I have visited my dentist, my dermatologist, my family doctor, and my eye doctor. We schedule social events and golf tee times around our doctors’ appointments. Like any doctor these days, not keeping those appointments not only has a financial penalty but rescheduling often means another two- to six-month wait for the new appointment! That old man may have wished he had not taken such good care of his body, but you and I have the responsibility to be good stewards of all that God has given to us, including our health. But even more important than our physical health is our spiritual health. The very same question should be asked of ourselves spiritually: How do I maintain or improve my spiritual health? What do I do to make sure that I do not deteriorate over time spiritually? In Mark 4, Jesus was talking to the crowd that had gathered around him about this very thing. He was challenging them to get in shape spiritually. He told them, “For to the one who has, more will be given, and from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.” (Mark 4:25). In other words, there is no such thing as marking time spiritually speaking. You cannot just “maintain” your spiritual health and expect it to stay the same. God is looking for people who are continually “working out” to improve their spiritual health in every way, and He honors those who do. It is very easy to become complacent spiritually and to decide we do not need to keep on eating the “fiber” of God’s Word, which is good for our spiritual health. Or we may say that it does no good to continue to put forth the “calisthenics” of prayer in our attempts to stay fit spiritually. But the truth of the matter is that if we do not continue in those disciplines, along with the “vegetables” of worshipping together with others and sharing with others our secrets for spiritual fitness, we will become flabby, and our spiritual cholesterol (that’s sin!) will increase to dangerous levels. The challenge for good physical health is to maintain a good diet and get plenty of exercise. The challenge to good spiritual health is the same: a good diet of God’s Word, and plenty of exercise in the form of prayer, worship, and meditation on the Word of God. The benefit of maintaining a good regimen for physical health is a longer and healthier life here on earth. The benefits of maintaining a good regimen for spiritual health is a long and fruitful life here on earth and will also include that litany of praise from God Himself: “Well done, good and faithful servant!” Only one thing to say then: Bring on the bran muffins!” God bless … Chuck Tabor is a regular columnist for the News Journal and a former pastor in the area.

This may sound daunting, but it doesn’t have to be—building an epic MP3 music library is easier than you think! To help get started on this project, Tubidy has put together some helpful tips and tricks for creating your music library. Organize Your Music Files The first step in creating your own music library is organizing your files. Make sure every file has its own folder and label each one with appropriate tags such as genre, artist name, album title, etc. This will make it much easier to find what you want when searching through your music library. Additionally, it’s also important to back up all of your files on external hard drives or cloud storage services just in case something happens and you lose them. Choose the Right Platforms & Software Once you have organized your music files, the next step is choosing the right platforms and software for playing and streaming them. There are several popular options out there including iTunes, Spotify, Pandora, Google Play Music, and more. Each platform has its pros and cons so consider what type of service best suits your needs before making a decision. Additionally, if you want full control over your library, investing in audio software such as Adobe Audition or Pro Tools might be worth considering. Download Free Tracks & Albums If you don’t want to pay for tracks or albums, plenty of free online resources allow you to download high-quality MP3 files without spending any money. Sites like Bandcamp allow users to stream entire albums for free while SoundCloud offers thousands of free tracks from both established artists and upcoming musicians alike. Many of these sites also offer paid downloads as well if you decide later on that you would like to support the artist directly by purchasing their work. Find Affordable Sources If budget is an issue, then plenty of ways to build up your music collection without breaking the bank. Sites such as Amazon Music Unlimited provide a wide selection of songs at very reasonable prices while Apple Music allows subscribers access to millions of tunes for only $9.99 per month (or $14/month if they have family plans). Additionally, services such as Tidal offer exclusive content from top artists along with discounted rates for students—so keep an eye out for any special deals that could save you some money in the long run! Look Out For Deals & Promotions It never hurts to keep an eye out for sales and promotions as you build up your music library; many digital stores offer discounts at certain times of the year, which can save you a lot of money in the long run! Also, keep an eye out for blogs dedicated to providing information about upcoming releases; they often post giveaways or other special promotions that can give you access to new material for free! Finally, don’t forget to use social media – many labels use Twitter or Facebook accounts to promote exclusive deals, so follow their pages closely! Use streaming services wisely Streaming services have become incredibly popular these days due to their convenience, but they can also eat up your monthly data allowance depending on how much time you spend listening each month! If possible, try using higher quality settings when streaming (such as 320kbps); most streaming services allow users to access higher bit rates, which should result in less data usage overall (and better sound quality too!). Enjoy your new library! Congratulations – you now have all the tools you need to create the perfect personal MP3 music library! Take advantage of all the different resources available online today, whether you want to download free tracks, shop around for affordable sources, take advantage of special offers, or simply enjoy unlimited streams without ever paying a penny! Enjoying great sound whenever you need it has never been easier thanks to modern technology – so get ready to experience musical bliss anytime with ease! In the past few years, there has been a massive increase in private messaging. It may seem like it’s here to stay, but is that really the case? When you think about it, how many times have you actually used an instant messaging application? The answer, I’m afraid, is probably not very often at all. So what exactly does this type of communication entail? How do instant messaging applications compare with other modes of communication? And how can you use these services effectively to maximize your privacy and security? The first thing we need to establish is what exactly makes up instant messaging. If you’re new to the concept, it’s worth pointing out that instant messaging is different from email. Email is designed for bulk transfer of large amounts of data; instant messages are designed for direct and personal communication between two people, usually over short distances. It also differs from social networks. Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn are designed for sharing information with others in real-time. They’re also used by businesses to promote their products and services. Instant messaging applications, on the other hand, are designed solely for one-to-one communications. They provide a safe space for users to chat privately without leaving any trace of their activity behind them. This makes instant messaging ideal for situations where you want to hide your online identity. For example, if you’re using an instant messaging service like WhatsApp to organise meetings with friends, it would be much more difficult for someone else to find out who you were meeting with if they weren’t able to see your contact list. Of course, as soon as you leave the confines of your own home, you’ll find that not everyone will agree with your choice of mode of communication. You might be thinking that if you’re going to be using a third party app to communicate with your family and friends, then you don’t want to give anyone access to your account. That’s certainly true, but you should also consider the fact that most messaging apps offer some form of encryption (or end-to-end encryption). This means that no one apart from you and the person you’re communicating with can read the contents of your message. In this way, even if the company holding your login details was hacked, the hacker wouldn’t be able to access your conversations. Encryption is especially important when using instant messaging apps because they’re more likely than regular email to be intercepted while in transit. So why are instant messaging apps so popular? Well, aside from being easy to set up and use, the main reason is that they allow you to communicate with multiple people at once. If you’re using a multi-device setup, like myself, this becomes crucial. Imagine you’re trying to get hold of a group of friends to plan something together. You could send a text message, but it could take forever before they respond. You could try calling them on the phone, but you know how busy they are, and you’d be wasting time talking to each other rather than getting down to business. Instead, you could simply fire off an IM to your whole group and wait for them to respond. They can reply back to you individually, or you can keep chatting with all of them at the same time. All you’ve done is saved yourself a lot of time. Another advantage of instant messaging apps is that you can talk to people you don’t know well. If you’re just starting out in life, you might be reluctant to make too many close friends. However, the ability to connect with strangers instantly allows you to meet people who share your interests and build lasting friendships. There’s another benefit to using instant messaging apps: speed. We live in a world where things move quickly. Most people are now accustomed to receiving emails and texts within seconds of sending them. Instant messaging apps bring us closer to that level of responsiveness, giving you the chance to speak to someone in less time than it'}]"

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 4:51 am Winners in Sunday’s God, Flag and Country Oratorical Contest included the first-place winners in the front row: Markenna Pfenning (10-11), Matthew Anspach (12-13) and Keianna Wellman (14-15). Also participating were Violet Caldwell (10-11) and Destiny Howard (12-13) and organizer Herb Limbert. Missing from the photo was contestant Kiera Wellman (12-13). The world could use more love and service. That thought was what inspired Kienna Wellman of New Knoxville’s entry in the annual God, Flag and Country oratorical contest sponsored by the Wapakoneta Eagles organization. Matthew Ansbach recalled there was no moment of silence held in September of last year to honor the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attack, which included the bombing of the World Trade Center Towers and the Pentagon, and the crash of an airplane in Pennsylvania, and used a story during that event to inspire his speech. Thankful to be living in a time where children are allowed to go to school rather than be working in factories was the spark that gave Makenna Pfenning a topic on which to base her speech entry in the contest. The speeches were presented to a panel of judges Sunday afternoon. All three winners in their age divisions, 14-15, 12-13, and 11-12 respectively, will represent Wapakoneta in the District Contest, set for March 20 at the Celina Eagles.

(Submitted photo) LISBON — The village’s public pool will open at noon on Sunday after being closed for two years. The pool was first closed in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and then in 2021 had to remain closed because of leaking problems. The pool is getting a late start opening this year due to weather delays on the work that needed to be done, which also included a full repaint and recaulking work, in addition to other upgrades. The work began in February and included major renovations in the changing rooms, all new siding on the building and new concrete poured. The pool also received an extensive cleaning. Mayor Peter Wilson said that work to get the pool operational again has been a community effort and as a result admission will be free to the public on Sunday. The village has also funded the pool work with state money. In total, upgrades and getting the pool operational amounted to just over $41,000. The village was most recently holding off on opening the pool in order to have it first inspected by the county health department, and that inspection was performed on Friday. “Many people in the community either donated money or time to help get the pool ready. We want to showcase the pool the first day it opens. What better way to do it by offering a free passage,” Wilson said. The village will not offer season passes this year due to the late start. “We want everyone to come check out all of the work that has a been done and to see how beautiful it is. We are all so excited the day is finally here,” City Council member and parks chairperson Linda Donnalley said of the reopening.

McGlaughlin seems to hint that maybe some D-I college coaches should consider giving Meyer an opportunity, at least preferred walk-on status. Meyer might prove that he can earn that scholarship because he has the athleticism and a proven ability to jump with people six, seven inches taller. “Jacob Meyer is just a great basketball player. College coaches need to take a good, hard look at him,” McGlaughlin said. “I know he’s 6-3, 6-4, but the way he elevates and it’s just the way he goes about the game. He goes about the game the right way. To see a kid compete like that and being able to watch him for four years and watch him grow, he used to be a really good athlete who could play basketball. Now, he’s a really good basketball player who is an athlete and that is a credit to him and the coaching staff.” Meyer is this year’s Alan Miller Jewelers All-Press Player of the Year, getting seven more votes than Rossford 6-10 junior Derek Vorst. The two combined got all but one vote. Meyer, who can play guard, forward, or wing, averaged 19.2 points, 7.3 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 1.8 steals and 1.8 blocks. In becoming the Northern Buckeye Conference Player of the Year, he led the Eagles to a 22-4 season and outright league title at 13-1. Vorst, who lives in the Eastwood district but his father Brian coaches at Rossford, averaged 15.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, 2.5 assists, and shot 70% from inside the arc, 43% from outside the arc, 68% from the free throw line and made just 1.9 turnovers per game. Those are good shooting numbers for a player who is two inches short of being seven foot tall and is a junior. Rossford finished the year 17-7 and as NBC runners-up (12-2) with both league losses coming to Eastwood, 61-59 in overtime at the George Wolfe Field House and 65-38 in Pemberville. However, the Bulldogs had just one senior, Oregon resident Ben Morrison, a 6-3 senior guard. Morrison is first team All-Press, averaging 12.3 points, three rebounds, 2.7 assists, and 1.7 steals. He shot 65% from inside the arc, 31% from outside and made 67% of his free throws, plus committed just 1.6 turnovers per game. In voting by 11 area coaches and 10 media members, rounding out the All-Press first team are Cardinal Stritch 5-9 junior guard Christian Burton, Oak Harbor 6-2 senior wing T.J. Hallett and Gibsonburg 6-6 senior post Aidan McGough. Burton is the younger brother of former Stritch player Jordan Burton, now a 5-10 junior guard playing alongside 6-4 junior guard Jacob Plantz (Genoa) at Lake Erie College in Painesville. Following in his brother’s footsteps, Christian averaged 13.2 points, 3.1 steals, and 4.1 assists, leading the Cardinals to an 18-8 season and the district finals, where they fell to Eastwood, 55-42, as Meyer put up 33 points and grabbed 11 rebounds. Hallett, a first team All-Sandusky Bay Conference Bay Division and District 6 player, averaged 19.1 points, 5.9 rebounds and 1.3 assists. The Rockets were 4-6 in the Bay Division and finished 12-12 after losing 45-43 to Elmwood in a D-III sectional final. McGough was the only local player to average a double-double with 17.1 points and 10.2 rebounds. The Golden Bears were 15-10 overall and 9-7 in the SBC River Division, reaching the D-IV district tournament where they fell to Old Fort, 54-38.

Dear Monica, Cantor Gary Gelender, 67, left us too soon on May 30. Gary was born Oct. 18, 1956 in Cleveland to the late Robert and Sara (Levine) Gelender. A vehicle with a red swastika on the passenger door is parked in the driveway of a South Green Road home in Beachwood on June 12. A vehicle parked in the driveway of a South Green Road home in Beachwood with what appeared to be a swastika in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood within a half-mile of several Orthodox synagogues garnered attention on social media – and on the street on June 12. The swastika appeared to have been placed on a Toyota Sequoia using red tape and was removed by the morning of June 13 and a gay pride flag covered the rear windshield. In a June 13 news release, Beachwood police said they received a complaint just before 5 p.m. June 12 regarding the image, which may have been a Hindu symbol. “The complaint was that a ‘Swastika’ was being displayed on the passenger side of the vehicle,” the police report reads. “An officer responded to the area and confirmed what was reported but had no cause to take action. At 8:41 p.m., a small group gathered on the sidewalk in front of (the house). The group had a calm conversation with an occupant of the home. A Beachwood police officer was present and only explained what rights each side had. After the conversation, the occupant of the home decided to remove the Swastika from the vehicle. The city of Beachwood recognizes that this incident is concerning to the Jewish community and the community as a whole. Although incidents such as this rightfully can cause fear and anxiety, there was no violation of law that the police department can act on at this time.” A photo of the vehicle, with the red symbol on the passenger door, was also posted on the Facebook groups, Cleveland Jewish and University Heights Ohio Discussion on June 12. “There’s somebody parked on Green with a big red swastika on their car,” a post read in University Heights Ohio Discussion. “Couldn’t catch if it was UH or Beachwood?” At the time, eleven people signified they were angry using an emoji of a red face. Four expressed surprise with an emoji. The administrator of the group removed the post with an explanation. “I removed the post about the swastika on the house because we have a rule against posting addresses of houses,” Mark Selent wrote June 12 on the private Facebook group. “Feel free to repost without the address.” Among those posting at University Heights Ohio Discussion, one person wrote, “Wherever it is, that’s really messed up. Terribly sorry for the hate & any reaction it’s causing.” The vehicle had a sign in the rear windshield advertising Hyperbaric Therapy of Brook Park. Christopher Dodson, who owns the Snow Road business, said that sign had been stolen from his business and he intended to review surveillance video and to file a police report with Beachwood police regarding the theft. He said the sign for the business had been removed June 10 to allow for the walls to be painted and was missing as of June 13. “I had two calls last night saying we were advertising our business on a Nazi vehicle,” Dodson told the Cleveland Jewish News June 13. He noted that the symbol was actually a Hindu image, not the Nazi swastika, based on its orientation. “That was an alarm to me because that’s not in any shape or form how we portray ourselves, Dodson said. “We’re a health care company. We provide alternative medicine to heal people, not to make people sick.” As of the morning of June 13, the swastika had been removed from the passenger door of the Toyota Sequoia parked in the driveway of a Beachwood home. In addition a placard with a business name had been covered by the gay pride flag on the back of the car. Managing Editor Bob Jacob contributed to this story. Choose from the options below.

Slight chance of a rain shower. High 78F. Winds WSW at 5 to 10 mph.. A few clouds. Low 59F. Winds N at 5 to 10 mph. Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 4:50 am According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 37 million Americans have diabetes and 96 million have prediabetes. More than 37 million people in the United State have diabetes — equaling around one in every 10 people — and the risk for the most prevalent type can often be reduced through lifestyle changes. Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body doesn’t make enough insulin and accounts for 5-10% of all diagnosed cases of diabetes, while Type 2 is when the body can’t use insulin properly and accounts for 90-95% of cases. Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that can develop during pregnancy in women who don’t already have diabetes. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), of the 37 million people in the U.S. who have diabetes, one in five people don’t know they have it. Furthermore, 96 million Americans — which is more than one in three — have prediabetes, which is when blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetic. Of those, more than eight in 10 adults with prediabetes don’t know they have it. Specifically in Ohio, the American Diabetes Association reports 12.1% of the adult population has been diagnosed with diabetes, while 33.6% of adults in the state have prediabetes. Tara Leahy, health educator at the Henry County Health Department, said, according to the most recent community health assessment, 9.3% of adults in Henry County have been diagnosed with diabetes. There is no known way to prevent Type 1 diabetes, but most cases of Type 2 diabetes can be prevented, according to the CDC. Leahy explained it’s important to be aware of risk factors for the disease — having prediabetes, being overweight, being 45 years or older, having a parent, brother or sister who has diabetes, being physically active less than three times a week and having had gestational diabetes. Also, African Americans and Hispanic or Latino persons are at a higher risk. Symptoms of diabetes includes being very thirsty, losing weight without trying, urinating a lot especially at night, blurry vision, dry skin, wounds that heal slowly and numb or tingling hands or feet. Leahy noted those symptoms can easily be confused with other conditions or aging and added those with risk factors for diabetes are encouraged to work with their health care provider to determine if they are prediabetic or diabetic and, if they are, how to address it. While all individuals with Type 1 diabetes must take insulin, there are different combinations of treatments for Type 2 diabetes which could include insulin or other medication, as well as lifestyle changes. “You can prevent or delay Type 2 with these lifestyle changes — losing weight, eating a healthy diet, getting regular physical activity,” Leahy said, adding losing 5-7% of body weight can lower the risk, as well as eating healthier. “Low fat doesn’t have to mean low flavor — use herbs and roast, broil, grill steam or bake and avoid frying.” As far as physical activity, two and a half hours of physical activity every week is advised, which could be broken down into 30 minutes of walking five days a week. For those who smoke, quitting is also recommended. Individuals with diabetes have a higher risk of serious health complications such as blindness, kidney failure, heart disease, stroke and loss of toes, feet or legs. In addition, Leahy noted individuals with diabetes are two to three more times likely to have depression compared to those without diabetes and added stress can also impact blood sugar levels. According to the CDC, diabetes is the seventh leading cause of the death in the United States and the number of adults diagnosed with diabetes has more than doubled in the last 20 years as the country’s population ages and and has become more overweight or obese. In addition, medical costs and lost wages for people diagnosed with diabetes totals $327 billion each year.

Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, penned a heartfelt note to the people of Ukraine this week. In an exclusive leak obtained by DelawareOhioNews.com, the musician and fashion icon shows his support for the war effort while sharing his hopes for the future. He also announced a new pair of Adidas Yeezy sneakers, “Yens,” which will honor him and Ukrainians everywhere. The Yeezus ski mask character and Ukrainian flag were drawn on the front of the card. The note read: Dear Ukraines, You’re more people than I thought! Like PEOPLE people. When I see you, I see Ye. That’s ME. When you look in the mirror, I hope that is what you see too. Ukraine-yens. Yens will be the next Yeezys. We are going to do big things when this is over. We will change the world. War good so we can more good. LOVE, YE I can’t find a date posted on this site .

Student Newspaper Pictured is “Barbarian,” directed by Zach Cregger; “Top Gun: Maverick,” directed by Joseph Kosinski; and “Bones and All,” directed by Luca Guadagnino. Luke Osciak | Arts & Entertainment Editor For some people, the best part about the end of the year isn’t Christmastime or a break from school. Instead the end of the year is when we stare at our Letterboxd accounts and figure out our favorite movies from the year. Surprisingly, 2022 has been an extraordinary year for the movie industry. It’s been a year full of box office hits while having many new offerings from acclaimed directors. After years of restrictions on the movie industry due to COVID-19, many directors are now free from these constraints and are putting out the best work in their careers. Here are some of our favorite movies of 2022. Barbarian “Barbarian” directed by Zach Cregger is his solo directorial debut, which is incredible as “Barbarian” is one of my most engaging films of the year. Cregger is most famous for the New York-based comedy troupe “Whitest Kids U’ Know.” His comedic efforts paid off as “Barbarian” perfectly underscores much of its horror with subtle comedy. The movie follows Tess as she visits Detroit for a job interview. At her Airbnb however, she discovers it has been double-booked and that a strange man is already staying there. The movie follows Tess throughout the weekend and slowly reveals that there is much more to be afraid of than just the stranger in her Airbnb. With a razor sharp pace and great reveals, “Barbarian” is one of the best horror thrillers of the year. Top Gun: Maverick On the Flyer News Instagram page (@flyernews) we held a poll to see what the students thought was the best movie of the year. The winner of that poll was “Top Gun: Maverick”. Honestly, how could it not be? The film surpassed “Black Panther” as the fifth-highest grossing movie in domestic box office history with films such as “Titanic,” “Avatar” and “Avengers: Endgame” being ahead of it. We think the film has earned this spot as it is one of the best Hollywood blockbusters in a long time. In an industry where CGI is more prevalent than ever, the visuals of seeing Tom Cruise almost pass out in a cockpit from G-forces is refreshing, awestriking and iconic. The duo of Tom Cruise and Miles Teller deliver some of the most charismatic performances of the year while also pulling through for the hard-hitting emotional moments. The dedication to real action while utilizing the most classic Hollywood movie tropes, makes “Top Gun: Maverick” an instant classic amongst modern blockbusters, and a Flyer News favorite. Bones and All The past five years has been incredibly successful for director Luca Guadagnino. In 2017 he released “Call Me by Your Name,” a film that introduced his oeuvre to a wider audience than ever before. With its immersive cinematography and beautiful scenery, Guadagnino treats the audience to a romance story that is as beautiful as the country-side of Italy itself. In 2018, the director released “Suspira”, inspired by the 1977 film by Dario Argento of the same name. “Suspiria” is the complete opposite of “Call Me By Your Name.” It is visceral and haunting in the best ways possible and had some of the best body horror of the year. For his 2022 film “Bones and All”, Guadagino set out to combine both of his talents to tell a cannibal-romance set across the backdrop of the Midwest. The film follows Maren (Taylor Russel) and Lee (Timothee Chalamet) as they travel across America struggling to maintain the balance between their personal morality and their insatiable desire to be cannibals. The best part of this movie is Guadagnino’s perspective on the Midwest. The director handles the lonesome interstates, parking lots and Rust-Belt towns of America with the same eye for beauty that he used to capture Italy in “Call Me by Your Name.” Both lead actors deliver incredible performances that reveal so much unsaid between the two characters. These moments of beauty are contrasted with the ugly and feral reality that these teenagers are growing up into a world that actively isolates them from every part in it. It is my personal film of the year and I think that carries a lot of weight for how many good movies were released in 2022. If you need more recommendations, check out “Tár,” “Bodies Bodies Bodies” or “Nope.” All of these movies are a great way to pass the time this winter break and will get you ready for the upcoming Oscar season. If you really want something to do over winter break, try making a Letterboxd account. Letterboxd is a free social media application that lets its users log and review films they have seen.

the scientific name Sassafras albidum, since I was a kid. One of the reasons I remember sassafras is I had a Cub Scout leader who founds some roots from a tree that smelled like root beer. My Scoutmaster cleaned the roots up before he put them in a pot of water over an open fire. He boiled the water with the roots in the water. Then he poured the tea into some of our tin cups through a funnel with some fabric to clean up the tea. You could squish up the cups and put it in your backpack, and the tea tasted like root beer. Wow! We sat around a fire and enjoyed our root beer tea and listened to our scoutmaster and learned about trees. Recently, a friend asked me about a sassafras tree she had in her yard and whether she should keep it. I said I had a good experience with sassafras trees and she might have some fun with it. I had no idea the controversy behind this tree until I had stepped into the health food store to ask about whether they carried sassafras health care products. Maybe capsules, teas or essential oils that have sassafras enzymes, safrole, in them would help me to understand the health qualities of the tree. The health food expert said the USDA had come through the store and removed all of the products connected with sassafras. “Why?” She did not give me any specifics, but it seemed serious. I found a blog talking about how many health benefits there were from using the roots for this tree. This article said there were as many as 19 health benefits using it as a supplement. Sassafras helps your liver, purifies your blood, thins your blood, reduces blood pressure by taking toxins out and strengthening your immune system and much more. Sounded like the supplement would be something anyone would want. I found out different. We all should be happy to know that since 1960, the safrole compound that may cause cancer has been extracted out of most compounds that are prepared for human consumption. The strange part is you can find this safrole in not just sassafras tree but also in cinnamon, nutmeg, black pepper and basil. There was a study done in 1977 saying the metabolites of safrole in both rats and humans was inconclusive with regards to carcinogenic metabolites in their urine. In other words, the results were questionable. What I do know is our pioneer forefathers and native Indians have been using the plant for their health for centuries in many ways. I did some investigating with my arborist friend, Tom Hunt. He has seen differences in the sizes of the trees and certain characteristics between certain sassafras trees north of U.S. Route 30 versus south of U.S. Route 30 where the glaciers came and then stopped. I thought it was an interesting discussion. Hunt suggested the lumber from the tree is something to be desired. I found out the lumber is rot resistant, straight grained, easy to work and has colors of orange, olive and mostly light brown heartwood. Sapwood has distinct lighter hues. Furniture makers use this wood regularly. Facebook is an interesting place to talk to experts about anything. I was fortunate in having a friend called Big Trees Ohio. I found the largest sassafras tree in Ohio is near Kent. It is 266 inches in circumference, 60 feet tall and 75 feet across in the canopy. No matter how you look at it, we are looking at a substantial sassafras tree. I went to ATI to take a closer look at some of the sassafras trees on the campus and Secrest Arboretum. I only found one potential group of saplings. I was able to confirm they were there but that was about it. Thank you for your help ATI Horticulturalist Caroline. You were very helpful. In answer to my friend and reader’s question, I feel the Ague tree is well worth keeping. If you have more questions, let me know. Enjoy your root beer without being concerned about the consequences. Drink with moderation and enjoy your own root beer. They really can’t cancel something that has been done for centuries. I hope you have a great stroll through your garden this week and enjoy the big trees. If you see a challenge, drop me a line at ericlarson546@yahoo.com.

Why does stress cause anxiety? The link between stress and anxiety is well documented and has been studied extensively. Scientists have concluded that stress causes anxiety because it releases the stress hormone cortisol into the bloodstream. Cortisol is a hormone produced in the adrenal gland (the organ that produces adrenaline) which helps regulate blood pressure and heart rate. Cortisol also plays a role in regulating glucose levels in the blood. When the level of cortisol rises too high it can lead to insomnia, stomach ulcers and other digestive disorders. When the level of cortisol stays high for longer than normal periods of time, this can cause serious issues including anxiety, depression, headaches, muscle tension, poor memory and concentration, weight gain and even diabetes. So, while stress may be bad for our health, it’s important to note that it doesn’t necessarily need to be stressful. Many people who suffer from anxiety and/or stress find that taking CBD oil makes a significant difference to their day to day life. It’s important to understand that CBD oil is completely natural and does not contain any THC, making it legal to buy and consume in the UK and across Europe. People all over the world are using CBD oil to improve their quality of life and manage their symptoms. How does CBD work? In simple terms, CBD works on how the brain communicates with the rest of the body. When we experience stress and anxiety, our body reacts by releasing large amounts of the stress hormone cortisol. Cortisol travels through the bloodstream and reaches the hippocampus region of the brain where it interacts with neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine. These neurotransmitters produce changes in our mood and behavior. For example, the serotonin neurotransmitter regulates mood swings, appetite, sleep, libido and sexual pleasure. Norepinephrine helps control blood pressure, heart rate, breathing and perspiration, among other bodily functions. As you could imagine, these changes in behavior and mood can have a major impact on our daily lives. They affect everything we do – every decision we make, every relationship we enter into, every job we go for and every single thing we think, say and do. We become anxious and stressed about almost everything. How does CBD oil reduce stress & anxiety? Many people who take CBD oil report less stress after just a few short days compared to before taking the oil. Some users notice reduced anxiety immediately after starting to use CBD oil. Others find that the effects last for weeks or months after the initial intake. CBD oil targets the endocannabinoid system which is responsible for controlling our mood, emotions and reactions to stress and anxiety. Endocannabinoids play a key role in maintaining mental and physical wellbeing and reducing stress and anxiety. They are found in the brain and throughout the body. There are two types of cannabinoid receptors: CB1 and CB2. CB1 receptors are located in the central nervous system, whereas CB2 receptors are found in the peripheral nervous system. Both types of receptor are present throughout the brain and the body in varying quantities. The CB1 receptors are mainly found within the limbic system (the part of the brain that controls emotional responses, motivation and pleasure). This is why CBD affects CB1 receptors directly and indirectly. CBD binds directly to CB1 receptors which reduces the amount of cortisol circulating in the bloodstream. At the same time, CBD binds to CB2 receptors throughout the body. These receptors are found in nerve endings, immune cells, muscles, organs, glands and organs. By binding to CB2 receptors, CBD lowers the production of inflammatory chemicals (such as histamine, prostaglandins and cytokines), which further reduces stress and anxiety. CBD also acts as a powerful antioxidant, protecting the cells against damage caused by free radicals. CBD oil has anti-inflammatory properties which help treat conditions such as arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout, lupus, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple sclerosis. What else can CBD do? There is so much more that CBD oil can do. Apart from helping people with anxiety and stress, CBD oil has also proven to help people suffering from PTSD, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, epilepsy, pain relief, migraines, and insomnia. Many studies are underway to determine whether CBD can help people suffering from anxiety and stress related disorders such as social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. While some of these studies have shown promising results, others have failed to produce positive findings. More research is needed to confirm whether CBD really does help alleviate stress and anxiety. It’s worth noting that CBD is not a cure-all. While it can be used to treat specific medical conditions, it cannot replace conventional medicine. However, it can complement traditional treatments, particularly when combined with other supplements and herbal remedies. I am Julia. I am extremely fascinated by the world of news.
