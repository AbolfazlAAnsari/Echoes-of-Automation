Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 5:48 pm MARTINSBURG — To help navigate possible postage delays and avoid anticipated crowded polling locations, Berkeley County Election officials urge registered voters to request their absentee ballot in as soon as possible and plan out their November voting experience in advance. Darrell Shull, the county’s new chief deputy clerk who began working on Aug. 1, said as of Sept. 8, the office has received 3,758 requests for general election absentee ballots as well as 150 requests for absentee ballots from citizens living oversees and members of the armed services. Though he said it is always hard to predict voter turnout, the election office is expecting between 10,000 and 20,000 absentee ballot requests for this year’s general election. “In West Virginia you must request an absentee ballot for every election,” Shull said. “Just because you voted absentee in the primary doesn’t mean you will get one for the general so we want people to be on top of it. People can request their ballot and expect us to start mailing them out on September 18 and then, for every request we get after that date, we intend to mail the ballot out the next day after receiving the request. Because of COVID-19, anyone can vote by absentee and no registered voter will be denied their right to vote by absentee.” Shull said though everyone has the chance to request an absentee ballot until Oct. 28, it is best if those who plan to vote absentee request their ballot sooner rather than later to allow for plenty of mailing time to get the ballot to their home, filled out and mailed back to the election office before election day, as the ballot has to at the very latest be post marked by Election Day to be counted. Shull said those who request an absentee ballot have the option to hand deliver their filled out form to the office, so long as it is received at the latest by the day before the election. Shull said if anyone wants to avoid requesting an absentee ballot in favor of voting early, registered voters are able to vote in person from Oct. 21 to Oct. 31 at the voter registration office on the main floor of the county building at 400 W. Stephen St. As previously reported, during the primary election held earlier this summer, of Berkeley County’s 78,714 registered voters, 23,005 ballots were cast, making up only 29.23% of the voting population in the county. According to Donnie Plotner, previous election official with the county, a total of 10,358 absentee ballots were returned and counted with 10,678 people showing up on primary Election Day to vote and the remaining 1,969 having voted early. Shull said people can apply for their ballot online at govotewv.com and anyone with questions is encouraged to call the office at (304) 264 -1989.

Oct 4, 2020 Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes (15) and head coach Andy Reid bump fists after an NFL football game against the Baltimore Ravens, Monday, Sept. 28, 2020, in Baltimore. The Chiefs won 34-20. (AP Photo/Gail Burton) One of the NFL’s premier matchups of the early schedule has been postponed due to players testing positive for the coronavirus. Patriots starting quarterback Cam Newton and Chiefs practice squad quarterback Jordan Ta’amu were both placed on the COVID-19 reserve list Saturday. The game will be played Monday or Tuesday, the league said. It is the second game postponed this weekend: Pittsburgh at Tennessee was moved to Week 7 after an outbreak of the coronavirus with the Titans. Buffalo (3-0) at Las Vegas (2-1) Should the Bills win — a long shot considering the history of this original AFL rivalry — they would invoke some positive history. The Bills are 1-11 in their past 12 road games against the Raiders, with the only win in the past 54 seasons coming in 1991 in Los Angeles. But Buffalo is seeking back-to-back 4-0 starts for the third time in franchise history. The Bills did it in 1991 and 1992 on the way to AFC titles, and in 1964-65 when they won AFL championships. Seattle (3-0) at Miami (1-2) OK, OK. Everyone in America seems to know that Russell Wilson is the best NFL quarterback to not receive an MVP vote in his career. His numbers so far are very MVP-like, of course. Wilson is the first player to have at least four touchdown passes in each of his first three games in a season. He leads the league with 14, the most after three games in NFL history. New Orleans (1-2) at Detroit (1-2) Who Dat going to beat the Saints? Well, the Raiders and Packers the past two weeks while New Orleans was minus 2019 Offensive Player of the Year Michael Thomas (ankle). The star receiver, probably the NFL’s most valuable performer who is not a quarterback, hopes to be back against the Lions. The Saints have lost consecutive games for the first time in three years. Chargers (1-2) at Tampa (2-1) Rookie Justin Herbert is the third quarterback in NFL history to throw for 300 yards in his first two games. But if Tyrod Taylor is recovered from a medical mishap, he could start. Bucs WR Mike Evans has four TD receptions, one of three players with a TD catch in each of the first three games. But Tampa Bay’s other top wideout, Chris Godwin, is hobbled with a hamstring issue. Baltimore (2-1) at Washington (1-2) That should be a ticked-off group of Ravens traveling down I-95 to take on their “neighbors.” Kansas City exposed the Baltimore offense when it falls out of Lamar Jackson’s comfort zone, though the Ravens did show some spunk in the second half. Arizona (2-1) at Carolina (1-2) Each team comes off unexpected results. The Panthers went out to LA and beat the Chargers handily. The Cardinals, one of the league’s most impressive starters in 2020, fell to the previously winless Lions. The Panthers have won four straight games against the Cardinals and 11 of the past 14. Indianapolis (2-1) at Chicago (3-0) If the Nick Foles era is beginning in Chicago, well, we know he is capable of doing big things, as he proved in 2017 with the Eagles. The Bears finally tired of Mitchell Trubisky’s inconsistency, and Foles brought them back to beat Atlanta. New York Giants (0-3) at Los Angeles Rams (2-1) Traveling cross country seeking a first victory isn’t the best route, and the Giants were only surpassed by their MetLife Stadium compadres, the Jets, for inept performances through three weeks. They are banged-up everywhere. Atlanta (0-3) at Green Bay (3-0) Could two teams look more opposite? The Falcons have blown big leads the past two weeks in dramatic fashion, putting an already under-fire coaching staff even closer to the flames. Atlanta’s defense has been a sieve and its offense has disappeared in fourth quarters. Cleveland (2-1) at Dallas (1-2) We never know which Browns or Cowboys team will show up each game. Cleveland was awful in its opener against Baltimore, then beat up on Cincinnati and Washington. That means the Browns lost to a good opponent and defeated two tail-enders. Philadelphia (0-2-1) at San Francisco (2-1) “We’re coaching like we’re playing against Carson Wentz who is one of the better quarterbacks in this league. He was the best player in the league the year they won the Super Bowl,” 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan says. Jacksonville (1-2) at Cincinnati (0-2-1) The fact that Joe Burrow and his teammates were crushed by tying at Philadelphia says a lot about the new mindset in Cincinnati. The top overall draft pick has been solid so far, finding a favorite target in Tyler Boyd, who has 21 receptions. Minnesota (0-3) at Houston (0-3) The Texans have fallen to the Chiefs, Ravens and Steelers, total record 8-1. Their defense has been unimpressive.

HARPERS FERRY — Negotiations to get the Hill Top House up and running as a luxury hotel continued Wednesday as the Harpers Ferry Town Council met with members of SWaN, the developer behind the hotel project, as part of a special meeting for the second time in as many weeks. At the center of the discussion was the town’s Home Rule status, which allows it to dispose of town property without it going to a public auction first, which would help move along the process for SWaN, which is looking to own some of the property that surrounds the Hill Top House. As Kin Sayre, the lawyer the town hired to help negotiate the deal, explained Wednesday night, the town has a couple options to consider in order to complete the process. “Home Rule power would give the town the ability to sell property greater than $1,000 without an auction,” he said. “A second way to transfer property without auction is to swap. The town would have the authority to transfer property, and there are ways to do it, but we would just have to jump through some hoops to allow us to do it.” The price tag was a revelation Wednesday night, because until then, many in the community assumed that the town could only sell property for less than $1,000 or else it would risk sending the property to auction. With the Home Rule provision, however, the $1,000 requirement is eliminated and thus the town could sell SWaN the lots, or the two parties could orchestrate a swap, as long as the value of land is equal. A recent appraisal of the land that SWaN engineered in order to purchase it came in at approximately $200,000. Because there most likely isn’t enough property value to do an outright swap in this instance, that would leave the two sides to negotiate a deal where some land and some cash may be exchanged. The notion of appraisal became a point of contention between the two parties at Wednesday’s meeting when Harpers Ferry Mayor Wayne Bishop suggested SWaN finance another appraisal on the land, despite the company doing so less than a year ago. SWaN’s Managing Director Fred Schaufeld, however, argued that engaging in another appraisal would only extend the process unnecessarily. “On the town’s nickel, you can do whatever you want to do,” Schaufeld said. “But I would view that as absurd, because you already have something that’s less than a year old. I think it’s a delay tactic — especially when we already paid for an appraisal of the appraisal.” Councilmembers Christian Pechuekonis and Jay Premack echoed Schaufeld’s opposition toward completing another appraisal of the town’s roads. Pechuekonis, for his part, stressed how important he feels it is to keep an eye on the bigger picture and all the benefits the project would ultimately bring to Harpers Ferry. Premack, meanwhile, explained how imperative he feels it is to keep the momentum of the project moving in a forward direction. “We have infrastructure that’s falling apart,” Premack said. “We’ve got a whole mess, and our current budget will not allow us to afford this stuff. That’s not the future of Harpers Ferry that I want to live in. ... I don’t want us to slow down the process over these sidebar issues and have them become distractions. We should keep our eye on the larger picture. “It’s been mentioned before,” he continued, “but who in their right minds would want to come and do a project in this town if this falls apart? I don’t want to sit with a wasteland up there. This is a fantastic opportunity. I respectfully disagree that a property appraisal would be prudent.” Also at Wednesday’s meeting, the council voted unanimously to make public a previously confidential August 2019 letter written from the corporation of Harpers Ferry to SWaN investors about streets and right-of-ways agreements. The vote came after some dispute regarding its current relevance, considering how both sides are working under a new deal. Because of as much, Hill Top House Hotel project manager Laurel Ziemianski, of SWaN, argued for a provision stating that the letter should be viewed as a historical document and nothing more. In the spirit of transparency, however, the council voted 7-0 to make the document public on the town’s website. As for what’s next, the SWaN representatives stressed their desire to receive an official counteroffer from the council, in order to give both parties a proper starting point in negotiations. To accommodate that request, the council will have a special meeting at 5 p.m. Monday before returning to the table with SWaN representatives at another 6 p.m. public meeting on Thursday. “Our short-term goal is to get the street-use negotiation where SWaN is the owner of the streets within and bordering the Hill Top property,” Ziemianski explained. “The goal we have in mind is to let the town council have their input with easements as to how they would like those streets to be used.” She also noted how much financial gain the town is estimated to take on, should the project, which Schaufeld said is now on pace to open in 2024, eventually be completed. “What we based the study on in 2019 shows a combined total of revenue in the Harpers Ferry budget as $800,000 a year,” Ziemianski said. “For this project, the construction years, which we anticipate would be two years, would add $900,000 each year to your budget. The hotel operations would add a million dollars to your existing budget. In operations, the town will have $1.8 million a year to put back into infrastructure. Plus, we will be providing 250 jobs per year for construction and 130 for ongoing operations. “We’ve told you we need to own the streets for financing,” she added. “We’re here trying to talk to you to find a middle ground to give you the option to say how we can get to what we need and give you the easements that you say the public needs.” See the winners and ALL the wonderful drawings of Mom submitted in the 2024 Draw Your Mom contest!
