If the trend continues, it’s possible the city could start the new year with lower than average infection rates. According to the Sentinel Wastewater Epidemiology Evaluation Project, commonly known a “SWEEP,” the city’s most-recent wastewater sample, recorded Dec. 13, had more viral DNA than 50% of samples submitted to the program since Escanaba began tracking viral load through the project in late August of 2021. While there is no real way to translate the amount of viral DNA found in the city’s sewer water to the number of active infections, the amount of viral load in wastewater reaching the 50% percentile suggests the rate of infections has normalized. The 15-day trend suggests the viral load is continuing to decrease at a rate of between -100% and -999% — based on categorical ranges of exponential decay reported by SWEEP — as of Dec. 16. While the 15-day trends give a general picture of COVID-19 infections in Escanaba, there are delays in data reporting, and, by its nature, the system relies heavily on past data that may or may not be accurate. For example, the samples submitted Nov. 8 and Nov. 15 had more viral DNA than 94% and 97% of all Escanaba samples, respectively. The Nov. 21 sample, however, was only reported as having a viral load greater than 6% of samples, with the following sample from Nov. 29 jumping back up to the 61st percentile. While it is theoretically possible to have a 91% drop in viral load in a single week, it’s more likely there was an error in the data, which translated to a significant drop in the 15-day trend reported on Nov. 25 and then a rise in the trend reported for Dec. 2. Still, when the Nov. 21 sample is accounted for, the city appears to be following a similar pattern to what was seen following the city’s highest recored spike in viral load, which took place in January of 2022. At that time, just over 40 copies of the viral gene were detected per 100mL of wastewater for three samples — fractionally more than were detected in November of this year, during the second-highest spike on record. According to SWEEP, the 2022 spike in viral detection coincided with the highest number of cases reported for the city to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, with more than 350 cases per 100,000 people. Despite the nearly-identical viral load, only about 60 cases per 100,000 people were reported to MDHHS in November, which may be due to the shift to home testing. By May of 2022 the number of cases reported to MDHHS dropped to levels below SWEEP’s reporting threshold and viral gene copies in wastewater dropped to some of the city’s lowest levels. It is important to note that 2022’s spike ended just as people were beginning to enjoy warmer weather and spend more time outside — naturally social distancing. Any downward trend could be negated by colder temperatures and holiday festivities opening up opportunities for people to gather indoors and spread the virus. If the holidays and cold weather don’t derail the trend, it’s possible the city could see some of its lowest reported viral load in January and early February, coinciding with very low infection rates.

was taking its predictable and traditional approach to questions about crucial upcoming labor negotiations with the UAW. GM\'s executives and spokespeople had nothing to offer. No details. No hints at a strategy. It was GM\'s policy to not comment on contract negotiation topics outside of bargaining, they\'d say. Oh, how times have changed as the strike hits the three-week mark. The UAW, GM and the two other Detroit automakers have tossed aside decorum as quickly as they\'ve tossed their contract offers out on the public stage, with unprecedented, opinionated commentary to accompany them. ""As a society we don’t have the civility we had before and people don’t hesitate to use curse words on social media or in public. Everything seems to go,"" said Marick Masters, a labor expert and business professor at Wayne State University in Detroit who has been closely watching the UAW strike. ""You’ve got militancy in the union and personal attacks on the CEOs ... and all the negotiations taking place on a public forum. That’s a recipe for what we see today."" The public transparency during these negotiations is unprecedented. The union demands and the automakers\' preliminary offers are usually kept guarded behind closed doors. Now, UAW President Shawn Fain has put them all out to the public, talking freely during weekly Facebook Live events to tens of thousands of viewers about sticking points like wage increases and cost of living boosts, and the automakers have reacted in kind. GM now has the summary highlights from one of its six offers to the union posted publicly on its www.gmnegotiations2023.com. Then, further igniting UAW tempers, GM asked for salaried workers to cross the picket lines last month at its parts distribution centers to keep the facilities running while on strike, as first reported by the Free Press. Ford Motor Co. held a news conference on Sept. 29 with CEO Jim Farley outright blaming the UAW for holding a deal ""hostage"" over jobs at battery plants not yet built. Stellantis has released details of its latest offer to the media and put out harshly worded statements after various union actions. Then there is the unpredictability of it all with Fain targeting all the automakers with strike action instead of just one. Just when Ford gets a break from further strike action one week, for example, it is on the outs with the union the next week as a targeted rollout strike spreads across the country — a Ford factory included again. Parts suppliers sweat as layoffs mount and the cost to GM in lost new-car production rises. To further add to the oddity of all that has transpired is the fact it\'s the first time a U.S. president has walked the picket line in support of the UAW. President Joe Biden walked the strike picket line at GM\'s Willow Run parts center in Van Buren Township on Sept. 26. By doing so, it now means if there is a stall in the talks, Biden cannot be called in to mediate a resolution, so a deal must get done at the bargaining table, experts said. ""Fain does not want Biden to step in because if he does, the pressure will be overwhelming for Biden to support the companies,"" said Harley Shaiken, labor expert and professor emeritus at the University of California-Berkeley. “There would be ferocious pressures on the other side, not just the automakers, but the business community. The table works.” But what may be the coup de grace in this public theater of the bizarre is when the otherwise unflappable GM CEO Mary Barra put forth a statement on the evening of Sept. 29 chastising the union leadership for dawdling at the bargaining table with no serious intention to get a deal done, but rather to ""to drag their membership into a long, unnecessary strike to further their own personal and political agendas."" Labor experts say Farley and Barra should have stayed quiet. “I thought it was positively unnecessary and where does it take us? How does it advance where we are?"" Shaiken said. ""But because (Barra) didn’t like what (UAW President) Shawn Fain had to say or how he’s conducting business doesn’t mean she had to react in kind. So the automakers have entered uncharted territory. There’s no way this hastens a settlement."" Masters agreed, adding that Farley referring to the UAW as “holding the negotiations hostage"" was a poor choice of words. ""I don’t think I would have used those terms. I think everyone knew from day one the union wanted to bring those battery plants into negotiations,"" Masters said. ""I think they both either felt the need to say these things themselves or they were poorly advised. Not that the points they were making were inappropriate, but they could have done it in a more appropriate manner. I don’t know why you’d want to poke the bear anymore?"" Shaiken commends Stellantis, noting jokingly, “Stellantis is actually Norwegian for silence."" He said Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has been completely silent, almost absent from any public discourse about the talks. ""Stellantis seems to have learned that lesson that this isn’t a public relations battle,"" Shaiken said. ""What good does it do GM or Ford to have a bit more public support? Both Mary Barra and Jim Farley succumbed to temptation of \'We’re not going to take this.\' Their top aides are going to say, \'That’s a brilliant idea. It’ll come across as you’re tough.’ It’s not tough that we want. It’s excellent product and good worker relations. If the workforce feels they have gotten a good deal, they will demonstrate that every day on the shop floor.” Stellantis declined to comment for this article. When asked about GM\'s approach to talks and Barra\'s decision to lambaste the union on Sept. 29, GM spokesman Kevin Kelly sent the Detroit Free Press the following: ""From day one, our focus has been on bargaining in good faith with the UAW leadership to reach an agreement as quickly as possible that rewards our workforce and allows GM to succeed and thrive into the future. We have said repeatedly the effects of a strike go well beyond our employees on the plant floor and negatively impact our customers, suppliers and the communities where we do business."" Ford spokesman Dan Barbossa responded to similar questions from the Detroit Free Press by sending this statement: ""Our approach from Day 1 of these negotiations has been to work diligently with the UAW to reach an agreement that reflects the hard work and value our U.S. hourly employees deliver every day and build a strong future for everyone with a stake in Ford. The record offer we have made to our UAW-represented employees reflects this approach."" On Friday, the eccentricity of the negotiations were on full display when Fain appeared on Facebook Live in front of some 52,000 viewers wearing an ""EAT THE RICH"" T-shirt. He then declared a ""transformative win,"" saying GM agreed minutes before the broadcast to include its battery plant workers in the union\'s national labor agreement. ""Moments before this broadcast, we have had a major breakthrough that has not only dramatically changed negotiations, but is going to change the future of our union and the future of our industry,"" Fain said. GM\'s move saved it from the union striking GM\'s Arlington Assembly plant in Texas where GM makes its full-size SUVs. Those are some of GM\'s most-profitable vehicles and to lose that production would have been costly. Fain also held off on further strikes at Ford and Stellantis, noting progress had been made with each on core issues. But he emphasized that the Stand Up Strike strategy was working and even took aim at Barra\'s comments a week earlier when she accused the union of theatrics. ""The CEOs are trying to trivialize our strike and they\'re saying it\'s just theatrics,"" Fain said. ""We\'re loud and we\'re proud about our fight. We want the public to understand our fight and side with us and poll after poll shows they do. But it\'s not about theatrics. It\'s about power, the power we have as working-class people."" Those comments add to the ""tit for tat"" vitriol that serves to feed the ""bizarre dimensions"" the talks have taken on, Shaiken said. Despite the rhetoric and the antics, the issues are crucial to many, he said. ""They concern families and a living wage,"" Shaiken said. ""We are seeing new language, new ways of going about things. Collective bargaining was something that always occurred in a closed room around a table. Now, it’s occurring in video and in real time."" And in some ways, the new out-in-open format of negotiating may not best serve anyone, he said. ""You don’t want to see how sausage is made, you just want to eat it,"" Shaiken said.

The Hoffmann Family of Companies (HF Companies) through its Media Division, Hoffmann Media Group acquired Maurer Publishing, LLC, on March 31st, 2023, the publisher of two newspapers and a printing shop in Northern Michigan. The Mackinac Island Town Crier is a weekly, seasonal newspaper that covers events on and around Mackinac Island. The Town Crier has been owned by the family of Wesley H. Maurer Sr. since 1959, making it one of Michigan’s oldest family-owned and operated newspapers. As of 2019, the Town Crier was published 22 times a year, with weekly issues in the summer and periodic issues in the late fall, winter, and early spring. The St. Ignace News is a weekly newspaper that covers events in and around St. Ignace and Mackinac County in Michigan. The newspaper’s coverage area includes a substantial portion of the Straits of Mackinac region and the eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan, including the Les Cheneaux Islands summer resort area northeast of St. Ignace. The St. Ignace News has been owned and operated by the Maurer family since 1975. “This will be an exciting transition for the newspapers, our staff, and the communities we serve and will ensure a local newspaper presence in this area for years to come,” said Wesley Maurer, Jr., the owner of Maurer Publishing. “I am especially happy to be able to stay on in a leadership and consulting relationship with Pason and Hoffmann Media Group and participate in our growth and service.” The acquisition of Maurer Publishing, LLC expands Hoffmann Media Group to 13 publications, with 11 in the state of Florida. “We are thrilled to continue to invest in the Mackinac Island Community and to bring the Town Crier and St. Ignace News into the Hoffmann Family of Companies.” Shared HF Companies Co-CEO Geoff Hoffmann “Local media plays an important role in the community, and we are excited to build off the great traditions of these publications.” The existing Maurer Publishing, LLC staff of more than 15 editors, writers and employees will all remain under the new company along with Mr. Maurer for a transition period as Publisher Emeritus. In addition to print and news, Hoffmann Media Group also offers digital services such as targeted online advertising, search engine optimization, website design and other services that may be beyond reach for small businesses, an added benefit and offering to smaller communities without access to as many business-to-business services. “I’m looking forward to continuing quality journalism with these newspapers. We plan to invest heavily in the operations to preserve the legacy of the Maurer family.” J. Pason Gaddis, CEO Hoffmann Media Group. As a loyal subscriber for over 50 years of the St. Ignace News, I am saddened to hear of the sale of the newspaper to the Hoffmann Family of Companies. I have had the pleasure of knowing both Wes Maurer, senior and Wes Mauer, Jr and they both and their employees have always had the best in mind and in print for St. Ignace. I sincerely hope that the new owners can continue to provide timely up to date local news upon which local and summer residents have relied upon for so many years. Edwin M.

Before, Democrats would bristle at any potential discussion over the border, particularly following Trump. But Chishti added: “That’s no longer true. Their backs don’t go up when they see someone saying we want to make some changes in the policies at the border.” Aides and allies to Biden have said the president is willing to accept new restrictions on asylum and potentially other Republican-led immigration policy changes, particularly as the numbers at the border continue to rise. His supplemental funding request, which seeks $14 billion for the border, would hire more asylum officers, increase detention capacity for migrant families and hire more immigration court judges. There’s now a backlog of more than 1 million cases, and it’s only increasing. Some migrants are released into the U.S. and wait for years before they are told whether they qualify for asylum. Arrests at the U.S.-Mexico border in August through October more than doubled over the previous three months as migrants and smugglers adjusted to new asylum regulations following the end of Title 42. Illegal border crossings were at 188,778 in October, down from 218,763 in September, which was the second-highest month on record. The White House decision to lump additional funding for the border in with Ukraine assistance has given lawmakers, Republicans say, an implicit nod to negotiate policy changes that would otherwise make Democrats feel uncomfortable. “The fact that they are trying to actually work and figure out what we can do to come up with border security tells me he understands the American people are getting fed up with their current posture,” Tillis said of Biden and the White House. Bolstering the GOP posture even further is a new House Republican majority that is largely resistant to continued Ukraine assistance, making the price of additional aid for the White House that much higher. And unlike the successful gun talks last year — when Democrats wielded political advantage after mass shootings galvanized public calls for increased restrictions — immigration is largely seen as an issue that is being fought on Republicans’ turf. But in the Democrats’ view, Trump and his hard-line immigration policies, coupled with antipathy toward Ukraine aid, continue to loom large, rendering Republicans unable to close any deal that would involve irking portion of their base that remain staunchly opposed to Ukraine aid and anything less than the hard-line policies they’ve already laid out. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., one of the chief authors of the 2013 immigration bill that never became law, said the U.S. immigration system, writ large, still needs an overhaul. But “we can’t do that right now in the context of this Ukraine bill,” he said. “It’s too complicated. It’s too far reaching. And frankly, there’s no reason to be attaching the border to Ukraine funding.” Today's breaking news and more in your inbox NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump sought to move past his historic criminal conviction on Friday and build momentum ...

Lowman will stay on through Sunday, Jan. 28, 2024 to assist in the transition and the Shacks will take over full time on Monday, Jan. 29, 2024. The new owners inherit a finely-tuned, thriving business, so Autumn and Adam do not plan to make any drastic changes. They may incorporate a few new menu items, but the entire staff will be retained. The out-going owner expressed his appreciation for the WIG’s customers and staff in a recent social media post. “The WIG was built on relationships; it grew and continues to succeed because of those relationships,” explained Mr. Lowman. “People who we didn’t know are now dear friends that are more like family. It has been a privilege to serve you, along with your friends and families, at weddings, retirements, funerals, birthdays and many other milestone occasions. We hope that we have enhanced this community and your lives as much as it has enhanced ours. We never imagined that we would become a destination restaurant as much as we have. We have always appreciated the time and distance that many of our guests have traveled to get to us. “I have been very fortunate to work with an amazing team currently and over the years,” continued Lowman. “They have always been like family to me and it has been a joy of my life to work with each and every one of them. I’ve always been so proud of this team and they are the reason that we have made it to 15-plus years here in Owosso” Mr. Lowman also used the post to give the incoming owners his endorsement. “I have given the WIG everything that I have and I would not change a single minute of it,” shared Lowman. “My dream come true was indeed everything that I hoped it would be. My heart is full. It’s been amazing, but it’s time for me to go. It is with immense pride that in January, the new owners of the WIG will be Autumn and Adam Shack. Autumn has been at the WIG from day one and has the passion and energy to lead the WIG into the future. My dream come true is now somebody else’s and I hope that it’s as magical for Autumn and Adam as it has been for Linda and myself. I couldn’t think of a better scenario than this one. It really is perfect. The same people who make your experience wonderful now when you visit will still be there to take care of you. I will remain on for a time in an advisory role to help Autumn and Adam transition smoothly into their new role as owners. I look forward to watching the WIG continue to grow and thrive. All the pieces are in place for that to happen.” The Wrought Iron Grill is located at the intersection of M-52 and Elm Streets in Owosso, on the first level of Woodard Station. The fine dining establishment features a large dining area, a full bar and a banquet room for parties. Catering is also available. Both Autumn and Adam are lifelong Shiawassee County residents and they look forward to continuing to raise their family in the community where they grew up. Adam thanked the current owners, the community and the staff when announcing this life-changing move on social media. “It is truly a blessing and honor to carry on the vision and legacy that John Lowman and Linda Lou Robertson started over 15 years ago,” shared Adam Shack. “I’m extremely proud of my wife, Autumn Shack, for her dedication and hard work getting to where she is today, and being part of the growth of the WIG. The relationships Autumn has developed with all of you mean the world to us. It’s truly an honor to be a part of this family. Your continuous support is absolutely incredible and we appreciate all of you. We also want to thank all of the staff at the Wrought Iron Grill for being such an important part of shaping the WIG into what it is today and welcoming us into this new chapter. We couldn’t do this without all of you. We certainly intend on making this a seamless transition and look forward to the next 15-plus years of serving this community.” To view the Wrought Iron Grill menu or to order online, visit www.wroughtirongrill.com. The restaurant is open from 11 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday and from noon to 7 p.m. on Sundays.'}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 10:51 pm Signs brought to a women's march at Bronson Park. The 2023 Kalamazoo Women’s March was held Oct. 15 in Bronson Park in downtown Kalamazoo to advocate for women’s rights. Subjects included abortion rights, LGBT+ issues, violence, disability issues, immigration issues and more. The theme of the march was “Stand Up and Stand By. We are not done!” Though attendance was lower than previous years, with 55 attendees listed on the group’s Facebook page, the march continued for women’s rights. The purpose of the march was not only to provide attention for a multitude of issues, but also to celebrate the accomplishments of Michigan, according to organizer Michelle Serlin. “Today, we are celebrating,” Serlin said. “Look at the achievements of Michigan.” The event began with a series of speakers and musical performances, followed by the march, and ended with more speakers and musical performances. Keynote speakers were CEO of the Ohio Unity Coalition Petee Talley and President and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Michigan Paula Thornton-Greear. Talley’s speech focused on abortion rights in Ohio. “I came here today because human rights can only be achieved when all women and girls have the complete economic, social and political power and resources to make healthy decisions about our bodies,” Talley said. “We're not done.” Thornton-Greear spoke on the current state of abortion rights in Michigan, and where legislation can go from here by advocating for the Reproductive Health Act. “We've come together today to remind ourselves and each other that despite the ongoing attacks at the national level, we can and we will make ways in Michigan to protect our citizens,” Thornton-Greear said. “But I'm also here to issue the next call to action.

Pastor Julie Kline spoke on the Christian perspective of abortion rights, and Julia Serlin spoke on date rape. Additional speakers were teen advocates T'Asia Brown, Davien Brown and Malia Morrow, discussing youth violence. Jade Thake, the march’s graphic designer, spoke on youth issues, and Attorney Emily Smith spoke on disability issues. “What we need is for doctors to do their jobs and listen to us,” Smith said. “Most chronic illness patients have done ample research on our conditions, symptoms and treatment. They have taken time to document our symptoms in detail and know how we feel.

Bolden, the first Black woman to sit on the Michigan Supreme Court, spoke at James Madison College’s second annual Black History Month Symposium on Wednesday, Feb 7th. Students United for Palestinian Rights, or SUPR, Arab Cultural Society, or ACS, and Planned Parenthood Generation Action, or PPGA, have partnered to hold a Menstrual Product Drive for Gaza until Feb. 6 in room 206 at the Michigan State University International Center. The drive is available from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. On Michigan State University\'s campus, the effects of this boycott remain to be seen. Starbucks supervisor and environmental biology and microbiology sophomore Morgan Bresson said there has been little change in business at the 1855 Place location on campus. Students supporting Palestinians said they plan to continue fighting, protesting and calling state representatives and urging them to a ceasefire. Walking along the outskirts of the Michigan Capitol building, hundreds of anti-abortion supporters and activists joined together in a “March for Life"" rally, hosted and organized by Michigan Right to Life, at noon today. The rally was arranged to be held a year after the 2022 Ballot Proposal 3, or the Right to Reproductive Freedom Initiative, which placed the right to abortion care into Michigan constitutional law, was passed. Earlier Wednesday morning, Right to Life filed a lawsuit against Proposal 3, arguing that the abortion access violates federal constitutional rights. Let’s take a deeper look at the history of hip-hop and how N.W.A., Tupac and Lamar were able to bring light many of the problems the Black community face. What social justice issues did these artists rap about in their songs? Did they influence each other in any way? In coordination with Students United for Palestine, or SUPR, at Michigan State University, Greater Lansing Islamic organized the “Justice for Palestine” protest to “stop the genocide” and to “tell Biden and all elected officials” to ceasefire. With hundreds of classes offered at Michigan State University, it can be hard to choose exactly which ones to take, especially regarding electives, throughout your time here. Below is a compilation of various classes that are not exactly titled “social justice,” but still cover social issues that are important for students to know about. If you have extra classes to take in your time remaining at MSU, keep reading to see which ones interest you. Organizations like PERIOD., Helping Women Period, Mission Menstruation X MSU and Pad the Mitten came together to host an event for the action day at the MSU Union on Oct. 14. On Thursday, Oct. 12 at 5 p.m., Students United for Palestinian Rights, or SUPR, organized a protest called “Hands Off Palestine” to garner support for those in Palestine and tell Michigan’s state government there should be no American support for Israeli war crimes. The protest, which amassed over one hundred people, included Michigan State University students, members of SUPR, people of Palestinian descent and other supporters. MSU Law Professor Justin Simard started the ""Citing Slavery Project"" in 2020 after researching sources for a project and stumbling upon citations of slave cases by modern judges. “The goal of the project is to document all cases involving enslaved people, either as litigants or as the property and dispute, and (we cite) all the cases... on our website,” Simard said. “It is essentially to get scholars and lawyers to recognize the important influence that slavery has played on the development of American law.” The Spartan Family Sensory Room was unveiled last Tuesday. The room is meant to be a safe space for individuals with autism and sensory needs. During her “What’s Next” address on Aug. 30, 2023, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer explained that a majority of Michiganders support paid family and medical leave so workers can spend time with their newborns, care for a sick parent or recover after a severe medical procedure. Whitmer plans to enact paid leave in a way that would ensure “people have breathing room” between the time of their leave and coming back to work. On Sept. 13 from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m., around 2,000 Michigan citizens surrounded the Michigan Capitol for the “Walk a Mile in My Shoes” rally to bring more attention to mental and public health and wellness.

The space agency\'s Artemis program, formed in 2017, represents NASA\'s interest in re-establishing crewed lunar missions for the first time in more than 50 years. While a four-member crew is slated to venture in a rocket around the moon next year, NASA had hoped to put astronauts back on its surface in 2025. But that ambitious Artemis III mission may not be able to reach that goal, a new report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office has found. In fact, it\'s ""unlikely"" the moon landing will be able to occur before 2027, according to the report, which was released Thursday. ""NASA and its contractors made progress since our last report on the Artemis missions, but they are still facing challenges,"" the agency said in a statement. Orbiting in tandem: Astronomers discover rare sight of 6 planets orbiting star in \'pristine configuration\' NASA had planned for 2025 to be the year that American astronauts set foot on the moon\'s surface for the first time since the last Apollo mission in 1972. The agency\'s Artemis program began last year when NASA performed a 26-day test flight of an uncrewed Orion spacecraft – the only spacecraft capable of returning crews to Earth – to test its heat shield under extreme reentry conditions. Next year, a different crew of three Americans and one Canadian are set to embark on Artemis II for a 10-day journey spanning 600,000 miles to the moon and back. Their main purpose is to test the capabilities of NASA\'s Space Launch System rocket and a crewed Orion spacecraft needed for deep space exploration. When the Artemis III crew launches, they are intended to land at the moon\'s south polar region, where they will stay for about one week. Ultimately, NASA hopes to establish a permanent human presence on and around the moon to serve as a base of operations for future missions to Mars. But NASA\'s timeline for the Artemis III mission might not be as feasible as the agency had hoped, the GAO report found. Delayed flight tests and challenges with the development of the human landing system and space suits have all hampered NASA\'s schedule for launch, according to the GAO. What\'s more, most NASA missions take more than seven years to develop, even when they don\'t involve human spaceflight. But the GAO said the space agency aims to complete its development for Artemis III in an ambitious 6½ years. ""The complexity of human spaceflight suggests that it is unrealistic to expect the program to complete development more than a year faster than the average for NASA major projects,"" the GAO said, adding that a 2027 target window is much more feasible. .@NASA is planning to send astronauts back to the moon with its #Artemis missions. We found the lunar landing mission is unlikely to occur as planned in 2025 due to challenges such as developing the lunar lander & space suits.Learn more in our new report: https://t.co/1vY0bKCTTX pic.twitter.com/vIPMfnHZrB The Artemis III already saw a setback in April when Elon Musk\'s SpaceX Starship rocket exploded about four minutes after launch, breaking apart in a fiery explosion over the Gulf of Mexico. NASA had awarded SpaceX a $2.9 billion contract in 2021 to develop the first commercial human lander that will ferry the two American astronauts from orbit to the lunar surface. While Musk still considered the mission a success since the main goal was for the rocket\'s engines to ignite and for the vehicle to clear the tower, the GAO said much work remains to be done. That includes developing the ability to store and transfer propellant while in orbit, according to the report. The GAO also found issues with the development of modernized space suits, work that NASA contracted to Houston-based Axiom Space. The company told the GAO that a redesign may be needed after NASA\'s original design did not provide the minimum required amount of emergency life support for the astronauts.

judges in a Macomb County slip-and-fall case last week traced their decision directly to a recent state Supreme Court ruling that has made it easier for plaintiffs to win premise-liability claims.The appeals court ruled Sept. 21 that Jeanne and Joseph Dziewit can continue to seek damages against Meijer Inc. due to her slip and fall in July 2021 at its store at Van Dyke Avenue and Metropolitan Parkway in Sterling Heights.Related Articles Michigan News | Man flees after alleged sexual assault in Detroit; caught in Melvindale Michigan News | Personalized signs honoring Woodhaven graduates

Michigan News | Alleged drunken driver plows through busy intersection, hits car, crashes The lawsuit had been thrown out by Macomb Circuit Judge Joseph Toia based on Lugo v. Ameritch that had been the standard for 22 years because the hazard was “open and obvious” to Dziewit, she knew or should have known of the hazard and avoided it.However, the Michigan Supreme Court in two cases last July 28 vacated that standard and ruled “property owners are responsible for anticipating the potential harm invitees could face due to an openly apparent dangerous condition they have allowed to persist on their property,” even if the hazard is open and obvious, according to Goodman Aker law firm, which has offices in Sterling Heights and Dearborn.“The formula has changed significantly,” said the Dziewits’ attorney, Philip Matthews, who practices out of Dearborn. “I’m very happy for the change in the landscape.”Under the old standard, “hundreds or thousands of cases have been dismissed” based on the open-and-obvious doctrine, Matthews said.The new standard returns personal injury cases back to the law prior to 2001 to comparative negligence in which even if the plaintiff is partially at fault, he or she can gain an award as long as the fault does not reach 50%, and the defendant breached their duty to maintain a safe environment.“We hold that the open and obvious nature of a condition is relevant to breach and the parties’ comparative fault,” the justices wrote two months ago. It places more responsibility on property owners to protect visitors from harm from hazardous conditions, attorneys said.The decision also places the decision more in the hands of juries instead of judges, attorneys said.The ruling is expected to spawn more such cases.Matthews said his client is also pleased with the ruling, and the case will return to Macomb County Circuit Court for further proceedings, though Meijer could seek an appeal to the state’s top court.Matthews also called the decision “ironic” for him because he had decided this was the last slip-and-fall case he would handle.

Low near 55F. Winds light and variable.. Cloudy. Low near 55F. Winds light and variable. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 10:37 pm NEW BUFFALO — An Amtrak train struck two vehicles at the Lakeside Road crossing in New Buffalo township on Thursday evening, Nov. 16. According to a Nov. 17 press release from Berrien County Undersheriff Chuck Heit, a vehicle was stuck on the railroad tracks and was in the process of being removed by a tow truck at the Lakeside Road crossing when a westbound Amtrak train was unable to stop and collided with the vehicle and tow truck on the tracks. “The train derailed but stayed upright on the tracks. The engineer and approximately 10 passengers received non-life threatening injuries and were treated by local ambulance services. There were approximately 200 passengers on the train that were evacuated safely. A temporary shelter was established at New Buffalo High School and school buses were used to transport passengers to the shelter.” The report continues to say many passengers were picked up by family members and friends at the school, adding that Amtrak provided buses to transport the remaining passengers to the Amtrak train station in Chicago at approximately 12:40 a.m. Friday. Amtrak officials said the train was traveling from Pontiac to Chicago. On Monday, Nov. 20, the Berrien County Public Safety Communication Center/911 Dispatch provided the following update on the Nov. 16 derailment: While the incident remains under investigation, it appears a technology failure and misidentification of a crossing contributed to the accident that led to the derailment of a westbound Amtrak train at approximately 10 p.m. Of the approximate 200 passengers on the train, six individuals were transported to the hospital for non-life threatening injuries by ambulance services who responded to the incident. The technology issue has been resolved, and Berrien County is reviewing its 911 emergency dispatch protocols to mitigate any future occurrence. Our preliminary review of this incident shows we were experiencing technical issues with our computer aided dispatch system on the evening of Nov. 16 that left us unable to enter intersection cross streets, which are critical to our ability to pinpoint locations. At approximately 9:21 p.m., we received two 911 calls alerting us to a stranded vehicle on train tracks in New Buffalo Township. We identified the location using a nearby business, as we were unable to enter an intersection using cross streets because of the software issue. We cross-referenced that location with our list of railroad crossings, which resulted in the identification of an incorrect train crossing. We then immediately notified CSX, the primary operating railroad of the tracks at that crossing location. “We appreciate the swift response from 20 agencies and organizations to Thursday’s derailment,” said Caitlin Sampsell, Berrien County 911 director. “We remain incredibly grateful for the support of all those who helped ensure the safe evacuation of the passengers onboard and their reunification with loved ones.” The initial steps taken to modify dispatch protocols include changes to: Protocols related to computer and software updates; Communication protocols with railroads; The railroad crossing resource guide, ensuring it is in a more user-friendly format for dispatchers. The incident remains under investigation and no further information is available at this time. ‘Everyone was confused’ Rebekah Gross, a senior at the University of Michigan, was taking the Amtrak home Thursday night to Chicago for Thanksgiving. Gross had taken the four-hour ride to Illinois from Ann Arbor nearly a dozen times before. She said Thursday’s trip was like most until the train began to shake. “There was a lot of rumbling and everyone could tell it was going off the tracks,” she said Friday. “Once it stopped, it started to smell like smoke. I was in one of the last cars, but I spoke with some of the people up front and they said they saw a fireball.” Gross said her part of the train still felt the initial hit and it took about 30 seconds to come to a halt. The Illinois native said she wasn’t injured when the train derailed, but had to jump out and was instructed by personnel to stand in a field near the highway. “(Before the crash) I was just watching Harry Potter on my phone,” she said. “When we got out, I had no idea where we were. Everyone was confused and nervous.” As firefighters and other emergency responders began to arrive, Gross said she stood with other passengers and called her mother. After an hour and a half of waiting in the field, Gross said she and others were moved to New Buffalo High School. About another hour later, she said buses arrived to bring them the rest of the way to Chicago. Not needing any medical attention, Gross made it to her final destination at about 2 a.m. CST. Despite the derailment, Gross said she plans to take the Amtrak back to Ann Arbor next week. Detours and cleanup The train derailment occurred almost directly behind Exit 4 Storage, a self-storage facility along U.S. 12 in New Buffalo. “I was here doing some work and the whole building shook,” Exit 4 Storage employee Tabitha Downs said. “I only came out to open up our gate for the firefighters. Other than that, I tried to stay out of the way.” She said the tow truck had caught fire, prompting emergency responders to cut holes in the fence behind the storage facility to fit their hoses through. Mike Deeds lives about a half mile away from the scene of the crash. He said he’s lived in his house for 41 years and has never seen an incident at the railroad crossing before. “All I know is I was in bed and it woke me up around 9:30 (p.m.),” Deeds said Friday. “I got up and looked out the window and I could see all the police and fire departments there.” Police said the incident remains under investigation. Following the derailment, the portion of Lakeside Road that stretches from New Buffalo Township to Three Oaks was closed to traffic between U.S. 12 and Kruger Roadfor an extended period. The Berrien County Road Department announced on Dec. 5 that Lakeside Road had reopened to through traffic. “However, we do anticipate a closure to resume based on Amtrak and their contractor schedule. We do not have the date or duration of that closure. We are advising the public to not drive around road closure signage when in place. But at this time the signage has been moved off the road, and road is currently open to traffic.” For updates, check at https://www.berriencounty.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=2131 — Robert Novak contributed to this story.

Beyond the war, Michigan was shaken by a showdown between the autoworkers’ union and the Detroit Three automakers. Former President Donald Trump visited the state during the strike and Biden, who has longtime ties to unions, became the first sitting president to join a picket line.Now that the strike is resolved, the war may have a more lasting political impact for the president. In 2020, Muslim voters nationally supported Biden over Trump 64% to 35%, according to AP VoteCast.Aiyash, the Democratic floor leader in the state House, said Arab American leaders who have spoken to the White House “are worried” about the implications for 2024 and have relayed those concerns to Biden. Other prominent Michigan Democrats have shared similar concerns. “Certainly none of us want to see part two of a Trump disaster presidency. But we also are not going to just passively give Joe Biden a second term if our concerns are not even dignified through a response,” Aiyash said.Michigan holds the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the nation and over 310,000 residents are of Middle Eastern or North African ancestry.

Trump won Michigan by just over 10,000 votes in 2016, and tens of thousands of Michigan voters opted to not vote in the presidential race that year.Anger over Democrats’ response to the war was on full display this past weekend in Wayne County, home to the largest bloc of Democratic votes in the state and the source of much of the pushback.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': ""This story was updated with additional information. Charlie LeDuff, the polarizing Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who has increasingly peddled right-wing outrage on his podcast, was fired from the Detroit News after using a vulgar, coded phrase aimed at Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel. LeDuff came under fire over the weekend for telling Nessel in a social media post, “See you next Tuesday,” a backronym for the word “cunt.” It’s often written, “C U Next Tuesday.”” In an email to reporters on Saturday, Detroit News editor and publisher Gary Miles said LeDuff had been fired. “While we stand by the journalism that we have published under his byline, I could not envision moving forward with his weekly column in light of recent events,” Miles wrote. Miles tells Metro Times that he and Charlie mutually agreed to terminate the weekly column. In an interview with Metro Times on Monday morning, LeDuff was defiant and said he thought the insult was “clever” because his weekly column was published on Tuesdays. “I’m not apologizing. I have nothing to apologize for. … I stand by it,” LeDuff says. “I said something clever on my own space because I am fucking pissed.” LeDuff alleged in a Detroit News column last week that Nessel “subtly pressured her staff to close” an investigation into a friend, Traci Kornack, a personal injury lawyer and treasurer of the Michigan Democratic Party. Kornack was accused of bilking an insurance company out of nearly $50,000 by using the account of an elderly, brain-damaged client. In a news release a day after the column was published, Nessel denied wrongdoing, and her acting chief legal counsel, Linus Banghart-Linn, accused LeDuff of sloppy, sensational journalism in a letter to the Detroit News. “The opinion piece published yesterday not only fails to achieve any public good or ‘sunshine’ on the work of government, but irresponsibly twists half-understood and fully fabricated notions of the Department to the detriment of public trust in their State government,” Banghart-Linn’s letter read. LeDuff’s insult swiftly drew condemnation from journalists. “This is disgusting and reprehensible,” Detroit News politics editor Chad Livengood tweeted Saturday. “@charlieleduff should do us all a favor and resign.” Jon King, a local freelance reporter, said it was important for journalists to speak out because LeDuff’s insult tarnished the profession. “While I can’t speak for anyone but myself, my sense is that his openly hateful, misogynistic response only served to further blur the line between holding truth to power and partisan advocacy,” King tweeted. “It’s no coincidence that the initial reaction came from our female colleagues. They know all too well how their gender is weaponized against them. So when they see a male journalist indulge in that weaponization, I imagine it is not just infuriating, it is also deflating.” Alan Stamm, a former reporter at Deadline Detroit, where LeDuff was previously a columnist, suggested the Detroit News would be better off without LeDuff. “Charlie LeDuff is a loose cannon who backfires embarrassingly and will do so repeatedly if not tossed overboard,” Stamm tweeted. State lawmakers also spoke out and called for LeDuff's termination. Addressing several Detroit News reporters and editors, Sen. Dayna Polehanki, D-Livonia, tweeted, “you good with your boy calling Michigan’s Attorney General a c***? Do tell us more about your ‘editorial standards.’ Asking for an army of women who have endured lifetimes of misogyny. Fire @charlieleduff.” As expected, conservatives came to LeDuff’s defense, and some even repeated the phrase. “Ladies can’t have it both ways,” Meshawn Maddock, former Michigan Republican Party co-chair, tweeted Sunday. “Be all offended [by] the men who use bad words, but demand to be treated like men when it suits them.” LeDuff is no stranger to controversy. In 1995, he conceded that he plagiarized a story while working for The New York Times. He also has been accused of manufacturing quotes and featuring inaccurate descriptions. After 12 years at The New York Times, LeDuff took a reporting job at the Detroit News, where details in some of LeDuff’s stories were called into question. In one story that made national news, LeDuff accused Detroit police of failing to respond to his call about a dead body discovered lodged in ice in an abandoned warehouse. Metro Times and the Detroit Free Press both published stories contradicting LeDuff’s accounts of what happened. In October 2010 LeDeuff left the Detroit News to join Fox 2, where he was known for using bizarre antics to report on serious issues. In 2011, a Detroit police officer sued LeDuff over two of his Detroit News stories that claimed she moonlighted as a stripper and danced at the long-rumored, never-proven Kwame Kilpatrick party at the Manoogian Mansion. In the lawsuit, which was eventually dismissed, Officer Paytra Williams alleged LeDuff got facts wrong in the story and disputed that she moonlighted as a stripper. In 2013, LeDuff was accused of urinating in public, biting a security guard at a St. Patrick’s Day party, and calling three policewomen “whores.” He left Fox 2 in November 2016. LeDuff wrote two critically acclaimed books, Detroit: An American Autopsy (2008) and Shitshow!: The Country’s Collapsing and the Ratings Are Great (2018). In October 2018, LeDuff launched his ongoing podcast, The No BS News Hour, where he lurched to the right and built a conservative following by attacking Democrats and taking a hardline position against immigration. He frequently appears on Fox News and conservative podcasts. His co-host Karen Dumas couldn't be reached for comment. LeDuff insists he didn’t need the Detroit News job, which he says paid “peanuts,” because of the success of his podcast. If he has any regrets, he says, it’s the harm done to Detroit News editor Gary Miles and editorial page editor Nolan Finley. “I regret the stress and the decision they had to make,” LeDuff says. “I admire them. I think of them as mentors and colleagues. I regret any ignominy or shade or stress on them. That’s who I apologize to and nobody else.” Nessel’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment.

environmental status and cleanup of DuPont’s 1,300-acre chemical manufacturing plant that operated west of Montague from 1955 to 1996, and White Lake area residents are invited to the Jan. 25, 2024, presentation, according to a press release from the Chemours Environmental Impact Committee (CEIC). The public session, featuring a presentation by the Hazardous Waste Section of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE), will be held at the White River Township Hall, 7386 Post Road, from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. The CEIC is a group of area residents that formed in 2018 to promote and advance the cleanup of the acreage, has been requesting the public update for several years. Also scheduled to attend is a representative of Chemours, the DuPont spinoff enterprise that since 2015 has overseen the property, which touches both White Lake and Lake Michigan, according to the release. In preparation for the Jan. 25 meeting, CEIC members will hold a Jan. 11 informational meeting at 7 p.m., also at the township hall, to provide residents with a history of the property’s contamination, CEIC’s goals for the cleanup, restoration, and conservation of the site, and — after 62 years of study and negotiations — why all of this is still on the table and not resolved. For those who are interested in the land’s cleanup and future, but can’t attend the Jan. 11 meeting in person, a Zoom link will be available by emailing makeitrightchemours@gmail.com or visiting Make It Right Chemours on Facebook. Because community acceptance is one of the determining factors for reaching decisions about the Dupont site, which produced acetylene, neoprene, other polymers, and Freon during its 41 years of operations, CEIC seeks a strong turnout at the township hall for the Jan. 25 meeting. According to local accounts and CEIC research, by 1961 taste/odor problems had impacted a nearby private well and studies confirmed groundwater contamination — originating from unlined landfills, sludge pits and spills in the manufacturing area — reaching White Lake. Two miles to the west, spillage caused by a 1965 break in another sludge-pit wall poured down a hill toward Pierson Creek. Two years later, a diverted wastewater flow into the creek resulted in a huge fish kill in Sadony Bayou whose waters meander about a mile into White Lake. CEIC’s efforts have recently resulted in a $36,700 state grant to evaluate the bayou as an initial step for its restoration, the release stated. Over the past six decades since groundwater contamination was discovered at the DuPont site, the names of state agencies have changed. Property ownership has changed from DuPont to Chemours. State laws that govern hazardous waste have changed. What hasn’t changed is the situation at the DuPont/Chemours site, according to the release from CEIC. In addition to annual sampling reports, major DuPont/Chemours investigation reports and work plans to inform decisions on interim measures and final cleanup plans have been submitted to state agencies for review in 1991, 2006, 2007, 2014, 2018 and 2021, the release stated. Some initiatives have been in place, including pumping and treating a large portion of the contaminated groundwater to remove chemicals, the release stated. Meanwhile, unlined landfills with contaminants have remained in place, and in some locations groundwater contamination still exists without treatment – while we await more testing, more reports, and more negotiations. While groundwater contamination might not be visible to the naked eye, what is in plain sight are the hills of lime just south of the former plant. A byproduct of one of the chemical processes at the site, the piles of lime have been stockpiled to such an extent that from the air they look like the lunar landscape, the release stated. The accumulation has impacted and invaded what has been known as Mirror Lake. The most recent round of negotiations between Chemours and the state has been ongoing since 2015. The Jan. 25 meeting will be the latest update for the public. CEIC’s goals for the acreage include: • Removal of landfills and all sources of contamination. • Testing of sediments in Pierson Creek and Sadony Bayou beyond the Chemours property boundaries. • Cleanup and restoration of Mirror Lake. • Removal of the massive lime pile and restoration of the ravine underneath. • Testing of soil beneath the former manufacturing plant and settling ponds. • Ensuring that there are no leaks in the pipeline to Lake Michigan. If there were leaks, testing the soil underneath. • Cleanup of the property with no deed restrictions. • Permanent conservation of portions of the property, including the White Lake shoreline parcel.

John-Williams’ employment was terminated in Oct. 2022 when former CEO Rose Coleman was then in charge of the Pavilions. Coleman left the Pavilions in Sept. 2023 and was replaced by interim CEO Dave Hautamaki. A new permanent CEO, Gerard Botolski, will take the reins in January. The lawsuit filed in 13th Circuit Court names defendants Coleman; Cecil McNally, chairman of the county Department of Health and Human Services board, which oversees the Pavilions; the DHHS board itself; and the county-owned Pavilions are named in the lawsuit. After months of legal maneuvers, discovery and hearings, the dispute entered voluntary (nonbinding) mediation on Dec. 22 and continued this week. While no resolution outside a trial is guaranteed, both sides indicated that a settlement could be reached soon. Another major issue came up during a Dec. 19 hearing with Circuit Court Judge Charles Hamlyn: Did Coleman and the DHHS board have a right to go into closed session in 2022 to discuss the possible termination of Johns-Williams – or was that a violation of the Michigan Open Meetings Act? First passed in 1976, the OMA requires most government and public entities to conduct nearly all business at meetings that are open to the public. The purpose of the law is to “strengthen the right of all Michigan residents to know what goes on in government by shedding light on the official acts of public bodies and enhancing responsible decision making; thus, promoting governmental accountability,” according to the Michigan Attorney General’s Office. While the OMA does include some exceptions that allow for non-public “closed sessions,” those exceptions are limited and subject to challenge. Ringsmuth, the attorney for Johns-Williams, argued during the hearing that Coleman and the board did not have the right to go into closed session in 2022 while discussing her possible termination. He asked the court to find that closed session “invalid” so that he could depose Coleman about what was said during that non-public session. A deposition is an interview with a witness who is asked to give testimony under oath outside the courtroom. It is used to gather information as part of the legal discovery process. In limited circumstances, that testimony may be used at trial. Hamlyn ruled at the Dec. 19 hearing that the closed session was invalid, giving Ringsmuth legal authority to depose Coleman, overriding defendant attorney Steven Wolock’s objections. However, if the lawsuit is settled outside court through the mediation process, Ringsmuth said he would not seek to depose Coleman or further pursue the OMA issue. So far, no charges have been filed, and no legal action has so far been taken, against Coleman or the DHHS board regarding the OMA violation. This is partly because DHHS board member Cecil McNally openly discussed the contents of that closed session after it took place, shedding light on what was discussed. Both parties expressed hope that an out-of-court settlement could be reached within days. Sign up now to get our FREE breaking news coverage delivered right to your inbox.

The intensity of feelings about COVID, I don’t think that’s going to go away,” Schafer said. “And any time something new comes along, it breathes new life into these grievances and frustrations, real or imagined.”Chinese government officials have in the past used their social media accounts to amplify anti-U.S. conspiracy theories, including some that suggested the U.S. created the COVID-19 virus and framed its release on China.So far, they’ve taken a quieter approach to the Energy Department report. In their official response, China’s government dismissed the agency’s assessment as an effort to politicize the pandemic. Online, Beijing’s sprawling propaganda and disinformation network was largely silent, with just a few posts criticizing or mocking the report.“BREAKING,” a pro-China YouTuber wrote on Twitter. “I can now announce, with ‘low confidence,’ that the COVID pandemic began as a leak from Hunter Biden’s laptop.”___Follow the AP’s coverage of misinformation at https://apnews.com/hub/misinformation. WASHINGTON (AP) — COVID-19’s origins remain hazy. Three years after the start of the pandemic, it’s still unclear whether the coronavirus that causes the disease leaked from a lab or spread to humans from an animal. This much is known: When it comes to COVID-19 misinformation, any new report on the virus’ origin quickly triggers a relapse and a return of misleading claims about the virus, vaccines and masks that have reverberated since the pandemic began. It happened again this week after the Energy Department confirmed that a classified report determined, with low confidence, that the virus escaped from a lab. Within hours, online mentions of conspiracy theories involving COVID-19 began to rise, with many commenters saying the classified report was proof they were right all along. Far from definitive, the Energy Department’s report is the latest of many attempts by scientists and officials to identify the origin of the virus, which has now killed nearly 7 million people after being first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. The report has not been made public, and officials in Washington stressed that a variety of U.S. agencies are not in agreement on the origin. On Tuesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray told Fox News that the FBI “has for quite some time now” assessed that the pandemic’s origins are “most likely a potential lab incident in Wuhan.” But others in the U.S. intelligence community disagree, and there’s no consensus.

It is one of 26 colleges and universities affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Suomi College changed its named in 2000 to Finlandia University. In addition to its teaching, the university is also home to the cultural center of Finns in North America, the Finnish American Heritage Center. In addition, the university has unique curriculum focused on Nordic studies, several Finnish exchange students and interns each year and the Finnish American Reporter, a monthly newspaper celebrating Finnish American heritage. The school\'s administration is working to try to come up with options for current students, including finalizing teach-out agreements with Michigan Technological University, Bay College, Adrian College, and Wartburg College. A fifth agreement is in process with Northern Michigan University. These allow students to have their credits transfer smoothly. Several small private colleges across Michigan and the Midwest have struggled with finances. They are heavily dependent on enrollment, which brings in tuition dollars. However, demographers are finding smaller and smaller numbers of students graduating from Michigan high schools every year. That smaller pool of students means colleges are competing more directly for each and every student, especially the small private liberal arts colleges that dot the Midwest. There, the demographic decline of traditional age students is among the highest of any region in the nation. According to federal data, there were 420,043 undergraduate students on 45 four-year college campuses — public and private — in fall 2010. In fall 2020, that number had shrunk to 354,615. That\'s almost a 16% drop. Contact David Jesse: 313-222-8851 or djesse@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter: @reporterdavidj'}]"

In a release from 1st Lt. Brian McComb of the Michigan State Police Caro Post, the post recently learned of an uptick in reported cases of motorists running the stop sign/red lights of area school buses. One local school district – Unionville-Sebewaing Area – has reported multiple violations, according to the MSP. As a result, the MSP – along with the Huron and Tuscola County Sheriff’s Offices – will be teaming up to perform special school bus enforcement details for the foreseeable future. “They’re getting their share of complaints and noticing these driving habits deteriorate just the same,” said Huron County Sheriff Kelly J. Hanson. “We’ve all been conversing about it.” Added Hanson: “Ours has been primarily stop signs… But it’s not just the Huron County Sheriff’s Office noticing these bad driving habits, it’s other agencies.” The fine for running the stop sign/red lights of a school bus starts at $315 and includes three points accessed to a person’s driver’s license. “The real cost could be a child losing their life,” said McComb. “There will be zero tolerance for these violations.” The special enforcement effort is already underway, having started Nov. 2. McComb noted that violators should also be aware that buses are equipped with video and a law enforcement officer can issue a citation upon completing an investigation. Late last month, the Huron County Sheriff’s Office started its own campaign to crack down on poor driving habits. According to the office, dangerous driving behavior such as excessive speeding, improper passing, intentional headlight blinding, failing to yield the right of way, and stopping related violations, as well as illegally passing stopped school buses, are all on the rise in the county. “We’ve been doing extra patrols and we have been writing extra tickets,” Hanson said, since the effort started. Hanson said along with deputies and local law enforcement agencies taking enforcement actions against careless drivers, private citizens are getting in on the action. This has resulted in multiple tickets being issued by the sheriff’s office through a witness account and identification of illegal driving. Citizens witnessing illegal drivers are asked to call Huron Central Dispatch at 989-269-6421 if they can identify the driver and the vehicle. “We’re trying to get the word out – trying to get the mindset to change,” Hanson said.

of roughly $5,000 in funding for the Iron County Road Commission. Interim Superintendent Brad Toivonen updated the commission on the situation at its monthly meeting on Dec. 12. “We had to do some funding reorganization because of the shortage of drunk driving arrests that were made statewide,” he said. “I guess we didn’t make the federal quota, so we got docked 1% statewide. That figure is actually 2.5%, according to a spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Transportation, equating to $28.9 million in funds redirected from road and bridge programs into safety-related programs. The issue isn’t really a shortage of arrests, but the possibility of shorter sentences following a 2020 bill that updated how Michigan courts sentence second and third offenders for drunk driving violations. The bill provided courts more flexibility in determining the length of sentences, specifically the ability to reduce or waive sentences if a defendant agrees to and successfully completes a specialty court program. To secure full funding, the federal government requires all states to meet minimum sentencing requirements for individuals charged with operating while intoxicated, according to a memo sent by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Those minimum sentencing standards are no less than five days of imprisonment or 20 days of community service for second offenders, and no less than 10 days imprisonment or 60 days of community service for subsequent offenders. Michigan sentences for second offenders allow a court to decide between jail time (five days to one year) and community service (30–90 days), or a combination of the two. Subsequent offenders can face 1–5 years imprisonment or a combination of probation with imprisonment (30 days to one year) and community service (10–180 days). The NHTSA outlined its sticking point with Michigan’s new policy in its memo: “Regardless of the number of previous offenses, repeat offenders who are sentenced to some jail time may have their term of imprisonment suspended if ‘the defendant agrees to participate in a specialty court program and successfully completes the program.’” Data compiled by the State Court Administrative Office show that Michigan issued sentences to 2,391 second OWI offenders, 56% of which met the federal government’s minimum criteria. The average jail sentence issued was 90 days. The courts issued sentences for 1,745 subsequent offenders, 67% of which met the federal government’s minimum standards. The average jail sentence for subsequent offenders was 108 days. Toivonen said that Iron County’s shortfall was low compared to those for Gogebic and Ontonagon counties, which were over $30,000 each. Toivonen also addressed a backlog of permits related to laying cable for fiber optic internet. ""My plan is to get all the local projects scoped and bid documents sent out, have a February bid opening, so I can start reviewing the permits for the fiber optic and get those people ready to roll in the spring,” he said. Toivonen said the most significant issues with most of the permits are related to existing water and gas lines, and that pressing federal aid projects had of late taken precedence over the fiber optic permitting. Commissioner Ron Frailing suggested Toivunen’s work on the fiber optic permitting fell outside the duties of his role as superintendent. “The concern is just the time that you have to put into it,” Frailing said. “If you don’t have the time for it, then should we be reimbursed for that time – if you’re taking extra time to work on that project, should you be doing it or should we hire something like GEI?” GEI will be helping with third-party inspections and supervision as fiber is being laid. That cost will be covered by the engineering firm laying the lines, Atlantic Engineering Group. Internet service from the cables will be provided by Highline. “The [GEI] contract is just to be out there as the fiber optic is being laid and making sure that it’s done as the permit was signed and agreed upon,” Toivonen said. “I don’t really feel comfortable having them doing … road commission work, as far as knowing the road and what’s going on. I think I should be doing that.” Last June, Highline CEO Bruce Moore told the Reporter he intended to see cable start going into the ground in Iron County in August, and to connect 988 Iron County homes to its growing U.P. fiber network by the end of the year. Toivonen said he hoped to review all fiber optic-related permits in February of 2024. The Iron County Road Commission also addressed the following matters at its December meeting. • Toivunen expressed concern about the timeline and cost of repairs needed for two bridges on Forest Highway 16, at the north and south branches of the Paint River. Bridge load limits were reduced last spring and currently loaded logging trucks are not legal to cross, creating concern over the impact on timber sales. Bids for the rehabilitation work, which includes trying to preserve the bridges’ deteriorating H-piles, are due Jan. 31, 2024. • Delta County has approached the Road Commission about buying out the total of Iron County’s federal aid – $893,000 – for 2025 at $.80 per dollar. (The Michigan Department of Transportation will often buy back federal aid at $.90 per dollar but will not be doing so for 2025 or 2026 aid.) • Iron County was approved for roughly $1 million in funding from the Federal Highway Administration and MDOT to repair flood damage to main roads from earlier this year. The Road Commission will need to come up with $200,000 in matching funds. • Construction on County Road 424 to correct the slope of the curve between Blue Lake Hill and Blue Lake Pit is estimated to begin next summer, as are upgrades to Brule Mountain Road. • The preliminary estimate from U.P. Engineering for bridge repairs at Wild River came in at $1.6 million. Toivunen said he planned to set up a meeting with the firm to discuss ways to cut the cost. • The final load of salt needed to get Iron County through the winter was delivered to Oss Garage on Nov. 16, after delivery mix-ups involving supplier Cargill. • When considering upcoming requests for proposals for next year’s bridge inspections, Toivunen also said to expect additional mandated bridge inspections to assess ratings for oversized loads. The Iron County Road Commission meets the second Tuesday of each month at 8 a.m. More information is available at ironcountyroads.com. Wendy Graham contributed to the reporting of this article.

The resulting chocolates can then be stored and consumed as desired. Safe and Responsible Consumption While magic mushroom chocolates make psilocybin consumption more palatable and controlled, it’s essential to remember that they are still a potent psychedelic substance. As with any psychedelic, dosage, set, and setting are crucial elements for a safe and enjoyable experience. Users should start with a low dose, especially if they are new to psychedelics, and consume the chocolates in a safe, comfortable, and controlled environment.

If you haven’t heard about it, you’d think the whole thing is quite silly. Well, as far as I’m concerned, it is. Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who’s got to be the top commercial endorser today, was irate that the refs flagged one of his players for lining up in the neutral zone on what turned into a trick play that would’ve secured a touchdown in what became Buffalo’s victory. If it’s close on the call of offsides, I can see why he might be upset. It wasn’t, and besides, when it comes to the line of scrimmage, like the goal line, there’s a very clear line of demarcation there. You don’t give a guy a touchdown because he almost made it to the goal line. He’s either in or he’s out. If he would’ve argued that one of his receivers hadn’t been contacted more than five yards from the line of scrimmage, then sure, you could see that there might be an argument that you let it go if it was really 4 1/2 yards or 5 1/2 yards. Those are guesstimates on the fly. But the line of scrimmage is plain for everyone to see — including the guys lining up for the play. My other part of this argument against Mahomes’ complaint — which he backtracked on a day later saying it wasn’t a good look to be so upset — is that the penalty call has to come at the moment the ball is snapped, not five or 10 or 15 seconds later when the trick play develops into a highlight reel moment. Can you imagine if the refs on a snap-of-the-ball penalty waited till the play was over to even begin considering throwing the flag? What kind of calls of a rigged system would we be hearing then? Now let’s take a look at the upcoming slate of games after a week where the line of predicting correctly was quite fuzzy, especially after both the Dolphins and Packers were unexpectedly knocked off on Monday night: ——————— Today, 8:15 p.m. Los Angeles Chargers at Las Vegas — Every time I think I’ve got the Chargers figured out, along comes another really sucky team to test their ability to pull defeat from the jaws of victory. So who do you like less, a team that loses no matter what advantage they’re given — the Chargers — or the team that allowed three points last weekend — Las Vegas — and lost. With the Chargers without Justin Herbert, I’ve got to go with the Raiders, 10-6. ——————— Saturday, 1 p.m. Minnesota at Cincinnati — On the flip side, the Vikings posted a shutout of the Raiders and needed a field goal in the final two minutes, I believe it was, to rescue their win from those jaws of defeat. And Cincy has found a credible backup QB in Jake Browning, the closest last name I’ve seen in sports to my own, Brownlee, in a few years. Bengals, 23-16. ——————— Saturday, 4:30 p.m. Pittsburgh at Indianapolis — Speaking of credible backup QBs … wait, no, I thought Pittsburgh’s Mitch Trubisky was one, but hd didn’t show it vs. the Pats. Indy is competitive, just not that great. Competitive should be enough against this version of the Steelers. Colts, 19-15. ——————— Saturday, 8:15 p.m. Denver at Detroit — What to make of the Lions, losers of two of their last three after their once-in-a-generation 8-2 start? Well, they’ve certainly come back to their toothless pussycat ways of turning the ball over at the most inopportune times. And Denver’s defense has made hay by producing a lot of turnovers — that’s what the difference has been since their horrendous start this season. Then I thought, I’m reading that the Broncos are still just about dead last in the league in yards allowed. How do you think Miami got to their 70 points against this team? I see Detroit turning the ball over two more times than Russell Wilson will … and still winning because they’ll roll up 500 yards despite that. Lions, 31-27. ——————— Sunday, 1 p.m. Atlanta at Carolina — Speaking of toothless pussycats, I think these Panthers qualify. Falcons, 27-16. ——————— Chicago at Cleveland — Two teams that have righted the ship after sailing straight into the rocky shoreline earlier this season. I like Joe Flacco taking advantage of the Bears defense, for some reason, though. Browns, 24-20. ——————— Tampa Bay at Green Bay — Just the antidote for the bad taste in your mouth, Packers fans. A NFC South team showing up on your doorstep on a frigid December day. Packers, 24-19. ——————— New York Jets at Miami — Miami better be annoyed after losing to Tennessee on Monday night. And what can the Jets’ offense do about an annoyed opponent? I can hear them now like a little kid complaining to Mom: “Aaron, will you come here? There’s a mean man out on the porch and he wants to talk to Dad?” Dolphins, 30-22. ——————— New York Giants at New Orleans — This normally looks like a good ambush game, a team with a weak offense showing up in a loud dome. But the Giants might do the squashing of the often inept Saints’ offense instead. Giants, 23-20. ——————— Houston at Tennessee — The rising stock of the Texans may just come thudding back to earth with the concussion suffered by rookie QB C.J. Stroud. But can the Titans take advantage, especially considering my “reverse momentum” should make them easy pickings after their upset of Miami. Hmm. Let’s go Texans, 24-21. ——————— Kansas City at New England — This was supposed to be the Monday night game until the NFL “flexed” it out of there. With the way KC is reeling, maybe this wouldn’t have been such a terrible matchup. Naw, I can see this as a candidate for the second 3-0 final score in as many weeks. Chiefs, 20-16. ——————— Sunday, 4 p.m. San Francisco at Arizona — It’s one thing for the Cardinals to beat Pittsburgh. It’s a whole ‘nother to take on the hottest team in the league. 49ers, 33-22. ——————— Washington at Los Angeles Rams — The Rams shouldn’t let an overtime loss to Baltimore derail their new-found success, especially with the Commanders coming to town. Rams, 29-23. ——————— Dallas at Buffalo — Will the Cowboys’ dog-and-pony show travel well? It should considering the Bills’ defense is such an accommodating bunch. Cowboys, 34-28. ——————— Sunday, 8:20 p.m. Baltimore at Jacksonville — While Trevor Lawrence was able to play last week despite his sore ankle, his team looked about as bad as I thought they would when I assumed the star QB couldn’t play. And now they’ve moved up a whole class from playing Cleveland to playing Baltimore. And on prime-time TV, to boot. Ravens, 31-24. ——————— Monday, 8:15 p.m. Philadelphia at Seattle — The way the Eagles have been beaten up and thrown around the last few weeks, I’d be worried. Except this is by far the easiest game Philly has played in at least a month after having had to face the Cowboys, 49ers, Bills and Chiefs and the Cowboys again since the start of November. Eagles, 34-25. ——————— Last week — 7-8, 47 percent. Season — 129-79, 62 percent. Steve Brownlee can be reached at 906-228-2500, ext. 552. His email address is sbrownlee@miningjournal.net.

Family separation, uncertainty about their fate, a scarcity of food and limited access to bathroom facilities are among the many hardships Israeli hostages held by Hamas endure, says a former captive freed two weeks ago. Sharon Alony-Cunio and her twin girls, age 3, made it out after 52 days, but her husband, David Cunio, is still being held in Gaza, along with about 135 other Israelis. They were kidnapped during Hamas’ Oct. 7 rampage that left more than 1,200 people dead in Israel border communities. In her first media interview since being freed during a weeklong truce late last month, Alony-Cunio told Reuters captivity was “a Russian roulette. You don\'t know whether tomorrow morning they\'ll keep you alive or kill you, just because they want to or just because their backs are against the wall.’’ Alony-Cunio, 34, told the news agency one of the girls was taken separately to Gaza and did not rejoin the family for 10 days. The three days before their Nov. 27 release, David was taken away. “I am petrified I will get bad news that he is no longer alive,’’ she said. “I am torn without my second half, the love of my life, the father of my daughters who ask me every day, ‘Where is daddy?’’’ Alony-Cunio said fellow hostages would sacrifice some of their meager rations of pita bread and sometimes dates, cheese or meat rice for her girls − Emma and Julie − who struggled waiting for a toilet and had to use a sink or trash can. Their group of hostages was kept above ground instead of in the miles of Hamas tunnels under Gaza, but the interminable days and not knowing whether the Israeli government had given up on them made the anguish of captivity nearly intolerable. Alony-Cunio is advocating for the remaining hostages to be released as soon as possible. “We are not just names on a poster,’’ she said. “We are human beings, flesh and blood. The father of my girls is there, my partner, and many other fathers, children, mothers, brothers.’’ Netanyahu says dozens of Hamas militants surrendering; Blinken defends veto on UN cease-fire resolution: Updates Developments: ∎ The 90-year-old father of Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif has been killed in an Israeli strike on his house in Jabaliya, northern Gaza Strip, the media outlet said.

Magill and Bok were accused of failing to adequately denounce antisemitic intimidation and hate speech at Penn. Read more here. ∎ The Israel Defense Forces said it has killed Emad Krikae, describing him as the commander of Hamas’ Shejaiya Battalion. The unit\'s former commander had also been ""eliminated,\'\' the IDF said. ∎ Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov, during talks with Palestinian and Hamas officials, pressed for an end to the fighting and the release of hostages held by militants, Russia\'s Tass media outlet reported Monday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday accused Russia of taking ""anti-Israel"" positions. As University of Penn leaders resign, students say \'a lot still needs to change\' Israel\'s overwhelming ground and air attack in Gaza figures to continue for weeks, and a subsequent military campaign of less intensity could go on for months, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant indicated Monday in an interview with The Associated Press. Undaunted by international pressure for a cease-fire amid widespread devastation and a mounting civilian death toll in Gaza, Gallant would not commit to a deadline for completing the current phase of Israel\'s military operation as its seeks to eliminate Hamas\' leadership and its ability to threaten Israel. “We are going to defend ourselves,\'\' he said. ""I am fighting for Israel’s future.” Gallant said the next phase would focus on fighting against “pockets of resistance” and would require Israeli troops to maintain their freedom of operation. “That’s a sign the next phase has begun,” he said. The Israeli military is still confronting dogged resistance from militants in parts of the battered Gaza City and the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, while also making headway in the southern city of Khan Younis, which has swollen with tens of thousands of refugees trying to flee the fighting. Hunger and disease are becoming even bigger factors in the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where 1.9 million of the 2.3 million prewar residents have been displaced, mostly going to the strip’s south. The difficulty of distributing aid amid the fighting – including such necessities as food, water and medicine – is making already dire conditions downright untenable. The U.N. World Food Programme said over the weekend that half the people in Gaza are starving, and only one out of every 10 is eating every day. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, reported Gazans carrying their dead children to health facilities. “There\'s not enough food. People are starving,’’ tweeted Carl Skau, COO of the World Food Programme. Shelters are overcrowded beyond capacity in the south, where about 1 million Palestinians have sought refuge in 94 U.N. facilities, leading to the spread of infectious diseases. Nicholas Papachrysostomou, emergency coordinator in Gaza for the aid group Doctors Without Borders, said “every other patient” at a clinic in Rafah has a respiratory infection. In shelters where hundreds share a single toilet, diarrhea is widespread, particularly among children, he said. The Israeli agency responsible for civilian affairs in Gaza said Monday it had increased its ability to inspect aid shipments bound for Gaza and blamed the U.N. for the long line of trucks awaiting passage into the war-battered Palestinian enclave. The U.N. says the fighting makes it too dangerous for its staffers to go to work. The Israeli Defense Ministry’s agency, Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories − or COGAT − said it was ready to open a second border crossing to allow aid to flow into Gaza. Israel has only been inspecting the trucks at the smaller Nitzana crossing before entering Gaza through Rafah on the Egyptian border. “Kerem Shalom (crossing) is to be opened, so the amount of inspections will double,” COGAT said in a statement. “But the aid keeps waiting at the entrance of Rafah. The U.N. must do better. The aid is there, and the people need it.” Israel says it has already been clearing more than 200 trucks of aid for passage into Gaza each day, but the U.N. has not been able to process and distribute the aid as fast as it comes in. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has repeatedly emphasized the lack of safety for U.N. staff and the intensity of military operations, leading to at least 130 U.N. staff members being killed so far. “Some of our staff take their children to work so they know they will live or die together,” he said. Israel\'s military campaign in Gaza has turned the enclave into the most dangerous place in the world for women, the advocacy group ActionAid International says. ""Women and girls in Gaza are suffering from unprecedented levels of violence during the Israeli military escalation,"" says a new report by the organization, whose mission is centered on ""feminist leadership.\'\' Health officials in Gaza have estimated the total Palestinian death toll at about 18,000 and say about 70% are women and children. ActionAid says women and girls are being killed and injured at ""horrific"" rates, denied their basic rights to food, water and health care on a daily basis, and exposed to enormous psychological stress and trauma after two months of ""living in terror."" ""It is the most dangerous place for women now, at this current time, according to numbers describing the reality and conditions of women in Gaza,"" ActionAid spokesperson Riham Jafari told USA TODAY in an email. Israeli military says it discovered an RPG training facility hidden inside a mosque in a civilian neighborhood of northern Gaza. Weapons seized included grenades, cartridges and various firearms, the military said in a statement. Some of the weapons, displayed on the military\'s social media, were found in bags belonging to civilian organizations, the statement said. The military has defended its deadly and destructive ground invasion of Gaza, claiming Hamas consistently uses civilians as human shields and establishes military facilities in civilian buildings. Hamas has denied the claims. Jordan’s Prime Minister Bisher Khasawneh accused Israel of attempting to drive Palestinian civilians out of Gaza, calling the effort a ""potential game changer.” Khasawneh said conditions ""suggest that there is a deliberate attempt to generate the conditions for Gazans – coupled with increased violence in the West Bank abandoned to settlers – that will compel people to consider the option of moving across the border.""'}]"

Ann was born on July 9, 1947, in Detroit, MI. to Philip A. Hart and Jane Briggs Hart. She was their second-born child. The firstborn was a son who would die in a drowning accident later in the summer of Ann’s birth. By July of 1957, there would be seven more siblings, four brothers and three sisters. In the summer of 1954 at age seven years, Ann contracted paralytic polio while the family was at their summer home on Mackinac Island. She spent an entire year in a polio hospital and rehabilitation center. She was left with significant, lifelong paralysis in both of her legs requiring her to use crutches for several years while undergoing three separate orthopedic surgeries. Eventually, she managed without crutches for many years and later in life used an electric wheelchair. None of this stopped her from living a dynamic and well-traveled life.

In 1986, she founded the Mackinac Island Music Festival. During Ann’s years of singing, she benefited from practicing a bodywork method known as Feldenkreis that seeks to reorganize connections between the brain and the body and so improve body movement and the psychological state. She would go on to study the method, and she became a professional Feldenkreis Practitioner for eight years in Seattle, WA. While in Seattle, she also became a Dharma student, studying Tibetan Buddhism. She was in retreat at Dzogchen Beara Buddhist Meditation Center in Ireland for six years, was a Practicing Sangha at Lerab Ling Buddhist Retreat Center in France for the next seven years, and then was a Resident Retreat Advisor at the Buddhist Center for Wisdom and Compassion in Berne, NY for three years.

I have to say she is a good addition to the Planning Commission,” added Trustee Robert Tasior. “She is very thorough on all of the revisions and everything. Does all of the punctuation,” Palmer added. The motion by Palmer to re-appoint Hopcroft, support from Tasior, passed unanimously. Trustee Jeremy Spencer did not attend the Nov. 13 meeting. The current terms for Member Greg Schulz and Chair Jeff Linderman are both up at the end of the year. It is unclear if either one of them have asked to, or plan to ask to be re-appointed. The Board of Trustees held a special meeting on Friday, Nov. 17 to schedule a public hearing to discuss an ethics complaint Clerk Josh Sutton filed on behalf of Superintendent Tammy Kline against Linderman. The public hearing will take place on Dec. 13 at 2 p.m. The other Planning Commission members include Tasior, who serves as a member of the Board of Trustees, Christine Beckner and Timothy O’Connor, whose appointments run through the end of 2024, and Jackie MacKenzie whose term runs through the end of 2025. According to notes on the township’s Planning Commission’s webpage, the township board is required to appoint/reappoint one third of the membership annually with the exception of elected officials. Elected official’s term expires with their election term. Officers are selected annually at the June regular meeting. The board packet also included the application materials for Rick Buckner. As reported in the previous issue of this publication, Buckner started as the new Planning and Zoning director on Nov. 6. After some discussion, the board voted to postpone the Planning Commission meeting scheduled for Dec. 4 until they hold the public hearing to discuss the ethics complaint against Linderman.

The court of appeals ruled Tuesday against Genesee County, rejecting the county’s request for an immediate dismissal of the lawsuit. The legal action, filed by the judges of the 67th District Court, and supported by many municipalities in Genesee County, comes after the Genesee County Board of Commissioners decision Sept. 13 ordering the closure of the outlying 67th District Courtrooms, moving them all under one roof in the McCree Building, 630 Saginaw St., in downtown Flint. The plan would shutter four courtrooms in Genesee County by the end of March. The judges of the 67th District Court, with the support of officials in the affected municipalities, obtained a temporary restraining order last month against the county plan to close the satellite courts. The plan, approved by the county commissioners, Commissioner Shaun Shumaker (R-Fenton Twp.) being the only dissenting vote, was intended to address deteriorating buildings housing various county offices. The focus of the plan is to save enough money, without raising taxes or cutting staff, to repair and improve four state mandated buildings in the county – the Genesee County Circuit Court, the Genesee County Jail, the county motor pool and the Genesee County Community Action Resource Department (GCCARD) warehouse. Those buildings will cost the county $82.9 million in expenses over the next nine years, according to officials, so the plan would close the six outlying 67th District Court buildings for a savings of $21 million over that period. All of the money saved by these closures would be put into a capital improvement fund specifically to repair and update the four buildings in question. The lawsuit argues the judges have the authority to determine necessary district court locations and a state law requires district court facilities in cities with a population of 6,500 or more – which includes Davison, Burton, Flushing, Grand Blanc and Fenton. The appeals court also asked for a retired judge to oversee further proceedings. Both parties have 21 days to file objections once the judge’s report is filed. – G.G.
