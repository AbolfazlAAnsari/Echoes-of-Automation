Doctors CBS News spoke with said treating non-viable pregnancies, in which the fetus is not expected to survive, puts them and their patients in what they call an impossible position. Dr. Anne Feighner, an OB/GYN in Boise, said she felt sad and frustrated upon hearing what one of her patients went through: delivering a baby in a hotel bathroom after traveling out of state for an abortion. ""Sadness, just really hopeless and frustrated feeling like there was so much harm that happened to her that didn\'t need to happen,"" Feighner said. Feighner\'s patient, Idaho resident Becca Vincen-Brown, discovered her expected baby had triploidy at 16 weeks. The rare condition meant many of the organs, including the brain, kidneys and heart, were severely malformed. ""That really hit both my husband and me hard, realizing it wasn\'t going to be a viable baby,"" said Vincen-Brown. She was told she had a few options: carry the pregnancy until it spontaneously miscarries or she has a stillbirth, or have an abortion outside the state due to Idaho\'s laws. She and her husband ended up driving seven hours to Portland, Oregon, for an abortion procedure. During the trip, she went into premature labor at her hotel, giving birth in the bathroom while trying to muffle her cries as her 2-year-old slept nearby. ""The trauma that I experienced, I blame completely on the legislation. And it\'s really pushing me to try to make a change,"" she said. Vincen-Brown is now suing the state alongside other patients and doctors over Idaho\'s strict abortion ban which they allege has caused ""grave harms to pregnant patients."" The legal action was filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights, which has brought similar lawsuits in Oklahoma, Texas, and Tennessee. Since the reversal of Roe v. Wade last year, 14 states, including Idaho, have imposed strict limitations on abortion rights. Idaho\'s law now categorizes abortion as a felony, with few exceptions, such as if the procedure is essential to save the mother\'s life or in reported cases of incest or rape. Anyone who helps a minor leave the state for an abortion could face jail time. Feighner said Vincen-Brown having to travel for the abortion was ""very dangerous"" and is troubled by the rules surrounding exemptions in the law, especially regarding when a woman\'s life is at risk. ""It\'s really hard to define at what point you\'re saving that woman\'s life. Someone might come in an emergency, bleeding. And I won\'t know the right thing to do, whether it\'s legal or not,"" she said, although she plans to stay in Idaho. Idaho Rep. John Vander Woude, a Republican who describes himself as ""pro-life"" and chairs the health and welfare committee, initially voted for the abortion ban. He said he now believes the law should consider the health of the mother, not just the life of the mother. ""I might say I\'m pro-life, but I\'m also pro-life for the mother, too,"" Woude said.

Tim Sheehy: 10% of our state are veterans. We're tied with Alaska basically as the highest percentage of veteran population in the nation, and yet 43 other states had an exemption for military retirement income, and we did not. That didn't make sense. Governor Gianforte, who is serving his first term as governor of Montana, says he was proud to sign the bill into law. Gov. Gianforte: Here we have this reservoir of incredibly talented people, and we've been discouraging them from settling and bringing their military pension to Montana because we taxed it. No more. Thanks to the leadership of John Fuller 50% of military pensions for retired military will not be taxed in the state of Montana. That means our doors are open. We want veterans to come here and prosper here. There's also new property tax incentives for disabled veterans. Full audio: Gallery Credit: Allison Rapp""}]"

There was a political debate Thursday night in Georgia, but not between two presidential candidates. Instead, it was between one governor and presidential candidate and another governor, who some think might be one. On the one side, there was Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is of course running for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, and California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. It sure looked like a presidential debate. There were two politicians at lecterns, a moderator, even a whole set made to look like one. But this was a product of TV, specifically of Fox News and host Sean Hannity. Newsom gained attention some months ago for a peppy interview with Hannity. Hannity seemed to enjoy the back and forth, and the duo formed an unlikely cable bromance. Soon after, when DeSantis looked like the principal alternative to former President Trump, Hannity invited DeSantis to take part in a ""debate"" with Newsom — and he agreed. And so this event was birthed. What did we learn? The California governor hasn\'t been shy about making a case for a left-of-center vision for the country. His pearly whites and Pat Riley hair haven\'t seemed to meet a camera they haven\'t liked. It has led to speculation that Newsom is really running a shadow campaign, waiting in the wings in case President Biden doesn\'t actually run for reelection — despite the fact that Biden is already doing exactly that. Newsom tried to dismiss — again — that notion early and often in Thursday night\'s debate. ""There are profound differences tonight, and I\'m happy to engage them,"" Newsom said, ""but one thing we do have in common is neither of us will be the nominee of our party in 2024."" As he\'s done in all of his other public events and interviews this year, Newsom defended Biden, but some — even in his own party — still don\'t buy the loyal surrogate act. ""There are two additional Democrats running for ... president right now,"" Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, a Democrat, said earlier this month — ironically from the early caucus state of Iowa. ""One is a congressman from Minnesota, the other one is the governor of California, but only one has the guts to announce it."" The congressman from Minnesota being Rep. Dean Phillips. ""I appreciate and respect the work the president is doing,"" Newsom said during the debate, adding, ""I don\'t know how many times I can say it. They\'re just making this stuff up about a shadow campaign."" The reality is, Newsom has thrust himself into the conversation for the presidency. If he\'s not angling to run this cycle, as he says, he certainly appears to be doing so for 2028 — when the country is set to be clear of Trump and Biden. Time is running out for DeSantis. He\'s trailing Trump by a lot, there are just 44 days until the Iowa caucuses, and DeSantis needs a strong showing there. It\'s not clear he did enough with this appearance to help himself close the gap, though his team was happy with his performance and cited dozens of conservative commentators who praised him. DeSantis\' task was made tougher, though, because Newsom didn\'t just want to have a debate on which of theirs is a better governing philosophy, but also seemed intent on trying to tank DeSantis\' campaign. ""Joe Biden will be our nominee in a matter of weeks,"" Newsom said, ""and in a matter of weeks, Sean, he\'ll be endorsing Donald Trump as the nominee for the Republican Party."" At another point, this: ""When are you going to drop out and at least give Nikki Haley a shot to take down Donald Trump in his nomination. She laid you out."" Newsom clearly seemed to be trying to get under DeSantis\' skin — and he appeared to do so at times. At one point, as both men were talking over each other and the volume got louder, Newsom played his best Joe Cool, threw his hands open, turned to DeSantis and said with a smile, ""Hey, Ron, relax."" Aside from the jabs, DeSantis went after Newsom on his record as California governor. And it was a friendly environment for DeSantis to do so. The topics seemed to benefit his point of view, not unexpectedly, considering the platform. They ranged from: You get the idea. With that wind at his back, and on a conservative platform, DeSantis was more than happy to contrast his state with Newsom\'s. The ""California liberal"" reputation is going to be a hurdle for Newsom, if he does decide to run at some point. And DeSantis got in a dig — with some family ties. ""I was talking to a fella who had made the move from California to Florida,"" DeSantis said before setting up his punch line. ""He was telling me that Florida\'s much better governed, safer, better budget, lower taxes, then he paused and said, \'By the way, I\'m Gavin Newsom\'s father-in-law.\' "" Zing. Newsom\'s father-in-law, Kenneth F. Siebel Jr., is an investment manager and longtime GOP donor, according to a Fox News report. A family trust gave money to a pro-DeSantis PAC last year. DeSantis stressed that Biden, whom he wants to take on in next year\'s general election, wants to replicate the California model for the nation. Newsom was quick to counter, charging that Florida\'s tax system hurts working people, that DeSantis bullies the marginalized and that women\'s reproductive rights are under assault because of Florida\'s six-week abortion ban. ""He\'s lying to you about all these facts and figures,"" DeSantis charged, ""throwing stuff out to see what sticks to the wall. This is a slippery, slick politician."" DeSantis also provocatively went after Newsom on the debate about books in schools and, as he called it, the uncleanliness of California\'s cities. He brought on stage with him, and displayed for the cameras, what appeared to be a page from a graphic novel with partially blacked-out images showing sexual acts that he claimed is in California schools, as well as a map of, well, poop that he said is from an app depicting parts of San Francisco. There couldn\'t be two more ideologically opposite philosophies on how to govern than DeSantis\' Florida and Newsom\'s California. If you\'re a conservative, you likely hold up California as everything that\'s wrong with America — as outlined in the topics presented. But if you\'re left of center, you likely see DeSantis and his governance as abhorrent. That probably didn\'t change if you watched this debate. In the end, neither man may be elected president in 2024, but this could be a preview of the next presidential cycle, when the country is past Trump and Biden, and there is the chance for an American political rebirth when candidates will have to debate — on an actual presidential debate stage — their starkly different for their visions of America in a clash of governing ideologies.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 1:39 am ABC Fox Reporter Dozens of people are safe after a chair-lift malfunctioned at Montana Snowbowl. Witnesses tell ABC FOX Montana when two people got off the Lavelle chairlift around 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday, it started to shake. The chair got caught after it swung around the bull wheel and tore from the cable, later dropping to the ground. Witnesses said immediately after the chair fell, ski patrol started evacuating several dozen skiers and snowboarders using ropes and harnesses. No one was injured in the incident. The people sitting directly behind the chairlift that malfunctioned said they saw the cable was frayed so they jumped around 10 feet off the chairlift and to the ground ""We heard the loud rattle and we looked up and we saw the chair flip up and get dragged through the bull wheel,"" the witness said. ""So I immediately looked across my buddy and was like jump jump lets jump we had to get out of the situation."" The three witnesses are season ticket holders to Montana Snowbowl and said they want to remain anonymous. ABC FOX Montana reached out to Montana Snowbowl and the Missoula County Sheriff\'s Office to confirm more about what happened, but have not heard back as of 4:30 p.m. on Wednesday.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 1:36 am NonStop Local Digital Journalist GREAT FALLS- Officers responded to a house on Third Avenue S. after the caller reported a man who was “out of control and refusing to leave.” Court documents say the victim said she allowed Nathan Rolfs to stay with her for about a week but she wanted him to leave, saying she was concerned over Rolfs’ bizarre behavior. When officers talked to Rolfs he initially said he was gathering things and planning to leave because the victim told him to. Court documents say Rolfs stalled for 20 minutes and was escorted out of the house. While on the porch of the house, Rolfs refused to leave and challenged the officers to take him to jail. Officers told Rolfs he was no longer welcome and was trespassing as the victim wanted him to leave the property. Rolfs continued to refuse to leave, and when officers tried to handcuff him he resisted, twisting and pulling away from the officers. At one point, Rolfs grabbed officers and attempted to hit and claw at them with his hands. Rolfs head-butted one officer and scratched another, causing injury and drawing blood to both, before trying to bite an officer’s fingers and attempting to kick a third officer while being put into leg restraints. According to the officer affidavit, Rolfs told officers that he was high on bath salts and continued to fight with detention staff members after being taken to the detention center. Detention staff members decided to use a taser to control and secure Rolfs at the detention center. Court documents note Rolfs has an extensive criminal history. Nathan David Rolfs has been charged with two counts of assault on a peace officer or judicial officer, criminal trespass to property, resisting arrest and obstructing a peace officer or other public servant.
