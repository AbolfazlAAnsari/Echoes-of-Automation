Better, a home ownership platform with a free mortgage calculator, looked into historical Census and HUD data. The data collected analyzed median home values in America for the first year of every decade since 1950 and the percent growth of the first year of each decade's home value since 1950. The rise and fall of home prices can be traced historically to many factors. Some of these include mortgage rates, inflation, historical events like economic recessions, and state-to-state or city-to-city migration rates, to name but a few. The decades between the 1950s to the 2020s saw significant home price fluctuations—especially the period between the post-war 1950s to the late 1980s, which saw a steady rise in home prices, minus a few bumps along the road. The recession in the early 1990s produced a minor real estate market bubble that burst, ultimately bringing a nominal dip in home prices. Significant price drops in the housing market didn’t really materialize until the 2008 Great Recession and real estate crash. The real estate housing market hadn’t experienced something like that since the 1930s, and though solid numbers for home prices weren’t tracked back then, home production rates dropped by 90%, proving trends were on a downward trajectory in the U.S. home market. As with any financial market, price fluctuations are expected. Overall, while sensitive to other external market forces, the home real estate market has proven to be relatively robust. Better, an online mortgage lender with a free mortgage calculator, looked into historical Census and HUD data. The data collected analyzed median home values in America for the first year of every decade since 1950 and the percent growth of the first year of each decade's home value since 1950. Prices are shown in both 2020 adjusted and unadjusted dollar amounts. The analysis from 1980 and onward also includes the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, using data from Freddie Mac. - Median home value (unadjusted): $7,354 - Median home value (inflation-adjusted to 2020 dollars): $79,063 At the start of the 1940s, homeownership sunk to a new century low of 43.6% while the median U.S. home value was just $2,938,, or $30,600 in today's dollars. With World War II raging overseas, home ownership was low on the priority list both on Main Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. This was no surprise given the 90% drop in production of new homes just a decade before the start of the Great Depression. The robust real estate market of the 1950s fell into place with high demand for homes, the shortage that demand created, the surging economy, and the migration to the suburbs. Amid the boom of post-war purchasing, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower passed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, connecting the country like never before. This paved the way for suburban sprawl, altering the real estate market and opening new possibilities for places to live—especially as many Americans were starting families. Families purchased cars in record numbers, and federally sponsored highways drove people out of cities and into the suburbs where post-war subdivisions like Levittown popped up. At the end of the war, the return of 15 million GIs was just the thing to rev up the long-suffering real estate market. Government-backed loans helped 2.4 million war veterans to purchase homes by 1952. While this contributed to major home buying and economic mobility for many white veterans of World War II, this was not the case for many Black veterans. Black families were still feeling the ramifications of redlining districts—a practice of banks refusing to grant mortgages to people because of their race or what neighborhood they lived in—that began in the 1930s and would not be deemed illegal until 1968. - Median home price (unadjusted): $11,900 - Median home price (inflation-adjusted to 2020 dollars): $104,166 - Price growth since 1950: 31.7% The homeownership boom continued into the 1960s, as did general prosperity in the United States. Many factors contributed to the rise in homeownership and home price increases, including a healthy price-to-income ratio, which is how much income the price of a house should cost (according to City Lab, that number is now 2.6 years of income). In the 1960s, the price-to-income ratio was 2, which meant that purchasing a house required two years of household income. The average household income had also risen to $6,691 by the end of the 1950s, up 57.9% from the beginning of that decade. Another contributing factor to rising homeownership and home prices were changes in mortgage financing led by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which like the popular GI Bill in the years following War War II, allowed many Americans to affordably buy homes. Homeownership edged up past 60% in 1960. Mortgage rates also remained low. In 1960, FHA mortgages were 4.6%, VA-backed mortgages were 4.5%, and the average mortgage rate was 5.1%. The economy was also flourishing in the 1960s with factors such as intense workforce growth and government assistance to remedy poverty through Food Stamps and Medicare. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 also became law during this decade, making redlining illegal and (in theory) opening up a fairer housing market to people of color. While The Fair Housing Act of 1968 provided legislative strides, Black homeownership rates are not any higher today. - Median home price (unadjusted): $17,000 - Median home price (inflation-adjusted to 2020 dollars): $112,941 - Price growth since 1950: 42.8% Median home values rose fastest (43%) in the 1970s from the time the Census started tracking values in the 1940s through the year 2000. The decade saw oil shocks, which caused gas prices to skyrocket and meat prices to go through the roof. Overspending on the Vietnam War also hurt the U.S. economy, as did the 1973-74 stock market crash. All these factors led to inflation, which rose during the decade to some of the highest rates in U.S. history. The streak of a strong economy during the prior two decades had finally ended. Along with inflation and rates, home prices also increased. While the recession of 1973-75 may not have dampened home prices, it did impact the housing market. According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, home sales and housing starts fell leading up to the recession in the early 1970s and aided economic recovery in the period that followed the recession. One Harvard study found that baby boomers entering the housing market in the 1970s was a major cause for the real housing price increase. - Median home price (unadjusted): $47,200 - Median home price (inflation-adjusted to 2020 dollars): $147,879 - Price growth since 1950: 87.0% - Average interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgage: 13.7% Back-to-back recessions rocked the early 1980s and left close to 4 million people without jobs. President Ronald Raegan's tax cuts to the wealthy in 1982 and 1986-87 also contributed to a widening wealth gap in the country, making it more difficult for average Americans to purchase homes. The recessions in the 1980s also impacted Black Americans the hardest as they had unemployment rates as much as 2.77 times that of white unemployment. The manufacturing sector—which disproportionately employed Black Americans—shrank the most during the ’80s. Normally, such high unemployment rates would negatively impact housing prices, though this was not the case during the earliest years of the decade. Inflation also continued to rise, which caused home mortgage interest rates to skyrocket. Double-digit inflation caused double-digit mortgage interest rates. According to Freddie Mac data, in 1981, the annual average mortgage interest rate was 16.63%, the highest in recorded history. On “Black Monday,” Oct. 19, 1987, the stock market dropped 22.61%. The impact was felt globally though the damage to the real estate market was regional, with New York City commercial real estate feeling the impact, albeit temporarily. - Median home price (unadjusted): $79,100 - Median home price (inflation-adjusted to 2020 dollars): $157,169 - Price growth since 1950: 98.8% - Average interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgage: 10.1% After rising steadily throughout the 1980s, home prices for the decade peaked in 1989 with an average sale price of $151,200. When the recession hit in 1990, the housing bubble burst, and nominal home prices slipped 0.9%. While the recession ended in the spring of the following year, real U.S. home prices actually continued to fall and were down from the 1989 peak in certain sections of the country. The 1990 housing bubble burst only impacted a few major cities like New York, Boston, Los Angeles, San Diego, Washington D.C., and San Francisco. Many of these cities didn’t return to their peaks until nearly a decade later. A 2009 report by the Federal Housing Finance Agency found that New England was particularly hard hit, and by 1997, housing prices lost more than 32% of their value from the peak in 1988. - Median home price (unadjusted): $119,600 - Median home price (inflation-adjusted to 2020 dollars): $179,331 - Price growth since 1950: 126.8% - Average interest""}]"

Hoffman Invitational that was held in Whitewater Sept. 18, 2021. Parker Olsen, Sports EditorDecember 12, 2021 The 2021 fall sports season was filled with success for many UW-Whitewater teams. Each of the fall sports were unable to compete in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic so, all teams were particularly excited to get back into competition. The football team’s season came to an end as they were upended in the national semifinal and many other Warhawk fall sports have been making appearances on the national stage and ended with strong seasons as well. Men’s Cross Country A season to remember. The Warhawk men’s runners had their highest finish, 2nd place, in the WIAC Championship since 1999. They took first place at the NCAA North Regional meet, a first for the program, and matched the highest finish in school history at the National Championships meet. The team was led by the WIAC coaching staff of the year, as well as by the WIAC Men’s Cross Country Athlete of the Year David Fassbender, the first Warhawk to win this title. Fassbender, a senior, was the team’s first WIAC individual champion since 2004 as well as the first ever regional individual champion, to cap off the season the three time All-American finished 6th at the nationals meet. Chrisitan Patzka and WIAC Newcomer of the Year Gunner Schlender, both freshman, joined Fassbender as All-Americans, finishing 23rd and 26th respectively at the national meet. Head coach Jeff Miller reflected on the team’s remarkable season: “The team had the most consistent and successful season in over 50 years! They won four meets and were second in two others. The team’s lowest finish was 5th place at the National Championship Meet. Winning the Regional Title was the first in school history. David Fassbender led the team finishing 1st in five races during the season. He became the first cross country runner to earn three All-American honors in school history as well as the first individual Regional Champion. Christian Patzka and Gunner Schlender also earned All-American honors providing a strong 1-2-3 punch. Justin Krause and Kyle Neuroth joined the three All-Americans, gaining All-WIAC Honors and All-Region Honors. Having a similar season, plus winning the WIAC title and placing in the top 4 at the national meet, is the goal for next year.” Volleyball The Warhawks finished the season as conference runners up in both the regular season and conference tournament losing only to UW-Eau Claire, who would go on to win the national title. The team’s record of 27-3 is the team’s highest winning percentage since the 2005 national championship team. 20 of their 27 wins were sweeps. The team was looking at a deep run in the NCAA tournament however they were knocked out in the second round of the NCAA Regional by Otterbein (OH). The team was filled with high achieving athletes. Morgan Jensen, the WIAC Defensive Player of the Year, Erin McNeil, Jenna Weinfurt and Morgan Wardall earned first team All-WIAC. Wardall, a middle hitter, earned first team All-Region honors while Jensen and KellyAnn Sotitos were honorable mentions. Wardall, a senior with a 3.9 gpa majoring in communication with an emphasis in public relations and a minor in general management, was first team Academic All-District. Her hitting percentage of .350, 82 blocks, 199 kills and 44 digs earned her Second Team All-America. Men’s Soccer The 2021 men’s soccer season was the team’s first in the Coast to Coast Athletic Conference, the team made it to the semifinals of the conference tournament. Finishing the season 15-6-1, the team was led by four All-Conference players. Freshman forward Jacob Mouille, and senior defender Evan Donini earned 1st team honors while senior midfielder Steven Wright and senior goalkeeper Jake King received 2nd team honors. Mouille was second in the conference for both goals, with eight, and points, 20. Head coach Tony Guinn reflected on the team’s season: “It was a great season, we won 15 out of our 21 games, 80% of our games were on the road, I could not be any prouder. We do the best we can to represent our school on the field and in the classroom. The team returns many players, with transfers and incoming talent this will be a very difficult team to make in the fall.” Women’s Soccer Finishing 13-7 the team bowed out in the first round of the WIAC tournament, losing to UW-Eau Claire after having finished 3rd in the WIAC regular season. The season was highlighted by a seven game win streak during which they only allowed three goals while netting 23 goals of their own. The team had four All-WIAC players. Anna Boyd, a senior, became just the second Warhawk women’s soccer player to achieve All-WIAC accolades four times. Senior Anna Brodjian led the conference in goals with 12, five of which were game winners. Sophomore Olivia May also received All-WIAC honors, as did the senior Katy Kusswurm, a biology major, who also was given the award for the Judy Kruckman Scholar-Athlete for women’s soccer. Anna Boyd was recognized for the second consecutive year as a first team Academic All-American, she holds a 3.96 gpa and majors in elementary education. Carli Nehls, a junior, is the team’s WIAC All-Sportsmanship Team. Here is what head coach Ryan Quamme had to say about the season: “While we are disappointed with the final result, a loss in the WIAC Tournament quarterfinals, I’m thrilled with the way that our student-athletes carried themselves through a pandemic over the last two years and put together a winning season in 2021. Katy Kusswurm was named WIAC Judy Kruckman Scholar-Athlete, giving an individual in our program this distinction as the conference’s top scholar-athlete in women’s soccer for the eighth time in the last nine years. Four of our players were named to the all-conference team, and three of them were selected all-region. I’d also like to mention the commitment and dedication of Anna Boyd, Anna Brodjian and Katy Kusswurm, who adjusted on the fly to stay for an additional year to complete their fourth year of eligibility. I’m excited about the future of the program and can’t wait to work with the team again soon.” Women’s Cross Country The young team spent the season gaining experience. The roster, which only boasts three juniors and no seniors, was riddled with injuries. Paige Fassbender, a sophomore, had the best finish on the team at the WIAC Championship where she finished 33rd. The team finished 6th at the WIAC Championship. The freshman Ari De La Cerda had the team’s best finish at the NCAA North Regional, earning 51st. The squad got 22nd at the North Regional. Jeff Miller, head coach of the team, reflected on the team’s season: “The women’s team started off the season with three very strong performances, finishing 1st at the UW-Platteville Gender Meet, 4th of 13 at the Tom Hoffman Invitational and 12th of 27 at the Blugold Invitational. We then lost a few runners due to injuries and illnesses that hurt our ability to see more improvement. The women were able to finish 6th in the WIAC which was the same place we had two years ago so we were happy with that result. Our top runner was Ari De La Cerda, she was closely followed by Paige Fassbender as our #2 runner. Our #3 runner Roxanne Temple came on very strong at the end of the season and finished just 10 seconds behind Paige in our last meet. These three will provide very solid front running for us next fall. Our goal is to improve on this year’s conference and regional places with the goal of trying to get an individual qualifier to the national meet.” Whitewater sports stuck to their motto, powered by tradition, and part of that tradition is winning. UWW fall sports have been able to maintain their stature as having some of the top sports programs in the country. Despite having skipped a year of competition due to the pandemic, nearly every Warhawk fall sport had similar or better results in this 2021 season than in their previous season in 2019.

Chippewa's Levi Gho looks on during a game against Anchorage on Sept. 30 at Chippewa Area Ice Arena. Last week and this week are a homecoming for Levi Gho. The Fairbanks, Alaska native and Chippewa Steel goaltender grew up watching the Fairbanks Ice Dogs in the North American Hockey League and last week returned to town with the opposition. Gho made 18 saves in last Friday’s 5-2 Chippewa defeat, taking the ice against a team as a youngster he dreamed of playing for. “You grew up watching this team you always hoped to play for and it’s pretty much the same thing playing against them in the same league, same division and everything,” Gho said prior to leaving for Alaska of facing the Ice Dogs. Gho leads the Steel in victories entering this week’s slate of three games in Kenai River on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. The 19-year old Gho is in his first season with the Steel after a strong effort in the NA3HL with the Texas Brahmas in 2020-21 where he logged an 8-0 record and 1.36 goals against average. Gho earned Midwest Division Star of the Game honors in early September in helping the Steel earn a two-game sweep over the Kenai River Brown Bears. Gho has played hockey since he was seven but didn’t start playing goalie until he was 10 years old. On the year the 6-foot-4 Gho has logged a 4-3-1 record with a 3.02 GAA while stopping more than 88 percent of shots faced. “Levi’s a big goalie,” Chippewa coach Casey Mignone said. “He’s pretty calm in the net, relatively quiet but a super hard worker and we’re looking for him to have a good performance going back home to Alaska. We’re just looking to get some stability back there and guys we feel confident can make the saves we expect them to make. Between him and Croix I think they have a good relationship with each other and just looking for him to keep making steps.” At 6-foot-4, Gho stands out between the pipes. “That’s the beauty of goaltending too, is there’s so many different styles to play,” Gho said of his height. “A 5-foot-11 guy is going to play drastically different than a 6-foot-6 guy would. You can’t just take a 5-foot-11 goalie and put him into a 6-foot-4 body and he’s going to play well. Everybody has to play with their own style.” Gho and Croix Kochendorfer have started all 13 games between the pipes thus far for Chippewa (6-7). Like Gho, Kochendorfer also stands 6-foot-4 but both goaltenders play a different style. Korchendorfer stopped 27 of 28 shots in Saturday’s 2-1 win to help the Steel split the two-game series in Fairbanks. “It’s not like there’s a right way to play it and a wrong way to play it and that’s one of the better things I like about being a goalie,” Gho said. “If you stop the puck, the puck stays out. As long as you’re not giving up a fat rebound it’s not a bad save.” The mental aspect of being the last line of defense against the opposition is also something that drives Gho. “It’s obviously a mental battle. Everything’s up in your head, (it’s) controlling what you can,” Gho said. “Obviously I can really only control what shots go in. Beyond that its waiting to deal with situations as they come, match it head on.” Chippewa is currently sixth in the Midwest Division standings with 12 points, just six points out of the lead. Kenai River comes into this week with a 1-9 record, including 5-0 and 4-1 losses to the Steel back on Sept. 10 and 11. This week’s three games will be the last of the Alaska trip for the Steel and the two teams won’t meet again until the start of February.
