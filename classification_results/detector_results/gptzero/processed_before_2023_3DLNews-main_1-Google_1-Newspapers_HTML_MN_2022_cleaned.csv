ELMORE– Members of several area fire departments participated in a controlled burn of a house in Elmore on Wednesday night. Fairmont Fire Chief, Bryan Kastning, said they try to do two burns a year. Kastning has been fire chief since December 2021 though he’s been with the department for 15 years. On Wednesday six people participated in the burn as part of their 1001 class. The last thing to be done as part of the training is the house burn. There were two students from Elmore and one each from Dunnell, Truman, Welcome and Ellendale. Safety and Security Consultation Specialists (SASCS), which is based out of Mountain Lake, brought in the instructors to do the training. Also on scene Wednesday was Truman Ambulance and Swea City Fire Department which brought a back up pumper and a tanker to use so that all of the equipment wasn’t take out of Fairmont. South Central Rehab was there to check the vitals of those who came out of the burn. “It’s quite the production,” said Kastning. One of the trainers with SASCS was Fairmont Fire Department member, Roger Carlson. Carlson has been with the department for 47 years. He estimates he’s taken part in somewhere between 300-400 burns. While Carlson is an instructor with the SASCS he’s also done training through other organizations, which has all led up to the high number of burns he’s participated in. He explained why the controlled burns are an important part of the training. “We don’t have many structure fires anymore, not as many as we used to. So a lot of firefighters don’t have a lot of exposure. This is the closest thing we can get to a real fire,” Carlson said. During the training, pallets, straw or cardboard is torched, which results in what Carlson called a “baby fire.” They can’t burn what’s in a house like a couch or recliner. “One recliner chair has the same number of BTUs (heat output) as 60 to 80 pallets. All we burn in a room is five or six pallets so the fire is not nearly what it is in a real situation,” Carlson said. First the students were in the house when instructors started a fire so they could watch how it developed. “They do a mist and knock it back,” Kastning said. Later, a fire was started while the students were outside and they entered to put it out. Three of the Fairmont Fire Department members participated in the burn as well. “When the new guys are done, our guys go in as practice,” Kastning explained. Right now the Fairmont Fire Department has 29 members. Kastning said that 32 is full and that they’ll be hiring again this fall. It’s a paid on-call position. “We train the first and third Wednesdays of the month for two hours,” Kastning said. In addition to practicing in the burn, throughout the year there are other drills, including one through Middle Nine Mutual Aid. At the end of the night, the house was burned to the ground. Not only does the burn allow students and department members to train, but it’s a good way to get rid of houses that need to be demolished. Carlson said it ends up being cheaper to have the house burned all the way down to ashes rather than have the house knocked down. Either way, an inspection needs to be done. For the burn, a permit is obtained through the DNR. Kastning said they don’t have anymore houses scheduled for burns this year but they’re always looking for one.

But Prior Lake (3-9 overall, 1-5 in the SSC) followed with a pair of conference defeats at home — 3-0 versus Eastview Sept. 22 and 3-2 against Farmington Sept. 27. Prior Lake had just three wins last fall (3-11-2) and had a mark of 1-7-1 in the SSC, so it’s been a tough go for the program the last few years. The Lakers were 4-6-2 in 2020, the COVID-19-shortened season that had section play, but no state tournament. It’s no secret what has slowed down the Prior Lake program the last few years — lack of scoring punch. The Lakers have 10 goals in 12 games this fall and have scored just 37 goals in 40 games over the last three years. It’s tough to contend in the SSC and the highly competitive Section 2AAA when averaging less than a goal per game. Section 2AAA has two teams ranked, No. 5 Minnetonka (7-1-3) and No. 6 Edina (8-2-1). The rest of the field includes Eden Prairie (6-4-2), Waconia (4-2-2), Chaska (3-5-3), Chanhassen (3-6-1) and Shakopee (3-9). Prior Lake is 1-3 against the section with its win over Chaska (1-0) and its losses to Edina (2-0), Waconia (3-2) and Shakopee (3-1). The first round of Section 2AAA play starts Oct. 11. The semifinals are Oct. 13 with the title game Oct. 18. Edina is the defending champion. Last fall, Prior Lake lost in an overtime shootout in the section quarterfinals to Eden Prairie. The game was tied 1-1 after regulation and the two overtime periods before the Eagles won the shootout 4-3. In 2017, Prior Lake beat Chanhassen in the Section 2AA final to earn the program’s first-ever state berth as a Class 2A program. The Lakers’ other state berth came in 2000 in Class A. Soccer went to three classes last fall. Meanwhile, in Prior Lake’s win over Burnsville, junior Layne Pforr scored two goals to lead the team, while seniors Sam Kohler and Alex Carlson both had one goal. Senior Rylan Mathison, Luke Dahlen and Ben Pascanik and junior Noah Meschke each picked up an assist. Senior Liam McVety made eight saves in goal for the shutout. McVety had two saves in the shutout win over Chanhassen. Dahlen scored the game’s lone goal in the first half. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular articles.

Supported by readers. The news came out of nowhere. Brian Larsen, editor of the Cook County News-Herald in Grand Marais, had no idea the weekly newspaper he worked at for 13 years was for sale until outgoing owners Hal and Deidre Kettunen broke it to him over an office pizza lunch in November 2020. Moments later, still in shock, Larsen watched as the new owners entered the break room and introduced themselves. Larsen had never heard of the company, a New Jersey-based information tech firm called CherryRoad Technologies, its CEO, Jeremy Gulban or any of its other executives. That wasn’t surprising. CherryRoad had no media holdings before it bought the News-Herald, though that would quickly change. In short order, CherryRoad Media, the firm’s new communications division, embarked on a newspaper buying spree, largely in the Midwest and the South. It purchased seven Minnesota newspapers formerly owned by Gannett, Inc. and launched one in International Falls. CherryRoad now owns 49 papers in 10 states, including the Lake County Press, which opened in Two Harbors last month. It’s a strategy Gulban hopes will showcase CherryRoad Media’s tech offerings while bolstering local news products stripped bare by profit-driven chain ownership. Gulban says CherryRoad plans to invest in these newspapers, not mine them for their assets. That’s a refreshing change from the shark-tank world of corporate journalism. “As I’ve gotten more involved with it, I have really come to realize how (important to) a small community the newspaper really is,” Gulban said in a phone interview from CherryRoad’s Parsippany, N.J. headquarters. “When you go out into these smaller, rural communities, there really is no other real source of news. People really do count on the local newspaper to provide that. It’s really an institution in the community. “What I’ve also learned is, it takes a tremendous amount of attention to detail to run these smaller newspapers, and I think bigger companies aren’t necessarily suited for that. We are, because we’re a small organization. We’re more nimble. We’re more able to react. The number of calls I get every day from the various small papers that we have that require a response, it’s very hard for a large organization to handle something like that.” [image_caption]CherryRoad CEO Jeremy Gulban[/image_caption]One important caveat: Just because CherryRoad is a tech company doesn’t mean all functions are moving online. Gulban understands many readers like a newspaper in their hands, so CherryRoad will continue to publish print editions. That’s a relief to Larsen, 65, a print guy at heart and one of the News-Herald’s two full-time employees, a combination editor/reporter/advertising and production manager. “Hal and Deidre said they were a month away from closing the paper when Jeremy bought them out, so it was a godsend that Jeremy came in,” he said. Until buying the News-Herald, Gulban had no previous connection to Minnesota or the newspaper industry. His father Michael founded CherryRoad in 1983; the name derives from the firm’s original address. According to Dun & Bradstreet, the company generated almost $98 million in revenue in 2020. Gulban joined the firm after graduating from Drew University, a small private liberal arts college in Madison, N.J., where he majored in economics and minored in political science. “I’ve always been very interested in politics and government,” Gulban said. “I guess I kind of realized through this process I was always into the news, probably way more than I would have acknowledged. But no formal training in journalism or news. Just kind of picking up as we go here.” When the pandemic hit, Gulban said CherryRoad created tech tools to help school districts and local governments navigate the learning and communication challenges. They offered them around, for free, but found no takers. “Everyone’s answer was, we’ve already got it covered. We’re using Google, we’re using Facebook, we’re using YouTube,” Gulban said. “We started looking at other ways we could make a difference and use alternate technology sources outside of the big tech firms. We looked at newspapers as a possibility because 2020 was such a brutal year for newspapers, with the pandemic and a number of papers closing.” According to the Poynter Institute, more than 100 local newsrooms closed since the pandemic began, accelerating a trend that saw roughly 1,800 papers shut down since 2004. Most were weeklies in small towns like Warroad, which lost the Pioneer in 2019, and Two Harbors, where the Lake County News Chronicle shuttered in 2020. Gulban cast around for a small weekly to buy and found the News-Herald listed generically on a website. Steve Bragg, a business broker in the Arrowhead, placed the ad, describing the paper in broad terms to prevent employees from discovering it was for sale. Gulban contacted Bragg for more information, and the two hit it off. “He’s such a nice guy that you couldn’t help but continue to talk to him,” Gulban said. “If he had not been as friendly as he was, I probably would have said this was a terrible idea. But he was a good guy, very engaging.” Bragg said there were other interested parties but none moved as quickly as Gulban, who flew to Minnesota to meet with him before closing the deal. “He was really cordial in asking all the right questions all the way along,” Bragg said. “He was really easy to deal with, like he’d done this over and over. It went smooth, and if there was any kind of hiccup, he was real accommodating. He was fun to deal with. I hope I can deal with him again on something.” Gulban was amazed to learn that in a county of 5,600 people, the News-Herald had about 2,200 subscribers, and sold 1,000 more single copies to vacationers during the summer. “That’s a huge coverage of the population,” he said. “If every newspaper matched that level of interest, newspapers would be doing great.” A few months later, CherryRoad tried to buy the International Falls Journal from Alden Global Capital, the vulture hedge fund that owns the St. Paul Pioneer Press. Alden chose to fold the paper instead, so CherryRoad launched a replacement, the Rainy Lake Gazette, about three weeks later. Soon after, when Gannett sought to divest itself of small papers in Kansas and Missouri, CherryRoad jumped in. Then the seven southwestern Minnesota newspapers Gannett acquired after merging with GateHouse Media in 2020 came on the market, and CherryRoad bought them, too. Under GateHouse, the seven — the Crookston Times, Granite Falls Advocate Tribune, Montevideo American-News, Redwood Falls Gazette, St. James Plaindealer, Sleepy Eye Herald-Dispatch and Tri-County News in Cottonwood — endured the usual staff and salary cuts imposed by big chains beholden to stockholders and profit margins. It’s reached the point where Montevideo, Granite Falls and Tri-County share a lone editorial staffer, editor/writer/photographer Jessica Stölen-Jacobson. Ten years ago, Stölen-Jacobson quit the Tri-County News and opened a boutique, burned out after GateHouse reduced staff and cut her pay. But she missed journalism and signed on in Montevideo last April, in time to field complaints about a host of Gannett-imposed changes, including the USA Today-style design of the paper. “That was very upsetting to people, especially in Montevideo,” she said. “They didn’t like that their paper looked like every other paper in the newsstands. They didn’t like seeing the staff leaving in droves, which happened when Gannett took over. “And then all the different things people needed to contact us for were divided up in different departments everywhere. For obituaries, they had to contact one department. For legal notices, they had to contact another department. To subscribe, they had to contact somebody else. And none of it was local.” Under CherryRoad, things are looking up. The company is trying to hire a reporter in Granite Falls, and Gulban asked Stölen-Jacobson to consider how she wants the paper and website to look. Gulban hopes to roll out individual website redesigns for all CherryRoad properties in about a month, all with local input and no universal template like Gannett’s. “CherryRoad has been really good about making these decisions ours, and giving us time to think about that, too,” Stölen-Jacobson said. “They prioritized putting money into the content end of things, which is a new concept for everybody who’s worked under bigger media companies.” Gulban believes there’s a market for local news in these communities. He wants to give readers more of it, not less. “I think getting the news back to being local will help a lot,” Gulban said. “Those newspapers have lost circulation of the last several years as people have realized that, I can get my news somewhere else, why am I subscribing to this? And bringing it back to stories that matter locally will bring more subscribers in. Same thing with the advertising. “We also want to bring in more digital advertising and technical services around websites.'}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:35 pm Chet Holmgren, center, hugs family and friends after being selected second overall in the NBA basketball draft by the Oklahoma Thunder, Thursday, June 23, 2022, in New York. OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — The Oklahoma City Thunder chose Gonzaga\'s Chet Holmgren with the No. 2 overall pick in the NBA draft on Thursday night and hit the accelerator on their rebuild by adding three of the top 12 selections. In Holmgren, the Thunder got a versatile 7-footer who was a second-team Associated Press All-American in his only college season. He averaged 14.1 points and 9.9 rebounds and ranked fourth nationally with 3.7 blocks per game for the Zags. Thunder general manager Sam Presti believes Holmgren will be a good fit. ""We\'re pretty comfortable with the idea of him blending in with the group that we have,"" Presti said. ""He was the person for Oklahoma City. He was the person for the Thunder."" He will join a young team led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who averaged 24.5 points last season, and Josh Giddey, last year\'s No. 6 overall pick who made the All-Rookie second team. ""I think it\'s a great situation, great dynamic playing with guys like Josh and Shai as well as everybody down the roster,"" Holmgren said. ""It\'s a lot of great players there with unique skill sets. I feel like I can kind of pair up with them and help enhance theirs as well as have their skill sets enhance mine."" The New York Knicks traded the No. 11 pick -- 19-year-old French forward Ousmane Dieng -- to the Thunder for three future conditional first-round picks. Dieng played for the New Zealand Breakers last season and averaged 8.9 points and 3.2 rebounds. He had more immediate concerns than playing for the Thunder. ""I think I need to buy a new phone because I need an American number, so I will need to buy that,"" he said. The Thunder then took Santa Clara guard Jalen Williams at No. 12. The 6-foot-6 guard averaged 18 points and 4.2 assists last season as a junior. He\'s the first Santa Clara player picked since Steve Nash was selected 15th overall in 1996. Williams played against Holmgren twice last season in the West Coast Conference. ""He\'s super talented,"" Williams said. ""It\'s kind of cool that we get to go through this experience together now instead of being enemies on the court."" Holmgren shot 61% from 3-point range and 39% from 3-point range last season — the kind of efficiency that could help a Thunder team that ranked last in the league in field goal percentage, 3-point percentage and scoring last season. His skill could help him be effective as he works to add to his slender 195-pound frame. ""He\'s going to have to adjust and learn like any player,"" Presti said. ""I think he\'s unique. I think sometimes, unique is beneficial, and I think some of the things that make him unique can be leveraged and utilized."" The Thunder\'s core includes Gilgeous-Alexander, Giddey, Lu Dort, Darius Bazley and Tre Mann. Dort is one of the league\'s best defensive players when healthy. Bazley is an athletic wing player and Mann was an explosive scorer off the bench. Gilgeous-Alexander, the oldest player in that group, is just short of his 24th birthday. The Thunder hope Holmgren eventually can help them regain some of the glory from the Kevin Durant-Russell Westbrook era. The Thunder went to the Western Conference Finals four times with that duo and the NBA Finals once. The Thunder have not won a playoff series since Durant left and have missed the playoffs the past two seasons. They went 24-58 last season. The franchise has had success early in drafts in the past, selecting Durant No. 2 overall in 2007, Westbrook No. 4 overall in 2008 and James Harden No. 3 in 2009. The Thunder selected Arkansas\' Jaylin Williams with the 34th overall pick. The 6-10, 240-pound forward averaged 10.9 points and 9.8 rebounds per game last season. He shot 46% from the field and led the nation with 54 charges drawn. The Thunder also picked UCLA\'s Peyton Watson at No. 30 overall, though he is going to the Denver Nuggets. The Thunder acquired JaMychal Green and a 2027 protected first-round pick from the Nuggets for the rights to Watson and two future second-round picks. Green has appeared in 487 career games and posted averages of 7.9 points and 5.7 rebounds on 47% shooting. ___ AP Basketball Writer Brian Mahoney contributed to this report. ___ Follow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: twitter.com/CliffBruntAP ___ More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Log In Keep it Clean.

Minnesota Vikings defensive end Dalvin Tomlinson was listed as a limited participant in a walkthrough Monday, increasing the chances he could play Thursday night against New England at U.S. Bank

Tomlinson has missed the past three games due to a right calf injury, and hasn’t taken part in any practices or walkthroughs since being hurt Oct. 30 against Arizona. The Vikings are scheduled to have a practice on Tuesday. Listed as not participating Monday were left tackle Christian Darrisaw (concussion) and cornerback Andrew Booth Jr. (knee). The Vikings already have ruled Darrisaw out for the game against the Patriots. Also listed as limited participants were cornerback Akayleb Evans (concussion) and edge rusher Za’Darius Smith (knee). Evans was hurt Nov. 13 at Buffalo and sat out Sunday’s 40-3 home loss to Dallas. The Vikings on Monday signed outside linebacker Benton Whitley to the practice squad after having waived him on Saturday. ADVERTISEMENT Whitley cleared waivers Monday. He takes the spot on the practice squad of tight end Nick Muse, who was signed to the 53-man roster on Saturday. Whitley was then let go to make room for Muse. Whitley, an undrafted rookie from Holy Cross, was plucked Oct. 19 off Kansas City’s practice squad. He was on Minnesota’s 53-man roster for three games, but was inactive for them all. On the final play of the first half Sunday, Dallas Cowboys kicker Brett Maher made a 60-yard field goal, the longest in the seven-year history of U.S Bank Stadium. Actually, he made it twice. With five seconds left in the half, Maher made the kick to apparently put Dallas up 23-3. But the officials ruled it didn’t count because there would be a booth replay of a diving CeeDee Lamb reception out of bounds for 27 yards to the Minnesota 42 on the previous play. The catch was upheld, so Maher got another chance from 60 yards out. He drilled it with more ease than his previous kick. “I thought Brett stroked the ball. I thought he had an excellent day,” Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy said of Maher, who also made field goals of 27, 50 and 53 yards. Maher’s 60-yarder also tied for the third-longest field goal ever against Minnesota. Wil Lutz of New Orleans made a 60-yarder last month in London. Longer ones have been Matt Prater from 62 yards last year at Arizona and Greg Zuerlein of the St. Louis Rams from 61 in 2015 at then-named TCF Bank Stadium.

I just know we had a good week of preparation.” Linebacker Jordan Hicks denied there was a hangover, saying, “No excuse there.’’ … Vikings star receiver Justin Jefferson entered Sunday needing 88 yards to break the record of Minnesota hall of famer Randy Moss for most yards receiving in a player’s first three NFL seasons of 4,163. Jefferson had just three catches for 33 yards to give him 4,109 career yards. … Cowboys safety Jayron Kearse, who played for Minnesota from 2016-19, did a mock Skol chant after sacking Cousins in the third quarter. Kearse said he had thought of doing that as the game went on if he made a big play. He said Sunday marked the “quietest” he’d ever heard at U.S. Bank Stadium.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:35 pm Dwayne Haskins, 24, the Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback War is Hell ""‘They shot my son...I was next to him...It would be better if it had been me.’” Ivan, a father, speaking about the atrocities being committed by Russian soldiers upon Ukrainian civilians in the latest article by NY Times reporter Charlotta Gall. Reading the latest reports from the Ukraine killing fields, and seeing the ghastly images of murdered (and some raped) civilians released earlier today, reminds me to refrain from taking issue when President Joe Biden calls Russian Dictator Vladimir Putin a ""thug"" and a ""war criminal,"" words that display the candor of Biden’s 78 years—but words that are unequivocally true! As we pray for peace, lest we forget the dead... Remembering a Legend The late Alonzo ""Jake"" Gaither was born on this day, April 11th, 119 years ago! If you do not know my personal family history, allow me to declare that my affinity for Coach Gaither knows no limits because had he not offered my father, Charles, a scholarship to play football at Florida A&M in 1958, then dad never meets (and marries) my mother, Vivian (ergo, no Charles II, a/k/a ""Chuckie"" or ""Ol\' Hobbs"") 😆. But my story is the same for so many descendants of Rattlers who were blessed to play for Coach Gaither, one of the greatest college coaches of all time! During the segregation era, Gaither was in hot demand among white coaches like Bear Bryant of Alabama, Darrell Royal of Texas, and Shug Jordan of Auburn—men who picked his brains about offensive and defensive concepts that kept the Rattlers dominant for nearly three decades. As the Ghosts of the Orange Bowl site wrote last year: ""Gaither is pictured below watching from the sidelines during the 1958 Orange Blossom Classic. Long before the Universities of Miami, Florida and Florida State were winning national championships, Gaither\'s Florida A&M Rattlers were the first true college football powerhouse in the state. Gaither\'s career record was a remarkable 204-36-4, including 6 black college national championships from 1945 to 1969. In a time when Florida\'s major universities were segregated, Florida A&M had assembled teams made up of the finest African-American athletes in the state. During the Gaither era, Florida A&M produced 36 All Americans and sent 42 players to the NFL—including hall of famers Willie Galimore and Bob Hayes."" Happy Heavenly Birthday, Coach Gaither… Covid 19 is still real! Last weekend, I went out to Bragg Stadium to watch the Florida A&M Spring Football game—but I did so while still wearing a protective mask. Just this morning, CNN reporter David Culver, stationed in Shanghai, noted that, “If you think Wuhan 2020 was bad, welcome to Shanghai 2022. This has been like no other lockdown. And it’s in the country’s cosmopolitan and most affluent financial hub, of all places.” Yikes! Stay vigilant, my friends… Spelman Founders\' Day The Hobbservation Point extends a Happy Founders\' Day to Spelman College, the perennially #1 ranked HBCU according to U.S. News & World Report, which was founded on this day in 1881! In Memoriam The Hobbservation Point extends condolences to the family, friends, and teammates of the late Dwayne Haskins, 24, the Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback who was killed in a tragic accident while walking in South Florida this past weekend. Checking my options, I had no choice but to make a walk of it on a busy Friday night; the distance to the exit was only about two miles, but as I walked on a stretch of road that was running parrallel to a retention ditch, my mind started playing tricks on me as I couldn\'t help but think that I was either going to get smashed by a Big Rig or car, or attacked by an alligator lurking in the muck. Fortunately for me, I made it safely to a convenience store where the attendant allowed me to charge my phone and then call my friend Reggie Holt, who came and scooped me up. Still, but for God\'s grace, I could have been dead at 32 years old on the side of a highway with my family left to wonder why! Which is why most my most sincere prayers will remain with the Haskins family—and all who loved him—in the days ahead.

That this science is beyond the stage of mere theorization, was evidenced by Mr. Johnsrud, who showed his audience commendable reproductions of pictures which had been seen a distance of several hundred miles.” The newspaper account read, “Mr. Johnsrud defined “Television” as “the science of far seeing,” where the person to be seen would stand in front of a “highly sensitive and revolving “electrical eye,” which breaks up the features of the person or object into 25,000 or more elements which are transferred one after another over the wires at great speed. At the receiving end, technological devices receive and reproduce the many elements and thus make possible the visibility of things many miles away.” Although Johnsrud’s years of collaborative research, beginning in the 1920s, would eventually lead to what would between the 1930s and 1950s, become known as television or TV, the term “television” referred to something a little different during that lecture in 1928. Remember, Johnsrud worked for Bell Telephone, where “it is hoped that it will become possible not only to hear the party over the telephone but to see the party at same time.” That described a “television” to accompany a telephone. But the technology would soon expand to revolutionize the world of entertainment and information, which had been previously dominated by radio. The lecture was necessarily technical, but the newspaper noted there was much interest among the citizens of Spring Grove. Technology expanded quickly. Only eight years previous (1920), the first known radio news program had been broadcast along with the nation’s first commercial radio broadcast, concerning the presidential election. In the same year that Johnsrud lectured in Spring Grove, 1928, the Federal Radio Commission licensed the first television station. The big boost came at the 1939-1940 New York World’s Fair where David Sarnoff, president of RCA, introduced television to the masses. The opening ceremony, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s speech, was not only aired on radio but was also televised on black and white sets to approximately 1,000 viewers in the New York metropolitan area. NBC announced its regular schedule of programs for New York City. There were television demonstrations in the General Electric and Westinghouse pavilions along with the RCA pavilion, where fairgoers could see themselves on television. As part of this formal introduction, televisions became available for purchase by the public in stores throughout metropolitan New York City. Nine years later (1948), a million homes in the United States had television sets. Television broadcasts reached southeast Minnesota in the early 1950s. Floor model televisions were huge, made of wood, metal and glass with rabbit ears antennas on top. Smaller portable models soon followed. No one person invented television. Many scientists collaborated or worked alone. But one engineer from Spring Grove was among those pioneers. Thanks to Don Ellestad for submitting the newspaper article about Alfred Johnsrud.

Outside La Crosse City Hall on Thursday, Sept. 8, a sign telling health providers to ""check your First Amendment rights"" at the door sits on a bench in front of the word ""trans"" drawn in chalk as the city council takes another vote on a ban on conversion therapy. The conservative law group Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty has made good on its promise and is suing the city of La Crosse for banning conversion therapy on LGBTQ+ minors. In a lawsuit filed Thursday morning, WILL claims the city’s ban is unlawful and unconstitutional, arguing it violates the First Amendment and 14th Amendment by infringing on the right to free speech and religion. WILL also claims it’s not in the city’s authority to regulate. The La Crosse Common Council passed the ban last month, which prohibits medical or psychological professionals from performing conversion therapy — a widely discredited and harmful practice that tries to forcibly change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity — on anyone under the age of 18. Thirteen other Wisconsin cities have conversion therapy bans in place: Appleton, Cudahy, Eau Claire, Glendale, Madison, West Allis, Milwaukee, Racine, Sheboygan, Shorewood, Superior, Kenosha and Sun Prairie. Only La Crosse has been sued. “The City of La Crosse is under the mistaken impression that it can simply punish citizens who dare to voice officially disfavored viewpoints on public issues of critical importance,” Anthony LoCoco, WILL deputy counsel, said in a statement. “The First Amendment prohibits exactly this kind of big-government bullying. Attempts to falsely paint as hateful those who share good-faith disagreements on matters going to the core of what it means to be human won’t salvage the City’s position.” WILL’s lawsuit is on behalf of Joy Buchman, a licensed mental health professional and owner of Kinsman Redeemer Christian Counseling Center, LLC in La Crosse. It was filed in U.S. District Court of the Western District of Wisconsin. “My mission as a counselor is to provide healing and guidance to anyone who comes to me for help,” Buchman said in a statement. “Government officials should not be allowed to police the private conversations I have with clients in need and then punish me for saying something they don’t like.” Leading up to the city council meeting, WILL sent two letters threatening to sue the city if the ban was adopted. The city had revised the ban from an earlier one passed in June to make it stronger against any potential litigation. The likelihood that the city’s ban on conversion therapy would end up in court was a sticking point for some city council members when it came time to vote. The city has not yet responded to a request for a comment. Former City Council member Tom Sweeney reads a portion of the letter sent to La Crosse Mayor Mitch Reynolds asking him to veto the conversion therapy ban.

Belle Plaine resident David Einertson officially retired from the Scott County Sheriff’s Office earlier this year after nearly five decades of service to the county. Einertson, known to most by his nickname “Bones,” began his public service career in Scott County in 1971. Over the decades, he worked as a probation case aide in the court system, a deputy, a crime scene investigator, a sergeant and chief deputy. After his retirement in 2000, Einertson returned to work part-time for Scott County processing firearm permits. “He has been a trailblazer for the Sheriff’s Office and will leave behind a legacy of honor, service and integrity,” said Scott County Sheriff Luke Hennen, in a statement. “He will be greatly missed.” Hennen is the last of the six county sheriffs Einertson worked with during his career. Before beginning his career in Scott County, Einertson served in the U.S. Army for two years, earning the rank of Sergeant E5. Afterward, he moved from his home state of Iowa to attend Minnesota State University in Mankato, where he earned his bachelor of science in sociology and psychology. In 1973, under Sheriff Bob Moody, Einertson joined the Scott County Sheriff’s Office as a deputy. Soon after, he landed the nickname “Bones,” in reference to his tall, lanky build. “At one time, he was so skinny that he only had one stripe on his pinstripe pajamas,” joked former Sheriff Bill Nevin. Nevin and Einertson worked together as deputies in the 1970s and soon after became the county’s first crime scene investigators. “Which was kind of unique for a small county at the time,” Nevin said. The 1980s brought busy and challenging years for the investigators, including two widely-publicized sex abuse cases. In 1984, under Sheriff Doug Tietz, Einertson was promoted to sergeant. In 1987, with Nevin in the sheriff’s post, he became chief deputy. After 13 years in the role, Einertson retired in 2000. Months later, he returned to work processing firearm permits. Fellow Sheriff’s Office retiree Dave Wagner, known by his nickname “Greek,” said Einertson’s enjoyment of talking with people probably kept him working well past his first retirement. Wagner, also a Belle Plaine resident, said the two friends are planning a walleye fishing trip in Green Bay in June. Einertson’s official last day with the department was Jan. 14, 2022. He lives in Belle Plaine with his wife, Phoebe, a retired elementary school teacher. Southwest News Media asked David ‘Bones’ Einertson some questions about his career. I’ve read that you and Bill Nevin were the first-ever Crime Scene Investigators in Scott County and you particularly enjoyed the new technology becoming available at the time. What did you find most rewarding about your work during those years? Einertson: I think the most rewarding part of the 1970s was the upgrading of law enforcement and emergency medical training, A basic police and law enforcement course became mandatory in the state of Minnesota, specialty courses became available such as crime scene investigation and advanced criminal investigation. Advanced emergency medical training appeared and a upgrading of the radio system all added up to the police and deputies in Scott County being more effective in carrying out their duties. What did you enjoy most about your decades with the Sheriff’s Office? Einertson: What I enjoyed most about my time in the Sheriff’s Office and Scott County employment in general was the people I worked for, with and those I met while working. I was very fortunate in starting out I came in contact with people who had a very high expectation for those in public service. I do not know of anyone I worked with who did not want to do a good job and with all the things going on I had many more positive contacts with people than bad. Do you have an accomplishment you are most proud of? Einertson: I do not have any single action I am most proud. As a deputy sheriff you are involved with so many different situations that it is difficult to pick one event that is the best one. It is also difficult to pick one I did not do all that well on, if I had to say what I was most proud of is I believe I tried my best. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular articles.

REGIONAL— Increased production and higher prices for Northshore Mining’s taconite pellets in 2021 sparked a financial windfall for a little-known royalty trust and likely contributed to the decision by mine owner Cleveland Cliffs to shutter the plant earlier this year. The New York-based Mesabi Trust owns rights to much of the ore that exists in the Peter Mitchell pit near Babbitt. Under its longstanding contract, as discussed in the trust’s most recent annual report, Northshore pays both a base royalty and a bonus royalty when prices for the ore it mines exceed a certain threshold. Extraordinarily high steel demand and limited supply in 2021 pushed the price of steel-related products, including taconite to the highest levels ever seen, far exceeding the bonus threshold in the Mesabi Trust contract. While iron ore prices are typically set in longer-term contracts, the spot market price for iron ore peaked at over $220 a ton by May of last year. As prices jumped and shipments from Northshore increased in 2021, the royalties owed to the Mesabi Trust jumped dramatically. Northshore eventually paid just under $71 million to the trust in 2021, including $27.1 million in bonus royalties based on the higher prices. Those payments represented a 193.8-percent increase over the previous year, when Northshore paid out $25.9 million to the Mesabi Trust. The trust realized the vast majority of its financial windfall as a result of ore shipments in the second half of 2021, when Northshore shelled out just under $40 million in royalties to the entity. The trust distributed a total of $3.17 per share over the course of those two quarters, more than twice the trust’s typical distributions for the same period. Northshore is required to make its payments to the trust quarterly and by February of this year, Cliffs CEO Laurenco Goncalves indicated he had had enough. Calling the royalty structure in the Mesabi Trust agreement “ridiculous,” Goncalves announced that Cliffs would be shuttering Northshore beginning in May and that he now considers the mine and its accompanying processing facility in Silver Bay to be a “swing” facility, that will operate only as Cliffs needs new base ore. Mesabi Trust’s required filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as their annual report make clear that the trust’s revenues are almost entirely based on the royalties they receive from Northshore, and that they have no control over whether the ore they control is mined by the company. Quarterly payments to the holders of certificates in the trust vary dramatically, depending on the quarterly payments from Northshore. So far, the trust has avoided the impact of the May shutdown because of the lag time between plant production and shipping and the payments Northshore must make to the trust. For example, the trust announced late last month that it took in $13.54 million from Northshore for the first quarter of 2022, a period when Northshore was still operational. As a result, the trust’s board announced distributions of $0.75 per share as of Aug. 20. In a press statement issued last month, the trust board indicated that it was increasing its unallocated reserves “in order for the trust to be positioned to meet current expenses, and present and future liabilities that may arise, including any expenses incurred by the trust during any potentially prolonged period of idling of Northshore operations.” The shutdown, which took effect May 1 of this year, had a much larger impact in the trust’s second quarter revenue. As of late July, the trust reported total royalty payments of just $2.314 million in the second quarter, a period during which Northshore was operational for only one month. During that time, Northshore reported just 198,495 tons of total production, compared to 1.393 million tons during the same period in 2021. The recent announcement that Northshore will remain idled at least until April of 2023 at the earliest, means mine production and accompanying revenues to the trust are likely to fall even further by the third quarter of this year and continue well into 2023. That doesn’t mean the trust will be without any revenue. Under the agreement with Northshore, the mine will need to pay the trust just over $1 million annually in advance royalties, whether or not the mine is operational.More on the trustThe trust was formed in 1961, and controls mineral rights on approximately 9,750 contiguous acres of mineland located near Babbitt. The trust’s estate is owned by a number of certificate holders, the largest of which is Horizon Kinetics Asset Management LLC, which owns 2.129 million shares, or approximately 16.2 percent of outstanding shares. The trust is overseen by a four-member board of trustees, including Robert Berglund, former Northshore general manager, Michael Mlinar, a longtime Cliff’s mine manager, including at Northshore, retired U.S. Bank vice president James Ehrenberg, and Robin Radke, associate general counsel for Merced Capital L.P. The trustees each earned $40,148 in 2021 and that is expected to increase to $49,345 each this year.

At the same time, she cautioned that my status as a transgender woman likely would generate some strong negativity, and given that, she would understand if I wanted to pass on running. Despite my reservations, I told the woman that I would think about it. As I did that mulling, I became concerned that any negativity directed at me might traumatize the queer kids that I had talked with. The last thing I want is to add to another human’s suffering. I reached out to several leaders in the LGBTQ+ community and asked if they thought my candidacy would cause secondary trauma in young queer humans. Uniformly, they replied that any trauma would be outweighed by the simple fact that me running for school board would demonstrate courage from which queer kids could gain strength. On top of this, there was another confidant who, when confronted with the question of whether I should run, responded with, “What would Bobby tell you to do?” Frankly, that was a cheap shot channeling one of my most precious heroes, Bobby Kennedy. But the response certainly nudged me. Still, I wasn’t totally convinced about running. That changed after I sat in a Chaska living room with 20 strangers, where I gave a very rough stump speech that was well received. I repeatedly heard, “We think you should run, and we think you can win.” While that buoyed my spirits, the clincher came later that evening when a young woman, maybe 19n years old, came up to me as the strangers moved from living room folding chairs to kitchen breakfast bar stools and munchies. The young woman was shaking and appeared on the verge of tears. I thought, What did I say wrong? Instead of criticism, what I heard was affirmation. “Ellie, I hope that you run for school board. I graduated last year and never felt that I could come out as lesbian,” she whispered. “Only this summer did I finally feel brave enough to come out to my mother.” The young woman began to cry. Between the tears, she went on. “But if you run, kids will feel safer in coming out. It will be different for them; you will spark their courage.” The young woman’s tears became more intense. I had no idea that simply running for something like a school board position could be that meaningful to someone. It was a vivid reminder of how we humans can ripple to each other. I hugged the young woman and thanked her for talking to me. I said that I would seriously consider running. That was a lie. Because of what she had said, I had just made the decision. Recently I filed papers to run for the District 112 school board. I will be one of at least 11 candidates vying for four open seats. Wish me luck. I will try my best to ripple.

The kinds of news coverage provided, the style of writing used to tell stories, the look and design of the pages, the technology that brings it all together – it’s all changed in some way, shape or form. And yet the things that have always been at the heart of this newspaper – like its dedication and service “to the betterment and general upbuilding of the community,” as one of Detroit Lakes’ first great newspapermen, George D. Hamilton, once said – have never changed. Dating back to the late 1800s, when the Detroit Lakes Tribune was named the Detroit Record, the front pages were dominated by non-local news. Unlike the front pages of today’s papers – which feature a select few hyper-local stories about the community’s people, places, events and issues, the fronts of those pioneer-era papers were packed with many short stories about news from around the world. The look and design of the front pages was quite different from today’s papers, too, with all those little short stories piled one on top of another in vertical columns that ran the length of the page – usually with advertisements mixed in, too. Papers then were black-and-white, and there were few artistic or visual elements (photographs weren’t commonly used in rural newspapers until decades later). The front pages of today’s papers, by contrast, are far more tailored to the eye, with large, colorful photos and other visual design elements like subheadlines, pull quotes, and the use of “white space” to break up text blocks and create separation between articles. In a November 1898 edition of The Record, the front page was dominated with stories about the Spanish-American War, with headlines like “Have Faith” and articles that talked about how the Spaniards were poised to accept the terms of the U.S. government. Other front page stories addressed the gold rush in Washington, fighting in Korea, and plans for the future of Cuba. The sparse local news on the front page mostly centered on meeting times for community groups, such as the Masons and Odd Fellows. ADVERTISEMENT On average in those early days, the newspapers were 8 pages long. Local news was minimal on the inside pages, just as it was on the fronts. Among the few local news bits contained inside that November 1898 edition was an editor-written recap of who had recently visited town, who had traveled out of town, and what events had occurred or were about to occur – one of which was “swearing-off day.” “Tomorrow evening many a man will take his last drink and smoke his last smoke – until Sunday, earlier or later. Tomorrow will be wholesale swearing-off day,” editor G. D. Hamilton wrote in that recap. The happenings of local residents continued to be reported in this sort of casual, ‘kitchen table’ manner until at least the mid-1900s; by that era, the newspaper was published under the moniker of Detroit Herald. For decades, the paper’s front pages remained focused on national or worldly news. Early newspapers were often done entirely by one person, which left little time for local reporting. But that focus began to slowly shift over time. A June 1921 edition, for example, included within its mix of global headlines a front-page article about local Memorial Day observations, and a story about the first livestock meeting of a newly-formed local breeders association. There was also a rundown of local athletic competitions between Detroit and Perham, even featuring an artist’s drawing of the teams in battle. As the years progressed, local news stories continued to increase in frequency, and eventually they overtook world news as the dominant coverage. That evolution was seen at newspapers all over the country, as the industry strove to meet changing needs and demands: a growing number of unique communities were being established within states and counties, and thus the demand grew for news relative to those specific communities. There was also a growing interest in the field of journalism, as newspapers largely proved to be successful business ventures and the work proved rewarding, with local newspaper owners, editors and reporters holding positions of influence in their communities. Newspapers were a growing industry that wanted – and could afford – to bring more trained journalists on staff, and the pool of trained journalists to hire from was growing larger. The more journalists on staff, the more unique news coverage a paper could provide; better coverage attracted more readers, which in turn attracted more advertisers, who paid good money to share their messages with the captive audience of the local newspaper. Today, with national and world news easily accessible 24/7 via the internet as well as an abundance of radio and TV news programs, news magazines, and big daily newspapers, smaller community newspapers continue to find success within their unique niche as a source of in-depth, hyper-local news coverage that cannot be found anywhere else. It’s commonplace now to include at least one good photograph with every story – if not for print, then definitely for the story’s online version. ADVERTISEMENT Such was not the case in the early days of the Detroit Record. The use of photographs was costly and time-consuming in the early 1900s, often requiring the creation of a wood engraving to print the image. Thus, photographs were not often included. Occasionally, newspapers would employ an artist to create a drawing or other visual, but that also entailed a cost. It wasn’t until the mid-1900s that the golden age of photojournalism arrived, thanks to advancements in technology that made the process speedier and more affordable – such as a compact camera that featured flash bulbs and the ability to take several pictures with minimal time in-between. Photographs were always a hit with readers, and so when it became possible to include more of them in the newspaper, it became commonplace for cameras, film rolls, and darkrooms to grace newsrooms. Eventually, photojournalists were brought on staff, to capture candid moments and portraits to enhance written stories and tell visual stories of their own. The Detroit Lakes Tribune brought photojournalist Brian Basham on board in 1998. Growing up, he said, he often found himself with a camera in his hands, so his career choice was a natural fit. He applied for the position because the Tribune was utilizing color photographs, as well as black and white, and that was a draw for him. “When I started, we were using film and had dark rooms,” he recalled of those pre-digital days. “The paper had Photoshop the day I got there, so I would take the negative and scan that to bring it into Photoshop,” Basham said, noting that the process was the same for both black and white and color photos. In an average week, Basham would shoot five to 10 rolls of color film, plus a few rolls of black and white. ADVERTISEMENT Those numbers increased exponentially when cameras went digital. “It was December of 2003 when we got our first digital camera there,” Basham recalled. “I still remember the first assignment I shot: I went to a Christmas choir concert – not that exciting for pictures, but I had a new digital camera and I wanted to go use it.” Within a year, the newsroom in Detroit Lakes shifted almost entirely to digital cameras. Without the need to process and scan film in a dark room, Basham said he was saved about 10 hours of work a week. With that extra time, he took on other duties, such as page layout and writing. Technologies continued to advance, and by the time 2010 rolled around, Basham saw the specialized role of photojournalist begin to shift into a more wide-ranging role – that of a multimedia journalist who takes and edits photographs, creates video, and writes stories. “I’d say by 2012 it became clear that the (photojournalists at) smaller papers needed to know more than just one speciality, and have more than one role,” he said. Basham concluded his career with the Detroit Lakes newspaper in 2016 and moved to the Twin Cities. No matter whether a photo is black and white or in color, was taken yesterday or 100 years ago, Basham said, the most important element of a good photo has been and always will be the same: emotion. If a picture can bring out emotions or make a person feel a certain way, he said, that is key. ADVERTISEMENT No newspaper would be possible without paid ads, legals, and subscriptions. Profits from ads and legals, especially, keep the business going, as those revenues help keep the cost of subscriptions down, allowing more people, of all income levels, to subscribe. Ads have been key to the funding of newsprint since the 1700s. The idea of legal notices being printed in newspapers began with the Acts of the First Session of the Congress of'}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:15 pm Computer with icons One place artificial intelligence, or AI, is making strides is with written text. We’ve all read short articles written by an AI, and most of us didn’t know that an AI wrote the article. For the last several years news outlets have been using bots to generate short, concise news stories. They’re usually four to five sentences long and just state the facts of what/where/who/when happened. These types of AI bots are popular because we have the largest datasets available to train them on. There are millions of coherent examples of writing already digitized, from books to news to opinions on what color you should paint your house. All of those works allow you to train a bot to write coherently about a subject. If you wanted to have a bot that could write about dinosaurs you could feed it every book you have about dinosaurs as well as every Wikipedia article on them and any news article you could find on them. The bot could read all of that text in just a few seconds and be ready to write about dinosaurs immediately. There are other ways to train these bots too though. Years ago Microsoft famously made a chat bot on Twitter that would learn from what people tweeted at it and respond with ideas based on those tweets. It was a short-lived experiment because people were able to get that bot to start tweeting racist and antisemitic responses within a day of the bot being turned on. A new AI chatbot has recently become popular and it’s very impressive. The new bot is called ChatGPT (the GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer), made by openAI. They’ve trained ChatGPT on everything that a person might write. You can ask ChatGPT for help with programming. You can feed it an article and ask it to write a humorous response to that article. You can ask it to write a 500-word essay on just about any subject. It writes with correct grammar and confidence. It’s so good it can be difficult to spot a paragraph written by a person and one written by ChatGPT. One good way to determine if something was written by ChatGPT is if the text is confident, but confidently wrong. ChatGPT is wrong about a lot of the “facts” that it presents in its responses. If you’re an expert on the topic being discussed spotting ChatGPT responses can be pretty easy. It’s wrong enough that several prominent question-and-answer forums that rely on user responses have banned the use of the bot because its answers are not useful most of the time. Another tell is that ChatGPT is often rather verbose. This can be useful if you’re asking it to write an essay for you to turn in (don’t do this, each person has a specific writing style and your teacher/professor will catch it). It’s not as useful if you’re trying to pass off a ChatGPT answer as your own in an online forum. Most people aren’t going to take the time to write several paragraphs in response to someone else in an online forum. You can try it for yourself. You’ll find ChatGPT if you Google it. It’s free to use right now and despite the drawbacks I just mentioned it’s very impressive. These kinds of bots will only get better in the future and I look forward to seeing how sophisticated they can become. — Jason Ogaard is a software engineer who formerly lived in Hutchinson.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:31 pm Longtime newspaper columnist and philanthropist, Val Imm, who grew up in Mankato, speaks in 2007 at Bethany Lutheran College. Imm died Monday in Dallas. She was 93. MANKATO — Val Imm’s first newspaper job was in her hometown, working for her father. The Mankato native later moved to Dallas and worked for many years as a society columnist. On a terrible day in 1963, she took on the journalistic role of linking the public to information about John F. Kennedy’s death. “Aunt Val told AP, AP told Walter Cronkite and Walter Cronkite told the world,” said nephew Andrew Imm from his home in Texas. Val Imm died Monday in Dallas. She was 93. On Nov. 22, 1963, The Times-Herald in Dallas sent Imm to cover the president and first lady’s arrival at Love Field. She was in the vicinity of Dealey Plaza when Lee Harvey Oswald opened fire on the presidential motorcade. Her assignment changed. JFK, critically wounded, was rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where Imm found herself at the head of a scramble of reporters waiting for updates on his condition. She spotted a priest leaving the emergency room and asked what was happening behind its closed doors. He told her the president had just died. Imm ran to a phone station in the hospital and called an Associated Press bureau chief’s office in her newspaper’s building. Minutes later, CBS anchor Cronkite relayed the sad news to a shocked nation. During a 2007 visit to Mankato, Imm described her recollections about the day of the assassination and shared several of her life experiences with her audience at Bethany Lutheran College. She had graduated from high school at Bethany, back in the days when the college included a Lutheran-based high school. She later attended Mankato Teachers College. After college she toured Europe, hitting 13 countries before heading home. She found work in New York working for a fashion magazine. She also did some teaching in the Adirondacks. A visit to a sister in Fort Worth resulted in Imm becoming a longtime resident of Texas. She returned often to Mankato. Imm’s 2007 trip home had a purpose. The success of her career and marriage had put her in a position to be philanthropic. She donated a large sum of money to Bethany Lutheran College, money to be used for scholarships to communications, English and religion students. “When you’re there financially, it’s the greatest joy in the world to give it away,” she’d said. During that 2007 visit, Imm met with Bethany Lutheran College students, including some candidates for scholarship money from her endowment. “There’s nothing more energizing,” she said, “than to connect with young people who have the fire in the belly for achievement.” Imm declined to disclose how much money she’d given the college. Imm married Fouad A. Bashour, a cardiologist at the University of Texas Southwest Medical Center. Together they founded the university’s Fouad A. and Val Imm Bashour Distinguished Chair in Physiology. The program was designed to help encourage and foster research by younger faculty members. Andrew Imm said his aunt’s attitude of public service likely stemmed from the teachings of her parents. Imm was given the name “Valerie” at birth; however, she chose to go by the same name as her father. The elder Val Imm had been the editor of Mankato News from 1926 to 1957 and served as a representative and senator in the state Legislature between 1932 to 1965. The main road leading to the MSU campus is named after the longtime editor and legislator. His aunt Val was “always intellectually curious, always learning. Those are good qualities for a journalist,” Andrew Imm said. “And she was one of those people who never met a stranger.” Imm’s newspaper career earned her several awards and lasting friendships with people she met while covering high society events. Her photo collection includes an image of her next to President Lyndon Johnson and another showing Imm and her husband with Jeb and George W. Bush. “They all became my friends,” she said in 2007. “And I have some wonderful friends.” Imm was named Bethany’s 2016 Distinguished Alumni award recipient. Her longtime friends from Mankato include Art Westphal, senior development officer in the college’s advancement department. The two spoke often and, prior to the pandemic, had met annually in Texas. They’d always have a nice dinner and wonderful conversations, Westphal said. “No question about it, she was a most interesting lady. And she was a most generous benefactor for the college.” Westphal recalled his friend’s reaction to a scholarship recipient’s thank you letter. “Val sent the student a personal gift to help with her college expenses.” Imm and Westphal had several phone conversations earlier this year, while they worked to restructure her scholarship donations to Bethany. Monies provided by Imm have been combined into one large scholarship, the Nehemiah Fund. “Unfortunately, she won’t be here when it first goes into effect this fall,” Westphal said. Services for Imm were Friday morning at Sparkman Hillcrest Funeral Home in Dallas. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:48 pm The “Great Pumpkin” is hiding under a sheet at a rural farm in Sturgeon Lake. There are actually several large pumpkins on Jerry Gibson’s farm and their names are Big Bertha, Florence, Albert and Frank. Gibson has grown pumpkins for many years, but only recently began to get serious and enter them in weigh-offs. Last year he entered his first weigh-off and took 13th place at 1,022 pounds. The first place winner was from Lancaster and his weighed 1,990 pounds. Gibson hopes to do better this year. He estimates that two of his pumpkins are already over 1,000 pounds. He doesn’t use your general, garden variety pumpkin seeds to grow these giants. Gibson said all giant pumpkins begin with Dills Atlantic Giant Pumpkin seeds, after that it’s all about the genetics. He explained that professional growers keep a family history of the seeds that they use, similar to dog and horse breeders. “One pumpkin seed can go for up to $450,” Gibson said. He quickly added that his seeds do not. Gibson starts the plants in his greenhouse area. He prepares the garden area, including burying heat tape in the ground, so he can transplant the tender plants early. He planted his giants on May 4 this year. He spends several hours every day caring for them, including feeding them. Once the plants are ready, he performs a controlled pollination. This ensures that the plant’s genetics are intact and it is not accidentally pollinated by an inferior neighboring pumpkin. “I’m not a professional grower,” Gibson said. “They grow pumpkins over 2,000 pounds and mine are only around 1,000.” He added that last year a Minnesota man from Anoka drove his pumpkin to California where it set a new record when it weighed in at 2,350 pounds. The world record was set in 2021 in Italy, according to guinnessworldrecords.com. The great pumpkin weighed in at a whopping 2,703 pounds. Gibson explained that some of the pumpkins are more yellow than the traditional orange because the giant pumpkins are squash hybrids. Gibson pays attention to the daily growth of the giants. They can increase in size up to 50 pounds in a day. If they suddenly slow down, he examines them to see why. Mice recently started nibbling on one of his huge giants. He immediately set mouse traps around it. Gibson keeps his fans updated on the pumpkins progress on his Jerry’s Pumpkin Patch Facebook page. He also invites fans to guess the pumpkins weight at the time of harvest. The closest guess will receive free pumpkins from his Halloween patch that boasts 42 varieties of pumpkins and gourds that are for sale. A few optimists guessed 1,600, 1,970 and even one at 2,150. Gibson will haul one of his giants to the weigh-off at Nowthen Heritage festival giant pumpkin contest on Saturday, Sept. 24, then he is off with a different one to the Anoka Halloween Great Pumpkin Expo on Sunday, Oct. 2 for a weigh-off, then to the final one on Saturday, Oct. 8 at the Stillwater Harvestfest.

MARSHALL — Their signature yellow delivery trucks have been a familiar sight around Marshall for decades. And starting this year, Schwan’s Home Delivery will be using that idea as the company moves forward with a new name. On Friday, Schwan’s Home Delivery announced that it will be changing its name and brand to Yelloh. “We wanted something that hearkened back to our heritage,” said Paul Schwan, executive chairman of Yelloh. The transition to the Yelloh brand is expected to be complete by the beginning of 2023. Current Schwan’s Home Delivery operations will continue as normal while the new Yelloh logo and branding are applied to food packaging, delivery vehicles and more. Yelloh will continue to operate under the ownership of the Schwan family, and remain headquartered in Minnesota, Schwan said this week. “It’s not a change of who we are,” Schwan said. The announcement comes as Schwan’s Home Delivery marks its 70th anniversary as a family-owned food delivery business. “Schwan’s Home Delivery was started in 1952 as a new business model for selling my family dairy’s ice cream,” Schwan said. “Since the beginning, our can-do attitude coupled with a desire to meet people where they’re at is what has made our company so special. As Yelloh, we will continue to operate as the same solutions-focused food delivery service that keeps our customers’ freezers stocked and their families happily fed.” “Bold, courageous change is in our company’s DNA, and evolving from Schwan’s Home Delivery to Yelloh is another exciting step in our journey,” said Joe Kirby, president and CEO of Yelloh.“In addition to evoking our iconic yellow delivery vehicles, Yelloh is a greeting commonly used in place of ‘hello’ between people who are familiar with one another, and it felt right as we continue to evolve our company to meet the needs of our customers. Embracing personal connections that form between our people and the communities we serve has set us apart for seven decades and is our biggest advantage in the highly competitive food delivery marketplace.” In the years since 1952, Schwan’s Home Delivery expanded from selling Schwan’s ice cream to delivering a wide variety of frozen foods to customers.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:37 pm At left: Lions Club member helps out with the Derby Days annual duck race. Middle: A flock of rubber duckies make their way down the Perro River at Bayport’s most competitive duck race. At right: A vintage button from the first Derby Days in 1956 shows the 100 year celebration of the Bayport area. Horses, water sports and a classic parade were part of the 50's celebration. Citizens of the city of Bayport will famously float hundreds of rubber ducks down Perro Creek Sept. 16 and 17 as a way to celebrate their city. While Derby Days will recognize 100 years of Bayport during the weekend events, the city celebration has its own historical roots starting with another centennial celebration. The Bayport Jaycees, a group of young business leaders dedicated to community improvement and personal betterment, were searching for a way to raise funds for the city’s playground facilities. The Jaycees claimed to have three purposes in mind for starting Derby Days: to provide “healthful” entertainment for the children of Bayport by building new playground facilities, to give their members experience in “Jayceeism” and to celebrate the area’s 100th birthday. The first Derby Days took place in the summer of 1956, which marked the 100th anniversary of when the first three settlements along Lake St. Croix formed the city of Baytown in 1856. It wasn’t until 1922 that those settlements would be known as Bayport. The name “Derby Days” comes from original celebration’s series of horse shows and pony rides that took place at the Washington County fairgrounds. Though the Bayport Jaycees intended to “think big” according to a Derby Days flier from 1956, the event only took place that one year. It wasn’t until 2004 that the Derby Days we know today came to be. A small group of community members decided to resurrect the Derby Days of the 1950s and repurpose it to the modern day celebration it is today. That group would later become the Bayport Community Action League, which is now the official organizer of the event. “It was just a group of five or six of us, just regular people,” said Mary Goullette of the Bayport Community Action League. Rubber ducks replaced horses, and Bayport added activities like fireworks, a pet parade and a dance. The Bayport Community Action League has branched out to location organizations like the Lions Club to help out. Goullette believes that Derby Days has found just the right balance of activities to get people to come out and celebrate. “I think that's the beauty of it. We're so small that we can keep the same things going,” said Goullette. 2022’s Derby Days is paying homage to that first Derby Days in 1956 with a cowboy-themed “Party in the Park” featuring the Tim Sigler Band on Friday. It will add a modern touch with trendy food trucks on Saturday. “We’re adding more food trucks this year,” said Michele Hanson of the Afton Bayport Lakeland Lions Club. “We’ll have local folks like Candyland there along with the fireworks.” Just like the first celebration in 1956, Derby Days has been all about celebrating the best of the small town. Goullette describes the celebration as “the flavor of Bayport.” “It’s just put on by people who care about this city,” said Goullette.

The Pizza Ranch construction site on highway 95 has been confirmed. After a decade of unsubstantiated rumors, social media punchlines, and even at least one hoax sign, fantasy is about to become reality — a Pizza Ranch restaurant is officially opening in Cambridge. In what could be called one of the worst-kept secrets in modern-day history for this area, signs went up Friday revealing what had daily been repeated on several community social media sites. The construction taking place along Highway 95 just to the west of Speedway was in fact for the much-talked-about restaurant. It wasn’t until those signs were placed, however, that the city was willing to go on record of confirming the news. “The city typically takes the position that it is up to the owners of the new business to make an official announcement,” City Administrator Evan Vogel said. Vogel added that the purchase of the property, plus construction and building permits are all of public record. He also said there are certain exceptions to this policy, such as when the city is directly involved with the process of opening a new business. He cited the city announcing the eventual opening of the third Kwik Trip on the west side of town as an example, where the city purchased the property from the state solely to turn around and resell it to Kwik Trip. Another example is if a business needed the council to approve the rezoning of property, or a conditional or interim use permit. The restaurant, which features pizza and other options such as chicken, salads, sides, and desserts in a buffet-style offering, has grown from a single restaurant in Iowa to over 200 franchise locations across the Midwest. In addition to the restaurant, however, Cambridge’s franchise will feature a Pizza Ranch Fun Zone Arcade, which offers a wide variety of classic games such as skeeball, basketball shooting, and other games where participants can accrue points towards prizes. A timeline has not been officially announced for when the restaurant is expected to open. Log In Keep it Clean. Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexually-oriented language.

'version': '2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'By Dan Kraker/MPR News The shortage of Native American mental health clinicians is both a professional and a personal issue for Mary Owen. “I’ve struggled with depression myself since high school,” said Owen, a Native American physician in Duluth and associate dean of Native health at the University of Minnesota Medical School. Owen, a member of the Tlingit Nation, grew up in Juneau, Alaska, where “Natives were at the bottom of the pecking order,” she recalled, and the racism she frequently faced made her feel like a second-class citizen. She’s devoted much of her professional career to increasing the number of Native American health care professionals of all kinds. Owen said she’s always struggled finding Native therapists – for her own patients in Duluth, and for herself. “I definitely would be able to relate more to a counselor of color, just our shared history of trauma and marginalization in this country. But I haven’t even been able to find that,” she said. “And then beyond that, someone who could relate to my experiences as an Indigenous woman, as a woman who is always invisible in this country, [I’ve also] never been able to find that.” While exact numbers are hard to come by, there are likely only 200 to 300 Native American psychologists in the entire country, out of a population of several million people. “American Indians are the most underserved and underrepresented when it comes to psychologists to potential population ratio,” said Doug McDonald, professor of clinical psychology at the University of North Dakota, and a member of the Oglala Lakota and Northern Cheyenne tribes. At the same time, there’s a significant need for mental health services in Native communities. According to government estimates, nearly 20 percent of Native American adults have experienced mental illness. The suicide rate for Native teens is more than twice that of white youth. Native people experience serious psychological distress at more than double the rate of the general population. “It has to do with the history that we’ve experienced that we can’t sort of disconnect from,” explained John Gonzalez, a psychology professor at Bemidji State University and a member of the White Earth Nation. “We have generations and generations of folks who have gone through trauma and continue to experience various forms of trauma, and then continue to struggle living in poverty.” And while he stresses that not every Native person will experience negative outcomes because of that, “there’s enough of it in our community where there hasn’t been a lot of healing,” he said. “That’s what has to happen.” Culturally appropriate care For healing to occur in Native American communities, experts stress the importance of providing culturally appropriate mental health care. To help explain why, McDonald tells a story he remembers from graduate school, when a non-Native classmate was trying to help a young Native client. He recalls watching when the girl came in for her third session, and noticing immediately that her hair had recently been cut short. “They sit down and my colleague looks at her and says, ‘Oh, what did you do with your hair? You had such beautiful hair.’ The young Native client burst into tears, gets up, leaves, never comes back,” he said. McDonald explains that some traditional Native people cut their hair when they’re mourning. In this case, he later found out the client’s mother had died. “It was unintentional, what my colleague did, she was caring, she was trying to be helpful. But it was a huge blunder,” he said. For the past 30 years, McDonald has been working to try to reduce the number of those cultural “blunders.” When he received his doctorate in 1992, he estimates there were only 100 Native American psychologists. In response, he started a program at the University of North Dakota called Indians into Psychology Doctoral Education, focused on training more Native American psychologists, and increasing the cultural competence of non-Native providers. The program is written into the federal Indian Health Care Improvement Act, which also provides funding for similar programs at the University of Montana and Oklahoma State University. The progress ever since has been steady, but slow. In the past 30 years, the program at UND has graduated about 30 Native psychologists. That’s the most of any university, but at that rate, McDonald concedes, the program will “never be able to meet the need out there in Indian Country on our reservations and in urban Indian centers.” But some of those graduates are planting seeds to grow even more mental health professionals to serve Native communities. Gonzalez is one of them. He started a program at Bemidji State University last year intended to boost Native American undergraduate students studying psychology. “We meet with them every other week. And it’s basically just a time for them to come together as Native students, to share what’s going on in their lives, talk about what’s happening in class, what’s happening at home and the things that they’re struggling with,” Gonzalez said. There were six students in the initial Indigenous Students in Psychology Training cohort. One of them has already gone on to graduate school. The program is now offering scholarships for up to ten Native American students who major in psychology, through a recent grant from the Blandin Foundation. “Most of these students want to come back home,” Gonzalez said. “They want to come back and provide services in the community.” Traditional healing Jessica Gourneau – one of the first graduates of the Indians into Psychology program at the University of North Dakota – is now clinical director at the American Indian Family Center in St. Paul, which provides a host of services out of an old Indian Health Service clinic on the city’s east side. When she first started more than 20 years ago, Gourneau realized the approach to mental health that she learned in school wasn’t working for her clients, who were often dealing with complex, historical trauma. Bits and pieces worked, but “nothing quite helped people to get to a point of healing,” she said. Now, she said, the center helps people tap into the resiliency and healing that are already within Native people by focusing on traditions, values and ceremonies. “Because we’re noticing that people are begging for this,” Gourneau said. “And they’re benefiting from this.” Two years ago, Gourneau and others successfully lobbied the state legislature to create a program specifically aimed at funding traditional healing for tribal communities. Two million in annual funding now helps ten tribal nations and five urban American Indian organizations across the state incorporate traditional healing practices into mental health and substance use disorder treatments. That process begins the first time people walk into the American Indian Family Center, Gourneau explains. Providers will visit with clients, offer food and try to build a relationship. They don’t just conduct a diagnostic assessment. They also ask about spirituality and cultural identity. “That is an important piece of mental health. So when we get to that, we start talking about that, and give them that space,” she said. If clients are interested, providers will connect them with community elders, including Richard Wright, who works as a spiritual helper at the Indian Health Board in Minneapolis. “One of my first questions is, ‘Where are you from?’ For me, it’s a diagnostic feature,” he said. “That helps me develop a series of questions to determine if they are traditional.” Wright is 73. He speaks slowly, gently. His office is filled with tobacco, sweetgrass and sage – traditional medicines he shares with clients. Being able to reach back into his traditions as an Ojibwe man allows him to “share some of the practices we use in order to heal people,” he said. Wright leads healing circles and ceremonies in the community, which can have profound impacts on people. “I’ve had people come up to me at these healing ceremonies and talk about feeling suicidal, that this helped them stay alive another day,” said Gourneau. “It hits really close to home.

He proclaimed in bold letters that he is “Pro-Gun”! I felt suddenly cold as a chill came over me. Our country has more guns than people! It has not made us safer! Doctors in hospitals are overwhelmed treating patients with gun wounds. The drama has intensified as we keep hearing of “mass” shootings in schools – a parade, a shopping center – leaving us to feel we aren’t safe anywhere. What has caused the violence in our society? And, what can we do to to insure a future where there is peace and reason is applied to solving our problems? There are many aspects of our culture that need to be examined. There is no single solution. One is – that every child born in this country should be “wanted and nurtured.” Children born into a family where there is domestic violence are unlikely to learn kindness and respect for others. Some children suffer from neglect. If they are ignored they won’t feel valued and may find perverse ways of getting attention. Throughout history, women have sought to control their reproductive healthcare. They experimented with self-abortion or relied on amateur help which resulted in the death of many women, which is why Roe v. Wade came into practice. Now that “Roe” has been rescinded, women will be returning to unreliable sources to terminate their pregnancies. Essential to controlling violence in our lives is the role of parents and teachers setting an example of behavior for children. The idea is that through education children can discover not only the world around them, but their own inner potential which will allow them to contribute to family, friends and to the community as they grow. There is a heated discussion today on the “evils” of abortion. We should be focusing on “prevention” – if children are to be “nurtured,” women must be able to choose when they want to be pregnant! The IUD should be readily accessible and the cost should be covered by healthcare to all women who want it. Filed Under: Commentary Your email address will not be published.
