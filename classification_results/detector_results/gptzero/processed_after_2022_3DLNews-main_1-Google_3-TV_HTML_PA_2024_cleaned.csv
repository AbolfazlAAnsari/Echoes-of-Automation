judge in Washington formally postponed Donald Trump\'s March trial on charges of plotting to overturn the 2020 election as a key legal appeal from the former president remains unresolved in the courts. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan on Friday vacated the March 4 trial date in the case brought by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith but did not immediately set a new date. The move opens the door for a separate prosecution in New York, charging Trump in connection with hush money payments to a porn actor, to proceed first. That case has long been seen as arguably the least legally perilous of the four indictments Trump faces, with the alleged misconduct less grave than accusations of mishandling classified documents or plotting to subvert a presidential election. The postponement in Washington comes as a federal appeals court has yet to resolve a pending appeal from Trump arguing that he is immune from prosecution for actions he took in the White House. It is not clear when the three-judge panel might rule, but a ruling in favor of prosecutors that permits the case to move forward is expected to be appealed by the Trump team, likely resulting in additional delays. For both sides, timing is of the essence. Trump, who faces four indictments and 91 felony counts, is looking to push his criminal cases back as he enjoys front-runner status in the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. Smith\'s team, meanwhile, is hoping to be able to prosecute Trump this year before the November election. If Trump is elected while the case is pending, he could presumably order the Justice Department to drop it and could potentially try to seek a pardon for himself. The Washington case had been expected to take place first, but it has been delayed for weeks by Trump\'s appeal on grounds that he is shielded from prosecution — a claim that has been vigorously disputed by Smith\'s team. The appeals court heard arguments on Jan. 9 and appeared skeptical of a Trump lawyer\'s position. Though the court has said it intended to work quickly, it has not yet issued a ruling. The judge in the New York case, the first of four indictments filed against Trump last year, has long resisted defense demands that he postpone the March 25 start date in light of the conflicting trial date in Washington, figuring — correctly — that the former president\'s legal calendar might change as the trial neared. Trump is due back in court in Manhattan on Feb. 15 for a pretrial hearing where final details are expected to be ironed out. All signs point to the New York case starting on time. Trump\'s lawyers and prosecutors have been discussing jury selection procedures with the judge and some witnesses have said they\'ve been told to be ready to testify. The New York case involves steps Trump allegedly took to hide payments that were made on the Republican\'s behalf to suppress damaging stories before his 2016 win over Democrat Hillary Clinton, namely logging them as legal expenses. While a guilty verdict would give Trump another historic moniker as the first former president convicted of a crime, potentially complicating his campaign to return to the White House, there\'s no guarantee of prison time. Trump critics and rival campaign aides have long bemoaned that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\'s indictment was the first, believing that it helped blunt the political impact of more serious charges that followed because voters tuned out or grew confused by the myriad cases. Bragg has eschewed his case\'s ""hush money"" label, opting in recent weeks to describe it as another Trump ""election interference"" case — albeit, this one involving behind-the-scenes maneuvering during Trump\'s first campaign for the White House in 2016. Trump, meanwhile, faces dozens of felony charges in Florida accusing him of illegally retaining classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. That case is set for trial on May 20 but could still be postponed. Another case in Georgia, brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, accuses him of plotting to overturn that state\'s 2020 election. No trial date has been set. Copyright 2024 NPR.

three people, and destroying multiple homes. Daytime aerials from the day after a plane crash that killed three in Clearwater, Florida, show a mobile home park left damaged from several fires. According to the FAA, one person on board the plane and two people on the ground died when the plane slammed into the Bayside Waters Mobile Home Park along U.S. 19 around 7 p.m. RELATED: Audio reveals pilot had engine trouble before crashing into neighborhood killing 3 As many as nine people had been inside the mobile home on Pagoda Drive shortly before the crash, but all but two had left the home, according to the city. Crews were still combing through the wreckage on Friday morning and say they do not know why the plane crashed. SkyFOX flew over the scene of a deadly plane crash at a Clearwater mobile home park Thursday night. When the single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza V-35 plane crashed into the small, close-knit, 55-plus community, it immediately burst into flames. Residents say they heard something like an explosion or a bomb going off. According to city officials, the plane had taken off from Vero Beach earlier in the day. The Clearwater fire chief says there were four homes affected by the crash and fire and at least one home was destroyed. Aaron Mesmer reports Residents inside the neighboring homes were able to make it out safely. READ: Clearwater 16-year-old arrested for fatal shooting of teenager while \'play fighting:\' Police Wayne Smith, a resident of the mobile home community, told FOX 13 that his best friend lived in the home that the plane crashed into, and they had just spent time golfing together. Clearwater first responders said during a late Thursday news conference that ""several"" people on the plane and in mobile homes are dead after a plane crash in a mobile home park. ""It’s the worst possible news anybody could get,"" Smith said. ""We were together and ten minutes later they’re dead. I can’t understand why. I just don’t know. We golf once a week together. We’re just a close-knit family, even though we’re not family. We’ve known each other for a long time, and they were all great, great people and I can’t describe the feeling that I have right now because I just loved them."" READ: Clearwater crews installing emergency alert system across city Witnesses say that the plane did not have its lights on and was coming in at a 45-degree angle before the crash. FAA officials say the pilot reported engine failure and responders on the ground began staging for an emergency landing at Clearwater St. Pete Airport (PIE), before the plane crashed about three miles north of the runway. As of Friday morning, officials were still digging through the wreckage. Clearwater Fire Chief Scott Ehlers said emergency vehicles designed to handle aircraft crashes were quickly re-routed to the scene. ""That\'s critical because those aircraft response vehicles are designed to put large fires out and that was a critical component of maintaining this mobile home park,"" said Ehlers. ""The crews did a phenomenal job of getting the fire knocked down very quickly."" According to Ehlers, firefighters were on scene within seven minutes of the crash, which minimized damage and likely saved lives.

MIDDLETOWN TWP., Pennsylvania (WPVI) -- A man accused of decapitating his father and showing the federal worker\'s severed head during a politically charged tirade online is charged with murder after he was arrested with a gun at a Pennsylvania National Guard base, according to officials and court documents. The gruesome video circulated for hours on YouTube - garnering more than 5,000 views - before it was taken down. Justin Mohn, 32, now is being held without bond, also charged with abuse of a corpse and other crimes, Pennsylvania court documents show. READ MORE: Bucks County man charged with murder after allegedly beheading father, posting video on YouTube Action News has learned that the U.S. Marshals Service investigated Mohn in August of 2023 after he allegedly made a threat against a U.S. District Court Judge. The case was closed that same month. During the online diatribe, Mohn railed against the Biden administration and the border crisis while declaring himself the new acting U.S. president under martial law and decrying his father as a traitor. The victim, Michael Mohn, worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Philadelphia District. ALSO SEE: Why was a revolting YouTube video of a decapitated head left online for hours? The video was removed over its graphic violence, YouTube said. According to information provided to law enforcement, Mohn held conspiratorial and anti-government views for at least seven years and attempted to recruit people to join his alleged ""Mohn\'s Militia"" on Reddit and Discord, though he did not attract any takers. One Discord server threw him out because of the recruitment attempts, according to ABC News. Mohn also sued the Department of Education three times, most recently in 2022, saying the department and the education secretary failed to inform him of the risks of the student loans he used to pay for college. He also sued his former employer, Progressive Insurance in Colorado, claiming discrimination that the company perceived him as an over-educated male, and deprived him of pay and benefits. In that case, the court ruled in favor of Progressive. Middletown Township Police were dispatched at 7 p.m. Tuesday to Upper Orchard Drive after a report of a deceased male, the Bucks County District Attorney\'s Office said. ""The call to emergency dispatchers came from the victim\'s wife. When officers arrived, they located the male deceased in the bathroom,"" the prosecutor\'s office said in a statement. ""The victim\'s adult son was not present when police arrived and left the area in his father\'s vehicle."" A machete and a large kitchen knife were found in the bathtub, according to the probable cause affidavit. ""Officers also located the deceased male\'s head inside of a plastic bag which was inside of a cooking pot in a first-floor bedroom next to the bathroom,"" the affidavit says. In the affidavit, police cite the video posted on YouTube by Justin Mohn, the son of the victim and alleged killer. READ MORE: Neighbors say Pennsylvania man accused of beheading father was acting \'strange,\' \'unhinged\' In it, the man identifies himself as Mohn and apparently reads from a written statement and at one point holds up what appears to be a bloodied head inside a clear plastic bag. He says his father, who was a federal employee for over 20 years, was a traitor to his country. ""America is rotting from the inside out as far left, woke mobs rampage our once prosperous cities,"" he says in the video. Investigators also found ""clear rubber gloves with what appeared to be blood on them."" After viewing the YouTube video, investigators confirmed ""the gloves, decapitated head, and room are the same as depicted in the video,"" the affidavit says. YouTube in a statement Wednesday told CNN it ""has strict policies prohibiting graphic violence and violent extremism."" ""The video was removed for violating our graphic violence policy and Justin Mohn\'s channel was terminated in line with our violent extremism policies. Our teams are closely tracking to remove any re-uploads of the video,"" it said. After fleeing the home, Mohn drove more than 100 miles, then broke into a Pennsylvania National Guard base with a gun, said state Department of Military and Veterans Affairs spokesperson Angela Watson. He was taken into custody at the Fort Indiantown Gap base - home of the Pennsylvania National Guard headquarters - shortly after 9:25 p.m. Tuesday, Watson said. ""He was armed at the time but did not resist arrest,"" Watson said. It\'s unclear what connection, if any, Mohn has to the base. He was not in the National Guard, Watson said. It\'s not clear whether Mohn has an attorney. He was arraigned early Wednesday morning. A judge ordered him held without bond, court records show. His next hearing is set for February 8. The victim\'s employer is ""deeply saddened about the tragic death of our teammate Michael Mohn,"" the Army Corps of Engineers Philadelphia District said in a written statement.

The vandalism is the latest twist in the saga of the three-tower project across the street from where the Grammy Awards will be hosted Sunday, the Crypto.com Arena — which is near the Los Angeles Convention Center and the L.A.

The towers were going to house a hotel and luxury condos, but the project stalled in 2019 when the Beijing-based developer ran out of money, the Los Angeles Times reported. City officials say the graffiti is not there to stay. The Police Department’s Central Division said in a social media post that officers met with the property management and representatives of the area’s City Council district to collaborate on efforts to better secure the property. “The measures will be implemented immediately and the graffiti will be removed,” it said. Taggers were reported to be seen at the property repeatedly this week, according to the police department. A police helicopter crew spotted more than a dozen people trespassing and possibly spray-painting the building at 12:43 a.m. Tuesday, the statement said. Two men, ages 35 and 25, were arrested by patrol units, issued citations and released. On Thursday, suspects were reported spray-painting a site on the 30th floor and officers were told the suspects fled in a vehicle. Officers ultimately stopped the vehicle and cited the driver for failure to yield, police said. The passenger was questioned and released. Submit Δ Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

carried out a series of retaliatory airstrikes against Iranian military forces and affiliated militias in both Syria and Iraq tonight. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the military struck dozens of targets at seven facilities. These U.S. attacks come six days after a drone strike on an American base in Jordan that killed three U.S. troops and injured at least 40 more service members. President Biden has said the response will continue. Well, NPR's Jane Arraf is in the Iraqi capital tonight. She is in Baghdad. And, Jane, tell us - what do you know? JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise. Well, the strikes took place in Iraq's western Al Anbar province, which is about - the main city there, al-Qaim, is about 250 miles from Baghdad, so in quite a remote area, as well as across the border in Syria. The U.S. military said they were targeting Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and militias affiliated with it. And they say they hit more than 85 targets, including command and control operations, intelligence bases and heavy weapons depots. Tribal security officials on the Iraqi side of the border said the strikes included missile warehouses in the border city of al-Qaim and airstrikes on Akashat in the middle of the Anbar desert, where Iraq's Iran-backed militias maintain one of their main bases. Across the border in Syria, the Imam Ali base, constructed by Iran and its proxies near the city of Abu Kamal, was also hit. KELLY: And when you say a base constructed by Iran and Iranian proxies, what groups specifically are being targeted here? ARRAF: Well, the main player here, apart from direct Iranian forces, is Kata'ib Hezbollah. It's a militia that's perhaps the most powerful of those that are part of the anti-U.S. resistance, as it calls itself - a group - a coalition, basically - that had been around for some years but has been revitalized since the war in Gaza. Kata'ib Hezbollah is at the center of a lot of this. The U.S. said the airstrike on its base in Jordan, which killed three service people, bore the fingerprints of the group. But it's also very much aimed, directly, in a sense, at Iran, although obviously not in Iranian territory, because they've been hitting bases where the IRCG Quds Force, the elite unit of Iran's, basically, expeditionary paramilitary, which works with militias in Iraq - operates. And they've been hitting a strategic area along that border, strategic both to the Iranian militias, the pro-Iranian militias - sorry, Iran-backed militias, let's say - that use it and strategic for the U.S. It's where the U.S. fought some of its fiercest battles against al-Qaida and ISIS. And it's where Iran-backed militias moved in to fight ISIS in 2014 and never left. KELLY: Yeah. So you're describing this border area. It's strategic. It is far from Baghdad, where you are. Just speak to how destabilizing these strikes could be in a region that is already so on edge. ARRAF: Extremely destabilizing. It's a very delicate balance, as you know. Iraq almost instantly condemned these strikes as an attack on its sovereignty. And, interestingly, the U.S. noted that the airstrikes were carried out in part by long-range bombers flown from the United States. That would be a move that would be aimed at avoiding some of the expected repercussions had the U.S. used bases in Iraq to carry out those strikes. Now, Iran says it's not responsible for the militias launching attacks, but the militias, though, do have clear ties to Iran. And both Iran and the coalition of groups attacking the U.S. have made clear that these attacks will continue until the war in Gaza stops. KELLY: All right.

will see his shadow, the National Weather Service says the groundhog is wrong slightly more than he is right. PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. - Every Feb. 2, America turns to the town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, for a sliver of hope that the cold winter will end sooner rather than later. That is where a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil is roused from a stump on Gobbler’s Knob each year. Legend has it that if the large rodent sees his shadow, six more weeks of winter weather are ahead. If not, spring will arrive early. WILL PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL SEE HIS SHADOW FRIDAY ON GROUNDHOG DAY? The animal prognosticator has been at it since the 1880s. Records kept by the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club show Phil has predicted 108 continued winters and only 21 early springs as of 2024. According to the Stormfax Almanac, that works out to a 39% accuracy rate for Phil. In the near term, the groundhog’s accuracy rate is slightly worse. According to the NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, Phil has been right about 30% of the time over the past decade. Groundhog handler AJ Derume and Punxsutawney Phil, who saw his shadow, predicting a late spring during the 137th annual Groundhog Day festivities on February 2, 2023 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Groundhog Day is a popular tradition in the United St ANIMALS OTHER THAN PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL THAT WILL TRY TO PREDICT END OF WINTER ON GROUNDHOG DAY In 2021, Phil predicted more winter. According to NOAA, his forecast was about half right. February 2021 was the coldest since 1989, but March turned out to be warmer than average. Phil saw his shadow again in 2022, which meant another prediction of a continued winter. NOAA experts said he again missed the mark. While February was slightly colder than average, March's temperatures were much warmer than average. Phil's prediction of another long winter in 2023 was half-correct, according to NOAA. The contiguous U.S. experienced above-average temperatures in February, but slightly below-average temperatures in March. LINK: Get updates to this story on FOXWeather.com.

(AP) — The Democrats’ first primary of the 2024 presidential contest contained little mystery. South Carolina propelled President Joe Biden to the Democratic nomination four years ago and had little trouble besting token opposition on Saturday. What was at really stake for Biden was the depth of support he received from Black voters. They made up half the party’s primary electorate in the state in 2020 and gave him a resounding victory, a win he rewarded by moving South Carolina to the front of the party’s nominating process. In the general election, Biden was backed by 91% of Black voters nationwide, according to AP VoteCast. Whether he ulitmately enjoys a similar level of support this year has implications far beyond South Carolina. Biden’s support among Black voters has waned considerably since he assembled his winning coalition four years ago. His approval rating among Black adults is 42% in the latest Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll, a substantial drop from the first year of his presidency. That’s a potentially troubling sign as he prepares for a rematch against former President Donald Trump, the overwhelming favorite to win the Republican nomination. Lackluster turnout among Black voters in South Carolina’s primary could signal a broader dip in enthusiasm. Biden will need to energize Black voters in the key swing states of Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. His campaign didn’t take the state for granted. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have been visiting in the lead-up to the primary and have promised to keep advocating for the interests of the Black community. Interviews with a wide array of Democratic-leaning Black voters in South Carolina ahead of Saturday’s primary revealed general support for the president, from early voting centers in Columbia, the state capital, to a historically Black college in Orangeburg to a voter-mobilization event in Charleston. But they also provided warning signs: Voters want Biden to spell out his priorities for a second term while expressing concerns about his age and how he is handling inflation and the economy. Younger Black voters said they want Biden to represent their concerns and to see them prioritized if he wins a second term. Alexandrea B. Moore, a 22-year-old senior at South Carolina State University, said Biden could have been more transparent about the challenges he faced in fulfilling his promise of widespread student loan forgiveness, a plan that ultimately was struck down by the Supreme Court. “If Biden wants to be able to regain the trust of the U.S. citizens, then there does need to be a little bit of transparency on why things didn’t go the way that they were promised to us,” she said. Olivia Ratliff, a 19-year-old sophomore at the college, the state’s only public historically Black college or university, wants to hear Biden focus on education issues, primarily school safety and the teacher shortage. South Carolina school districts reported over 1,600 teacher vacancies at the beginning of the 2023-24 school year, a 9% increase from the year before, according to a report from the South Carolina Education Association. “It’s bad enough we send our children to schools with no teachers, but then they also risk their lives every day going to school,” said Ratliff, an education major. Kailyn Wrighten feels let down by Biden because she thinks his administration has been too quiet on social justice issues stemming from the protests against police violence in 2020. But seeing her mother’s student loan forgiven before Biden’s initial plan was struck down was a relief and something she considers a bright spot for the administration, so she plans to vote for Biden in the primary. A 22-year-old senior at South Carolina State, Wrighten also expressed a frustration shared by most younger voters interviewed — that Biden decided to run for reelection rather than make way for a new generation of Democrats. “This is something we’ve worked up to for 18 years and kind of finally being able to exercise this, and you’re like, ‘This is what I’m left with right now?’” she said. Biden’s faltering attempts to push a broad plan for student loan forgiveness and his handling of the economy came up repeatedly as top-of-mind issues in interviews with more than a dozen voters. Sheridan Johnson cast an early vote for Biden in Columbia. She applauded the fact that his administration reduced some loans, but is hoping for more. “I’m waiting for that to pass because I really need some student loans forgiven,” said Johnson, 53. Biden’s initial plan was struck down by the Supreme Court. The administration then developed a repayment plan set to take effect this month. Under it, borrowers won’t see interest pile up as long as they make regular payments. Inflation remains a major concern. While price hikes have cooled in recent months and the economy is growing, that has not had a significant trickle-down effect on Americans’ outlook or benefited Biden. Laverne Brown, a 69-year-old retiree in Columbia, said Biden needs clear messaging to show voters what he has done to improve the economy and what more he would do if given a second term. “As an American citizen, the message that would make me feel really good is knowing that there’s continued concern for the working people, the people that have really put in … years of working and now are living on a lower income,” she said. She noted that some in the city don’t have access to grocery stores within a reasonable distance, which adds to their financial strains. Age concerns came up frequently in the interviews, and not just among younger voters. Polling has consistently shown a broad lack of excitement about the prospects for a Biden-Trump rematch. The age of the candidates — Biden is 81, and Trump 77 — is among the top concerns. An August AP-NORC poll found that 77% of U.S. adults, including 63% of Black adults, said they believe Biden is too old to effectively serve another term as president. “They’re as old as I am, and to have these two guys be the only choices, that’s kind of difficult,” said Charles Trower, a 77-year-old from Blythewood, South Carolina. “But I would much rather have President Biden than even consider the other guy.” Trower, a veteran, said Biden has implemented changes that improved the quality of life for veterans. Joshua Singleton, a 19-year-old sophomore at South Carolina State, shared the sentiment: “We should have, you know, younger presidents to represent us.” Some of the nation’s most divisive and personal issues — voting rights, abortion and the overdose epidemic — also were among the top talking points for many of the Black voters interviewed. Several noted the failure of Democrats to pass voting rights legislation during the first two years of Biden’s presidency as a response to restrictive laws passed by several Republican-controlled states. Democrats’ slim majority in the Senate was not enough to overcome Republican procedural moves to prevent the legislation from moving forward. “The ability to protect voting rights needs to be expanded,” said Seth Whipper, 74, a former Democratic state representative who was contacted last week by voting rights activists during a community canvassing event in Charleston. “Every state in the nation, every territory should be subject to the Voting Rights Act. It’s just that important.” Biden and Harris have been focusing on the stakes for abortion rights in this year’s election, a message that appeared to resonate with voters. Several wanted to know what a second Biden administration plans to do to protect reproductive rights. “I’m a strong believer in women’s rights. I have a wife. I have a daughter,” said Tony Thomas, who is 71 and cast his ballot at an early voting site in Columbia. “I believe they should have a right not to have the government interfere in their lives.” Fentanyl, which along with other synthetic opioids is the leading culprit in an overdose crisis killing Americans at a record rate, concerns Saundra Trower, a 75-year-old from Blythewood, just outside the state capital. She wants Biden to continue trying to fix it and figure out how fentanyl is flooding the country and why so many people are addicted. “That’s the biggest thing for me,” she said. “There are too many young people and even middle-aged people who are dying from fentanyl.” The voters interviewed were among the most engaged Democrats in the state, taking advantage of early voting opportunities or helping to register and persuade others to get to the polls. Many said they generally supported Biden and would vote for him in the primary and November’s general election, driven by a sense that he was trying to address their concerns. They pointed to'}]"
