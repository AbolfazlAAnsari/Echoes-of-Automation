She did not pull the trigger. Ethan Crumbley, her then-15-year-old son, killed four students at Michigan's Oxford High School in 2021. She was accused of involuntary manslaughter for her failure to heed the warning signs about her son. We have called Steve St. Juliana, who is the father of Hana St. Juliana, the youngest victim in the shooting. She was 14 at the time. Mr. Juliana (ph), welcome to the program. I'm sorry for your loss. STEVE ST JULIANA: Thank you. INSKEEP: What do you make of this verdict? ST JULIANA: I think it's just the first piece of the puzzle in holding people accountable and that accountability leading to change. INSKEEP: I guess we should remind people, if they need to be reminded, of some of the facts in this case. It was considered extraordinary, not only because there was this disturbed individual who opened fire, but because there had been warning signs. He had done violent drawings. He had written desperate messages. And the allegation was that his parents seemed not to act. Do you believe that his parents could have prevented this? ST JULIANA: Oh, absolutely. There was numerous occasions and just small actions that could have avoided this, from both the parents and the school. INSKEEP: The parents and the school - who else do you hold responsible for this? ST JULIANA: Definitely the school. And it's not so much that myself and the families are looking for punishment as much as we're looking for them to acknowledge their mistakes so that they can be corrected, and we can be sure that they're never repeated again. And there were numerous mistakes. INSKEEP: Let's talk about that. What message would you want other parents to receive from this verdict? ST JULIANA: Well, this verdict - it should be a wake-up call to parents, to, you know, pay more attention, to take responsibility, you know, especially within your own family, because nobody else can. And it's - like I said, it's kind of hopefully the first step to making some change. INSKEEP: I suppose we should just note, when someone is a minor, parents have enormous authority, and government officials have somewhat limited authority, in many cases, to act. It is up to the parents in this circumstance and to some extent up to the school as well, right? ST JULIANA: Yeah. It's a combination of both. And depending on the situation - I mean, obviously, the parents have the greater piece of the responsibility there, obviously. But you know, while the child is in school, the schools have greater responsibilities but have become afraid of parents, to be quite blunt. I mean, you know, they tend to not discipline like they used to. But in this case, you had a parent that came in, just kind of ran over the school and refused to take the kid home, and the school just caved instead of doing what they should have. INSKEEP: Mr. Juliana, if I'm not mistaken, you sat through this trial. You've relived these episodes more than once. How are you doing? And how's your family doing? ST JULIANA: That's a tricky question. That's - it's just kind of - we just take it - continue to take it one day at a time. The trial - you know, there's nothing that's going to bring my daughter back. So it's really more about the future with the trials, etc., just trying to wake people up and secure some change that hopefully avoids this in the future. INSKEEP: Is the process helping? ST JULIANA: The - is the process helping? Could you explain that? INSKEEP: I mean, do you feel that the time you've spent in court, the process going forward, re-examining this is, in fact, pushing toward change, leading to change? ST JULIANA: I believe so. I think the verdict that came out today, like I said, is the first step, but it's going to be a very long haul, uphill. INSKEEP: Yeah. Mr. Juliana, thanks so much. ST JULIANA: Thank you. INSKEEP: Steve St. Juliana is the father of Hana St. Juliana, killed at age 14. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. NPR transcripts are created on a rush deadline by an NPR contractor.

There are at least two questions worth considering, the first is legal. Do his actions around the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol bar him from office according to the 14th Amendment? The second question is practical. What would happen if Trump were removed from the ballot? How might his tens of millions of supporters respond? Here\'s Trump at a rally last month. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: And I just hope we get fair treatment, because if we don\'t, our country is in big, big trouble. Does everybody understand what I\'m saying? I think so. (CHEERING) TRUMP: Because they\'ll cover that completely differently. They\'ll cover that in a much different manner. PFEIFFER: University of Chicago law professor Aziz Huq has spent some time thinking about that second practical question. Welcome. AZIZ HUQ: Thanks for having me, Sacha. PFEIFFER: Would you walk us through the arguments for and against removing Trump from the ballot? HUQ: After the Civil War, Congress proposed and the states ratified an amendment to the Constitution that said that anyone who engaged in insurrection or rebellion, or provided assistance or aid or comfort to those, would be disqualified from holding federal offices if they had previously sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution. The argument today is that Section 3, by its terms, covers various actions that former President Trump committed, particularly on January the 6th. President Trump argues that the terms of Section 3 do not apply to his actions because he is not the right kind of official and because what happened on January 6 did not count as an insurrection, at least as far as his actions were concerned. He further argues that if Section 3 is to be applied, it has to be done through a mechanism that Congress creates rather than by the independent actions and decisions of various state authorities. PFEIFFER: So he objects on multiple fronts. Whatever the court\'s ruling eventually is, would that ruling necessarily apply to all the states in terms of whether Trump is off or on the ballot? HUQ: I think the best way to think about this is that the Supreme Court often rules on one specific factual dispute involving parties on one side and on the other side. Technically, the ruling binds only those parties. I suspect that even if technically the ruling in the Colorado case only binds the Colorado secretary of state, nonetheless, it will be taken as a powerful signal of what the law is for other state and federal officials. PFEIFFER: You wrote in Politico that a win for plaintiffs, meaning Trump would be kept off the ballot, would - and we mentioned this earlier - be, quote, ""the beginning of a bloody unraveling of democratic norms."" Why do you say that? HUQ: I think it is easy to think, if you are opposed to former President Trump appearing on the 2024 election ballot, that a ruling from the Supreme Court will end the dispute, the public debate over Trump\'s candidacy in 2024. Even if the court rules, that is almost certainly not going to be the end of the matter. In the past few years, we\'ve seen an increase in people\'s expressed willingness to commit acts of political violence. We\'ve seen, particularly in the last couple of months, debate about whether state officials are under an obligation to follow instructions from the Supreme Court. And as we saw in 2020 and 2021, there are often questions about how electors in the Electoral College for president can or should behave. PFEIFFER: It sounds like you\'re saying that some people, primarily conservatives or Republicans, might resist. They might defy the order, particularly at the state level. HUQ: I think it would be very surprising if the court rules that Trump is barred from the ballot. I think it would be even more surprising if such a ruling did not spark open and active opposition from the general public who are sympathetic to former President Trump, from state officials and from the people who are involved in the counting and certification of the general election in November 2024. PFEIFFER: By the way, did I just hear you say you think it\'s unlikely that the Supreme Court will rule to keep Trump off the ballot? HUQ: I think that the Supreme Court is unlikely to rule that President Trump is disqualified, even from the Colorado ballot. PFEIFFER: There is a conservative legal thinker named David French who writes a column for The New York Times, and he makes the argument that the consequences of not disqualifying Trump would be even worse. He says If Trump runs and loses, we could see a repeat of January 6, the attack. And if he wins, he could use the government to go after his political enemies. What do you say about that argument? HUQ: I think it is completely correct to say, as David French has said, that whatever pathway the country takes between now and, let\'s say, mid-2025 is one characterized by a very high risk of political violence. Part of that risk is the violence that might follow from supporters of the former president venting their rage at an outcome that they don\'t like, whether that\'s a court decision or whether it\'s an electoral result. Part of that political violence might be the misuse of official power by people who don\'t think that public expression of democratic preferences is OK when those preferences don\'t align with their views. We are in a world in which there is a greater appetite for political violence among both individuals out in the general public and also people who work for the state in various capacities where they have the right to use force. And under those conditions, it is really hard to see how we navigate the next couple of years without some kind of serious political violence. So... PFEIFFER: Either way, no - you think that whether or not he\'s on the ballot, there\'s a risk of political violence? HUQ: I think that the conditions that are creating, that are pushing political violence to the surface are going to exist regardless of the particular sequence of events that lead up to the 2024 election. I have a really hard time seeing how - any pathway in which political violence is not a substantial risk. PFEIFFER: That\'s University of Chicago law professor Aziz Huq. Thank you for your time. HUQ: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF ELMIENE AND BADBADNOTGOOD SONG, ""MARKING MY TIME"") Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. NPR transcripts are created on a rush deadline by an NPR contractor.

The Clayton County Medical Examiner’s Office said Tuesday that newborn Treveon Taylor Jr.’s cause of death was a “fracture dislocation with complete transection (to the) upper cervical spine and spinal cord.” His death was caused by shoulder dystocia, arrest of labor and fetal entrapment in the birth canal. It also said pregnancy-induced diabetes and premature rupture of membranes contributed to his death. The medical examiner’s office said Treveon’s death was caused by the “actions of another person.” The newborn’s mother, 20 year-old Jessica Ross, went into labor at Southern Regional Medical Center on July 9 and reported experiencing complications during the birthing process. According to a lawsuit filed on behalf of the newborn’s parents in August, the baby’s shoulders got stuck in the vaginal canal, at which point a doctor allegedly performed a cesarean section too late and applied “excessive tension” on the baby’s head, causing it to detach from the body. The lawsuit claims the doctor did not tell the mother and father what had happened. Instead, hospital staff allegedly refused to let them hold the baby after death, the lawsuit claims. They showed the parents Treveon wrapped tightly in a blanket with his head propped on top, a statement said. It also says staff pressured the couple to cremate the remains and told them an autopsy wasn’t warranted. The family alleges they were not made aware of the decapitation until they received a concerning phone call from the Willie A. Watkins Funeral Home. “I just felt a sense of urgency to say, ‘Hey, listen, this is not right. Never seen it before,’” said Sylvania Watkins, the funeral home’s general manager, in August. Watkins found it peculiar to receive a decapitated baby from a hospital and not the medical examiner’s office or law enforcement. “With the body and the head being detached, we should have retrieved this body from the coroner’s office. When that did not happen, that’s when I said we need to reach out and back up and do it right,” Watkins said. The medical examiner’s office was alerted to the dead infant’s condition by the funeral home, launching an investigation into the matter shortly after. In August, Southern Regional shared the following statement, adding that they were not able to discuss details surrounding the birth due to HIPAA laws: Our heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with the family and all those impacted by this tragic event. Our prayers also remain with the dedicated team of physicians, nurses and staff at Southern Regional Medical Center who cared for this patient. As our deepest sympathies remain with the family, Southern Regional Medical Center denies the allegations of wrongdoing in the Complaint referencing the hospital. Due to patient privacy laws and HIPAA, we are unable to discuss the care and treatment of specific patients, but we can state this unfortunate infant death occurred in utero prior to the delivery and decapitation. The hospital voluntarily reported the death to the Clayton County Medical Examiner’s Office and is cooperating with all investigations. Since this matter is in litigation, we cannot provide additional statements. The medical examiner’s office said it will be up to the district attorney whether formal charges relating to the homicide investigation will be filed. Copyright 2024 WANF via Gray Media Group, Inc.

Just minutes after the Democratic president’s remarks at the White House, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell emerged from a GOP luncheon at the Capitol and acknowledged that the deal was dead. “It looks to me and to most of our members that we have no real chance here to make a law,” the Kentucky Republican told reporters. The split-screen moments in Washington represented a rapid turn of events that showed McConnell’s slipping control of his GOP conference, Trump’s growing influence, and Biden’s ability only to look on as a cornerstone of his foreign policy — halting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s advance into Europe — crumbled in Congress. Out of funds, the Pentagon is sending no more arms shipments to Kyiv just as the war — entering its third year — reaches a critical juncture. Ukraine is struggling with ammunition and personnel shortages while Russia is on the offensive, mounting relentless attacks. “Every week, every month that passes without new aid to Ukraine means fewer artillery shells, fewer air defense systems, fewer tools for Ukraine to defend itself against this Russian onslaught,” Biden said. “Just what Putin wants.” Biden had engaged for months with Senate leaders on a carefully negotiated plan to pair policies intended to curb illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border with $60 billion in wartime aid for Ukraine. The bill was intended to exhibit American strength around the world and would have also sent tens of billions of dollars more for Israel, other U.S. allies in Asia, the U.S. immigration system and humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza and Ukraine. But after Republicans rejected the compromise, the president and Senate leaders are now stranded with no clear way to advance aid for Ukraine through Congress. They have run into a wall of opposition from conservatives — led by Trump — who reject the border proposal as insufficient and criticize Ukraine funding as wasteful. Biden laid blame for the bill’s demise squarely on Trump — his likely Republican opponent in the November presidential election. “For the last 24 hours he’s done nothing, I’m told, but reach out to Republicans in the House and the Senate and threaten them and try to intimidate them to vote against this proposal,” Biden said. “It looks like they’re caving. Frankly, they owe it to the American people to show some spine and do what they know to be right.” Democrats in the Capitol vented frustration at their colleagues as it became clear that the deal was done. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer cast Tuesday as a “gloomy day here in the United States Senate” during a floor speech in which he scolded Republicans for backing away from the deal. He still dared them to vote against border security — an issue they have long championed. “After months of good faith negotiations, after months of giving Republicans many of the things they asked for, Leader McConnell and the Republican conference are ready to kill the national security supplemental package even with border provisions they so fervently demand,” Schumer said. Senators are still floundering for a way to get Ukraine funding through the Republican-controlled House. And after the border compromise collapsed Tuesday, some suggested jettisoning that portion from the package and advancing the aid for U.S. allies on their own. But that idea also faces resistance in the Republican-controlled House, where House Speaker Mike Johnson is under pressure from hardline conservatives not to bring any Ukraine funding up for a vote. When asked about wartime aid for Ukraine and Israel Tuesday, he told reporters, “We have to deal with these measures and these issues independently and separately.” House Republicans on Tuesday night failed to pass a separate $17.6 billion package of military aid for Israel. Hardline conservatives opposed the bill because the funding would not be offset by budget cuts in other areas. Democrats were also mostly opposed because it undermined the push for a comprehensive package that would include Ukraine and other allies in Asia. The lack of a national security deal will loom large over Biden’s Friday meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Biden plans to underscore to Scholz that he remains committed to providing Ukraine the funding it needs to continue to repel the nearly two-year-old Russian invasion. McConnell said in an earlier floor speech that it was essential to assert American strength in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, yet also blamed Biden for not responding sooner to threats from rival powers. “Either we confront challenges we face with clear strategy and firm resolve or we lose,” McConnell said. But he reacted with frustration when he was later asked by reporters whether he misread his colleague’s demands for border policy. “I followed the instructions of my conference, who were insisting that we tackle this in October,” he said. “I mean, it’s actually our side that wanted to tackle the border issue. We started it.” After Trump excoriated the compromise, however, the longtime Republican leader has not been able to convince his conference to support the proposal. Within hours of the bill’s release Sunday, Johnson said he would not support it, and even GOP senators who had been supportive of the border policies under discussion came out against the bill on Tuesday. “The politics of this were a big factor,” said Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican. “When the speaker said basically the Senate bill is dead on arrival. And then President Trump weighs in and discourages Republicans from voting for it.” In light of their refusal to support the bill, some congressional Republicans have shifted to blaming Biden, suggesting that he already has the authority to halt the flow of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, a vast oversimplification of the matter. The Trump campaign said in a statement that “America does not need a ‘border’ bill that does nothing to deter illegal immigration. We need a President who will use his executive authority to shut the border down.” The border proposal represented one of the most conservative and comprehensive proposals in decades to emerge from a bipartisan negotiation in Congress. It would seek to tamp down the historic number of illegal border crossings by making the asylum process tougher and faster. Presidential administrations would also be given authority to deny migrants from claiming asylum at the border if the number of migrants claiming asylum becomes unmanageable for authorities. Biden called the proposal “the most fair, humane reforms in our immigration system in a long time, and the toughest set of reforms to secure the border ever.” But Republicans have largely heeded the wishes of Trump to reject the bill because it would show that Biden could act to address problems at the border, which is seen as one of his largest vulnerabilities in his reelection campaign. “Americans will turn to the upcoming election to end the border crisis,” said Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming in a statement. But Biden too suggested he would make the Republican rejection of border policies a campaign issue, saying, “I’ll be taking this issue to the country and the voters are going to know that.” ___ Associated Press writer Darlene Superville contributed.

After GOP senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer tried to push ahead to a crucial test vote on a $95 billion package for Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies — a modified package with the border portion stripped out. But a deeply divided Republican conference was scrambling to find support for the wartime funding, even though it has been a top priority for Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. It was the latest sign of the longtime Republican leader’s slipping control over his conference and underscored how the traditional GOP tenet of robust foreign involvement is giving way to Donald Trump’s “America First” nationalism. At stake is the future of Ukraine’s defense against Russia. The Senate floor settled into an hours-long stall Wednesday night as Republicans huddled to see if they could gain the votes necessary to push it through the chamber. Schumer then closed the floor, saying he would “give our Republican colleagues the night to figure themselves out” ahead of a crucial test vote Thursday. Republicans planned to meet in the morning to plot a path forward. Some GOP senators have grown skeptical of sending money to Ukraine in its war with Russia, but Schumer warned earlier Wednesday that “history will cast a permanent and shameful shadow” on those who attempt to block it. “Will the Senate stand up to brutish thugs like Vladimir Putin and reassure our friends abroad that America will never abandon them in the hour of need?” Schumer asked as he opened the Senate. The roughly $60 billion in Ukraine aid has been stalled in Congress for months because of growing opposition from hardline conservatives in the House and Senate who criticize it as wasteful and demand an exit strategy for the war. “We still need to secure America’s borders before sending another dime overseas,” Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah wrote in a post on X. The impasse means that the U.S. has halted arms shipments to Kyiv at a crucial point in the nearly two-year-old conflict, leaving Ukrainian soldiers without ample ammunition and missiles as Russian President Putin has mounted relentless attacks. Ukraine’s cause still enjoys support from many Senate Republicans, including McConnell, but the question vexing lawmakers has always been how to craft a package that could clear the Republican-controlled House. A pairing of border policies and aid for allies — first proposed by Republicans — was intended to help squeeze the package through the House, where archconservatives hold control. But GOP senators — some within minutes of the bill’s release Sunday — rejected the compromise as election-year politics set in. Many Republicans said the compromise wasn’t enough and they would rather allow the issue be decided in the presidential election. Supporters of the bill insisted it represented the most comprehensive bipartisan border proposal in years and included many Republican priorities. The vote failed 49-50 — far short of the 60 ayes needed to take up the bill — with four Republicans voting to move forward with the legislation and six Democrats, some of whom said the border compromise went too far, voting against it. The bipartisan group of senators who negotiated the compromise for the last four months said it was a missed opportunity to try to make some progress on one of the most intractable issues in American politics. In a speech on the Senate floor just before the vote, Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, who crafted the proposal, said it was a chance for the Senate to decide “if we’re going to do nothing, or something.” “It’s an issue that’s bedeviled, quite frankly, this body for decades,” Lankford said. “It’s been three decades since we’ve passed anything into law to be able to change border security.” Independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona blamed Republicans for not giving the bill a chance. “Finally, it seemed, we had the opportunity to solve the nightmare my state has lived for over 40 years,” she said, scolding Republicans for using the border for “campaign photo ops” but rejecting the chance to enact law. “Turns out they want all talk and no action,” she said. “It turns out border security is not a risk to our national security. It’s just a talking point for the election.” The White House said President Joe Biden believes there should be new border policy but would also support moving the aid for Ukraine and Israel alone, as he has from the start. “We support this bill which would protect America’s national security interests by stopping Putin’s onslaught in Ukraine before he turns to other countries, helping Israel defend itself against Hamas terrorists and delivering life-saving humanitarian aid to innocent Palestinian civilians,” said White House spokesman Andrew Bates. The standalone $95 billion package would invest in domestic defense manufacturing, send funding to allies in Asia, and provide $10 billion for humanitarian efforts in Ukraine, Israel, Gaza and other places. The revamped package includes legislation to authorize sanctions and anti-money laundering tools against criminal enterprises that traffic fentanyl into the U.S. A separate section of the compromise border legislation that would have provided a long-awaited pathway to residency for tens of thousands of Afghan refugees was dropped in the slimmed-down bill. Still, it was not clear whether the new plan, even if it passed the Senate, would gain support from House Speaker Mike Johnson. House Republicans are still insisting on a border plan, even though they rejected the deal negotiated in the Senate as insufficient. “We’ll see what the Senate does,” Johnson told reporters Wednesday morning. “We’re going to allow the process to play out.” Some were skeptical that a standalone aid package would be viable in the House. “I don’t see how that moves in this chamber.

Trump has also led many Republicans to question supporting Ukraine, suggesting he could negotiate an end to the war and lavishing praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin, including after Moscow’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Johnson said this week he wanted to handle wartime aid for Israel and Ukraine in separate packages, but a bill he advanced that only included funds for Israel failed on the House floor Tuesday night. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries was still hoping the House could take up the comprehensive package next week. “That is the only path forward,” he said. __ Associated Press writers Lisa Mascaro and Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.

(WFLA) — At least six people are missing, including children, after two officers were shot while responding to a suburban Philadelphia home that was then set ablaze, according to NBC Philadelphia. “Our fear is there may be multiple people inside that home who have died,” Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer said. “We are hopeful that that is not true.” Delaware County officials said police were called to Baltimore Pike and Lewis Avenue in East Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, for a report of an 11-year-old girl that had been wounded by gunfire, according to reports. Officers immediately came under fire and two were wounded, officials said. Both were reportedly taken to Penn Presbyterian Hospital. One was shot in the arm and the other in the leg, and they were in stable condition, said Margie McAboy, director of policy and public engagement for the Delaware County District Attorney’s Office. At a news conference Wednesday evening, officials said both officers are expected to be “perfectly fine.” The officers were dragged out of harm’s way by other officers from Upper Darby. Officials said at a news conference that they don’t know who was in the house, how many people were in there, or if they’re alive. Officers are working to make sure the house is safe before making entry. NBC Philadelphia reported that officials wouldn’t be able to enter the home until Thursday morning because the fire isn’t completely out. Officials are also working to learn if the child was or was not shot. Aerial footage from NBC affiliate WCAU showed a home with its roof destroyed and the second floor fully engulfed in flames. The fire appears to have spread to a neighboring residence. A neighbor reported hearing gunshots before he was ordered out of his home by police. He told reporters he was worried his home would catch fire with his dogs still inside. There’s no word yet on the shooting suspect or the cause of the fire.

The helicopter carrying five Marines that crashed during stormy weather in the mountains outside San Diego was a CH-53E Super Stallion designed to fly through bad weather, even at night. The Super Stallion is the largest helicopter in the military, but every aircraft has its limits, and while every flight for Marines is considered a training opportunity, there is inherent risk, experts say. Now investigators will be looking at whether it was appropriate to send troops into a region being clobbered by a storm of historic proportions. The military confirmed Thursday that all five Marines were killed when their helicopter went down during stormy weather, and efforts were underway to recover their remains. Marine Corps leaders, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and President Joe Biden expressed their condolences. “It is with a heavy heart and profound sadness that I share the loss of five outstanding Marines from 3d Marine Aircraft Wing and the ‘Flying Tigers,’” Maj. Gen. Michael J. Borgschulte, commander of the wing, said in a statement. Authorities say the CH-53E Super Stallion vanished late Tuesday night while conducting a flight training on their way back to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego from Creech Air Force Base, northwest of Las Vegas. The last known contact with the Super Stallion was at about 11:30 p.m. Tuesday, when waves of downpours and snow were hitting the region, Mike Cornette of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection told CBS 8 news. That location was based on a “ping” reported to a Cal Fire dispatch center. Marines fly the model in the “most challenging environments you can think of,” said Timothy Loranger, a former Marine Corps aircraft mechanic and now civilian pilot and lawyer who specializes in aviation crashes. “But even knowing that, it’s important for those making the decisions to decide whether the risk is worth it,” he said. “Here was a training mission with the crew flying back home to Miramar, so you have to ask, why fly in this weather now? Was this poor judgement or some pilot error issue? These are very important questions that have to be asked.” A mechanical issue in bad weather would also make flying even harder. And while the helicopter was designed for bad weather, ice accumulation on rotor blades could disrupt the ability to create lift for the craft and cause it to crash, Loranger said. All this will be part of the investigation, Loranger said, adding that it’s too early to speculate on what occurred. He said the Super Stallion has a long history of being reliable, but it’s not perfect. The craft was discovered Wednesday morning near Pine Valley, an hour’s drive from San Diego. The mountain community is at about 3,700 feet in elevation in the Cuyamaca Mountains, an area that saw as much as 8 inches of accumulating snow within hours Tuesday night and early Wednesday and saw more falling Wednesday night, forecasters said. The area includes San Diego County’s second highest mountain, Cuyamaca Peak, at 6,512 feet, and is also near the Cleveland National Forest, which covers 720 square miles with much of it steep, rocky and with limited trails. Per military policy, the names of the Marines are not released until 24 hours after all next-of-kin have been notified. The five Marines were assigned to Miramar’s Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 361, Marine Aircraft Group 16, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at Miramar. Capt. Stephanie Leguizamon, spokesperson for the wing, said she had little information beyond the statement but noted that recovery efforts were being hampered by snowfall from the storm that was moving out of California on Thursday. “I do know that it's cold ... I know that's been a contentious issue” for searchers in reaching the crash site, she said. Measuring about 99 feet long and weighing up to nearly 35 tons, the CH-53E Super Stallion has been used in combat and other operations around the world for more than three decades, including in Beirut, Somalia, the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, according to a U.S. Navy website. In 2018, four Marines from Miramar died when their Super Stallion crashed near El Centro, near the California-Mexico border, during a training mission. The Marine Corps ruled out pilot error for the accident. The victims’ families later sued two companies they alleged provided a defective part that they blamed for the crash. In 2005, a Super Stallion went down in a sandstorm in Iraq, killing 31 people on board. The accident, blamed on pilot error, was the single deadliest loss of U.S. troops during the war. More than 130 are in operation. Nicknamed the “hurricane maker” because of the downwash from its three engines, the Super Stallion has a range of about 640 miles. It was designed to carry up to 55 troops or about 16 tons of cargo. ___ Associated Press writers Lolita C.

Please enter a search term. by: Alain Poupart Posted: Feb 7, 2024 / 09:00 AM CST Updated: Feb 7, 2024 / 09:00 AM CST Examining where the Miami Dolphins stand at each position heading into free agency by: Alain Poupart Posted: Feb 7, 2024 / 09:00 AM CST Updated: Feb 7, 2024 / 09:00 AM CST The Miami Dolphins are coming off what overall could be considered a successful season, which ended with an 11-6 record and a second consecutive playoff appearance, but there is work to be done for the team to reach the next level. The major first step in the roster-building process will be free agency, which will kick off with the start of the new league year March 13 after the Dolphins go over their season-ending roster and decide how to proceed at each position moving forward. With that in mind, we examine where the Dolphins stand at each position heading into free agency, with contract status of each player, a quick review of the 2023 performance and an analysis of what to expect in the offseason. We continue with the wide receivers. On the roster: Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle, Cedrick Wilson Jr., Braxton Berrios, River Cracraft, Robbie Chosen, Chase Claypool, Erik Ezukanma (ended season on NFI) 2023 season: This pretty much was the Hill and Waddle show, with the former on track to become the first 2,000-yard receiver in NFL history until injuries slowed him in the final weeks. The Dolphins didn't get a ton out of any of the other wide receivers, though Wilson had a nice bounce-back season after being pretty much an afterthought in 2022. Stats that stand out: Hill became the first player in NFL history to produce a second consecutive season with at least 1,700 receiving yards. ... While Hill ranked in the top three in the NFL in catches, targets and receiving yards, he was only 69th in catch percentage (69.6). ... Despite battling injuries most of the season and missing three games, Waddle became the first receiver in team history with a third consecutive 1,000-yard season. ... Hill and Waddle accounted for 59.9 percent of the Dolphins' passing yards. Contract status: Hill is under contract through 2026. Waddle is signed through the 2024 season, though the Dolphins likely will pick up his fifth-year option this spring. Ezukanma is signed through 2025. All the other wide receivers on the roster — Wilson, Claypool, Chosen, Cracraft and Berrios — are scheduled to become unrestricted free agents March 13. Notable pending free agents around the NFL: Mike Evans, Tampa Bay; Curtis Samuel, Washington; Tyler Boyd, Cincinnati; Tee Higgins, Cincinnati; Michael Thomas, New Orleans; Calvin Ridley, Jacksonville; Devin Duvernay, Baltimore Offseason outlook: While Hill has been and should remain the focal point of the passing game, the Dolphins probably would be better served if they could find a more consistent third option at wide receiver. With five pending free agents, the wide receiver group figures to look very different at the start of training camp because it's highly unlikely every one of those players will be re-signed. It's also unlikely that all of them will be gone, so it becomes a question of who will be prioritized, and from this vantage point, we're thinking that Cracraft and Berrios might be at the top of the list. The Dolphins will need to sign other receivers to fill out the roster, but they won't have that much money to spread around considering all their pending UFAs at other positions, so they could be shopping for bargains on the free agent market and also might use the draft to replenish. It also would greatly help if Ezukanma can pick up where he left off last season. Related: Dolphins 2024 Mock Draft Roundup 1.0""}]"
