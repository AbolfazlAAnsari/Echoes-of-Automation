Elway covered several topics during his 20-minute availability, including: What’s the story: The Broncos traded down 10 spots (No. 10 to 20) in last year’s first round, which allowed them to move up in round 2 to draft quarterback Drew Lock. Sitting this week at No. 15, there has been some chatter about the Broncos moving up. Elway said: “We’re preparing ourselves to go either direction. It depends on how it falls. But we’re also looking at going back. We can play around with the scenarios, but really, it depends on who’s available.” Analysis: The question for the Broncos moving up is two-fold — who are they targeting and what will be the cost? It makes more sense to stay put or move down. What’s the story: An average of 13.2 receivers have been selected in the first three rounds of the past 10 drafts. That number could be exceeded this week. Alabama’s Jerry Jeudy and Henry Ruggs III, Oklahoma’s CeeDee Lamb, LSU’s Justin Jefferson and Arizona State’s Brandon Aiyuk could all be first-round picks. Elway said: “It’s kind of what flavor do you like? It’s a very deep draft when it comes to receivers so everybody will obviously have different views on who they think is the best fit for them. It’s hard to say exactly how they’re going to fall, but the good thing and the fortunate thing is, we do need a wideout and it’s a deep class.” Analysis: Who says pre-draft news conferences are void of news? At least Elway admitted what we’ve been thinking all along — the Broncos need to give receiver Courtland Sutton some help. The depth of the class could allow Elway to wait until round 2 to get a receiver. What’s the story: The Broncos have A.J. Bouye at one starting cornerback, but the other spot is uncertain. Bryce Callahan (foot) didn’t play in 2019 and Elway was tepidly optimistic when discussing Callahan’s health because he hasn’t been on the field yet. There will be cornerbacks available in the first two rounds who could step in and start opposite Bouye. Elway said: “There is some depth at corner. You determine what you like. It goes back to how different teams look at them.” Analysis: Elway mentioned four cornerbacks without being asked — Ohio State’s Jeff Okudah, Florida’s C.J. Henderson, Alabama’s Trevon Diggs and Clemson’s A.J. Terrell. Diggs and Terrell should be available at No. 15 or in a trade-down. What’s the story: Safety Justin Simmons has not signed his franchise tag tender and the Broncos’ stated goal is to work out a long-term contract. A second-team All-Pro last year, Simmons is viewed as an ideal fit for coach Vic Fangio’s defense'}]"

costumes and Halloween! But a child’s dream of piles of candy can be a parent’s worst nightmare for their teeth. And because October is also National Dental Hygiene Month, trick-or-treating is a perfect time to be watching out for Mouth Monsters looking to cause tooth decay. Cava-Teena, Dracteria, Plaxus, Gum Denise and Ginger-Vitus are lurking in every bag and bucket just looking for little mouths filled with sugar. However, Halloween doesn’t have to be a battle of the snacks! It can be both fun and a perfect time to teach children good, lifelong oral health habits, without depriving them of their goodies. Here are some ideas to add to your favorite ghostly gatherings to frighten away those Mouth Monsters waiting to pounce. Sort the Hoard and Beware the Mouth Monsters’ Favorite Treats! After a night of candy collecting, the first thing kids love to do is dump out their stash and start sorting. This year, before they get started, remember that not all sweet treats affect teeth in the same way and there are some the Mouth Monsters like better. Denying kids their favorite treat may lead to unhealthy eating when they are older. Therefore, even those candies to be avoided as a regular snack, should be allowed in moderation. Once the kids have sorted their treats by favorites, separating by these categories will help them have a good understanding of what foods invite an attack from the Mouth Monsters: Let Them Indulge – a Little I know this may sound contradictory to everything you have been told, but rationing candy over months is more damaging, from a dental health standpoint, than to indulge for a few days and then placing the bucket somewhere to be forgotten, in fact, it will likely lead to less candy being consumed overall. The problem lies in eating sugary treats over an extended amount of time. This is actually more harmful to your teeth than a one-time binge. Bacteria in our mouths break down the sugar into acid that weakens tooth enamel, the constant exposure to acid results in a higher risk of cavities. Obviously, a stomachache on Halloween is never a good idea, but allowing your little Ghoulies a tiny candy indulgence that night may fend off an incessant attack from the Mouth Monsters for months to come. H2O Straightaway Keeps the Monsters at Bay! Drinking water discourages Mouth Monsters from latching onto those tiny teeth while consuming foods with high sugar and starch content. So it’s a great idea to wash down all that chocolaty goodness with a big bottle of H2O. Swishing it around in your mouth will further help dislodge particles that can get stuck. An alternative way to increase saliva flow, wash out foods from between teeth and neutralize acid produced by bacteria that causes cavities, is to chew a sugar-free gum for 20 minutes. Sugar-free gum made with xylitol also promotes the growth of a tooth-protective, non-acidic bacteria which can make it difficult for bad bacteria and plaque to form. Be Sure to Brush! As expected, the best lesson to teach your children, and stop the Mouth Monsters, is to floss and brush after consuming all that Halloween candy. A normal and frequent dental routine creates a “tooth smart” habit for years ahead. Overexposure to fluoride can be a concern with these extra brushing sessions if your very young child does not spit out the toothpaste, but if in doubt have them brush with just water or a fluoride-free toothpaste. Make brushing fun so they don’t resist brushing. One idea is to have them pick out a new Halloween toothbrush so they are excited about brushing! Another important aspect of encouraging kids to maintain their normal dental routine is by scheduling regular dental checkups to examine and clean their teeth. What to do with the rest? Once kids have gotten their fill, you will be astonished how quickly they forget about the rest. Pick a place to store your child’s candy that is out of reach to prevent overconsumption and/or late night snacking or freeze it for a surprise treat in a few months. An even better idea would be to donate or find a Halloween candy giveback program. Think Outside the Candy Box! For those of us planning to hand out treats, think before you spend your money on that bag of cavity inviting, Monster Mouth bait. There are all sorts of other non-food, inexpensive, cavity free treats such as stickers, quarters, bubbles, pencils, glow sticks or silly putty. Halloween is a fun and exciting time for kids, and can be for parents as well. You and your kids can enjoy the added goodies that come with the festivities without inviting the Mouth Monsters. It is just a matter of being safe, thoughtful and consuming in moderation. For more information about oral health, visit our website at https://www.nchd.org/oralhealth and happy Halloween everyone!

much of Colorado, it was largely business as usual on the Anchor Three Farm on Wednesday afternoon. Just days ahead of the start of spring planting, a tractor-pulled disc and packer prepared the soil by thrashing through the remnants of last year’s corn crop.But this year’s prospects are filled with uncertainty. The farms and ranches that produce our food — arguably the most essential of businesses — may be exempt from the state’s shutdown orders, but they haven’t been immune to the virus’ growing economic effects. Farmers face new hardships that threaten to stanch the flow of food to consumers.Anxiety punctuates nearly every conversation.Don and Peggy Brown, the owners of Anchor Three, worry about suddenly falling corn prices. They also wonder if feedlots and meat-packing plants will still be open soon when it’s time to send off their yearling steers. They saw the recent temporary closure of a JBS meat-packing plant in Greeley, site of a major outbreak among the workers, as a warning signal — the latest on top of long-standing challenges, including a drought in eastern Colorado.“The real problem is it was dry late last summer as well,” said Tyson Brown, their 35-year-old son, inside the large family farm’s cavernous machinery shop. “We didn’t get any help (from nature) re-establishing the grass. And so it was dry last fall, it’s dry this spring and, well, commodities are in the tank.”Added Don, his voice filled with nervous laughter: “And we’ve got this damn virus! As if we had a problem, we’ve (now) got a virus here.”At left: Lisa Brown, pictured through a window, helps her son Max, 7, his with schoolwork at their home in Yuma on April 15, 2020.

(Photos by RJ Sangosti, The Denver Post)Survey farmers and ranchers across the Eastern Plains and on the state’s Western Slope, and the anxieties spill forth. Many of them live in sparsely populated counties that have been spared outbreaks — Yuma County has held steady for weeks at just two confirmed cases — but they worry their very livelihoods are at stake if the pandemic drags on for too long.“Within the last three weeks, the price that we’re selling lamb for has dropped about 60%,” said Angelo “Butch” Theos, 72, a third-generation rancher in northwest Colorado. Last week, he and his son, Anthony, 41, were trailing their flock of nearly 4,000 sheep back to Meeker from their winter grazing lands on a high-desert plateau near Rangely. Soon it will be lambing season, and in July they’ll move the flock high into the mountains to the east for the hot months.For both activities, they usually rely on five hardy and trusted sheep-herders, longtime seasonal employees from Peru who are willing to do a tough job that locals in Rio Blanco County won’t. But two had their worker visas up over the winter and now face a new hurdle: Peru is on lockdown, and they can’t get back to Colorado this month, as they’d planned.“I’m hoping and praying we get our guys back by May 1,” Anthony Theos said. If they’re still short-handed in July, “I don’t know what we’re going to do.”At left: Don Brown, of Anchor Three Farm in Eastern Colorado, is hoping farmers and ranchers can continue to keep the food supply chain open during the coronavirus pandemic.

John Hickenlooper’s second term.And the JBS plant wasn’t the first. Among other closures are plants operated in South Dakota and Missouri by Smithfield Foods, a pork producer that also has hog farms near Yuma.

Since we are all children of the God who cherishes us, we can lovingly express this tender care and promise to ourselves. We want to glorify our heavenly parent by keeping ourselves beautiful and fruitful for His service and loving our neighbor as ourselves. Here in Chaffee County, we know that gardening can be a challenge. Our native soil is sandy, rocky and invaded by weeds. Digging up river rock is inevitable and requires patience and strength. Tumbleweed and cheat grass take up water and nourishment where we want to see beauty. We have a vision for our garden – colorful blossoms of many hues that are fragrant and attract bees and butterflies, bushes and trees with berries and fruits for birds and us to enjoy and share. Doesn’t God have a vision for us, His perfect spiritual image and likeness as recorded in Genesis 1? We strive to understand and exemplify this image, so we look to Jesus as our example. In the mirror we may see a person needing a lot of help from God to measure up to this vision of divine beauty and goodness. What do we do? With divine Love’s help we can rebuke the lying serpent that tells us that ungodlike qualities are part of our true identity as God’s children. From the barren soil of our hearts we can eliminate stones of selfishness, greed, dishonesty, ingratitude, anger and hate. We can uproot and toss out weeds of fear, faults, hurts, doubt and discouragement from our mortal thoughts of ourselves. God’s ever-present and all-powerful love, wisdom and strength are with us in this effort, for what loving parent would not correct us? Once we have identified and done our best to remove those rocks and weeds, we enrich our garden with proper nutrients such as humility, sincerity, gratitude, obedience, trust, and unselfish love. In this good soil we can then plant our seeds of “love, joy, peace, patience, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, self-control,” as the apostle Paul tells us. Gal. 5:22 As God waters us with bountiful blessings from heaven, so we can water the garden of our hearts with hope, faith and love. I know when I hike in our pristine mountains to enjoy glorious views of wildflowers and rejoice in God’s abundant goodness, I’m also inwardly hoping to catch glimpses of myself as His fresh, lovely, innocent, pure reflection. We want to enjoy and share the blessings of our understanding of God’s goodness and love. As we fence in our garden to protect it from hungry deer and bunnies, let’s humbly and gratefully trust that divine Love not only corrects, plants and nurtures us, but also, as Jesus showed, protects us from the devourer that would steal, kill and destroy us. This spiritual knowing is our protection. Don’t we long to see our children safe and secure all day? We can wrap them up in the arms of our heavenly parent, knowing, as Paul tells us in Romans 8, that nothing can separate them from the love of God, wherever they are. They can learn this love of God, feel this peace for themselves and be free from fear for their schools as well. I’ll be praying for them. Carolyn J.

On Monday, spokespeople for the four declined to comment when asked if Trump should concede.On Sunday, former Gov. Bill Owens, the only Republican to lead Colorado in the past 45 years, wrote on Facebook that the election is over. Contrary to Trump’s claims of election fraud, Owens said, America’s election systems performed “remarkably well” considering this year’s pandemic and record-high turnout.“For the good of the country and our democracy, President Trump needs to respect the will of the voters, accede to the wishes of the electorate, and help prepare the way for the 46th President of the United States, Joe Biden,” he wrote. “And — no matter our own personal political views — we should, as Americans, do the same.”The former governor, who was in office from 1999 to 2007, told of how he prepared two speeches for election night in 1998, one in case of victory and another written in preparation for defeat. He won by 8,297 votes, less than one percentage point.“It turned out I had the good fortune to give the former (speech) but I was fully prepared — had the voters so decided — to give the latter,” Owens said, calling on Trump to now do the same.During an interview with the ultra-conservative One America News Network on Friday, Rep. Ken Buck, a Windsor Republican who chairs the Colorado GOP, spoke of a hypothetical Biden administration without conceding the Democrat has won. Late last week, he told the Colorado Sun he is awaiting results of the Trump campaign’s lawsuits but doesn’t have knowledge of widespread fraud.When asked Monday whether Buck believes the president should concede, a Buck spokeswoman pointed to a statement he made last week about Trump’s right to litigate his allegations of election fraud in court until Dec. 14, when the Electoral College meets to certify the results of the presidential election. The president’s campaign has lost repeatedly in court and failed to present evidence to back up accusations of massive, widespread fraud and a stolen election. As a result, some Republicans in Congress have called for the president to concede. The four from Colorado have not.Sen. Cory Gardner, a Yuma Republican who conceded his own loss Nov. 3, did not respond to a request for comment sent to his spokeswoman. Last week, Gardner complained when a Capitol Hill reporter asked if Biden is the president-elect.“You’re going to play gotcha questions with me? You guys, just come on. I’m not going to play your gotcha questions. I’m not going to play your games. I’m tired of it,” Gardner said then.Spokespersons for Rep. Scott Tipton, a Cortez Republican, and Rep.

On Saturday, she said on Twitter that “President Trump still has time to turn this around and get the real results out.”“This is no time to be demoralized or give up,” she told fellow Trump supporters on the social media site Thursday. “Our founders fought relentlessly for our freedom…and we are in a battle for it once again.

Please give us a call at 970-874-4421 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy The Sno-Cat that plunged through the ice of Island Lake in 2019, killing the two men aboard, is hauled ashore Tuesday, after a volunteer dive team succeeded in bringing it to the surface. By Katharhynn Heidelberg Staff writer This article ran Sept. 30 and is available online. Volunteers on a second attempt raised from Island Lake the Sno-Cat that in 2019 carried two Delta County men to their deaths when it went through the ice. “Our goal is to, for one, remove the Sno-Cat for the benefit of the environment and in addition, so that neither the Forest Service nor the families, nor anybody has a trickle-down deal over this,” Jared Leisek, the founder of the volunteer dive organization Adventures With Purpose, said Wednesday. “The families have enough they have to deal with.” Adventures With Purpose brought the 15,000-pound machine up from the bottom of the lake last Tuesday, after an earlier attempt this year was unsuccessful. The Sno-Cat fell through the ice in February 2019, killing Ryan Wells and Ricky Colton. The two friends had been staying at the nearby Grand Mesa Lodge. When the lodge owner could not find them the following morning, he contacted authorities who discovered a gaping hole in the ice about 150 yards from shore. The men’s bodies were recovered with assistance from the Summit County Sheriff’s Office remote-operated vehicle. Getting the Sno-Cat raised to the surface and hauled ashore took more than a year. In June, Leisek’s team came and attempted to raise the machine from the lake floor using lift bags, but it was not possible to keep air flowing fast enough as the bags began to leak. This week, Adventures With Purpose returned with custom, open-bottomed float bags. Dive teams contended with a shallower lake, as well. “The good news is it was 10 feet shallower this time,” Leisek said — although the volunteer team still operated in a high-mountain lake. With the previous bags, the team had to try to raise the machine in 25-foot sections at a time and because of the elevation, this was equivalent to a 100-foot dive. With the custom bags providing 25,000 pounds of lift, the team was able to go all the way to the Sno-Cat and stay for a minimal amount of time — a “blow and go,” Leisek said. “That allowed us to cut out a lot of extra time. We would have had to have staged lifts (without the custom bags),” he said. Once the machine was up, Wells’ father, Tom, used his wrecker to pull it ashore, Leisek said, calling Tom’s work integral to the efforts. “We didn’t want to leave the Sno-Cat as one of those unaccomplished tasks in our life,” Leisek said, acknowledging some in the community had debated whether to raise it from the lake. His team was happy to return, he said, with members coming in at their own expense, some from as far away as Missouri and Washington state. The operation costs themselves were covered pro-bono, which is possible because of the ad revenue Adventures With Purpose’s YouTube and Facebook pages bring in. On top of that, locals chipped in, with the lodge owner donating cabins, a business owner lending his pontoon boat, and other efforts. Leisek said the Sno-Cat is being restored to be used in future Adventures With Purpose search and rescue missions. Delta County Sheriff Mark Taylor welcomed word that the Sno-Cat was out of the lake. “I hope it gives the families some closure,” he said. Leisek remembered the victims, Wells and Colton. “These were good men,” he said. “This could have happened to anybody and unfortunately, the community lost two good men who were also fathers. It’s a sad loss for everybody.” Log In Keep it Clean. Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexually-oriented language. PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR CAPS LOCK. Don't Threaten.

High Country News A nonprofit independent magazine of unblinking journalism that shines a light on all of the complexities of the West. In May 1900, a Boise Shoshone leader known as Captain Jim aimed his bow at deer and elk amid the shady pines and firs along a tributary of the Snake River near what is currently Boise, Idaho. Federal Indian agents called him “Captain” to denote his tribal leadership. Bundled away among the documents he carried was a letter signed by an Indian agent, which gave him permission to leave the Fort Hall Reservation and hunt on his tribe’s traditional territory. White settlers had flooded the lush Idaho valleys, gouging out gold and silver mines along the river and mountain ridges, while the Boise Shoshone lived far away, confined to a reservation. Back in 1869, Captain Jim and his tribe were marched to the Fort Hall Indian Reservation in the state’s southeastern corner as federal troops cleared the land of Indigenous peoples and opened the region to white settlement and mining. The shores of the Snake River and the nearby mountain ridges — home to both the Boise Shoshone and southern Nez Perce bands — boasted “the richest and most valuable silver mines yet known to the world,” The New York Times proclaimed a few years before. Violence was rampant; many tribes and bands lost their territory to the encroaching settlers and were banished to reservations or prisoner-of-war camps run by the U.S. military hundreds of miles away. The U.S. created the state of Idaho using unbalanced treaties, land grabs and coerced agreements to seize Indigenous lands with little to no compensation. Tens of thousands of those acres were later used for lumber and cattle grazing to benefit the University of Idaho, which was established in 1889, one of 52 land-grant universities funded with stolen land. The letter Captain Jim carried survives today, safeguarded by his great-great-granddaughter, Louise Dixey. Meanwhile, the land his community lived on still produces income for the state’s flagship college. “It’s really important for our people to know where we came from,” said Dixey, cultural resources director for her tribe. “That’s why we saved all of those documents. They never wanted us to forget.” A scan of the original letter carried by Boise Shoshone leader Captain Jim granting him permission to leave his reservation to hunt on his homelands. Credit: Courtesy of Louise Dixey To fund land-grant universities like the University of Idaho, the United States took nearly 11 million acres of land from approximately 250 tribes, bands and communities through over 160 violence-backed treaties and land cessions. The Morrill Act of 1862 granted that land to states to be sold for the benefit of fledgling universities; altogether, it would raise nearly $18 million for 52 institutions by the early 20th century. To claim a share of Morrill Act lands, universities had to agree to conserve and invest the principal raised from their sale. Eastern, Southern and some Midwestern states received vouchers for lands out West, while Western states and territories selected land inside their borders. In the course of a two-year investigation into how the United States expropriated nearly 11 million acres of Indigenous lands to build today’s celebrated land-grant university system, High Country News found that at least 16 land-grant universities in the West and Midwest — nearly a third of the schools in the system — still retain more than a half-million acres. The Morrill Act of 1862, which established the land-grant university system to spread public education across the country, bestowed 90,000 acres on the University of Idaho. That land was taken from the Nez Perce tribe, Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, the Schitsu’umsh (Coeur d’Alene) and the Te-Moak Tribe of Western Shoshone between 1855 and 1873. The University of Idaho raised over $450,000 from the land sold from its initial grant. Adjusted for inflation, the principal was worth over $13 million. Today, the University of Idaho continues to benefit from over 33,000 unsold Morrill Act acres, more than a third of its original land grant. These lands comprise nearly 18,000 acres of rangeland, over 15,000 acres of timberland and over 350 acres of farmland. Held in trust by the state, they produced nearly $360,000 in revenue in fiscal year 2019. Another 70,000 mineral acres originally granted through the Morrill Act brought in approximately $1,200 in revenue to the university in the same year. (A “mineral acre” is a full or 100% interest in the minerals on one acre of land.) Both surface and mineral acres are managed by the Idaho Department of Lands — a feature unique to Western states that pulled land from within their own borders.

The University of Idaho’s continued financial benefits would not have been possible without the Nez Perce “thief” treaty of 1863 or the land seized without treaty or agreement from Western Shoshone bands, as well as the land ceded by unratified treaties from the Shoshone-Bannock and taken by executive order from the Schitsu’umsh (Coeur d’Alene). In 1864, the Boise Shoshone signed a treaty with Territorial Gov. Caleb Lyon, relinquishing their rights to their traditional lands along the Boise River. That was over a century ago, yet the treaty has never been ratified by Congress. The same happened to the Bannock Tribe. The Fort Hall Reservation was created by executive order, to shoehorn multiple tribes and bands together in one place. For the Nez Perce Tribe, like many others, the choice was clear: Either sign a treaty, or prepare for war. In 1855, the tribe’s reservation had stretched across most of its original territory in what is now Washington, Oregon and Idaho, comprising millions of acres guaranteed by treaty — until, that is, gold was discovered, attracting hordes of illegal prospectors. A second treaty in 1863 reduced the tribe’s territory by nearly 90%. During the negotiation of the 1863 treaty, the United States propped up de facto Nez Perce leadership to legitimize the agreement. A faction of the tribe now known as the “lower” or “nontreaty” Nez Perce refused to assent to a treaty that would swallow up their homelands. This eventually led to war in 1877. More than 19,000 acres of the appropriated land would later be used to benefit the state’s land-grant university. All told, the Nez Perce lost around 7 million acres — a land seizure enabled by fraud. “Ultimately, we need to take the next step into making sure that money goes back to the people who it originates from in the form of opportunities and in the form of partnerships.” “Ultimately, we need to take the next step into making sure that money goes back to the people who it originates from in the form of opportunities and in the form of partnerships,” said Nakia Williamson-Cloud (Nez Perce), director of the Nez Perce Cultural Resources Program. “I think some of those partnerships exist, but I don’t think they really, truly, reflect what was taken from tribal people.

Employers request visas for workers from other countries they need to meet the demand for their services. There are too few visas available for every company to bring in temporary workers. Political pressure is applied. Often, more visas will be approved on an emergency supplemental basis.“Honestly, it’s just horrendous,” Brian Carlson, the CEO of Lafayette-based Green Landscape Solutions, said. “What I tell people is at this point my business plan comes down to a lottery or luck.”But 2020 is not just any year — the visa roller coaster has come off the tracks. The H-2B and other programs have been frozen by presidential decree. Whether or not that will mean the hundreds of thousands of Colorado workers who are unemployed amid the COVID-19 pandemic will seek out the jobs normally filled by foreign laborers remains to be seen.On June 22, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation amending an existing ban on new green cards for foreign nationals outside the U.S. and added a number of temporary worker visas to it.

from Buena Vista Heritage in the paper last week was first identified by Lou Ann Johnson. It is the town of St. Elmo but the photo is very early, probably 1881. On the hill above town you can see the railroad bed of the Denver South Park and Pacific. Notice all the trees are cut down, used for buildings and railroad ties. The two log houses on the hill below the tracks are still standing. Most of the buildings in the photo are gone, burned in various fires over the years. On the front left is a corner of the Stark Brothers General Store with the restaurant sign and on the far right is the city hall which was rebuilt after a recent fire. None of the buildings seen on the right beyond the city hall are still there. On the left, the small building beyond the Stark store is still standing. The big white building above the small building was the American House Hotel. It was torn town except for the Parlor which was restored and opened this summer. The other building still standing is the one with the outside staircase, and it was the Pat Hurley Saloon. Did you notice all the women in the photo, and one riding side saddle on a donkey and another on a horse? The street is busy with wagons, miners and railroad people as St. Elmo was booming with all the railroad construction the Mary Murphy Mine and miners searching for another strike. Buena Vista Heritage has started a digitization of all our old photos. They will be available for viewing on our website when we are done. I may need help identifying some so be prepared for some real Where Is This? Or we may have a photo identification party this spring at the museum. Log In Keep it Clean.

Saturday’s commencement was attended by Vice President Mike Pence and capped a difficult final semester in which the cadets attended virtual classes and ate their meals alone in dorm rooms.

At an Air Force Academy graduation unlike any other in the school’s storied history, cadets sat 8 feet apart, their faces uncovered, as Vice President Mike Pence told them a weary nation needs their leadership now more than ever.“America is being tested,” the vice president told 967 graduating cadets. “While there are signs that we are making progress in slowing the spread, as we stand here today, more than 700,000 Americans have contracted the coronavirus and tragically more than 37,000 of our countrymen have lost their lives.“But as each of you has shown in your time here,” he went on, “and as the American people always show in challenging times, when hardship comes, Americans come together. We rise to the challenge. The courage, compassion and generosity of the nation you will defend are shining through every day.”The vice president’s remarks extolled patriotism, military might and American perseverance. They also praised President Donald Trump, last year’s graduation speaker, and the Trump administration’s military policies.“We will get through this. We will protect our most vulnerable people. And we will heal our land,” Pence told the academy’s Class of 2020.Graduating weeks ahead of schedule, the cadets traded in Falcon Stadium, the usual graduation location, for an outdoor pavilion near the academy chapel. They did not march to receive their diplomas and no spectators were allowed to attend.The Air Force Thunderbirds performed their traditional flyover of the ceremony but did not perform their usual aerobatics demonstration. And after the Thunderbirds took flight over an unusually quiet academy, graduates jumped and cheered in place, but could not hug or shake hands. Some waved to classmates instead.The class of 2020 was historic even before coronavirus precautions drastically changed Saturday’s ceremony. Eighty-six graduates will now go on to serve as officers in the new Space Force, the first class of academy graduates to do so. “You, if deterrence fails, will fight and win the battle for space superiority,” said Gen. John “Jay” Raymond, the Space Force leader, during Saturday’s remarks, “which is so vital to our nation, to our allies, and our joint coalition forces.”The graduation was given an exception from the state’s stay-at-home orders and ban on gatherings because it occurred at a federal institution and because military members are essential employees.“Governor Polis congratulates the Air Force Academy cadets on their commission as second lieutenants in the United States Air Force and United States Space Force,” said the governor’s press secretary in the days before the event. “The academy will be practicing good social distancing and he hopes they stay safe during this challenging time for our state and country.”Polis and Pence spoke for five minutes on a Colorado Springs tarmac before the graduation, according to a White House pool report. They did not shake hands due to social distancing restrictions. Polis wore a mask with the Colorado logo on the front; the vice president did not wear a mask as they spoke. “America is being tested,” the vice president told 967 graduating cadets. “While there are signs that we are making progress in slowing the spread, as we stand here today, more than 700,000 Americans have contracted the coronavirus and tragically more than 37,000 of our countrymen have lost their lives. “But as each of you has shown in your time here,” he went on, “and as the American people always show in challenging times, when hardship comes, Americans come together.

Since the onset of the pandemic, Knott has gone cashless and hasn’t looked back.“I think going cashless can help out a lot of small businesses,” he said. “It’s a more accurate, easier business to run with similar or better margins.”Of course, going cashless, like the pandemic itself, has disparate impacts on different populations.A customer pays for coffee with a credit card at Blue Sparrow Coffee on in Denver on Dec. 29, 2020.State Rep. Alex Valdez, D-Denver, plans to pursue a bill in the Colorado legislature that will make it illegal for businesses not to accept cash, CBS4 reported earlier this month, a measure that would follow in the footsteps of several other states. Valdez said the measure is about fighting discrimination, according to CBS.A Federal Reserve System study found that in 2018, 6% of American families did not have bank accounts. Families making less than $40,000 per year were the most likely to be unbanked, at 14%. Black people and Latinos were also more likely than white people to not have bank accounts, at ratios of 14% to 4% and 11% to 4% respectively.While Knott would like Blue Sparrow to go cashless permanently, he is looking for an in-house workaround to allow people without bank accounts to keep using cash, perhaps by allowing people to buy gift cards with cash.Moore said that a cashless system runs the risk of creating an uneven economic playing field. Her survey found that the national coin shortage created by the pandemic disproportionately impacted lower-income people and minority groups.“That’s something that we need to watch for,” Moore said.

This includes the Sunlight Winter Sports Bus. This amenity offers season passes to local youth snowboarders and skiers for just $35, busing the kids each weekend to rip up Sunlight Mountain. The program usually runs from early December to spring break. “Sadly, we had to cancel that,” said parks and recreation program manager Austin Rickstrew. COVID-19 concerns, of course, caused the department to scrap this year’s usual winter activities itinerary. Some would argue, however, such a bleak anomaly is actually a blessing in disguise. With the open time, the municipal department has now focused their attention on providing holiday meals for the needy. “Everyone’s struggling right now,” Rickstrew said. “We’re just trying to give a little holiday cheer at this time while still being as active as we can.” Called “Holiday Feast,” people have until Dec. 16 to submit entries to the department, pitching their reasons why they or people they know should receive a meal kit this holiday season. The kit, stocked with turkey baskets, all the ingredients to prepare green bean casserole, pie, potatoes, bread, corn, Brussels sprouts and fresh carrots, poses quite the hearty feast. It should feed 5-7 people. “It’s basically whatever we can buy for $75, we’ll fit in that meal kit,” Rickstrew said. There are simple options to pursue for people interested in submitting nominations. They can either scan the QR code found on the Holiday Feast fliers or visit the parks and recreation Facebook page. From there, they’ll need to take a survey, which asks for names, addresses, places of residence and why the surveyee feels the nomination is valid. “It makes me feel good,” Rickstrew said. “But as much as I want to take credit for it, it was not my idea.” This is the inaugural year of the Holiday Feast, Rickstrew said. Earlier this fall, the city held their first Halloween-house-decorating contest, which churned a success. From that, the parks and recreation department decided to hold another house-decorating contest – this time for the winter holiday season. Rickstrew said parks and rec administrative assistant Kearstin Pierce came up with the idea of providing meals as prizes for the Christmas House Decorating Contest. Winners also have a chance to win up to $250 if they place first in one of the three judging categories. Meanwhile, after the annual Hometown Holiday fireworks display was canceled, Western Garfield Chamber of Commerce CEO and Director Tanya Perea Doose, Alpine Bank and the city’s Greater Rifle Improvement Team (GRIT) reached out to help contribute to the Holiday Feast. “Tanya thought that was a great idea, the bank thought that was a great idea,” Rickstrew said. “Alpine Bank said, ‘Make it 20 meals and we’ll sponsor it fully.'” In addition to the Holiday Feast and the Christmas House Decorating Contest, the parks and recreation department is currently holding a canned food drive until Dec. 18. People can donate cans of food at the parks and recreation office. “I am just so impressed with them down there, in terms of our parks and recs department,” said city public information officer Kathryn Potosky. “This is that time of year when they would be doing all these sporting events and different activities – none of which they can do. So they have just become ultra philanthropic.” Rickstrew said once the nominations are accepted and approved, the parks and recreation department plans to load up the meal kits onto city buses and personally deliver them to people’s doorsteps. rerku@citizentelegram.com May 31, 2024 May 31, 2024 May 31, 2024 May 31, 2024 May 31, 2024 May 26, 2024 May 28, 2024 May 29, 2024 May 28, 2024 May 29, 2024 Readers around Glenwood Springs and Garfield County make the Post Independent’s work possible.

HOPE Online Learning Academy Elementary schools were voted to be closed. Now, back to reading, which I believe to be the most important subject taught in elementary school. A short explanation for teaching reading is found in the Simple View of Reading. Reading comprehension is the desired outcome of decoding words and language comprehension. Decoding X language comprehension = reading comprehension If students cannot decode printed English, they cannot understand it. If students cannot comprehend spoken English, they cannot know written English. Recognizing a word quickly and accurately is essential for comprehension. If you’re spending too much time trying to figure out a word, the understanding of the text will be challenging. Learning how to teach the evidence-based science of reading in the classroom is not easy. It takes time and dedication by district and school leaders with an earnest desire to ensure that every student can read proficiently by the third grade. Teacher education courses are currently being evaluated by the Department of Education. Next month, I’ll introduce you to the Reading Wars or why we haven’t been teaching according to the READ Act.

I find that I am a better writer than orator so when deciding what kind of jobs to apply to after college I decided to lean more towards the sports journalism jobs than the TV or radio jobs. What drew you to Colorado? What drew me the most to Colorado was the job that I now have with the Craig Press. What do you look forward to most in your new position with the Craig Press? The thing that I look forward to the most in my new job as a sports and education reporter is meeting the people in the community and covering Moffat County sports, especially football since I grew up in an area without high school football. As a result, the “Friday Night Lights” type setting is interesting and exciting to me. What are you most excited about when it comes to working with sources within the community? I think I am most excited about building the relationships with people in the community, as both friends and sources so that they know they can trust me when a story does arise, they can come to me and I will fairly and accurately report it. What do you like to do in your free time? In my free time, I like to hang out with friends and watch sports and play video games. I also like to watch movies and television.
