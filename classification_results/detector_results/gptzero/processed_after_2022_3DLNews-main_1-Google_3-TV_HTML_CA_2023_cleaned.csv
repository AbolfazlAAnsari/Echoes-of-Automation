Chance Comanche, 27, was in the Sacramento County Jail Saturday evening after a warrant for first-degree kidnapping was issued in Las Vegas Justice Court early Friday morning. Comanche was allegedly involved in the disappearance of Marayna Rodgers, 23, sources say. Rodgers, a medical assistant from Washington state, had been visiting Las Vegas with friends in early December, her family told KLAS. She hasn’t been seen since December 6. While details of the investigation are limited, KLAS has confirmed that Comanche was taken into custody by an FBI apprehension team on Friday. Neither a criminal complaint or an arresting affidavit were immediately available for Comanche. Comanche was a member of the Stockton Kings, the G League affiliate of the Sacramento Kings. The team released Comanche on Friday. A team spokesperson declined to comment further on the matter. Comanche went undrafted after playing basketball at the University of Arizona and has spent the last two seasons with Stockton. The Stockton Kings played the G League Ignite team at the Dollar Loan Center in Henderson, Nevada on December 5, the day before Rodgers reportedly disappeared. It is unclear how long Comanche may have been in the Las Vegas area. The Stockton Kings then played the Rip City Remix in Portland, Oregon on December 7. A woman has already been taken into custody in connection with Rodgers’ disappearance. Sakari Harnden, 19, faces a first-degree kidnapping charge in connection with Rodgers’ disappearance. As of Saturday evening, she remained in a downtown Las Vegas jail on $500,000 bail. According to a criminal complaint, Harnden said she held or detained Rodgers against her will and without her consent for the purpose of killing her and/or inflicting bodily harm. Las Vegas Justice Court Judge Diana Sullivan set Harnden’s bail at $500,000 on December 14, according to court records. Conditions included high-level electronic monitoring. It also noted for the “State to notify the Court immediately if the alleged victim is located alive.” Harnden is believed to be the last person to see Rodgers before her disappearance. Judge Sullivan also issued the arrest warrant for Comanche. Comanche is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday afternoon in Sacramento County court, jail records showed. Harnden declined an interview with KLAS. She is represented by a public defender, records showed. A preliminary hearing for the kidnapping charge is scheduled for December 28. Loved ones told KLAS that Rodgers had a good job and would never leave her family back home in Washington state, or abandon her dogs she brought with her to Las Vegas. They believe Rodgers’ disappearance is suspicious. Anyone with information is urged to contact Las Vegas Metro Police at (702) 828-3111. Tips can be submitted anonymously through Crimestoppers at (702) 385-5555. Jasmine Lee, the CEO and founder of the Doc Ellis Foundation said that the foundation which advocates for missing and murdered people of color is looking into Rodgers’ disappearance.

President Biden’s son faces a total of nine charges — three felonies and six misdemeanors — in relation to tax evasion and other tax-related matters. Biden already faces gun charges, relating to allegedly lying about his use of illegal drugs in the process of buying a gun in 2018. The new charges were approved by a grand jury empaneled by Special Counsel David Weiss. Weiss was first appointed as the U.S. Attorney for Delaware by former President Trump but continued in the role after Present Biden’s election. Weiss has received criticism from Republicans more recently for purportedly being too lenient on Hunter Biden. He was appointed special counsel in August. The charges, filed with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, come after a plea deal collapsed during the summer. Biden is expected to vigorously contest the charges. If convicted, he would face a maximum sentence of 17 years in prison. Here are the political takeaways from the new indictment. There are plenty of differences in the trials facing former President Trump and Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden has never held or sought public office. His alleged offenses, though serious, pose no fundamental threat to American democracy comparable with the details of Trump’s indictments relating to election interference and the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. But a Biden trial would be embarrassing for father and son alike. The alleged law-breaking is only part of the story. There is also its luridness to consider. Hunter Biden has himself written about his conduct while he struggled with drug and alcohol addiction following the death of his brother Beau in 2015. A trial would bring fresh attention to a lifestyle that, according to the indictment, included vast expenditures on “drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing and other items of a personal nature, in short everything but his taxes.” Among other embarrassing allegations: Biden placed women with whom he had romantic or sexual liaisons on the payroll of one of his companies, and a $10,000 payment, listed as being for “golf member deposit,” was in fact for membership of a sex club. Even setting aside private peccadilloes, the sheer amount of money sloshing around Hunter Biden is highly incongruous with his father’s “Scranton Joe” image. The core of the prosecution argument is that Biden failed to pay around $1.4 million in taxes on about $7 million in income — including a $1 million salary from Ukrainian energy company Burisma and a one-third cut of a $3 million payment “purportedly to help a Romanian businessperson…contest bribery charges he was facing in his home country.” Republicans will take glee in the indictment, thanks to its capacity to cause turbulence for the president. But the GOP’s efforts to prove serious wrongdoing on the commander-in-chief’s part have come up empty so far. They will get no help from the indictment in that quest. It does not mention, or even allude to, President Biden. On Wednesday, President Biden complained to reporters about “lies” being told about his involvement in his son’s business affairs. House Republicans are expected to hold a vote on formalizing their impeachment inquiry into the president next week. The move will pass unless moderate Republicans balk — a possibility that appears to be receding. But the GOP will need to find evidence elsewhere if it is to come close to proving “high crimes and misdemeanors” by the president. Hunter Biden has been trying to wrest back the initiative from his critics in recent months, having previously taken a lower-profile approach. The most obvious example is his recent counter-offer after House Republicans subpoenaed him to provide a deposition behind closed doors on Wednesday. Biden, through his lawyer Abbe Lowell, said he was prepared to testify but only in public, not in private. Lowell stated this would allow the American people to see that various GOP allegations against his client are “baseless.” The counterproposal was a rare public relations win for the younger Biden, even though House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) are now threatening to hold him in contempt of Congress. Biden’s newly aggressive strategy has also included suing some of his most aggressive accusers outside Congress, including former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Patrick Byrne, the Trump loyalist who is the former CEO of Overstock. Now, the new indictment puts him on the back foot once again. The Hunter Biden saga is long and convoluted, encompassing a years-long investigation, the now-collapsed plea deal, and a series of allegations and denials over how the probe was conducted. But the bottom line is, the filing of serious criminal charges is a moral victory for those who argued that prosecutors had gone too lightly on him. Of specific relevance to this latest indictment was an allegation from a whistleblower and IRS agent named Gary Shapley. Shapley alleged that he had been shocked when Weiss revealed that he did not have final charging authority on the Biden case. If true, that would have meant that the decision whether or not to charge Biden over conduct outside of Delaware’s jurisdiction would have been left to other U.S. attorneys — in this case, two appointed by President Biden: Martin Estrada in California and Matthew Graves in the District of Columbia. Weiss said that he was never denied “the authority to bring charges in any jurisdiction,” and he has been backed up by Attorney General Merrick Garland. But Shapley has not stepped away from his account, and he is joined in the broad allegation that the investigation was soft-pedaled by another IRS whistleblower, Joseph Ziegler. Amid claim and counterclaim, the essence of Shapley and Ziegler’s argument — that Hunter Biden’s conduct merited deeper investigation and more serious charges than had been leveled — appears to have been borne out. The starkest political ramification of the new indictment might the simplest: it extends the Hunter Biden story, and adds another strand to it. Now, there will be more court dates, more accusations and denials, and more speculation about whether the president’s son will be ultimately found guilty. That’s a bad outcome for the president, regardless of the eventual outcome of any trial for his son. Submit Δ Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

""Bubba"" Copeland wore many hats in the small city of Smiths Station in east Alabama. He was the mayor, a pastor and the owner of a local grocery store. He was also a husband and father. But in the days before Copeland took his life, the 49-year-old was revealed to have another identity — this time, of a man who liked to dress up as a woman and write erotic fiction. On Wednesday, 1819 News, a website previously owned by the conservative Alabama Policy Institute, wrote that Copeland used a string of social media accounts under a pseudonym. The outlet also included several photos of Copeland in women\'s clothing and makeup that the site said were posted under the accounts. Two days later, Copeland killed himself, the Lee County Sheriff\'s Office said. A funeral service for Copeland is scheduled for Thursday. It\'s impossible to know all the factors that led to Copeland\'s suicide. But his death puts a spotlight on media ethics and when, if ever, it\'s appropriate to publish stories on people\'s private lives. The social media accounts belonging to Copeland described a transgender woman in the process of medically transitioning, 1819 News said. But Copeland told the outlet he was not actually doing so. He added that his wife knew of his private hobby, 1819 News said. Copeland told his congregation on Wednesday at a weekly prayer service that he was under an ""internet attack."" He admitted to taking photos of himself in women\'s clothing, but added that ""a lot of things that were said were taken out of context."" ""The article is not who or what I am,"" he said, according to a recording of the service. ""I apologize for any embarrassment caused by my private or personal life that has come publicly."" Two days later and hours before Copeland\'s death, the outlet released another article, focused on fictional stories and social media posts it says were produced under Copeland\'s pseudonym. 1819 News alleged that Copeland had used the names and photos of real community members in these posts without their consent. The article emphasized one fictional narrative about a trans woman\'s infatuation with a local business owner that turned deadly. 1819 News said that the business owner character was inspired by a real-life person and business familiar to Copeland. 1819 News did not respond to NPR\'s request for comment. On Friday, the outlet reported on Copeland\'s death and expressed its condolences. ""Our prayers are with the residents of Smiths Station, the parishioners of First Baptist Church of Phenix City and Copeland\'s family,"" the outlet wrote. Gary Hicks, a communications professor at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, has studied the history and consequences of outings, or when the media exposes a person\'s sexual orientation, gender identity or other private details of their personal life without the person\'s permission. The act of wearing clothes associated with another gender is not synonymous with being gay, lesbian or transgender. But like with many practices that challenge typical gender norms, outing a person\'s interest in cross-dressing without their consent can be extremely harmful, Hicks said. ""I cannot find a good reason to out a person in a story,"" he said. ""You do not know what the ramifications are going to be."" Hicks pointed out that some news organizations have justified outing elected officials if they actively denounce or vote against gay rights. NPR was not able to find any evidence that Copeland held such views. Historically, people who do not conform to gender norms have been accused of being deceptive or secretive. But Hicks said decisions related to a person\'s gender or sexual orientation are deeply personal and it can take a long time for a person to fully understand themselves. ""The decision to come out in any way belongs to the individual and not a news organization or anyone else,"" he said. Copeland was born in Columbus, Ga., but lived in Smiths Station, Ala., for most of his life. He attended Smiths Station High School and later, Auburn University, where he earned a degree in hotel and restaurant management. He went on to own and operate a grocery store. His political career began in 2008 as a school board member for Lee County. In 2016, he became the second person ever to be mayor of Smiths Station. During his time in office, Copeland was devoted to the city\'s growth and development. He spurred the designation of a historical site, and the creation of an outdoor community center and a public works department. He also championed a million-dollar road improvement project to address traffic congestion. And he guided the city through unprecedented challenges, including a deadly outbreak of tornadoes in 2019 and the COVID pandemic. Amid all his mayoral duties, Copeland also served as a senior pastor at First Baptist Church in nearby Phenix City. On Sunday, the First Baptist Church of Phenix City kept its service short for congregants to mourn together the loss of their senior pastor. Before that began, church member David White shared a few words. ""I cannot tell you that I fully understand or can explain the scope of his tragedy,"" he said, according to a recording. ""There are some things I do know are absolutely true. I know that my friend Bubba Copeland loved this church and its people."" Later that day, his church published an online obituary. ""He helped guide the City through a period of tremendous growth and development, and earn its place as one of the fastest growing Cities in the State of Alabama,"" it read. ""Beyond serving his church, city, and community, Bubba loved spending time with his family and serving his community."" The Alabama Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, of which Copeland\'s church was a part, said it was grieving with the Phenix City First Baptist Church. ""We hold all those who mourn Bubba Copeland in the light and love of Christ as they await the promised comfort of God,"" wrote coordinator Lucas Dorion. In a statement, Lee County Democrats said Copeland had a heart for service, adding that Copeland provided ""countless people with hope and support"" during the pandemic and 2019 tornadoes. ""Mayor Copeland was the backbone of Smiths Station,"" the group wrote on Friday. Former Alabama Sen. Doug Jones said he was heartbroken by the loss of Copeland, who he described as a friend, a ""good man and great mayor."" Jones also directly condemned 1819 News. ""It is sad and disgusting how he was treated by the @1819News for personal decisions however misguided they might have been,"" Jones wrote on X. The former superintendent of Phenix City schools, Larry DiChiara, said he was enraged by how Copeland was treated in the days before his death. ""I just want to ask you people who thought it humorous to publicly ridicule him, \'Are you happy now?\' What crime did he commit? Some of you people make me sick,"" DiChiara said in a social media post. Copyright 2023 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.'}]"

online, California will now require all K-12 students to learn media literacy skills — such as recognizing fake news and thinking critically about what they encounter online. Gov. Gavin Newsom last month signed Assembly Bill 873, which requires the state to add media literacy to curriculum frameworks for English language arts, science, math and history-social studies, rolling out gradually beginning next year. Instead of a stand-alone class, the topic will be woven into existing classes and lessons throughout the school year. “I’ve seen the impact that misinformation has had in the real world — how it affects the way people vote, whether they accept the outcomes of elections, try to overthrow our democracy,” said the bill’s sponsor, Assemblymember Marc Berman, a Democrat from Menlo Park. “This is about making sure our young people have the skills they need to navigate this landscape.” The new law comes amid rising public distrust in the media, especially among young people. A 2022 Pew Research Center survey found that adults under age 30 are nearly as likely to believe information on social media as they are from national news outlets. Overall, only 7% of adults have “a great deal” of trust in the media, according to a Gallup poll conducted last year. Pushing back against the surge of misinformation online, California will now require all K-12 students to learn media literacy skills — such as recognizing fake news and thinking critically about what they encounter online.

Overall, only 7% of adults have “a great deal” of trust in the media, according to a Gallup poll conducted last year. Media literacy can help change that, advocates believe, by teaching students how to recognize reliable news sources and the crucial role of media in a democracy. “The increase in Holocaust denial, climate change denial, conspiracy theories getting a foothold, and now AI … all this shows how important media literacy is for our democracy right now,” said Jennifer Ormsby, library services manager for the Los Angeles County Office of Education. “The 2016 election was a real eye-opener for everyone on the potential harms and dangers of fake news.” AB 873 passed nearly unanimously in the Legislature, underscoring the nonpartisan nature of the topic. Nationwide, Texas, New Jersey and Delaware have also passed strong media literacy laws, and more than a dozen other states are moving in that direction, according to Media Literacy Now (PDF), a nonprofit research organization that advocates for media literacy in K-12 schools. Still, California’s law falls short of Media Literacy Now’s recommendations. California’s approach doesn’t include funding to train teachers, an advisory committee, input from librarians, surveys or a way to monitor the law’s effectiveness. Keeping the bill simple, though, was a way to help ensure its passage, Berman said. Those features can be implemented later, and he felt it was urgent to pass the law quickly so students can start receiving media literacy education as soon as possible. The law goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2024, as the state begins updating its curriculum frameworks, although teachers are now encouraged to teach media literacy. Berman’s law builds on a previous effort in California to bring media literacy to K-12 classrooms. In 2018, Senate Bill 830 required the California Department of Education to provide media literacy resources — lesson plans, project ideas and background — to the state’s K-12 teachers. But it didn’t make media literacy mandatory. The new law also overlaps somewhat with California’s effort to bring computer science education to all students. The state hopes to expand computer science, which can include aspects of media literacy, to all students and possibly even require it to graduate from high school. Newsom recently signed Assembly Bill 1251, which creates a commission to look at ways to recruit more computer science teachers to California classrooms. Berman also sponsors Assembly Bill 1054, which requires high schools to offer computer science classes. That bill is currently stalled in the Senate. Teachers don’t need a state law to show students how to be smart media consumers, and some have been doing it for years. Merek Chang, a high school science teacher at Hacienda La Puente Unified in the City of Industry east of Los Angeles, said the pandemic was a wake-up call for him. During remote learning, he gave students two articles on the origins of the coronavirus. One was an opinion piece from the New York Post, a tabloid, and the other was from a scientific journal. He asked students which they thought was accurate. More than 90% chose the Post piece. “It made me realize that we need to focus on the skills to understand content as much as we focus on the content itself,” Chang said. He now incorporates media literacy in all aspects of his lesson plans. He relies on the Stanford History Education Group, which offers free media literacy resources for teachers, and took part in a KQED media literacy program for teachers. In addition to teaching students how to evaluate online information, he shows them how to create their own media. For example, homework assignments include making TikTok-style videos on protein synthesis for mRNA vaccines. Students then present their projects at home or lunchtime events for families and the community. “The biggest impact, I’ve noticed, is that students feel like their voice matters,” Chang said. “The work isn’t just for a grade. They feel like they’re making a difference.” Ormsby, the Los Angeles County librarian, has also been promoting media literacy for years. Librarians generally have been at the forefront of media literacy education, and California’s new law refers to the Modern School Library Standards for media literacy guidelines. Ormsby teaches concepts like “lateral reading” (comparing an online article with other sources to check for accuracy) and reverse imaging (searching online to trace a photo to its source or check if it’s been altered). She also provides lesson plans, resources and book recommendations such as “True or False: A CIA Analyst’s Guide to Spotting Fake News” and, for elementary students, “Killer Underwear Invasion! How to spot fake news, disinformation & conspiracy theories.” She’s happy that the law passed, but would like to see librarians included in the rollout and the curriculum implemented immediately, not waiting until the frameworks are updated. The gradual implementation of the law was deliberate since schools are already grappling with so many other state mandates, said Alvin Lee, executive director of Generation Up, a student-led advocacy group among the bill’s sponsors. He hopes that local school boards will prioritize the issue by funding training for teachers and moving immediately to get media literacy into classrooms. “Disinformation contributes to polarization, which we’re seeing happen all over the world,” said Lee, a junior at Stanford who said it’s a top issue among his classmates. “Media literacy can address that.” In San Francisco Unified, Ricardo Elizalde is a teacher on special assignment who trains elementary teachers in media literacy. His staff gave out 50 copies of “Killer Underwear!” for teachers to build activities around, and he also encourages students to make their own media. Elementary school is the perfect time to introduce the topic, he said. “We get all these media thrown at us from a young age, we have to learn to defend ourselves,” Elizalde said. “Media literacy is a basic part of being literate. If we’re just teaching kids how to read and not think critically about what they’re reading, we’re doing them a disservice.” To learn more about how we use your information, please read our privacy policy.'}]"

Ron DeSantis (R) and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) went head to head in a Fox News debate on Thursday as the governors — one a current presidential contender and the other seen as a future White House prospect — clashed over their records and policy. During the fiery 90-minute debate moderated by Sean Hannity and branded as “The Great Red vs. Blue State Debate,” DeSantis and Newsom took jabs at each other over how they handled key issues like the COVID-19 pandemic, crime and abortion, at times reverting to personal attacks such as calling each other bullies. The debate came against the backdrop of DeSantis’s presidential campaign. The Florida governor was initially seen as a threat to Donald Trump but is now lagging in polls behind not only the former president but also former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. Meanwhile, Newsom has been widely floated as a presidential hopeful; while he has said he’s not interested in challenging President Biden next year, the Fox News debate has only helped elevate his national profile and fueled further speculation over his plans. Here are five takeaways from the DeSantis-Newsom debate: Though Newsom often found himself on the defense in a hostile media environment, the California Democrat managed to keep his calm throughout, easily batting away attacks while also lobbing many of his own at DeSantis. In one such instance, DeSantis went after Newsom over his COVID-19 policies, saying that in California “you had Disney closed inexplicably for over a year” and that Newsom was “a lock-down governor.” Newsom quickly fired back. “Let’s talk about your record on COVID,” he said. “You pass an emergency declaration before the state of California did. You closed down your beaches, your bars, your restaurants. It’s a fact. You had quarantines — you had quarantines, you had checkpoints all over the state of Florida. By the way, I didn’t say that. Donald Trump laid you out on this.” “He followed science. He followed Fauci,” Newsom added of DeSantis, to which the Florida governor said, “that’s not true.” Throughout the debate, Newsom was confidant and good-humored, rarely seeming fazed when being attacked by DeSantis or pressed by Hannity, a self-proclaimed conservative. His debate performance will likely bolster his image as an extremely polished, media-savvy politician who nonetheless knows how to throw a punch when necessary. DeSantis went into the debate with arguably more at stake than Newsom, since he’s currently running in the GOP presidential primary. Ultimately, the Florida governor delivered a decent performance, frequently demonstrating his research of the topics at hand and even at times displaying visual aids — including a map of what he said was human excrement in San Francisco — to knock Newsom. He also landed a couple memorable blows, such as when he labeled Newsom a “liberal bully” or when he mocked his opponent for what he said was Newsom’s “shadow campaign” for the Democratic nomination for president in 2024. Still, the “red state vs. blue state” debate also felt at times like a two-on-one match-up. Hannity, during his introduction for the debate, acknowledged his well-known reputation for boosting Republican candidates for office and conservative causes, though he emphasized that he wanted to be a referee in the debate, not a participant. Throughout the night, many of the moderator’s questions began with an infographic or chart displayed on the screen for viewers, most of which painted California in a less favorable light than Florida on issues of homelessness, the economy and migration. Newsom on several occasions pushed back directly on Hannity’s line of questioning, DeSantis’s characterizations of the statistics and argued his state was in a stronger position than conservative critics routinely suggested. By contrast, Hannity gave little pushback to most of DeSantis’s answers or his attacks on the California governor. Hannity repeatedly said on Thursday night that he wanted to let the event “breathe,” resulting in a free-flowing — and at times raucous — debate. DeSantis and Newsom frequently talked over each other, to the point when they were sometimes unintelligible. They lobbed attacks at each other throughout the night and often interrupted each other. Hannity, for his part, worked hard to interject or move on to a new topic whenever it got chaotic. At one point, he begged the two governors not to “turn me into a hall monitor.” The lack of an in-person audience allowed the two participants to go after each other more freely, as there was no need for either governor to hold for applause or raise his voice over shouting spectators. Before one early commercial break, Newsom finished an answer to a question on his handling of the coronavirus pandemic by looking into the camera and saying, “more to come on this,” as the outro music signified a break was imminent. DeSantis joked that Newsom would be setting up “the next segment, I guess.” “I’m not a potted plant,” an apparently frustrated Hannity joked later during the debate, as the two governors bickered back and forth. Adding to the sense of chaos was a moment near the end in which it seemed like the debate was being abruptly extended. Hannity asked the two men on stage if they’d like to continue debating past the pre-planned 10:30 end time. “I don’t know why we don’t do another half hour, I’ve got all night,” Newsom said. “I think it’s been fun and it’s more entertaining than … I’m sorry to the guests I’ve invited,” Hannity said, before sending the broadcast to what would be its final commercial break. Once the network returned, Hannity said both candidates “had other commitments” and welcomed in a post-debate panel to provide analysis on the debate. DeSantis sought to make President Biden a frequent boogeyman during the debate, tying Newsom to the president, who continues to suffer underwater approval ratings. “I’ll give Gavin credit. He did at least admit in his first answer, he’s joined at the hip with Biden and Harris,” DeSantis said at one point. “He thinks Biden and Harris have done a great job. He thinks the economy is working because of their policies for Americans and they are not.” “And so, what California represents is the Biden-Harris agenda on steroids. They would love nothing more than to get four more years to be able to take the California model nationally. That would be disastrous for working people in this country,” he added. Unsurprisingly, Newsom found himself as chief defender of the Biden-Harris administration during the debate, while trying to paint a stark contrast between Democrats and the Republican Party. “I’m here to tell the truth about the Biden-Harris record and also compare and contrast Ron DeSantis’s record and the Republican Party’s record as a point of contrast that’s as different as daylight and darkness,” Newsom said. It’s not the first time Newsom has positioned himself as a surrogate for the Biden campaign — he played a similar role during the second GOP debate in Simi Valley, Calif. The move strategically helped demonstrate his loyalty to the Biden campaign while also elevating his own national profile amid rumors that he might run for the White House himself. But the frequent mention of Biden also emphasized the extent to which Republicans like DeSantis believe the president is an albatross for Democrats heading into 2024. While sparks flew during the Fox News debate, it’s unlikely to change much for either governor. For DeSantis, he’s still struggling to catch up to Trump in the 2024 GOP primary as all signs increasingly point to the former president once again winning the nomination. He has notched key endorsements from Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) and influential Evangelical leader Bob Vander Plaats, but DeSantis still faces steep hurdles in polling out of the early primary states of New Hampshire and South Carolina, where he’s polling behind rival former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. For Newsom, the debate has boosted his national profile, though it’s hardly the first time the California Democrat has sought to position himself front and center in the public eye. It’s also unlikely to change the minds of the many conservatives watching the debate in an already hyper-partisan political environment. Still, both men came out of the event being praised by their respective sides — a sign that the event served some purpose for them. Submit Δ Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

video Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video SEATTLE — No state in the U.S. is more heavily impacted by retail theft than Washington, a new Forbes study shows. The Forbes Retail Theft Index found that Washington gets 48% more reported retail thefts than the state should based on its population. Only the District of Columbia and North Dakota, which both have much smaller populations than Washington, had a larger Retail Theft Index figure. Washington also was the third-worst state when it comes to the total value of stolen goods per resident, with $347 being lost for each resident of the state. Pennsylvania and California were the only two states with a higher total, and the study's average was $173. Only the District of Columbia sees a larger proportion of larceny thefts per 100,000 residents than Washington, which had 2,306 incidents per 100,000 residents in 2022. The 24% rise in larceny thefts from 2019 to 2022 is also the second-largest in the nation behind Vermont, per FBI crime data. Forbes also cited U.S. Chamber of Commerce data from 2021 that shows Washington lost an average of $78 per resident in tax revenue due to retail theft. West Virginia ($119 per resident) lost the most with Pennsylvania and California also ahead of the Evergreen State. The four states coming in behind Washington on Forbes' list are District of Columbia, Maine, Hawaii and Pennsylvania, respectively. Wyoming was the state least affected by retail theft, with Idaho, Mississippi, Georgia and Alabama rounding out the bottom five. Major retailer Target announced earlier this year that it was shuttering two Seattle locations due in part to a rise in retail theft. Target said in May that theft was cutting into its bottom line and it expected related losses could be $500 million more than last year, when losses from theft were estimated to be anywhere from $700 million to $800 million. So that means losses could top $1.2 billion this fiscal year. The National Retail Federation, the nation’s largest retail trade group, said its latest security survey of roughly 177 retailers found that inventory loss — called shrink — clocked in at an average rate of 1.6% last year, representing $112.1 billion in losses. That's up from 1.4% the previous year. Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who is a candidate for governor of Washington, announced the first criminal prosecution by his new Organized Crime Retail Unit last week. Shawn Nanez, a 33-year-old from Bremerton, was charged in connection with 11 thefts where over $50,000 of merchandise was stolen from Target locations in King and Kitsap counties.

work, they make lower wages and are more likely to be arrested. In California, foster youth are three times as likely to drop out of public K-12 schools at 8% compared to 3% for the rest of the student population. Of those students in the public assistance system, only 58% of foster youth students will graduate from high school. Of those, only 3% will ever get a degree from a 4-year college compared to the general student population, with 33% receiving 4-year degrees. Sade Burrell of San Diego is defying the odds. She grew up in San Diego’s foster care system. She’s a single mom. And now, she’s got a doctoral degree from the University of California at San Diego. Burrell could very well change the foster care system in California. Burrell is the second oldest of seven children. She was born in San Diego and grew up in City Heights. She says when the State of California took her and her siblings from their mother and put them in foster care, it forever changed their lives. She says her aunt got them out of foster homes, but then, “I had a social worker pull me out of my aunt's house and put me in Polinsky Children Center, and from the children's center, I went to Juvenile Hall and a group home. And it was because I was labeled as a bad apple. I went to 5 different elementary schools. I went to 1 middle school, and I believe I went to 4 high schools.” 37& of all foster youth drop out of high school. But Sade beat the odds. She got a job, and with the help of the UP program, she started Cuyamaca College. UP stands for Unlimited Potential—a program for foster and at-risk youth. When she aged out of foster care, she lived in transitional housing at the YMCA called Turning Point, then went to a home program that supports students from Foster Care. Burrell says, “I worked throughout college. I worked at the YMCA. I coached little 3, 4, and 5 years old in T-ball, soccer, and things like that.” She got a bachelor’s degree in Social Work from San Diego State. She went on to earn a Masters degree in Social Work from the University of Southern California. “Yeah, I’m a Trojan. Fight on!” She chuckles. This single mom of 2 has her Doctoral Education in Educational Leadership from the University of California at San Diego. She says, “I had a village of people who could see I was trying, and they would help me out.” Those in her village came to see her defend her dissertation at UC San Diego. She showed the academic community the research she did to get her degree. And before the presentation, she prayed with her son and daughter. She says, “My kids, they get to see it. It's like the cycle of abuse has stopped. I cry when I think about it.” Her goal now? To improve the lives of kids who find themselves in foster care. To help them get an education. And show them- anything is possible. “I would say to my youngest self it will be alright. It will be some trials, a lot of tribulations, and many hardships. But you’re going to make it through.” Currently, Burrell works at San Diego Mesa College and ensures other foster youth with a similar background can get a college education. She says from here, she will advocate making a college education accessible to all foster youth in California. She says the state of Texas has been doing it for years, making getting a higher education something foster youth can entertain.

Much like his fellow soul singers Bettye LaVette and the late Sharon Jones and Charles Bradley, gritty funk shouter Fields delivers impassioned, heart-on-the-sleeve vocals that hearken back to the music\'s classic \'60s era. Fields started his recording career in 1969 after relocating from his home in North Carolina to New York City while still in his teens. With moves, a sound and even a physical resemblance to James Brown, Fields earned the nickname ""Little J.B."" and recorded a cover of Brown\'s 1959 hit ""Bewildered"" for his first single release on the Bedford Records label. He would put out a number of funk 45s for a variety of different labels during the early \'70s while sharing stages with such notables as Kool & the Gang and O.V. Wright. He would work with the label Angle 3 Records during the latter part of the decade, eventually issuing his first full album, Let\'s Talk It Over, in 1979. While his mix of sweaty funk workouts and soulful ballads didn\'t find an audience at the height of the disco era (Fields would eventually start working in real estate to support his family during the 1980s), the effort later became a coveted collectors item, selling for hundreds of dollars. Fields would return to music during the \'90s, initially recording a couple of synth-heavy soul/blues albums for Ace Records before connecting with Gabriel Roth and Phillip Lehman and their NYC-based imprint Desco Records for a series of singles that were a throwback to Fields\' earlier James Brown-inspired work. That label would evolve, splitting into Daptone Records and Soul Fire Records. The two companies would feature Fields and Sharon Jones on a number of 45s and albums, elevating the singers as two of the foremost classic \'60s sound and funk revivalists of the 2000s. Fields has put out a series of outstanding R&B albums, most recently issuing the acclaimed 2016 effort Special Night on Big Crown Records. The singer\'s uncanny vocal emulation of James Brown led him to provide the singing voice for the Brown biopic Get On Up in 2014. Along with his talented backing band the Expressions, Fields and company have established a well-deserved reputation as a scorching live act that has become a staple of music festivals across the globe, appearing on the main stage at Outside Lands in 2017 and co-headlining a Stern Grove concert with reggae legends Toots and the Maytals two years later. For his latest album, Fields reunited with Daptone Records co-founder and producer Roth last year to record Sentimental Fool backed by the label\'s all-star stable of session players for one of the singer\'s most emotionally charged efforts in years. Fresh from an Australian tour earlier this month, Fields and the Expressions come to the Chapel for a pair of concerts produced by folkYEAH including a New Year\'s Eve celebration. The headliners receive support from local Ethiopian jazz-funk interpreters Sun Hop Fat both nights, with DJ sets from Tylawave and her partner and Bay Area soul singer James Wavey on New Year\'s Eve. Lee Fields also performs at the Rio Theatre in Santa Cruz on Dec. 29.

Ch. 3 is broadcast at 60 Mhz and Ch. 14 is broadcast at 470 Mhz. You’ll want to check the specifications of the antenna before buying to make sure the antenna can receive those frequencies. An antenna that is known to receive low-VHF through UHF signals is a Channel Master CM 3018. These antennas are large and are meant to be mounted on a pole on your roof or chimney. Some people don’t like the look of an antenna on the roof of their home so it can also be mounted inside an attic if you have enough space. Just be aware that doing so will lower the signal strength and may make it so you are unable to receive the signal at all depending on your location. Our main transmitters are located in Kneeland for both Ch.3 and Ch. 14 so you’ll want to aim the small end of your antenna towards there to get the best signal strength. We also have translators in Hoopa and Shelter Cove that rebroadcast our signal in those areas where our main transmitters won’t reach. Below you’ll find coverage maps for our OTA signal Coverage Maps NBC Ch. 3 KIEM Main Transmitter- https://www.rabbitears.info/contour.php?appid=f0a15eb4b05a4f9f97d0cf6212b6c0ea&site=1&map=Y NBC Ch. 3 KIEM Hoopa Translator – https://www.rabbitears.info/contour.php?appid=17d72c9cd7ae4c6897d7cf6212b6c0ea&site=1&map=Y NBC Ch. 3 KIEM Shelter Cove Translator – https://www.rabbitears.info/contour.php?appid=8454aac897db42e39a19cf6212b6c0ea&site=1&map=Y CBS Ch. 14 KVIQ Transmitter – https://www.rabbitears.info/contour.php?appid=25076ff35f490dae015f4f7a45310a22&site=1&map=Y We are using cookies to give you the best experience on our website.

Those neighborhoods are often located in areas that are growing in population overall, including parts of Florida, Texas and the region around Washington, D.C. The results underscore how flood risk – which is growing due to climate change – is already affecting where Americans live. ""People are being more selective about where they live,"" says Jeremy Porter, one of the authors of the study and a researcher at the First Street Foundation, a research and advocacy organization that publishes analyses about climate hazards including flooding. The study was published in the journal Nature Communications. Americans are flocking to some of the most flood-prone parts of the country, including coastal areas, and low-lying cities in Florida, Texas and coastal Virginia. At the same time, heavy rain and sea level rise from climate change means floods are getting larger and more frequent. As a result, the cost of flood damage in the U.S. has skyrocketed in recent years. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, home insurance companies and climate and housing experts all warn that huge financial losses from flood damage are not sustainable for families or the economy. At the same time, people buying homes are increasingly aware, and wary, of flood risk. More and more states are requiring that homebuyers receive information about whether a house has flooded before, and whether it is likely to flood in the future. Some real estate listing sites include information about flood risk. And people are less likely to search for flood-prone properties when they are given information as part of the listing about whether a home flooded in the past or is likely to flood in the future, according to a study by the real estate website Redfin. But if people are trying to avoid moving to flood zones, why are so many people ending up in the most flood-prone parts of the country? The authors of the new study offer some new insight. They looked at the number of people living in each of the more than 11 million census blocks in the contiguous U.S., and analyzed how that number changed in places with high exposure to floods versus lower exposure to floods. They found that about 7% of census blocks – which are roughly the size of a city block – are experiencing population decline due to flood exposure. They estimate that those neighborhoods saw a net loss of about 9 million residents between 2000 and 2020. And they found that many of those neighborhoods are located in places that are growing overall, such as South Florida and Southeast Texas. The results suggest that the influx of new residents into flood-prone cities such as Miami and San Antonio may obscure the millions of people who are moving more locally to get away from the lowest-lying neighborhoods in those cities. Moves to the Sun Belt ""are a macro migration trend,"" explains Porter. ""But they\'re dwarfed by the amount of people that move within their same city. Keep the same job, keep the same friends, stay close to family."" Previous research has found that most people stay local when they move to a new home, including in situations where a flood disaster forced them to relocate. That means decisions about where to live and how to stay out of harm\'s way often come down to block-by-block or even house-by-house comparisons. And, while flood risk appears to play a role in where people choose to live, social factors including race and class are also hugely important, says Kevin Loughran, a sociologist at Temple University who studies relocation from flood zones. ""Flood risk, or environmental risk in general, is not the only criteria they\'re using to make these decisions,"" says Loughran. The new study offers a new level of national insight into how flood risk might be affecting local trends in population, he says. But the details are still fuzzy, and further research is underway by social scientists and others to study exactly how people who live in areas threatened by climate hazards decide whether, and where, to move.
