business is booming in Dahlonega. And Sam McDuffie brought the credit card receipts to prove it at two local meetings this month. The Lumpkin County Tourism Director provided a behind-the-scenes look at spending stats during his annual report for fiscal year 2022 to the Dahlonega City Council and the Lumpkin County Board of Commissioners. For starters, McDuffie noted in his dual presentations that Lumpkin is experiencing a competitive growth rate that places it fifth out of 34 counties in growth within the newly-designated Mountain Region. “We’ve seen a 44 percent growth rate of visitor spending here in Lumpkin County. We’re in the top five of growth rate in 2021… I’ll be excited to see 2022 numbers,” McDuffie said. As for actual spending, McDuffie had several interesting statistics to report thanks to a partnership with credit card tracking company Adara. “We recently received a report from a company called Adara that looks over credit card expenditures. We were able to track almost $69 million dollars in credit card spending from tourists, directly. That’s anybody that does not have a 30533 zip code. We take [30533] out of the picture. That means it’s actually from visitor expenditures,” McDuffie explained. The report compiled by Adara tracked the spending habits of 97,841 travelers across 347,241 transactions over the past year. Each traveler spent approximately $169.24 on a daily basis during their visits to the county. The average spend was $47.60 per transaction. The largest share of visitor spending came from area food stores and restaurants. Some of the top earners of tourist dollars in this category included Wal-Mart, Paul Thomas Chocolates, Gold City Growlers, Montaluce Winery, Shenanigan’s Irish Pub, and Rooster’s Cafe, among others. McDuffie went on to explain how visitor spending benefits local residents in the community. “If we did not have tourists in Dahlonega and Lumpkin County, every household would be paying $577 more on their taxes. So visitor direct tourism spending saves all of us Lumpkin County residents $577 a year,” McDuffie stated. REACHING OUT “I guess what’s mainly important is this year we’ve actually been able to put almost $300,000 into marketing Dahlonega and Lumpkin County due to the increase of hotel/motel tax,” said McDuffie as he outlined the efforts undertaken by the Dahlonega-Lumpkin County Chamber & Visitors Bureau over the last year to boost tourism to the area. He began by discussing a major advertising push that coincided with one of Georgia’s most iconic sporting events. “We did the Augusta billboard this year during the Augusta Nationals. Huge success with that, it was right on the exit where the Masters was, on Exit 199 outside of Augusta,” McDuffie said. McDuffie views billboards in general as an important tool for reaching out to Georgia travelers. “We’ve got a billboard coming in from the south, in Chattanooga and Ringgold. We put a Discover Dahlonega billboard outside of Macon, Georgia, in Byron. We’ve got a billboard coming out of Birmingham, and we also have a billboard coming out of Greenville now. So we’re trying to catch everybody that’s coming to Dahlonega. When I was driving up the interstate this year I saw Pickens County, Alpine Helen, and Blue Ridge billboards, so it’s something [needed] to stay competitive in the industry,” McDuffie said. Of course television is another big way to reach potential visitors, and Dahlonega is making its presence known in terms of both individual TV show episodes and commercials. “We also have done two TV shows. The most recent is a T.V. show called ‘Wine First.’ It gets ten million views per episode, and that will go live in March. So we’re very excited about that, and that is a worldwide show through Georgia Public Broadcasting. We also did a show called ‘Fork in the Road’ which really focuses on the cultural history of Lumpkin County. We highlighted Big Creek Distillery, Red Oak Lavender, and a couple others,” McDuffie said. As for more traditional forms of advertising, McDuffie said “We’ve done two [commercials] this year and we’re just wrapping up our third, which is going to focus on a winter commercial (mainly Christmas-oriented)… And then of course print advertisement: we’ve been in Southern Living, Atlanta Magazine, Explore Georgia (the state visitor guide that goes out to 200,000 people a year, and even with The Mountain Traveller which comes out with The Dahlonega Nugget.” ‘TRENDING UP’ McDuffie also had positive news to report regarding traffic to the tourism website Dahlonega.org. “Our website has 1.1 million page views as of 10/31… we’re probably going to see an increase on that this year. So that’s pretty nice. And we’ve increased our average session duration of how long people spend on our website up to 2 minutes 23 seconds, and the average for the tourism industry is less than a minute. So we’re definitely getting people to stay on our websites. They’re intrigued with what we’re offering; they’re intrigued with our area,” McDuffie stated. County Commissioner Bobby Mayfield indicated that he was particularly impressed with the web statistics. “I used to do that for the county a long time ago, and 2 minutes and 23 seconds on a page is significant. That means someone is reading something or downloading something, and the fact that they have 2.85 pages per session means that [one] page took them to another page. So we’re serving our community very well with that website,” Mayfield said. At McDuffie’s presentation before the city council, Councilman Johnny Ariemma asked what factors separate Lumpkin County from the fastest-growing county on the list, Fannin County. “What they have that we don’t have is short-term rentals. They have over 1,400 short-term rentals in Fannin County alone. Lumpkin County has 248 short-term rentals,” McDuffie replied. McDuffie also cited the limited number of available hotel rooms in Dahlonega as a limiting factor for growth in the county, but he expects that situation to improve over time. “We only have about 840 rooms in the whole county. I think we’ll continue to see growth for the next couple years. Hopefully as the hospital opens up, and a few other things open up, I think we’ll probably see the number of rooms increase, and our hotel/motel tax [collections] will as well.” McDuffie concluded his presentation to the city on a confident note. “We’re definitely trending up, and I don’t think we’ve plateaued yet,” McDuffie said.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:33 pm Christopher Jenkins Michael Morris A Haralson County sergeant was able to seize drugs from a traffic stop after initially pulling the individual over for not having valid insurance. According to a Facebook post made by the Haralson County Sheriff’s Office, on Nov. 11, Sgt. Terry McAdams pulled over a vehicle for having no insurance. It was later determined that the driver was Michael Aaron Morris, 44, of Bremen. The other occupant was Christopher Michael Jenkins, 36, of Douglasville. During the traffic stop, one of the individuals had a warrant out of Carroll County and was taken into custody. The other person in the vehicle admitted that there were drugs in the car, according to HCSO officials. Inside the vehicle, a bag was located that contained multiple bags of marijuana and methamphetamine along with pipes and scales. Both occupants of the car denied the bag belonged to them so both were charged with possession of methamphetamine. Morris was additionally charged with no insurance. The investigation has been turned over to the Haralson-Paulding Drug Task Force. Morris was released from the Haralson County Jail on a $5,362 bond. Jenkins remains in jail, but has a $25,000 bond set. Christopher Jenkins Michael Morris Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles. Success!

You take away his food supply. That\'s the crux of the Marvel Comics miniseries ""Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter,"" also available in a collected trade paperback. Beta Ray Bill has the power, and look, of the Mighty Thor. Odin even created an enchanted hammer, Stormbreaker, for Beta Ray Bill. But to wield it, just like Thor with his hammer Mjolnir, Beta Ray Bill must be worthy. Beta Ray Bill sets out on a mission to stop Galactus, an intergalactic being who devours the energies, resources and life forces of planets. Galactus devoured Bill\'s world and Beta Ray Bill wants vengeance. So, he hunts Galactus across the universe. If Galactus can\'t eat, Galactus will die. To keep Galactus from devouring worlds, Beta Ray Bill will deny him a meal. In other words, to stop Galactus from destroying worlds, Beta Ray Bill will destroy the worlds first. Beta Ray Bill sees it as a noble mission but will the judgment of Stormbreaker agree? ""Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter"" is a good feature for Bill who has been mostly a recurring supporting character for decades in Thor and other Marvel comics. It poses an interesting dilemma and features Galactus along with his original herald, the Silver Surfer. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

requirements next July after several years of legal wrangling over the controversial proposal. “I can confirm that we are moving forward with implementing the Pathways plan,” said Andrew Isenhour, a spokesman for Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. The limited Medicaid expansion plan will require enrollees to work, study or volunteer for at least 80 hours per month. “No one who currently qualifies for Medicaid will be affected by the new program,” Isenhour said. “It is important to note that we are only adding people to the Medicaid rolls with this program. Georgia Pathways will expand Medicaid to otherwise ineligible Georgians who satisfy the work, job training, education, or volunteer requirements.” Around 345,000 additional Georgians will become eligible for Medicaid under the new plan, as long as they meet other requirements, Isenhour added. Georgians whose incomes are below the federal poverty level (currently $13,590 for one person) will be eligible for the insurance. To get the insurance, Georgians will need to work or perform other qualifying activities such as vocational training, education, job readiness programs or community service. Some enrollees will pay monthly premiums ranging from $7 to $16, depending on income and tobacco use. Kemp has made the Pathways plan a cornerstone of his health-care policy. While 39 states have now opted for Medicaid expansion plans that allow low-income people to obtain health care, Kemp and other Georgia Republican leaders remain opposed to full Medicaid expansion, citing concerns about costs to the state and consumers. Instead, the Republican-led General Assembly approved the more limited Medicaid expansion proposal back in 2019. In October 2020, while Republican Donald Trump was still president, the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) approved Georgia’s Pathways plan. After Democratic President Joe Biden took office in January of last year, CMS rescinded approval for the work-requirement plans in Georgia along with 13 other states. Although the other states, including Arkansas and Indiana, dropped their work-requirement plans, lawyers for Georgia sued in federal court. They argued the federal government, and CMS in particular, had overstepped its authority in blocking the work-requirement proposal. In August, a U.S. District judge agreed, effectively allowing the Pathway plan to move forward. Although the federal government could have appealed to a circuit court, it has not done so, opening the door for Georgia to forge ahead with the new plan.

Hunter has succeeded Robin Rhodes as executive director of Georgia Press Association (GPA). Rhodes will continue working through a transition period and will continue to represent GPA at the state legislature on issues important to the newspaper industry. Jaillene Hunter Hunter joins GPA after a career working in communications at the state and federal government levels. She was press secretary for Rep. Max Burns and Rep. Dave Weldon in Washington, D.C., and then served as communications director for Georgia Lieutenant Gov. Casey Cagle, working on issues such as transportation, economic development, government spending, health care and education. Since then she has worked on communications strategies and initiatives for state government, small businesses, legislative initiatives and nonprofits. Eight additional legislators — on both sides of the aisle — have signed on as co-sponsors of the Community News & Small Business Support Act (HR 4756). The act was introduced in the 118th Congress by Congresswoman Claudia Tenney (NY-24) and Congresswoman Suzan DelBene (WA-1), both members of the Ways and Means Committee. The bipartisan legislation supports two institutions critical to sustaining hometown communities: local news organizations and small businesses. The act makes refundable tax credits available to local newspapers to reinvest in professional journalists who cover local news topics. The act also makes non-refundable tax credits available to local businesses that advertise with local newspapers, providing an additional stimulus to the local economy. “Thank you to for supporting this important legislation,” said Dean Ridings, CEO of America’s Newspapers. “On behalf of the members of America’s Newspapers, we appreciate your support of local community newspapers and Main Street businesses. The Community News & Small Business Support Act is a big win for local communities. More local reporting means more access to the hometown news citizens rely on. And stronger newspapers mean stronger advertising vehicles for local businesses.” Georgia Press Association wants to know how your newspaper is using the Local Matters campaign materials. Have you created house ads? Rack cards? Other promotional materials? What ideas have you developed? Local Matters is your opportunity to use a ready-made campaign and improve your business.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:55 pm Splatoon (Nintendo Switch) Nintendo has never really been known for being as into the shooter genre of games as their competitors but they made some massive waves when the first “Splatoon” hit the Wii U back in 2015. Seven years later, the third entry in what’s become one of their most successful properties has helped the series make an even bigger splash. “Splatoon 3” follows in the footsteps of its previous entries through the series’ unique spin on team-based shooters; instead of typical ammunition, the weapons you use in game fire ink, making your team’s goal not only taking down your rivals but painting the battlefield around you. The weapons themselves also don’t follow usual norms, instead practically oozing with the series’ charm; rather than pistols and machine guns, the Inklings and Octolings of Splatsville charge into battle with water guns, buckets and oversized paint rollers, among other things. Every weapon in the game has its own strengths and weaknesses, each one functioning very differently from the others, giving players a lot of options to experiment with and find their personal role in their squad. “Splatoon 3’s” various modes take the basic idea of “shoot more ink than the enemy” and run with it in their own fun and creative ways, offering players a variety of unique and carefully crafted experiences to choose from – from 4v4, to 4vHorde, to a more contained single player experience. The series’ story modes are always a delight and the campaign on display in “3” is definitely one of the best the series has ever had. Expanding on concepts from the previous game, players can tackle the levels of each area in any order, with each level giving them a specific weapon or set of weapons to complete the mission. In this way, the campaign almost becomes a tutorial for many of the game’s weapons, sub-weapons and specials. Some of the levels can definitely be tricky, especially if you’re still getting used to a weapon, but it’s still generally a great learning experience for new players that’s also just really fun to play. And while it might be a small thing to some, it’s impossible to skip over how much livelier and personalized “Splatoon 3” feels compared to its predecessors Not only is the area of Splatsville you get to explore so much bigger and more packed with content than earlier hubworlds but the series’ iconic Splatfests, where players back a team and compete for dominance based around a specific theming like sci-fi vs. fantasy, have never been more vibrant and festive, now featuring three teams to pick from and a chaotic three-way battle mode. “Splatoon 3” also offers a heaping of customization, going from appearances and clothing to character tags, titles and personalized lockers. Even options like hairstyles, which used to be gender-locked, are now completely unrestricted, giving players as much freedom with their avatars as they want. A big sticking point, however, is that every mode in this game, aside from the story mode, requires an Internet connection, and unfortunately, the servers are still having some hiccups when it comes to maintaining connection between players. As a silver lining, though, “Splatoon 3” is very much still in its larval stages, and, like its predecessors, is set to receive an ocean of updates to add more content and fix any lasting bugs. If you’re a fan of the series or just starting out for the first time, definitely give this game a try. Shooters have never been my thing but this is by no means a normal shooter – and I wouldn’t have it any other way. Davis Cobb is a reporter with The Tifton Gazette.

Dionne Warwick, daughter of Lee Drinkard. Von Trapp Family of “Sound of Music” fame has nothing on the Drinkard family of Early County. The Drinkard descendants include Cissy Drinkard, who sang backup for Elvis Presley, Dionne Warwick, the most prolific female hitmaker of the late 1960s, and Cissy Drinkard’s daughter, Whitney Houston, one of the most beloved singers of modern time. The family history began with John Drinkard, Sr., who was born in Mississippi before 1850 and arrived in Georgia before 1862. After the war, the Drinkard family lived in the Hilton area of Early County. Tax records show that John Drinkard’s wife, Victoria, owned 62.5 acres of land, making them among the earliest known black landowners in the county. John Drinkard, Sr., died in 1925 and was buried in Ebenezer Cemetery at Hilton. One of his grandsons was named Nicholas. Known as “Nitch,” Nicholas had eight children. The first three were born in Early County, the last five were born after Nitch moved to Newark, New Jersey. The last child to be born in Early County was a daughter named Lee. The last child to be born in New Jersey was a daughter named Emily. It was Nitch Drinkard who encouraged his children to form a gospel singing group in Newark. The Drinkard Quartet consisted of sisters Anne and Emily, and brothers Nick and Larry. Sister Lee Drinkard served as manager. Another sister, Marie, joined the group and they became the Drinkard Singers. They performed in New Jersey and New York, and after an appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival, they recorded their first gospel album. Emily Drinkard, better known as Cissy, married first to Freddie Garland and gave birth to son Gary, a future NBA player, and later married John Houston. In 1963, Cissy and her nieces, Dee Dee and Dionne Warwick, sang background on the original version of “Time is on My Side,” which later became the Rolling Stones first top ten hit.

They recorded with Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin and Jimi Hendrix. The Sweet Inspirations provided background vocals on the Van Morrison hit “Brown Eyed Girl.”. In 1969, the Sweet Inspirations were hired as backup singers for Elvis Presley during his performances at Las Vegas and they can be heard on two of his live recordings.

Lee Drinkard’s daughters went on to perform under the names Dee Dee and Dionne Warwick. Dee Dee Warwick had performed as one of the Drinkard Singers, and along with her sister and Aunt Cissy, formed a gospel trio called the Gospelaires. Dee Dee was credited with recording the earliest known version of “ You’re No Good” and she also recorded the original version of “I’m Gonna Make You Love Me.” Dionne Warwick has sold more than 100 million records and won six Grammy awards. She is the second most charted female vocalist of the rock era with 56 singles making the Hot 100, twelve in the Top Ten.

Despite being one of the most successful recording artists of all-time, Dionne Warwick was not the most successful in her own family. A background vocalist while still in high school, Whitney Houston became a successful model during her teen years. Early hit songs included “How Will I Know,” “Greatest Love of All,” and “I Wanna Dance With Somebody.” She was also noted for her cover of the Dolly Parton song “I Will Always Love You,” and her rendition of the “Star Spangled Banner.” Houston went on to star in movies such as “The Bodyguard” and “The Preacher’s Wife.” Whitney Houston won two Emmy Awards to go along with her eight Grammy Awards.

Shortly after congregants learned that a familiar billboard in front of the church at 1952 Ga. Hwy 21 had been defaced by spray paint and a vile message overnight, it was replaced with a new one. The substitute sign wasn’t an exact copy of the original but displayed the same opinion: “God doesn’t make mistakes. Choose life!” The vandalism occurred about a month after the U.S. Supreme Court changed the landscape of abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade and just hours before the 11th U.S. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals upheld Georgia’s “heartbeat” abortion law. The state statute bans abortions after detection of a fetal heartbeat. St. Boniface congregant Yvette Carr was outraged by the trashing of the sign. “That’s definitely wrong,” she said. “Here in American, we have the freedom to express our opinions and to participate in marches. However, that freedom of speech doesn’t allow us to deface banners or destroy things that are not on our property.” Carr voiced strong support for HB 481, which went into effect immediately following the appeals court ruling. It prohibits physicians, except in certain situations, from offering abortions to pregnant women after a fetal heartbeat is present. This typically occurs in the sixth week of pregnancy. “I agree that once a heartbeat is detected no abortion should be performed,” Carr said. “If protestors would put themselves in one of their parents’ mind when they found out Mom was pregnant, they should be thankful that Mom didn’t have an abortion.” After being asked to comment about the incident, Fr. Martino Nguyen referred the Herald to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Savannah. “As a diocese, we pray for a conversion of heart for those responsible for the vandalism at St. Boniface,” said Jill Parks, the diocese’s communications director. “Incidents such as these underscore the importance of rejecting a culture of death and working instead to build a culture of life that recognizes the beauty and dignity of every person. It is our responsibility to respect, love and protect the sanctity of God’s creation, recognizing the incomparable value of human life from its very beginning until its end. “Life is sacred.”'}]"
