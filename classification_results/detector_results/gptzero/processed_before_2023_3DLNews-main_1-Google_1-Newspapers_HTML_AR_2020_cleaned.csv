Valdes, a first-year player on the Women\'s All Pro Tour competing in the NWA Charity Classic this week in Bella Vista, had just completed a practice round at the Scotsdale Golf Course. After the round, Valdes and her boyfriend, Alberto Doniga, retired to the home of host family Kathy and Maurice King, who live high above Loch Lomond.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': ""Arkansas Tech's official student newspaper Photo Credit: Goodreads Now, you’re probably thinking, “Not another young adult novel.” And I’m sorry, but I can’t seem to help myself when it comes to this genre. It’s a drug and I’m an addict. Next week I’ll try to mix it up but until then, let’s get into “And I Darken.” Kiersten White’s 2016 novel “And I Darken” is set in the 15th century Ottoman Empire. Lada and Radu are pawns in a political game. They are the children of the prince of Wallachia, a country under control by the Ottomans. Lada and Radu are long-time prisoners by the Ottomans to secure their father’s obedience. During their imprisonment, they befriend the son to the sultan, Mehmed, but that friendship drags them into a world they don’t know, and in Lada’s case, don’t like. In order to protect Mehmed, the two siblings will sacrifice the freedom they are just beginning to receive and each other. Technically, and I mean, technically, “And I Darken” falls into the category of historical fiction. I don’t read a whole lot of historical fiction because it tends to lull me to sleep, but this novel was different. Since I’m basically clueless about the history of the Middle East, it was enlightening to read about some of the history that White gives us throughout the novel. I picked up a lot of information about Middle Eastern cultural practices from Lada and Radu’s story. Radu discovering Islam spoke to me because unlike the representation of the religion in the media, it’s portrayed so peacefully in “And I Darken.” Prayer was a beautiful thing to Radu, and it gave him a sense of calm and security when he normally didn’t have those emotions. The oppression of women in the Middle East becomes a stark image as we watch Lada struggle with who she is versus who society wants her to be. Lada isn’t a girl who likes to wear dresses. She doesn’t like needlework. She likes to wear trousers and beat up any man who challenges her. While all women, regardless of whether they lived or when, suffered from some sort of oppression by men, this novel includes the specific expectations the Ottoman Empire had for women. Harems were common in the empire, but not so common in a place like Britain, so Lada must fight against marrying someone who has several other wives or concubines. “And I Darken” isn’t specifically focused on the romance amongst the characters, but it does explore it some. I nearly fell out of my chair when I read a section that was LBGTQ+ inclusive. One of the main characters is gay. It’s freaking awesome, and the fact that I didn’t have to ask for it made it a thousand times better. I think while a lot of research went into this book (Kiersten White is a white woman) and time went into creating Lada and Radu’s environment and story, it does fall a little short in my opinion. I found the reaction the other characters had towards Lada completely unrealistic. 1) She gets a proper education equal to her brother’s with no resistance to the fact that she is a female. 2) She never gets punished for stepping beyond her gender. Never. 3) She’s allowed to train and hang out with male soldiers. This novel is set in the 15th century, and while I’m a feminist who supports strong women, Lada wouldn’t have just gone through life doing whatever she wanted. There should have been more of a struggle for her to achieve this almost equal-to-men status she has. It shouldn’t have just been given to her on a silver platter. Most women didn’t even receive an education in the time period the novel is set in. Women weren’t allowed to be alone with men without a chaperone. Like, where’s the realism? And don’t even get me started on how White destroyed Lada’s independence. She becomes weak when she’s around Mehmed? That completely goes against her bad-girl behavior. Does she have to sacrifice her happiness to be independent? Yes, because apparently power and happiness can’t be in the same room together. Lada’s whole character goes downhill in the last half of the novel. I was extremely disappointed in the decision to give Lada a lonely and heartbreaking ending. This last problem is small: the first half of the novel is so slow. The synopsis of the novel made me believe Lada and Radu would grow up in the Ottoman Empire, not just suddenly go there when they’re teenagers. A quarter of the novel does nothing more than just tell us who the characters between the ages of one to 12. It doesn’t set up the conflict until almost halfway into the book when it should’ve been given sooner to increase interest and clue me in to what will eventually happen. The unrealistic situation, the ruin of Lada’s character, and the slow start really destroyed the potential “And I Darken” had. Will I finish the series? Maybe. I don’t want to waste money on a series I can’t fully get behind. Can I recommend this novel? No. There are better ones.""}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 12:42 pm A new unit has been created at the White County Sheriff\'s Office to assist with handling certain crimes in the county, according to Sheriff Phillip Miller. With the new year and with the help of the White County Quorum Court to provide budget support, Miller said the department has formed a Street Crime Unit that consists of Deputy Cpl. Eddie Allen and Deputy Paul McIntosh. Miller said Allen and his K-9 partner Hart will focus on interdicting ""dope dealers"" and suspects who are trafficking narcotics throughout county roads as well as trafficking it from their homes. McIntosh\'s role will consist of concentrating on thefts that include four-wheelers, lawn mowers, trailers and any property that has ""unique identifiers,"" Miller said. This patrol also will aid in ""organizing saturations"" and will assist in tracking and communicating with patrol about trouble areas. Asked about the Quorum Court\'s role, Miller said ""midyear last year they provided funding for the K-9 and this year, I had asked to make some changes as far as positions so I could put additional boots on the ground."" The Street Crime Unit, Miller said, is responsible for identifying problems within the community, creating solutions for these problems and implementing the solution. ""The members of the unit are going to be proactive in their approach to policing and performing their duties in both plainclothes and uniformed assignments,"" Miller said. According to Miller, the unit ""predominantly targets"" high crime areas that that are identified as having ""known"" offenders or ""spikes"" in crime rates and will implement ""innovative ideas"" to thwart criminal activity. ""On average, the members of this unit make an arrest every shift they work,"" Miller said. Three goals of the unit were given by Miller. First, ""the on-scene apprehension of the suspect and successfully prosecuting criminals offenders within White County."" Second, Miller said, is for the unit to gather information on all types of criminal activity by maintaining ""continual contact"" with the general public, placing emphasis on their troubled areas and to effectively utilize the information that is provided by concerned members of the community. Third is to ""create a deterrent"" for ""persons intent on committing criminal acts"" within White County.

Associated Press LONDON -- Sean Connery, the charismatic Scottish actor who rose to international superstardom as the suave secret agent James Bond and then abandoned the role to carve out an Oscar-winning career in other rugged roles, has died. He was 90. Connery\'s wife and two sons said he ""died peacefully in his sleep surrounded by family"" in the Bahamas, where he lived. Son Jason Connery said his father had been ""unwell for some time."" Bond producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they were ""devastated"" by the news. They said Connery\'s ""gritty and witty portrayal of the sexy and charismatic secret agent"" was largely responsible for the success of the film series. ""He was and shall always be remembered as the original James Bond whose indelible entrance into cinema history began when he announced those unforgettable words -- \'The name\'s Bond... James Bond,\'"" they said in a statement. Daniel Craig, the current Bond, said Connery ""defined an era and a style"" and that the ""wit and charm he portrayed on screen could be measured in mega watts."" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the country was mourning ""one of her best loved sons."" Connery, was a commanding screen presence for some 40 years. He was in his early 30s -- and little known -- when he starred in the first Bond thriller, 1962\'s ""Dr. No,"" based on the Ian Fleming novel. Condemned as immoral by the Vatican and the Kremlin, but screened at the White House for Bond fan John F. Kennedy, ""Dr. No"" was a box office hit and launched a franchise that long outlasted its Cold War origins. United Artists couldn\'t wait to make more films about the British secret agent, with ever more elaborate stunts and gadgets, along with more exotic locales and more prominent co-stars, among them Lotte Lenya and Jill St. John. For decades, with actors from Connery to Craig in the leading role, filmgoers have loved the outrageous stunts, vicious villains and likable, roguish hero who enjoyed a life of carousing, fast cars, gadgety weapons, elegant clothes and vodka martinis (always shaken, not stirred). Connery continued as Bond in ""From Russia With Love,"" ""Goldfinger,"" ""Thunderball,"" ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" often performing his own stunts. ""Diamonds Are Forever"" came out in 1971 and by then Connery had grown weary of playing 007 and feared he wasn\'t being taken seriously despite his dramatic performances in Alfred Hitchcock\'s ""Marnie"" and Sidney Lumet\'s ""The Hill."" ""I\'d been an actor since I was 25, but the image the press put out was that I just fell into this tuxedo and started mixing vodka martinis,"" he once complained. When he walked away at age 41, Hollywood insiders predicted Connery would soon be washed up. Who would hire a balding, middle-aged actor with a funny accent? Connery fooled them all, playing a wide range of characters and proving equally adept at comedy, adventure or drama. And age only heightened the appeal of his dark stare and rugged brogue; he set a celebrity record of sorts when at age 59 he was named People magazine\'s ""Sexiest Man Alive."" He won the affection of fans of the ""Indiana Jones"" franchise when he played Indy\'s father opposite Harrison Ford in the third picture, 1989′s ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."" He turned in a poignant portrayal of an aging Robin Hood opposite Audrey Hepburn in ""Robin and Marian"" in 1976 and, 15 years later, was King Richard to Kevin Costner\'s Robin Hood in ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves."" He was the lovable English con man who joined Michael Caine in swindling people in a distant land in ""The Man Who Would Be King"" and the bold Russian submarine commander in ""The Hunt for Red October."" Connery delivered a charming performance as a reclusive writer who mentors a teenage prodigy in 2000\'s ""Finding Forrester."" He won his Oscar for supporting actor in 1987 for his portrayal of a tough Chicago cop who joins Elliot Ness\' crime-fighters in ""The Untouchables."" By then he was at peace with James Bond, and when he arrived onstage at the Oscars ceremony he declared, ""The name\'s Connery. Sean Connery."" He kept his promise not to play Bond again until 1983, when he was lured back by an offbeat script about a middle-aged 007. Based on the only Fleming story that hadn\'t been nailed down by the film empire Broccoli and Saltzman created, Connery took the role and helped produce the film. The result was ""Never Say Never Again,"" a title suggested by his wife, Micheline Roquebrune. Even as the 007 films made him a millionaire, Connery tried often to separate his own personality from that of Bond. ""I\'m obviously not Bond,"" he once said. ""And Bond is obviously not a human being. Fleming invented him after the war, when people were hungry for luxury, gourmet touches, exotic settings. Those were the things the English loved to read about following the privations of the war."" The ""real"" Sean Connery had a troubled first marriage and a history of comments justifying domestic violence. In 1962, he married Diane Cilento, an actress best known for her role as Molly in ""Tom Jones."" They had a son, Jason, who also became an actor, but the union proved tempestuous and ended in 1974. Its impact lasted long after. Cilento would allege that he had physically abused her and Connery defended his behavior in interviews. In 1965, he told Playboy magazine that he did not find ""anything particularly wrong about hitting a woman -- although I don\'t recommend doing it in the same way that you\'d hit a man.

Connery was widely criticized, but still received numerous honors, including being chosen as commander (the same rank as Bond) of France\'s Order of Arts and Literature and a Kennedy Center honoree in 1999. The following year Queen Elizabeth II proclaimed him a British knight, for services to film drama. In 2005 he was chosen for a lifetime achievement award by the American Film Institute.

2020 at 7:28 p.m. | Updated February 13, 2020 at 6:34 a.m. by Jason Hopkins , Gazette Staff TEXARKANA - Reactions from those who knew him flooded social media after learning of the death of former Texarkana Gazette Sports Director Johnny Green. Green, who spent 48 of his 49 years as a member or in charge of the Gazette sports department, died Tuesday in a local hospital. He was 76. ""Johnny took a chance on me, as an inexperienced sports writer with just one semester of journalism, and that was 17 years ago. Johnny was rarely surprised by news; he seemed to know it before anyone else. He was a great mentor, boss and friend. He had a passion for sports, writing and people, especially coaches and student-athletes. Not everyone always agreed with him, but I don\'t know of anyone who didn\'t respect him. ""Johnny loved his family, and we all mourn their loss. He was one of a kind and will be sorely missed."" -Texarkana Gazette Sports Editor Josh Richert ""For 18 years, we talked several times a week, went to ballgames together, we were friends. Johnny was probably one of the best writers I\'ve ever been around. Professionally, he was outstanding, but stronger than that were the friendships he developed with everybody through the years. You always knew where you stood with him, and he was about as good a friend as you could have."" -Arkansas High head football coach and former Texas High football coach Barry Norton, via interview ""I was around Johnny Green for about 23 years and I have no doubt that he was the best sports editor ever. He was a pleasure to work with and be around. I thought the world of him and always had the highest confidence in his ability to cover the whole region, not just Texarkana, but the whole area. I knew when I went to church on Sunday and someone wanted to talk about the sports section, Johnny had my back and it was already covered. Some of my fondest memories I have are going to the sports department and arguing with him over Arkansas and Texas sports. I honestly enjoyed talking with him - it was always the highlight of my day. I called him, \'Guru,\' because there was no one else that knew sports as well as he did. There were a lot of people who came through with plenty of sports knowledge, but he was the top dog. I\'m sure going to miss him."" -Former Texarkana Gazette Publisher Buddy King, via interview ""I first met Johnny at a Lufkin vs. Texas High baseball game back in 1990, three years into my career as a sports writer. I was still learning the business and wasn\'t very smart, but I was smart enough to know when you get a chance to learn from someone who has been in the business for a long time you soak up everything you can from them. Johnny was great about letting me, as a young guy just trying to learn, pick his brain. I have stuck around long enough to be one of the old guys now, and it was always fun to cover a game with Johnny later in our careers and talk about how things were done in the ""good old days."" He can watch games from the best seat in the house now. He definitely earned it."" -Longview News-Journal Sports Editor Jack Stallard, via email ""I visited Johnny in the hospital about ten days ago and he knew that he didn\'t have much time left and he didn\'t want everyone to know that he was sick. I don\'t think that he could stand for people to fawn over him out of sympathy. He was old school and often brutally honest, but those qualities made him beloved. After we had a nice visit, his last words to me were ""get out of here now, I have to use the bathroom."" That made me laugh because it was perfectly Johnny Green."" -Leaving the Yard co-host Chuck Zach, via Facebook ""An absolute legend in #txhsfbmediamafia. I covered a few games with him, and his love of East Texas was unwavering. Rest in peace, Mr. Green."" -The Old Coach DFW sports writer Matt Diggs, via Twitter ""I took the spot that was vacated by Johnny when he retired in 2011 and Louie (Avery) was promoted to sports editor. Those were definitely big shoes to fill and I always enjoyed when Johnny would come in the office to talk sports or to give feedback on a story or column. We played golf together a time or two and were supposed to play again the next time I came down there. He always took the time to wish me happy birthday every year since I left the Gazette and would periodically check in with me and see how my kids were doing. The world is a little less bright without Johnny in it today."" -Former Texarkana Gazette sports writer Derek Oxford, via Facebook ""Tuesday night Texarkana and the surrounding area lost one of its greatest treasures. sports writer, umpire, husband, dad, granddad and friend Johnny Green passed from this earth. ""Johnny was a friend, a mentor, an encourager and had a wealth of knowledge to share."" -Contributing writer David Fant, via Twitter ""Sad news from the sports writing world."" -NWA Arkansas-Democrat sports writer Henry Apple, via Twitter ""Sad to hear about Texarkana media legend Johnny Green. I always enjoyed talking with Johnny every time we crossed paths, including the time I covered a doubleheader sitting between him and Louie. Thoughts with his family."" -Longview News-Journal sports writer Hayden Henry, via Twitter ""Just got word that former longtime Texarkana Gazette sports editor Johnny Green has passed away. I had the pleasure of meeting him and he gave me lots of advice when I first started."" -Observer/Houston Chronicle sports writer Marcus Gutierrez, via Twitter ""We lost one of the area\'s great newspaper men today. He was a dedicated, beyond knowledgeable sports writer, editor, and director for the newspaper where I started working. He was a man who was tough, but fair; calm regardless of the situation; and happy with his position and was a giant presence in a newsroom as well as in a press box."" -Marion County Herald Publisher Hugh Lewis III, via Facebook ""Such sad news. I spent many nights in the same press box with Johnny Green! He kept me in stitches with his comments. I loved working beside him at games. Truly one of the best sports journalists I got to call a friend."" -Journalism Advisor at Mount Pleasant High School, via Facebook ""Saddened to learn of the passing of longtime Texarkana Gazette Sports Editor/Writer and friend Johnny Green yesterday. Johnny always looked out for me when I was in the Texarkana area. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family."" -Longview News-Journal sports correspondent Joe Hale, via Twitter ""We lost a good one in the East Texas sportswriting with the passing of former Texarkana Gazette SE Johnny Green. He was huge baseball fan and loved the ChiSox."" -Longview News-Journal sports writer George Whitley ""Whew! This has really hit me hard. Johnny Green covering a game meant that it was an event. You were at a basketball playoff game at the ET Field House when I was in college. You needed to use my phone at the dorm to get your story sent to the Gazette. The Student Union Building was locked, so you and I climbed on top of the building and we walked across the roof to get to the parking lot. You covered the teams I coached and I knew I was doing a great job when you bragged on them. Because you never sugar coated a thing. After a tough fork in my career road, you hit me right between the eyes with the truth. But you also let me know you had my back. You were there less than a year ago to offer comfort and condolences in my time of loss. And you were the person I could count on to comment on my Facebook posts with the words of my father. Dad always referred to you as Big John. You will be so missed by family, friends, fans, and the fraternity of coaches. Rest In Peace."" -Jason Boston, former girls basketball coach at Pleasant Grove and Texas High, via Facebook ""Johnny Green it was a sincere pleasure to work with you. You were plain spoken, pragmatic, and loved what you did. Your Texarkana Gazette family always loved you. Thank you for your devotion to and your legacy in local journalism."" -Texarkana Gazette City Editor Christy Busby Worsham ""You were a big reason for my growth in journalism. We had many disagreements in our days together in the newsroom, particularly about sports. But you, my friend, made me better for it. I will always remember those late night conversations we had talking about sports.'}]"
