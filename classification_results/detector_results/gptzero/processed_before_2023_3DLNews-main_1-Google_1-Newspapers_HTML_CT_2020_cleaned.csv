Carley, who has taught English at HCC since 2009, was chosen from faculty members throughout the 17 Connecticut State Colleges and Universities across the state to be honored with the System-Wide Board of Regents Teaching Award.

The shop local movement spreads virally as local businesses who are “tagged” have the opportunity to share their story! You\'re IT Factory Underground! Four questions with Marc Alan, Director of Marketing of Factory Underground. Why did you start your business? Factory Underground was started by its two principal owners and partners, Ethan Isaac and Kenny ""Cash"" Cascioli. Ethan had been in the music business for many years, as a studio owner, as well as the singer of a rock band called Edisun that was based in Norwalk. It was through Edisun that Ethan toured extensively for Armed Forces Entertainment, performing in 20 countries including Iraq and Afghanistan for US servicemen and women. Meanwhile, Kenny was a Norwalk musician that had graduated from Berklee College of Music, and was looking to build his own studio, ""to be his own Paisley Park,"" he says in reference to his musical idol Prince. The two musicians both needed a place to record their own music, and with their goals in line, they decided to become business partners and build a commercial studio. The studio is located at 16 Isaac Street, in Downtown Norwalk, an underground industrial facility that has grown to encompass nearly 10,000 square feet of space. The diverse and growing business provides many professional services in addition to recording, including commercial video production, commercial photography, graphic arts/animation/web design, artist development and business marketing. Finish this sentence in regard to your business. ""I wish I could…"" I wish I could do more to give back to the community that has given us this incredible opportunity - to grow Norwalk\'s thriving and culturally diverse music and arts scene. We are active supporters of the Wall Street Neighborhood Association, and I am (Director of Marketing Marc Alan) the Chairman of the Norwalk Arts Commission. Factory Underground has actively supported Make Music Day, First Friday, Carver Foundation, and run food drives to help organizations like Person to Person. Our passion for music is the driving force of everything we do, including helping as many people as we can. What is your best selling product/service? A recording is the heart of our business, and we strive to be a state-of-the-art recording studio that can service every level of professional music artists, as well as cater to the needs of the advertising industry, film industry, podcasters, local musicians and students, etc. Expanding our studios with the highest level of digital technology, with analog Neve consoles, a huge microphone collection, and honestly, some fo the best audio engineers in the business - have helped to make Factory Underground really competitive in the field. At the same time, we have pioneered quality services for helping artists distribute, market and promote their music and video, which has really opened doors for our clients and ourselves. One of the services we have been especially successful in developing is Video Promotion. We recently directed a music video for the blues artist Tom Forst, that we are now promoting - it\'s a song called ""Late Night Train"" that achieved 200K views in the first three weeks of being on YouTube. Altogether, this is a great example of the integrated work we do because we not only produced and recorded Tom\'s record, we directed and produced his music videos, are running a radio promotion and publicity campaign, in addition to promoting his videos. We have essentially grown from being a Recording Studio into a full services Artist Development agency, which has seen huge growth over the past year. How many local businesses do you use to support your business (products and services) and can you name them? In addition to Factory Underground Studio, we also have Factory Underground Media, which is a division providing media production, business marketing, web/graphic design, social media advertising, and Google-certified Digital Marketing, to help small to mid-size businesses. We have worked with a number of local businesses, and restaurants, including Saltwater in South Norwalk and Bar Zepoli in Stamford, Ct. We have also worked to service other agencies and organizations such as Norwalk Now (they help promote small business in Norwalk), and recently did some work with WWE. I would like to nominate ARC SSL - which is lighting, staging, and sound company that is also located in Downtown Norwalk (directly across from our parking lot. In addition to providing production services at local venues such as Wall Street Theater, they do a number of profile events around the Super Bowl every year. They provide technical staff at all the high profile New York City clubs including Lavo and the Marquee. The owner of the company, Gene Morell, is a Norwalk native, who like everyone at Factory Underground, believes in giving back to the community. Factory Underground is located at 16 Isaac Street in Norwalk. Visit Factory Underground online here. HamletHub thanks Fairfield County Bank for making our Why Small Businesses Matter series possible!

February 12, 2020 | Kenneth Best - UConn Communications A new exhibit at the Benton Museum of Art captures the turbulence of the late 1960s on campus through the eyes of a student photographer. Moratorium, October 15, 1969. Students at the Vietnam War protest in front of the Student Union. (Howard Goldbaum Collection of Connecticut Daily Campus Negatives, Archives & Special Collections, University of Connecticut Library.) Student newspapers have chronicled the life and times of their colleges and universities for decades, and UConn’s is particularly long-tenured: UConn’s student newspaper dates back to 1896, when The Lookout was first published at what was then known as Storrs Agricultural College. Fifteen years later, the newspaper was renamed The Connecticut Campus and continued to publish after the University of Connecticut was established in 1939. It moved to daily publication in 1955, and has produced five issues a week during the academic year ever since. Photography, primarily publicity photos, began to appear in the campus newspaper as early as 1917 and by the 1950s, news coverage included photos of campus events such as student elections and Huskies basketball games. When Howard Goldbaum arrived on campus in 1965 with his camera, the newspaper’s coverage began to reflect both student life on campus and the turbulence of the times. As a staff photographer and then photo editor for the newspaper, Goldbaum took hundreds of photos during protests against racism and the Vietnam War, campus traditions such as Homecoming, UConn athletics, and renowned performers and musicians who appeared in Storrs. Some of these images, drawn from Goldbaum’s extensive archive at the University, are included in a new exhibit called “UConn Through the Viewfinder: Connecticut Daily Campus Photographs from the Howard Goldbaum Collection, 1967-70” at the William Benton Museum of Art through March 13. “It was a time of change. Revolution was in the air, as the song said,” says Goldbaum, who went on to serve as chief photographer at “El Vocero” in Puerto Rico and as a freelance photographer for Newsweek and other publications before becoming a journalism professor at Bradley University, where he was founding director of its multimedia program. Since 2003, he has taught at The Reynolds School of Journalism at the University of Nevada-Reno, where he is an associate professor of immersive media. Goldbaum, who earned his degree in English at UConn before completing a master’s degree in communications photography from Syracuse University, says his time at the student paper shaped his future both in journalism classes and by working with student editors that included Juliet Cassone, Richard Cohen, Dennis Hampton, Al May, and Michael Whalen. “I was learning that I was not just attracted to photography, I was attracted to where the action was. I wanted to be part the pivotal events of the time,” he says. “A lot of my career choices were influenced by mentors I had, particularly Evan Hill and John Breen of the journalism department. It was my close relationship with them that modeled my wish to become a journalism professor myself. John Breen was the faculty member who did the weekly critique with Daily Campus staff. I really loved his attitude. The way he gently chided us when we made mistakes was an inspiration for me, because later at Bradley University I became that person who did the weekly critiques with the newspaper staff at the Bradley Scout. Evan Hill was a unique professor. I looked up to him as a very wise voice and mentor in journalism education.” The exhibition includes prints made from the hundreds of 35mm film negatives Goldbaum created during his time at The Daily Campus. The images include “Protest: Symbolic and Otherwise,” in which demonstrators are shown protesting the denial of tenure to a faculty member who was involved in anti-war protests; “Dancers Captivate Audience,” from a performance by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater; “Warming Hut Demonstration,” depicting UConn students protesting the Vietnam War in 1967 and 1968; a 1967 performance by Ravi Shankar, the classical musician from India who introduced the sitar to George Harrison of The Beatles; and “Watch That Elbow,” from a women’s basketball game against Springfield College in 1969, described as “Action in a girl’s basketball game.” Part of the exhibition focuses on the process of photography before the age of digital cameras. There are contact prints — a page with 35mm images of all photos on a single roll of film — with marks indicating which images would selected for use in the newspaper, along with the manila envelopes into which they were placed, identified by date and news assignment. In a room off the Benton’s Center Gallery where the exhibit is displayed, visitors can see an even more vivid demonstration of pre-digital photography: a darkroom with chemical trays, a photo enlarger, and a drying wire with clothespins holding photo prints. There is also the characteristic smell and sounds of the college newspaper darkroom from that era–the odor of the chemicals used to make prints, and rock music. The only missing elements photographers from that era might notice are ashtrays used for incense and cigarettes, along with a rolled up towel at the bottom of the door to keep the sometimes clandestine smoke from spreading beyond the walls of the darkroom. Goldbaum says documenting events on campus such as anti-war protests reflected the evolving lifestyles of the times. “People were rebelling against the war but it metastasized into rejecting many of the class norms between freshman and seniors and the interactions between men and women,” he says. “It was a revolution of students demanding more independence, more control over their lifestyle, whether it was the ability to grow your hair long or to visit women in the dormitories at any hour. I was in the UConn Honors program and we did away with grades after our freshman year.” The experience of being a photographer on the frontline of events fed his enthusiasm for finding a way to remain there. “It always made my pulse beat faster,” Goldbaum says. “I didn’t want to miss any of the action because of the ability of photojournalists to get to places maybe off limits to others. I was able to use my student credentials, and then later working as a professional photojournalist in Puerto Rico and elsewhere, [to stay] on the frontlines of conflict and political change.” Goldbaum also has stayed on the leading edge of technology in his field. He started taking photos with a twin-lens camera using 2 ¼ film but moved into 35mm film photography early as a freelancer. While teaching at Bradley, he began to use the early Apple digital cameras and created one of the first classes in digital photography. Over the last decade in Nevada, he has moved his photography into virtual reality projects with websites that allow visitors to explore historic sites including ancient monuments of Ireland, a 17th century Jacobean home and estate in England, and various locations around Nevada. All of these projects can be accessed via his website. “UConn Through the Viewfinder: Connecticut Daily Campus Photographs from the Howard Goldbaum Collection, 1967-70” continues through March 13 at the William Benton Museum of Art.

One of the nation’s first professionally written and edited community news sites, WestportNow provided 24/7 coverage of Westport, Connecticut, from its founding in 2003 until the death of editor and publisher Gordon F. Joseloff in November 2020. (See WestportNow November 9, 2020). It frequently attracted more readers on a weekly basis than any other print or online Westport-based publication. WestportNow’s award-winning journalism will remain available on the website as a historical record of Westport from 2003 to 2020. Visitors can use the search bar at the top of the page to find topics of interest or scroll using the links at the bottom. WestportNow is grateful to its readers, contributors, and advertisers for making the site a trusted source of fact-based information for nearly 18 years. We hope the archive is useful to researchers and historians and reminds Westporters what makes our community such a special place.
