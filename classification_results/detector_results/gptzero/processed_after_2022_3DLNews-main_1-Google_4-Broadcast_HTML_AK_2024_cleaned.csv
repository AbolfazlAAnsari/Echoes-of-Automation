She began her speech by thanking her producer and friend Jack Antonoff and added, “I would love to tell you this is the happiest moment of my life,” she told the crowd, but said she feels this happy when she creates music and plays shows. Earlier in the night, Taylor Swift used her 13th Grammy win on Sunday to announce her new album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” will arrive April 19. “I know that the way that the Recording Academy voted is a direct reflection of the passion of the fans,” she said while accepting the best pop vocal album award. “So, I want to say thank you to the fans by telling you a secret that I’ve been keeping from you for the last two years.” One of the night’s biggest awards, record of the year, went to Miley Cyrus for “Flowers,” her second-ever Grammy and second of the night. “This award is amazing. But I really hope that it doesn’t change anything because my life was beautiful yesterday,” she said in her speech. Victoria Mon負won best new artist. “Thank you to the champagne-servers tonight,” Mon負began her acceptance speech. “Thanks to my mom, a single mom raising this really bad girl.” Then she started to cry, telling the room that this award was “15 years in the making.” Billie Eilish won song of the year for writing the “Barbie” hit, “What Was I Made For?” She thanked director Greta Gerwig for “making the best movie of the year.” It was just one of several standout moments from Sunday’s show, hosted by Trevor Noah and broadcast live from Cypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles. Karol G made Grammy history Sunday by becoming the first female performer to win best mﾊ�a urbana album for her blockbuster “MaB� Serﾽ�onito” record. “This is my first time at the Grammys,” she told the audience in English. “And this is my first time holding my own Grammy.” Performances were many. Olivia Rodrigo brought her bloodsucking ballad “vampire” – or in this case, bloodletting, as red liquid dripped from the walls behind her. Joni Mitchell, 80, made Grammy history by performing “Both Sides Now” from her 1969 album “Clouds”; Travis Scott did a medley of “My Eyes,” “I Know?,” and “Fein.” Burna Boy was joined by Brandy and 21 Savage and did “On Form,” “City Boys,” and “Sittin’ on Top of the World.” A long and touching In Memoriam segment celebrated many of the musical greats lost last year. Stevie Wonder performed “For Once in My Life” and “The Best Is Yet To Come” in honor of Tony Bennett; Annie Lennox delivered “Nothing Compares 2 U” for Sin蠤 O’Connor. “Artists for ceasefire, peace in the world,” Lennox said at the end of the song, her fist extended in the air. Jon Batiste did a medley of “Ain’t No Sunshine,” “Lean On Me,” and finally “Optimistic” with Ann Nesby for the late great music exec Clarence Avant. Oprah introduced a fiery Tina Turner tribute of “Proud Mary” by Fantasia Barrino and Adam Blackstone. SZA also took the stage – performing a medley of her larger-than-life hits “Snooze” and “Kill Bill,” joined by dancers wielding katanas. Later, she’d take home the trophy for best R&B song — for “Snooze,” handed to her by Lizzo. SZA ran to the stage and gave a charming, out of breath speech because she was “changing, and then I took a shot.” Luke Combs’ delivered a heartfelt rendition of “Fast Car” with Tracy Chapman – his cover of the Chapman classic has dominated country radio and won him song of the year at the 2023 CMAs. In 1989 the song won Chapman best female pop vocal performance. Dua Lipa opened the show with a high-octane medley: first, a tease of her forthcoming single, “Training Season,” then, her most recent single, “Houdini,” and finally, her disco-pop “Barbie” hit “Dance the Night.” Eilish and Finneas also brought “Barbie” to the Grammys stage with live string accompaniment. They were followed by Cyrus, who performed “Flowers” for the first time live on television. “Why are you acting like you don’t know this song?” she teased the crowd — John Legend and wife Chrissy Teigen were among those in the audience who got up to dance — and later cheered mid-song, “I just won my first Grammy!” Best country album went to Lainey Wilson for “Bell Bottom Country,” — her very first Grammy — as presented by Kacey Musgraves. “I’m a fifth-generation farmer’s daughter,” she told the crowd, adding that she’s a “songwriting farmer,” and that’s where the musical magic came from. Jay-Z was awarded the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award and used his speech to talk about the hip-hop greats that came before him – and heavily suggesting at the Grammys history of placing rap on the backburner – or at the very least, not in the televised version of the show. (This year, there were no rap categories on the telecast, but two pop, one Latin, one country and one R&B.) “We want you all to get it right,” he said. “At least get it close to right,” before switching focus to Beyonc笠“Most Grammys, never won album of the year. How does that work?” Bridgers took an early lead at the Grammys, quickly winning four trophies ahead of the main telecast, with her and her boygenius bandmates bringing an infectious energy to the pre-telecast Premiere Ceremony. Jack Antonoff took home producer of the year, non-classical for a third year in a row, tying Babyface as the only other producer to do so consecutively. “You need the door kicked open for you,” he said in his acceptance speech. “Taylor Swift kicked that (expletive) door open for me,” he said. The first of three new categories in 2024, best pop dance recording, went to Kylie Minogue for “Padam Padam” — her first win in 18 years. About 80 Grammys were handed out pre-broadcast. Regional Mexican star Peso Pluma won his first Grammy for his first and only nomination, for best mﾊ�a Mexicana album for his “Genesis.” Best African music performance, a new category which aims to highlight regional musical traditions and recognizing “recordings that utilize unique local expressions from across the African continent,” went to South African singer Tyla for her ubiquitous hit, “Water.” “I never thought I’d say I won a Grammy at 21 years old,” she said in her acceptance speech. “Last year God decided to change my whole life.” Killer Mike won three awards in quick succession Sunday night, but ended up in police custody before the main Grammys ceremony began because of an altercation, police spokesperson Officer Mike Lopez said. The rapper won his first first Grammy in 21 years, for best rap performance for “Scientists & Engineers,” which featured Andr瞳000, Future and Eryn Allen Kane. Soon afterward, they won for “best rap song.” Killer Mike also took home best rap album for “Michael,” cheering, “It is a sweep! It is a sweep!” Billy Joel was both the penultimate and final performance of the night. First, he brought his new track “Turn the Lights Back on” — his first new music in decades — live to the Grammy stage. Then, after album of the year was announced, he returned to the stage for his 1980 classic, “You May Be Right.” A welcome surprised was the inclusion of Celine Dion, who handed Swift her record-breaking trophy. “When I say I’m happy to be here, I really mean it from my heart,” she told the audience. In 2022, Dion revealed she was diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder called stiff person syndrome, which causes spasms that affect her ability to walk and sing.

The Justice Department proposed changes Monday to rules governing state-run programs that provide financial assistance to violent crime victims in order to address racial disparities and curb the number of subjective denials of compensation. The proposal from the Justice Department’s Office for Victims of Crime, a major overhaul to how states across the U.S. currently handle victims compensation claims, comes less than a year after an Associated Press investigation exposed that Black victims were disproportionately denied in many states — often for subjective reasons rooted in implicit biases that are felt across the criminal justice system. If adopted, the changes would bar states from considering a victim’s criminal history and eliminate some of the most subjective reasons for denials in many states. “Certain populations may be more likely to have criminal history due to unjustified disparate treatment in the criminal justice system or due to criminal conduct induced through force, fraud, or coercion, such as unlawful acts that traffickers compelled their victims to commit, and this can result in unjustifiably disproportionate denial of claims for those populations,” according to the proposal. Thousands of Americans each year turn to the state-run victim compensation programs that provide financial assistance to victims of violent crime. The money is used to help with funeral expenses, physical and emotional therapy, lost wages, crime-scene cleanup and more. But the AP found last year that in 19 out of the 23 states willing to provide racial data, Black victims were disproportionately denied compensation. In Indiana, Georgia and South Dakota, Black applicants were nearly twice as likely as white applicants to be denied. From 2018 through 2021, the denials added up to thousands of Black families each year collectively missing out on millions of dollars in aid. Thousands of people are denied compensation every year for often subjective reasons that scrutinize victims’ behavior before or after a crime. The AP found that Black victims were nearly three times as likely to be denied for these reasons, including a category often called “contributory misconduct” where programs sometimes, without evidence, accuse victims of causing or contributing to their own victimization. The proposed changes would strictly limit when a state program can deny a person for misconduct including requiring that states put into law or policy what is specifically considered contributory conduct and the process they use to decide if it is being applied in a denial. The proposal also clarifies that state programs should not claw back money victims receive from crowdfunding sources such as GoFundMe among other changes. Pamela White, whose son Dararius Evans was killed in 2019, was initially denied compensation by Louisiana’s program because officials blamed her son for his own death. She received few details of how the state came to that conclusion and had to take out a personal loan to cover his funeral expenses while she appealed the decision. She eventually won. White said Monday that she was happy to hear about the proposed rule changes from the federal government. “Why make things difficult when someone is already going through a hard time?” White said. “I’m thankful that (the proposal) has happened because murders are still taking place. You know, parents are still going to have to bury their children.” Over the last decade, several states have passed laws or made administrative regulation changes to limit some of the most subjective kinds of denials. Other states have passed laws expanding access to the funding or adding covered expenses. But the state-level changes have resulted in piecemeal and uneven access for victims, where the victim of a crime might be eligible for compensation help in one state but denied in another. Advocates have pushed for federal rule changes that would require state programs to all adhere to a victim-centered approach to considering claims. The proposals would do that in several areas including the bar on considering previous criminal histories and removing administrative hurdles like barring most requirements for notarized portions of applications. Many of the items in the proposal Monday give states more room to expand services and approve claims. The proposal would allow states to apply a broader definition to medical or mental health expenses to allow people in rural areas with fewer licensed providers to find care or to allow for Native American healing practices to be covered expenses. The proposal would allow for a broader definition of who would be eligible to include people beyond a close familial relationship to a victim and allow for states to create broader definitions of allowable property damage expenses that contribute to victim safety. The publication of the proposed rule changes opens a 60-day public comment period. It can take several months to process those comments and submit final rule changes.

Minnesota Timberwolves star guard Anthony Edwards has been fined $40,000 for “repeatedly publicly criticizing” officials after their recent 107-101 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder. Edwards led the Timberwolves with 27 points in Monday’s win, giving Minnesota sole possession of first place in the Western Conference. Edwards made the comments during an interview with Bally Sports North after the victory Monday at Paycom Center in Oklahoma City, where he griped about only getting four free throws during the game when he felt he should’ve gotten more calls. When a reporter asked about how the Timberwolves won the game, Edwards said: “We had to play through every bump and every grab. I don’t know how we won tonight. Big shout out to my team.” Edwards was seen in the postgame celebration calling the referees out for “cheating” and then said in his postgame interview, “I’m going to take the fine, because the refs did not give us no calls tonight.” Edwards’ criticisms continued in the locker room following the win, telling ESPN’s Tim MacMahon (without prompting): “The refs was bad tonight. Yeah, they was terrible. We was playing 8-on-5.” Edwards added that he feels like he doesn’t get the same respect as other stars in the NBA. “I haven’t earned [referees’ respect] yet, so it’s OK,” Edwards said. “But I think tonight was bad from the refs. It was terrible. We didn’t get no calls as a team. I got fouled multiple times, and I’m walking up to the ref telling him, ‘Hey, can you watch this?’ They just shaking their head. Yeah. And then soon somebody come down from their team and get bumped, it’s a foul. So I just feel like it wasn’t a fair game tonight from the jump. And so that’s why I’m super happy we won the game.” Edwards is averaging a career-high 25.9 points, 5.3 assists and 5.2 rebounds per game this season.

Trump has pleaded not guiltyto four felony counts that accuse him of leading a conspiracy to cling to power and disenfranchise millions of voters in 2020. Prosecutors say that this culminated in violence at the U.S. Capitol three years ago that injured 140 law enforcement officers and shook the foundations of American democracy. Tuesday\'s decision comes at a crucial time for both Trump and the federal case against him. Trump is the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination and continues to insist — without basis in fact — that he won the 2020 presidential election. Already, Trump\'s serious legal troubles — he is fighting 91 criminal charges in four separate U.S. jurisdictions — are clashing with the political calendar. The former president has signaled that he could seek to dismiss the federal cases against him in the District of Columbia and Florida if he regains the White House. His lawyer in Georgia recently suggested Trump may try to delay the election interference case against him in Fulton County, Ga., until 2029. Copyright 2024 NPR.

Additionally, Wrangell could soon see infrastructure money coming in from the state – $5 million is listed in Governor Mike Dunleavy’s budget for Wrangell’s dams. If the Legislature approves the funding, Villarma says the money could help make the dams safer. “Five million dollars doesn’t come to the city very easily,” Villarma said. “That will be used for restructuring those dams and reinforcing them so that they’re able to handle excess rainfall and other seismic activity.” In other Wrangell municipal news, Villarma said there are other positive developments happening. The town’s old hospital might have an undisclosed buyer. Villarma said the city is not at liberty to discuss those details but he said it could be an opportunity for the community with the potential to expand housing and economic development. Also, Trident Seafoods closed its operations in Petersburg, Ketchikan and Kodiak. Wrangell now has the last remaining Trident plant in Southeast Alaska. Villarma said Wrangell is likely to see a lot of economic activities increase as a result. Share: © 2016 Wragell Radio Group'}]"

That averages out to one almost every 54 days,” Dunleavy said. “As Alaskans, we know it’s not a matter of disaster strikes, but when. As governor I also know that I can always count on Alaskans to pull together.” Dunleavy talked about how Wrangell’s community took action immediately after the landslide. It destroyed a few homes and covered 450 feet of highway. He mentioned the sole survivor, Christina Florshutz and named the six people who perished – Otto Florshutz and the Heller family – Timothy, Beth and their children – 16-year-old Mara, 11-year- old Cara and 12-year-old Derek. On top of memorializing those who passed and survived, Dunleavy honored Wrangell’s mayor, Patty Gilbert. “Mayor Patty Gilbert is here today to represent her community,” he said. “She’ll be the first person to tell you that she doesn’t deserve any credit for the actions of those who rushed headlong into danger. Mayor Gilbert may not have ended up covered head to toe in mud, like those first responders, but their spirit is with her tonight.” He gave a brief timeline of Gilbert’s life. She worked as a teacher all over the country and in Venezuela. He talked about how she and her husband ended up in Alaska, first in Cordova where she worked at Prince William Sound College. She and her husband then moved to Wrangell where she taught for approximately 20 years. Dunleavy acknowledged Gilbert’s activism as the president of the Wrangell Medical Center Foundation. They help fund travel expenses for Alaskans who need cancer treatment. Gilbert also raises money for health careers and student scholarships. “Mayor Gilbert gives back to the committee that has given her so much, and we’re glad she’s here tonight,” Dunleavy said. “Mayor, I’m going to ask you to stand and be recognized for all the hard work you do, and the first responders across the state.” On top of her activism, she’s served two terms on Wrangell’s City Council, followed by serving as a borough assembly member.
