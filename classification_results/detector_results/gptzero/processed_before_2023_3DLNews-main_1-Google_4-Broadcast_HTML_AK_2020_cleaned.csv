Gallagher said that people are moved back to their original dorms once they no longer have active cases. Even before the COVID-19 outbreak, the gym had been equipped with beds. Gallagher said that it was converted to a 60-bed housing unit due to an increase of offenders over the years. There are currently 56 inmates housed in the gym. Since the pandemic began, two inmates have had to be hospitalized for COVID-19. Gallagher said that some inmates were able to receive monoclonal antibody treatment from YKHC, but she said most of the cases at the jail have been treated with fluids, over-the-counter medication, and rest.

According to state data, the person is an out-of-state resident who works in the seafood industry. It’s the ninth case of an out-of-state resident testing positive for the disease, and it’s the fourth instance of someone testing positive who works in that industry. The state said in a news releasethat the individual is a seasonal worker for Trident Seafoods. Trident is arranging for that worker to leave the community today. That person is asymptomatic, doing well and does not require hospitalization. Trident doesn’t have processing facilities in Dillingham; it operates a barge for tender and vessel support in partnership with the Bristol Bay Economic Development Corporation. Five workers arrived via a Lake Clark air flight May 1, and were tested at the end of their quarantine. “So we’re obviously really disappointed in the news.

Trident operates in 10 communities around the state. After the positive test, the company is changing the way it operates. “Now, given that there’s been some revised local ordinances in Dillingham and state health mandates, all future employees that will be coming into Dillingham will be quarantined and tested in Anchorage, and then have secured transport to Dillingham,” Carroll said. The other workers quarantining at the location tested negative, and will now quarantine for another 14 days because they were in close contact with the infected person.

To get out of quarantine they will need to satisfy the City of Dillingham’s ordinances and, according to Trident, receive a minimum of two negative tests, including one at the end of the quarantine period. Public health nurses have completed a contact investigation and report that no one at that quarantine site had any outside contacts. In a community meeting on Saturday, Dillingham Mayor Alice Ruby said that the response to this case demonstrates that Trident’s health protocols, as well as the local ordinances and state mandates, are effective. “We’ve been working with partners, the state and tribal partners, federal and health care partners, to ensure that the plans we have in place work well and that they protect everyone. The discovery of this positive case, while they were still in quarantine, is just an indication of how our plan is working,” she said. During the summer, processors bring in thousands of employees, while thousands of independent fishermen come to the region as well. The off-season regional population is around 6,700, which is spread out through many small communities. During the fishing season the population balloons up to nearly 22,000. In Bristol Bay, the City of Dillingham, as well as several tribes and the regional health corporation, have asked the state to consider closing the fishery, citing the influx of outside workers and fishermen. In April, Gov. Mike Dunleavy released a series of guidelines for commercial fishermen and the state remains committed to keeping the fishery open. The City of Dillingham passed several ordinances at recent meetings extending its travel permit and quarantine requirements for incoming visitors. Effective May 22, it is requiring testing for people quarantining in Dillingham in order for them to come out of quarantine. There are two places to get tested for COVID-19 in Dillingham. Free testing is available at a Capstone Clinic center at the Dillingham harbor, which opened today. It was set up through a partnership between the Dillingham Public Health Center, Bristol Bay Area Health Corporation, the City of Dillingham and Capstone Clinic. Dr. Cathy Hyndman, clinical director of BBAHC, said harbor’s testing center is for people who aren’t experiencing symptoms but might have been exposed. People who are experiencing symptoms should call the hospital at (907) 842-9440 to set up an appointment. Once they arrive at the hospital a nurse will come to the car and administer an Abbot ID Now swab test. Dillingham does not currently have testing set up at its airport. City Manager Tod Larson said that was partly because it would create crowding at the terminal. “It takes quite a bit to put everything together. We have to kinda get a semi-windproof area that has to be built with a lab, fridge, freezer, that kind of stuff,” Larson said. During the Saturday meeting, the state’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Anne Zink,said the state is working with the city and other local entities to minimize the risk to the community. “One is to track the case and to make sure that we are looking at all the contacts, any possible exposure, and be able to try to break any chain of spread,” she said. The case was announced two days after a delegation of state and federal officials visited four communities in Bristol Bay, including Dillingham. The group toured health facilities and seafood processing plants, and heard from community leaders about concerns and support ahead of the fishing season. The Dillingham police force is currently making trips to the airport to check on compliance with state and local laws, according to Mayor Ruby, who said that the city requested additional assistance from the state during the delegation's visit. “We’ll be following up next week to try to get more bodies that would help us with security, so that we can be in more places at once to enforce the mandates,” she said.

(Alaska Department of Fish and Game) The state department of Fish and Game decided to euthanize three bears in Haines. The sow and two cubs eluded law enforcement and Alaska Department of Fish and Game over the weekend. State biologists visited Haines over the weekend with a death warrant for a sow and two cubs who have a track record of destroying property. After four days of intensive tracking with the Haines Police Department they were unable to dispatch the bears. Wildlife biologist Carl Koch says the decision to euthanize the bears was a hard one, but the complaints added up. He said relocating bears like these is usually ineffective. “This bear has been causing enough property damage and now standing at the ground to people that are hazing it, at least in one situation. Most of the time, she’s pretty wary and runs away,” he said. It’s not just this spring; the sow in question has a track record of indiscretions. She was collared and tagged at the landfill in the fall of 2018. Since last year, Koch said she’s racked up a list of offenses. “She’s gotten on porches, gotten stuff from freezers, and torn into some buildings, tried to push into some garages and things like that. It kind of became progressively worse over time to where now it’s property damage. And there was even one report of pulling on the door of a house with a with people inside it. And this is what it’s come to,” Koch said. Despite the tracking collar, the bears are still at large. Koch said it is extremely difficult to get close enough to bears to dart them. ADF&G turned the responsibility over to the Haines Police Department. Local law enforcement now has a public safety permit to kill the bears. Koch said euthanasia is a defense of last resort. “You know that it’s necessary in certain situations. Nobody, nobody that I know likes to do it. That’s why we try very hard… You know, the key take home for me here is: prevent this stuff as much as possible before the bears become food conditioned,” he said. Koch advised residents to secure their coolers inside and eliminate bear attractants. He said if a bear is destroying property is it advisable to haze the bear from a safe distance while waiting for law enforcement. And ADF&G tried to find a home for the cubs. Its search was as far-ranging as facilities in the lower-48, but the department came up empty-handed. All three bears are slated to be darted and euthanized—or shot, by the discretion of local law enforcement. Share: March 3, 2023 February 12, 2024 June 7, 2023 December 12, 2022 Thats weak they can try harder so lazy now 3 bears gotta die because they are lazy what a waste fire them get someone else to figure this out death is not the answer we must protect our animals not kill them bastards I looks to me like law enforcement is taking the easy way out. The problem is not the bears it is the people in the way….there is way too many people. The people are the problem not the bears… Democrats love to complain, we need all democrats to leave america now. Move the bears to Seattle, maybe they will eat the politicians and solve our problems here. Heck send the bears to bidens house, now they would be saving america. Bear sanctuary in Arizona will take them. The cubs at least. They have recently taken 3 grizzly cubs. Bearazonia. Cannot avoid to kill a mother and a cub like this..its a life not a thing to do like this..hope there is a hope to save them from die..love animals..

City officials report a tree fell at 11.2 mile, near Pat’s Creek. Wrangell Light & Power Superintendent Rod Rhoades said the tree pulled down multiple power poles and lengths of wire, uprooting one power pole and setting the asphalt on fire. This caused reported blackouts from around 3.5 mile to the end of the road, affecting about 120 homes. Firefighters extinguished the fire to allow the line crew to restore power at around 3:30 a.m. Wednesday. City Public Works crews assisted with gravel and equipment to shore up the replaced poles, which were insecure in the waterlogged ground. That was the second instance on Tuesday of trees felling power lines and causing blackouts. On Tuesday morning, two trees fell on other power lines in the area of Pat’s Creek, causing a blackout from 9-mile to the end of the road that lasted until late afternoon. Line crews had restored power to the main line at about 4 p.m. Tuesday, when the next tree fell and set the asphalt on fire at around 8 p.m. A tree also damaged power lines near the City Park restrooms on Tuesday afternoon. Electrical Superintendent Rhoades reported Wednesday morning that all lines had been reset or reconnected, and power was restored to all but one residence. That house had damage to its meter box, and required further work. Heavy rains greatly increase the potential for landslides out the road, so drivers are reminded to be cautious when traveling by common landslide areas — between 5 and 11-mile Zimovia Highway.
