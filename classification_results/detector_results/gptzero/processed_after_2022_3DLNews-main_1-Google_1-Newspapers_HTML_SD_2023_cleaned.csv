Marlo was born on March 3, 1940 to Raymond and Dorothy (Keogh) Bicek where his parents lived south of Colome. Marlo has always called himself a simple man which started early on in his life; being raised with no electricity using kerosene lamps for any lighting needs and a wood stove to heat the house. He attended the Kansas Flats country school and developed many lifelong friends during his attendance there. Marlo made the decision to serve his country by enlisting in the National Guard. He was a member of the 730th medical company, based in Winner. Shortly after enlisting he met the love of his life, Linda Lee Sweetland, at the Little Diner located on Main Street Winner. After much persuasion he finally convinced her to go on a date with him. On their third date as they were dancing, Marlo told Linda that he could dance with her forever and the decision was made; they were engaged. A wedding was soon planned for December of 1961 but plans soon were changed when Marlo was called up for active duty to Fort Riley, Kan. Marlo and Linda were then married on Sept. 3, 1961 creating a union, which Marlo had always said was meant to be. Through this union, four children were born: Kay Evans (Daniel) of Storm Lake, Iowa, Amy Engel (DeWayne) of Winner, SD, Todd Bicek (Angie) of Winner, SD and Carol Peterson (Justin) of Winner SD. Early on in Marlo and Linda’s marriage, Marlo discovered the second love of his life; being a truck driver. Lil Smokey (dad’s CB handle) and a lifelong career of logging over 3 million miles began. During his trucking career, Marlo developed the reputation of being a man who never met anyone who was a stranger. His children and wife would tell you that they spent many, many long-suffering hours in the back of the family’s station wagon waiting for their dad/ husband as he visited with his newfound friends at gas stations and truck stops. Dad lived a simple life. He modeled generosity and paying it forward before it was even popular. Always seeing needs of others and helping in any way that he could, even if he was struggling to financially meets the needs of his family. He gave of his resources, money and time whenever he could. Even though dad worked countless hours, he always found the time to get into a little bit of mischief, tell jokes and share many stories that entertained others. He also found partners to participate in his crazy antics; teaching his grandkids that having fun was an essential to living a happy life. Since the passing of his Dolly (Dad’s name for his beloved Linda), he did his very best to help fill the void of our missing mom and grandma. Grateful and blessed for the time that we got to share with him are his children, Kay, Amy, Todd and Carol.

Gerald “Red” Hartford, 96, of Winner, SD passed away on Wednesday, May 17, 2023 at Monument Health Rapid City Hospital in Rapid City, SD. Funeral service were held on Tuesday, May 23, 2023 at 11 a.m. at the Winner United Methodist Church in Winner, SD. Burial followed in the Rosebud Cemetery in Bonesteel, SD. Gerald D. (“Red”) Hartford, loving and caring husband, dedicated father, entrepreneur, builder, businessman, Marine, and racer ascended to heaven May 17, 2023 at the age of 96. His was a life lived full pursuing his various interests and realizing his vision through hard work and perseverance. He was born April 6, 1927 into a humble depression-era environment in Ewing, NE to Otto and Addie (Wilson) Hartford, the third of three children, his older brother Floyd and sister Norma, both deceased. The family moved to a site near Bonesteel, SD during his early high school years where he would board in town during the week. This meant, of course, that he had access to an automobile at a time when most students did not. Although thin as a rail, he excelled at running track while at Bonesteel HS. Although they knew of each other, he didn’t get close to the love of his life, Alice Ruth Jons until she had graduated high school a year before he did. Alice was attending the State Normal School in Springfield, SD pursuing her teaching degree, and they met through mutual friends. Their romance was put on hold for thirteen months while Gerald fulfilled his voluntary enlistment in the Marine Corps at the end of WWII. Once honorably discharged at age 19, they continued their courtship to the eventual decision to get married.'}]"

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:07 am The Plain Talk reached out to several Vermillion citizens earlier this month and asked them to recall their memories of Nov. 22, 1963, when an assassin’s bullets killed President John F. Kennedy and, in an instant, changed our nation’s history. Below is the second of a two-part series. The first portion was published in the Plain Talk’s Nov. 17 edition. Be sure to also read a second, related story in today’s Plain Talk about Dr. Earl Rose, a South Dakota native and an alum of Yankton College who attended the USD School of Medicine. He was the Dallas County, Texas medical examiner on the day Kennedy was shot.

Kennedy. I guess the question most asked is ‘where were you when you heard the news from Dallas?’ I was at work when the news came over the radio. I was completely shocked,” Fuller wrote. “All work came to an immediate halt as all the office personnel gathered around waiting to hear the news they longed not to hear.” In his letter to his parents, he wrote of seeing people crying and of people from the lowest to highest ranks at Ft. Meade being stunned. “I think the first reaction was one of a feeling of vengeance. Of wanting to do something to revenge his death. Then of compassion and remorse,” Fuller wrote. He stated in his letter that when it became known that the presidential party was going to return to Andrews Air Force Base later that afternoon, “we drove over to witness the event. You may have seen on television the arrival. We were about 30 yards away from President Johnson when he read his statement.” Fuller and the soldiers he traveled with then drove directly to Washington, D.C. and checked into a hotel. “We stayed there during the entire weekend. It proved wise to get a room there because later on the hotels and motels filled fast,” he said in his letter. “We were a witness to all of the proceedings during that tragic weekend,” Fuller wrote. “The march from the White House to the Capitol. We saw Mrs. Kennedy and the rest of the family arrive and leave. We were in uniform and got to be one of the first to see the casket in the capitol.” Early on November 23, six military pallbearers carried the flag-draped coffin into the East Room of the White House, where the President lay in repose for 24 hours. Then, his flag-draped coffin was carried on a horse-drawn caisson to the Capitol to lie in state. Throughout the day and night, hundreds of thousands lined up to view the guarded casket, with a quarter million passing through the rotunda during the 18 hours of lying in state. Fuller recalls in his letter that on Monday morning, Nov. 25, there was a line of people 16 blocks long waiting to get into the Capitol rotunda. “Many waited in freezing weather for four to six hours to see the casket,” he wrote in his letter. “We followed the procession all the way to Arlington and witnessed the burial. Since then, we have been back to look at his grave. “Only then could I make myself believe that he was truly gone. Gone in body, but never in what he left behind in the hearts of our people,” Fuller wrote. “John F. Kennedy. A good man … “ He shared recollections of that day with the Plain Talk this week that weren’t included in his letter to his parents. “There were thousands and thousands of people in D.C. the day of the funeral and I remember two things about that in particular,” Fuller said. “First was the quietness of that many people, the silence was deafening -- so many people yet so quiet and respectful of the event we were seeing. And secondly, the sounds of the horses as they clip-clopped down the street -- an incredibly soulful moment. I can still hear them.” He also remembers “… watching Mrs. Kennedy walking with her two brothers-in-law -- Robert and Ted Kennedy -- walking with sadness and determination. “I remember the heads of state that marched in the procession -- the height of General DeGaulle, the president of France, and so many other countries represented,” Fuller said. “When we got to Arlington National Cemetery, our group was some distance from the gravesite, but we did see the lighting of the eternal flame in the evening dusk -- a very moving moment. “And then the playing of ‘Taps’ -- profoundly unforgettable,” he said. VERMILLION NATIVE DAN CHRISTOPHERSON, who was the community’s mayor when Vermillion celebrated its sesquicentennial in 2009, was in the junior class at Vermillion High School in November 1963. In brief responses to a Plain Talk email, he recalls that he learned about JFK’s assassination from an announcement given over the school’s speaker by Vermillion High School’s principal. He noted that the VHS football season was completed in October, but the football coach had heard about an alcohol incident involving football players after the season was over. “Our entire team was in a mandatory meeting with the coaching staff regarding the perceived training violations and possible repercussions,” Christopherson said. “The announcement silenced the room and ended the discussion.” He and fellow classmates reacted with shock when hearing the news, followed by realizing the new “reality” that suddenly existed, which brought sadness. Christopherson learned more about the assassination from television news reports and recalls the abundance of TV coverage that followed – something that was not normal for 1963. He also remembers feeling shock and fear for the future of the United States. “It caused much concern and deep thinking by many people,” he said. “My generation had not yet experienced such a profound event as this.” DAVID DAY, WHO IS TODAY RETIRED AS A PROFESSOR WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH DAKOTA KNUDSON SCHOOL OF LAW, was a 15-year-old sophomore at Greenwich High School in Greenwich, Connecticut on the day of JFK’s assassination. “I lived in Old Greenwich with my mother and father, and three younger brothers. Most of the people of my generation learned about the Kennedy assassination while in school; my story is different,” he said. “I was reading and watching TV (CBS) when the announcement was made by a TV reporter. Later, I watched Walter Cronkite take off his glasses—look the nation right in the eye—and tell us all that President John Kennedy had died. Home Alone Day noted that unlike his brothers and all of his friends on that day in November 1963, he was alone in a motel room in Greenwich. “Greenwich High School was a big school in an old near-Gothic building—like Sioux City Central or Washington High School in Sioux Falls,” he said. “Sports (for boys—in pre-Title IX) was the “royalty” in the high school, and football was “king.” The Greenwich football coaches seemed to be all WWII veterans, and they coached with the same intensity that allowed them to attack Guam or land at Omaha Beach in Normandy. Football was a “junior basic training.” In the fall of 1963, Day’s father was given a promotion by his employer, General Electric. “So, we were moving. But my father did not tell the team we were moving because, in his view, the coaches would pull me out of the varsity practices,” he said. “In mid-November, the head coach decided I, a sophomore, would be the starting quarterback for the rest of the season. So, my father’s secrecy and my hard work paid off.” Day noted that those athletic dreams came to an end when, during varsity practice, “several senior linemen tackled me, and I broke my ankle. I was, of course, crushed. “But my parents agreed that I should not be'}]"

COLMAN – It was the fifth set at the state tournament and Colman-Egan was in trouble. The Hawks had dropped their first game of the tournament to Castlewood and were aiming to make a run in the consolation bracket. After losing the first two sets to Faulkton Area in a consolation semifinal, the Hawks stormed back to force a fifth set. But C-E was down 14-10 and some fans were bracing for the end. For some players, a situation like that can bring a lot of pressure. But for Daniela Lee, it was a situation that just came naturally to her. “I’ve never been a person to get super nervous and fall under pressure,” Lee said. “I always try to block out the pressure because a comeback story is always a good time. I just said there’s nothing to lose here, so we might as well just see what we can do.” Lee’s serve helped the Hawks begin a rally that helped C-E defeat Faulkton in five sets and go on to win the consolation title the following afternoon. It was just one of the areas where Lee has thrived during her career and why she is our choice for the 2023 Brookings Register Volleyball Player of the Year. Lee’s talent was on display from an early age, starting volleyball in the third grade. When the fourth-grade team needed an extra member, Lee grabbed a friend to try out and wound up making the team. Lee began her career as a middle hitter but started to find her way all over the court. Her versatility made her a valuable weapon entering high school and her athleticism helped her make the varsity team during her freshman year. “It’s just always come kind of naturally to her,” C-E volleyball coach Abigail Dockter said. “Ever since she was young…just the simplest things like passing or setting the ball. She’s the type of player that can play any position.” Lee’s talent gave the Hawks a good problem to have when they tried to find a position. They initially used her as a setter but then she was moved to hitter. When the Hawks needed a back-row specialist, Lee was the player to fill that void. Lee’s versatility was key to the Hawks’ success as they made the state tournament in all four years at the varsity level including a fourth-place finish in 2020, a Class B runner-up in 2021, a seventh-place finish in 2022 and a fifth-place finish this season. Over the past two seasons, C-E went 54-17 and had a 30-6 record this fall. Lee was a big part of the Hawks’ run to state this season, recording 361 kills, a 23.7% kill percentage, 555 digs, 84 blocks, 31 aces and a 92.1% serve percentage. While Lee racked up the accolades, her biggest accomplishment may have been as a leader. Lee considers herself to be a natural-born leader but Dockter believes she found a bigger voice this season. “She’s always been a great leader but she just wasn’t a vocal leader those first couple of years because we had some stronger girls above her,” Dockter said. “This year, she really stepped up and kept the girls together with that high energy and her desire to win. It really just fed off onto them.” Lee credits part of her voice to playing with many of her friends that she grew up with. “It wasn’t anything new but it was just finding my ground with all of my teammates,” Lee said. “I didn’t want to be the kind of leader that’s just throwing criticism around and everything, it was making sure that everyone has a voice and everyone understands that they are an important part of the team. We needed every single individual to be working their hardest and striving our best to make this team successful.” For Lee’s part, she was the player who wanted those big moments. While the pressure gets to some, Lee embraces it and credits her coaches both in volleyball and track for developing that mindset. “I love this sport but with both of my coaches for track and volleyball, they always tried to give me a mindset that you have to try your best and strive to be the hardest worker on the team,” Lee said. “It’s about being a leader for everything. …This year, I really had to step it up because we lost a lot of seniors and being a senior, it was just nice getting to lead the team.” Lee finishes her career with 806 kills, 94 assists, 285 blocks, 1,501 digs and 88 aces. While Lee is focused on her track career, her graduation will leave a hole in the C-E lineup next fall. But it will be more than just her stats that will be missed because of the energy she brings every day. “When she has that high energy, she’s so much fun to be around,” Dockter said. “She’s such a positive light to have on the court and it’s so much fun to watch her get excited with her teammates and kind of keep her teammates boosted up. She’s very coachable. She’s always willing to try and play any position for the better and she does whatever it takes for us to be successful.” Other items that may interest you Shooting sports driving growth in South Dakota 4-H program South Dakota GFP commissioners tackle issues, including license entrance fees at parks South Dakota to dedicate 12 bridges in honor of 15 fallen veterans Guilty: Trump convicted on 34 counts in hush money case Six relatives fall ill from parasite in bear meat served in South Dakota More news View this issue Browse other issues PO Box 71 / 107 W. 2nd Ave. Flandreau SD Phone: 605-997-3725 Links of interest Get Social""}]"

During graduate school, Vanderhoff researched calf performance using implants and distillers grain supplementation in backgrounding and grazing calves and discovered a passion for educating others on the practice. “More people are starting to explore backgrounding and ways to improve their backgrounding operation,” Vanderhoff said. “For others, you can always learn something you didn’t know or refresh your memory.” Registration is $30 per person, which includes a recording of the webinar after each session. To register, visit extension.sdstate.edu/events and search “backgrounding.” For more information, contact SDSU Extension Beef Nutrition Field Specialist Sydney Vanderhoff at 605-995-7378 or Sydney.Vanderhoff@sdstate.edu; SDSU Extension Beef Nutrition Field Specialist Madison Kovarna at 605-882-5140 or Madison.Kovarna@sdstate.edu; or Assistant Professor and SDSU Extension Feedlot Specialist Warren Rusche at 605-688-5452 or Warren.Rusche@sdstate.edu.

HURON — Huron Fire Chief Ron Hines spoke with gathered media and fellow first responders Tuesday afternoon for a press conference to discuss the business fire that occurred on Monday at Hurd Alignment.

saturated summer, and large portions of the pasture on the dairy farm I was renting were inundated. Had they a mind to do so, my Holsteins could have dogpaddled right over the submerged fence and strolled onto the adjoining highway. They might have then tried to thumb for rides except that they lacked thumbs. This wouldn’t do, so I opted to construct a temporary electric fence on the shoulder of the highway. My wife, who was several months pregnant at the time, helped me string the wire. “What was that noise?” she asked in a startled voice. I replied that I hadn’t heard anything. I chalked it up to extreme paranoia brought on by the extreme hormonal changes of pregnancy. But then the noise – an unmistakable splashing sound – manifested itself a few feet from me. I swiftly identified the source of the commotion. “Holy crap!” I exclaimed, “That’s a carp!” That’s right: we had fish in our pasture. I decided to withhold this information from our landlord lest he raise the rent, saying that that the carp were a form of value-added agriculture. I had leased that farm in 1979 from an old guy named Frank. Frank was extremely profit-oriented, the kind of man who would claim that every penny in his pocket contained a nickel’s worth of copper. The farm wasn’t much to brag about. Its dairy barn was a ramshackle affair that was sagging here and bulging there, not unlike many humans who have reached middle age. What passed for a farmhouse sat at the end of the long driveway. The rundown shack had been haphazardly remodeled over the years and leaked air like a corncrib. I didn’t mention this to old Frank because he would have likely tried to hike the rent, claiming that the house featured a superior ventilation system.
