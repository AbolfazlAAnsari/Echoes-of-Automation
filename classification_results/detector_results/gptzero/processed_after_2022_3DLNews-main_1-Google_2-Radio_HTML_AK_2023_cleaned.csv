down on Wrangell for days. It grew even stronger in the late afternoon as Angie Flickinger drove to her house on Zimovia Highway, a road that follows the coast for 14 miles south from downtown. Around mile eight, she saw water cascading from the steep bluffs above the road. She raced through that stretch nervously, worried about the rockfalls that happen there. “That type of weather always gives me tons of anxiety,” Flickinger said. “There always seems to be this big storm at the end of November, where trees fall. There’s always carnage.” Later that night, the rain pounding on her roof sounded like white noise. Then it changed suddenly. “I heard this very loud sound. Like it had been amplified tenfold,” Flickinger said. “My brain was like, ‘That’s not right.’” Flickinger’s friend Jamie Roberts lives about a half-mile up the road. To her, the sound was like a jet rumbling overhead. She opened the door to look, and the sound got louder. “I yelled at my husband, and I was like ‘Alaska Airlines, something is wrong with the jet, it’s coming down,’” Roberts said. She braced herself for the sound of a crash, but it never came. Instead, the whole house started shaking. “And we just ran out the door,” she said. A few hundred feet away, Roberts’ neighbor Christina Florschutz was on the second floor of her house, just out of the shower. She knew what the sound was. She’d heard mudslides before. “Suddenly I’m like a piece of weightless popcorn being tossed around all over the place,” she said. “And then — I don’t remember anymore for a while.” That evening, a burst of heavy rain drenched the already sodden hillside around mile 11 of Zimovia Highway while 70 mph gusts battered the trees. Eventually, parts of the slope were more water than soil. The earth finally gave way at about 8:45 p.m. A viscous flow of mud roared down toward the road, carrying hundreds of fallen trees. It picked up the Florschutz house and carried it downhill until it slammed into the family’s workshed and fell to pieces. The slide crossed the highway, burying the house where Beth and Timothy Heller lived with their three children. Some of the debris reached the water. Beth and Timothy Heller were later found dead, as were their daughters, Mara and Kara. Their son Derek has not been found. Searchers found the body of Otto Florschutz, Christina’s husband, on Nov. 30. It was the deadliest landslide in recent Alaska history. For about 70 people who live beyond the slide zone, it blocked the road and knocked out power for a week. Now, some who live on the hillside wonder if they should leave their homes for good. KTOO spoke to a dozen people who were stranded beyond the slide zone that night. They described hours of fear and confusion as some fled their homes — and how that confusion gave way to an improvised evacuation where neighbors helped each other to safety. After the slide came down, Roberts ran to the beach with her husband and son. She could see the silhouette of a big pile of debris just up the coast. And she could smell it. “Like Christmas wreaths,” Roberts said. “It was a very overwhelming, you know, conifer smell.” Roberts was close with the Florschutzes and the Hellers. They’d celebrated holidays together, and Roberts had coached the younger Heller children at swimming. From what she could see, the slide had plowed right through their properties. She was shaken and didn’t know where to go. Her family stood in the rain wearing just the clothes they escaped in. Her husband was barefoot. The rain was soaking through their sweatshirts, but they were afraid to move. “We could still hear the hillside cracking,” Roberts said. “So we figured if we just stand in this one spot and are quiet, we’ll be able to know which way to go if more starts coming down the hill.” Angie Flickinger, Roberts’ neighbor to the south, didn’t know what had happened. The power had gone out, but she was still in her house. She stepped outside to investigate, thinking a small slide might have come down close by. That had happened two years ago, during a November storm that snapped utility poles and knocked down dozens of trees. She couldn’t see much of anything with her headlamp. The roaring had died down, but the two creeks that run through her property were raging, and the wind was shaking the trees. She tried to reach friends who might know more, but she couldn’t get through to anyone. She thought she might just go to bed, but as she was putting pajamas on, at 9:30 p.m., the phone rang. “It was a friend in town,” Flickinger said. “And she told me that there had been a big slide. Like a major slide.” Just then, something caught Flickinger’s eye out the window. A boat with piercing white lights was charging up the coast. Search and rescue teams arrived quickly, just after 9 p.m. by road on the north side of the slide, and soon after that by boat. In the pitch dark, they made a hasty search and recovered the body of the Heller’s 16-year-old daughter, Mara. But the mud was deep and soft — rescuers who tried to climb the debris sank to their chests. Like the Roberts family, they could hear the unstable hillside shifting in the dark. Before long, they called off the search for the night. About a mile away, Charlie and Mel Hazel saw the search boats, too. A retired couple, they live at mile 12.7 in a house they built 10 years ago. “Great big, huge sodium lights. And they were up here, kind of going around in circles,” Hazel said, pointing to the water north of his property. They watched the lights through the windows of their darkened living room. Then some of the lights started moving their way. “That boat came down here and landed on my dock,” Hazel said. “Then a search and rescue team got off.” They told the Hazels about the landslide. Charlie Hazel gave them the keys to his pickup truck, and they tore off down the road. Back in town, Eric Yancey was firing up his private ferry, the Rainforest Islander. He had learned about the slide from his brother-in-law, who took his fishing boat out to help light the search. Yancey wasn’t sure where he was going or how his ferry might be used — he just wanted to help somehow. Flickinger — and many others — also were not sure what to do or where to go. “I didn’t really know the full severity of it,” Flickinger said. “I didn’t know what I was doing.” Cell reception that far out of town is always unreliable, and the slide had taken out landlines and internet along with the electricity. At 9:36 pm, the city had sent out a text and email alert saying a landslide had happened between miles 10 and 12 — and they sent several more updates through the night. But it’s likely that most people never got them. According to the Wrangell’s interim borough manager, only 10% of residents are signed up for the city’s emergency alert system. Out the road, the houses are spread out, and many have long driveways through large, wooded yards. In the dark, it took hours for firefighters to spread the evacuation warning. Meanwhile, people wandered up and down the road, in cars and on foot. A few went to the slide with flashlights and hand shovels. Some even tried to climb over it, but they retreated once they realized just how far the debris stretched. Others went back to their houses, packed their bags and waited. Some listened for more slides, ready to make a quick escape. Flickinger started walking toward the slide, too, but her neighbors up the road pushed her back. They urged her to go to the school bus turnaround — a flat place near the toe of the mountain where many had already gathered. But Flickinger was worried about her neighbors. She knew the slide had come down near the Roberts’ house, and she hadn’t heard from them. She also thought of a young family down the road. She knocked on their door, but they didn’t answer. Thinking she might be overreacting, she started to head back home. That’s when a truck full of firefighters stopped her. They told her to leave the area and head to Charlie Hazel’s dock. For Flickinger, that’s when fear fully set in. “So I turned around, went back to my friend’s house,” she said. “I screamed and flashed my headlamp in all their windows and doors until they woke up.” The Roberts family finally ventured up from the beach.

The North Pacific Fishery Management Council will meet in early October to discuss opening the crab fishery, which has been closed since 2021. The federal government shutdown, which could start Sunday, wouldn’t stop the regional council from meeting, but it could affect whether or not the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration can distribute IFQ or Individual Fishing Quota, following the Council’s recommendation. While a shutdown has never delayed the opening of the fishery, it has pushed back NOAA’s ability to issue that quota. Still, Gretchen Harrington, assistant regional administrator with NOAA’s Sustainable Fisheries Division, said that staff are working to make sure they can administer quota even if there is a shutdown. “We don't anticipate a delay in issuing IFQ for the [Bristol Bay red king crab] fishery, however there is a lot of uncertainty with any government shutdown,” Harrington told KUCB in an email. U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said in Alaska, crabbers bore the brunt of the last government shutdown. “They couldn't get the allocations for crab, so they couldn't get out in the water,” Murkowski said. “And they missed weeks of a valuable harvest where their boats were tied up.” In North America, red king crab are found in the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, along the coast of the Gulf of Alaska and south to Canada. Red kings are the largest commercially harvested crab and are mainly caught in Bristol Bay. The lucrative Bristol Bay fishery was made internationally famous by the popular reality TV show “Deadliest Catch.” In 2020, Alaska’s king crab commercial landings totaled roughly eight million pounds and were valued at more than $72 million, according to NOAA. The Bristol Bay red king crab fishery has been closed since 2021 due to low numbers of mature females in crab stocks — marking the first closure for the fishery in 25 years. But this year, numbers are looking better. The population is above federal parameters for closure, and officials say the species isn’t overfished or approaching that status. Meanwhile, fisheries specialists say surveys show that snow crab populations remain poor — with both female and male counts at all-time lows. Bering Sea snow crab closed for the first time in the fishery’s history last year. Following the recent crash within the commercial crab industry, a delay in the king crab fishery could be detrimental to some fishermen, even if the total allowable catch for king crab is low. In 2022, Gov. Mike Dunleavy and U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola requested nearly $290 million from the federal government for fishermen impacted by the crab closures. The North Pacific Fishery Management Council and the Scientific and Statistical Committee will set the Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) on Oct. 6. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game will then decide whether or not to open the fishery and set the total catch limits. If opened, the Bristol Bay red king crab season is set to start Oct. 15. CORRECTION: This story originally reported that the Bristol Bay red king crab fishery began in 1966, however, United States fishermen harvested crab in the region prior to this. Accurate reporting of harvest in the domestic Bristol Bay red king crab fishery began in 1966.""}]"

This figure has been in the news a lot lately. But there’s another, more important number that residents haven’t settled on: What is the right amount of cruise tourism? Sitka’s Tourism Task Force is determined to find out. Note: The next Town Hall meeting of the Sitka Tourism Task Force will be 4-8 p.m. Thursday, December 7, in Harrigan Centennial Hall. It will be an Open House format, with presentations on the hour. Listen to the full interview with task force members Phyllis Hackett and Camille Ferguson. If the growth in cruise traffic had been more gradual, Sitka might have found the sweet spot without looking for it. Now, a Tourism Task Force has been charged with finding the “magic number.” They’ve been charged with a list of other things too, but Task Force chair Phyllis Hackett says she got a nudge from city hall to move the overall passenger count to the top of the list. “And then in October we received a call from the city administrator John leach to bring him a number,” Hackett said, “because Cruise Line International Association and the city are ready to develop an MOA (memorandum of agreement) around this, and they need to have a number. So we started in earnest on that.” The Task Force was created back in April, and Hackett says a majority of the nine-member group were involved in the industry over the summer, preventing any full meetings until after the season. Hackett said this helped create the space to formulate a plan. “And it also took time, at least for me –I’m the chair – to wrap our minds around how to go about even gathering a number.” The Task Force’s first Town Hall meeting was on November 27. Rather than a shouting match, it was a carefully-orchestrated data-gathering exercise, with post-it notes and beans – all of which have been recorded and weighed. The next Town Hall will be December 7, when these data will be presented and residents will contribute more information toward helping the Task Force narrow down its target. The Task Force has representatives from various economic segments of the community, but member Camille Ferguson, who represents the Sitka Tribe, says residents should not be overly concerned with that. She wants this process to be human-centered. “Your relationship between these people are more important than any kind of segment,” Ferguson said. “Just as long as your voice is heard, and you’re sharing your concerns, and in a manner that it will help us come up with that magical number. And I think that’s the most important thing.” After the Tourism Task Force identifies an appropriate level of cruise tourism for the community, its work will only be 20-percent finished. Other jobs include an annual review of the city’s tourism funding, looking at land use and waterfront development regulations, regional strategies to advance Sitka’s interests in the industry, and helping develop a Tourism Management Best Practices program. Hackett, a former member of the Sitka Assembly, does not mince words about best practices. “These are the ways we’d like you to behave and run your businesses, when you’re in Sitka to help all of us – them and us, everybody – work better with what we have.” Erin Fulton contributed to this story.

Brianna Rick, University of Alaska Anchorage (THE CONVERSATION) In August 2023, residents of Juneau, Alaska, watched as the Mendenhall River swelled to historic levels in a matter of hours. The rushing water undercut the riverbank and swallowed whole stands of trees and multiple buildings. The source for the flood was not heavy rainfall – it was a small glacial lake located in a side valley next to the Mendenhall Glacier. Glacier-dammed lakes like this are abundant in Alaska. They form when a side valley loses its ice faster than the main valley, leaving an ice-free basin that can fill with water. These lakes may remain stable for years, but often they reach a tipping point, when high water pressure opens a channel underneath the glacier. The rapid and catastrophic drainage of lake water that follows is called a glacial lake outburst flood, or GLOF for short. The flood waters race downstream over hours or days and often hit unexpectedly. Glacial lake outburst floods have destroyed homes, infrastructure and human life around the world. They have killed hundreds of people in Europe and thousands of people in both South America and central Asia. Globally, an estimated 15 million people live downstream from these lakes, with those in Asia’s high mountains at greatest risk. Flooding from a glacial lake in the Himalayas on Oct. 5, 2023, left dozens of people dead in India as water swept away bridges, damaged a hydropower station and flooded small towns. Satellite images showed that the lake level dropped markedly within hours. I study Alaska’s glacial lakes and the hazards that glacier-dammed lakes in particular can create. Our latest research shows how these lakes are changing as global temperatures rise. When glaciers hold back lakes Some glacial lakes are dammed by moraines – mounds of rock and debris that are left behind as a glacier retreats. Too much pressure from extreme rainfall or an avalanche or landslide into the lake can burst these dams, triggering a devastating flood. Officials say that’s likely what happened when the Himalayas’ Lhonak Lake flooded towns in India in October 2023. Glacier-dammed lakes, like Suicide Basin off of Mendenhall Glacier, are instead dammed by the glacier itself. These glacial lakes tend to repeatedly fill and drain due to a cyclic opening and closing of a drainage path under the ice. The fill-and-drain cycles can create hazards every couple of years or multiple times a year. How glacier lake hazards are changing in Alaska In a new study, we identified 120 glacier-dammed lakes in Alaska, 106 of which have drained at least once since 1985. These lakes have collectively drained 1,150 times over 35 years. That is an average of 33 events every year where a lake drains its contents, sending a pulse of water downstream and creating potentially hazardous conditions. Many of these lakes are in remote locations and often go undetected, while others are much closer to communities, such as Suicide Basin, which is within 5 miles of the state capital and has frequently drained over the past decade. Our study found that, as a whole, glacier-dammed lakes in Alaska have decreased in volume since 1985, while the frequency of outbursts remains unchanged. This suggests a regional decline in the potential hazards from glacier-dammed lakes because less stored water is available, a trend that has been documented for glacier-dammed lakes worldwide. To better understand this trend, imagine a bathtub. The higher the sides of the tub, the more water it can hold. For a glacier-dammed lake, the glacier acts as a side of the bathtub. Warming air temperatures are causing glaciers to melt and thin, lowering the tub walls and therefore accommodating less water. That reduces the total volume of water available for a potential glacial lake outburst flood. Smaller lakes, however, have had less significant change in area over time. As the August 2023 event clearly illustrated, even small lakes can have significant effects downstream. Alaskans witnessed a new record of destruction in Juneau from the flood. The water reached nearly 15 feet at the Mendenhall River gauge – 3 feet above its previous record. In summer 2023 alone, Alaskans saw record or near-record flooding from multiple glacier-dammed lakes near populated areas or infrastructure, such as Suicide Basin, near Juneau; Skilak Glacier-Dammed Lake, which affects the Kenai River; and Snow Lake, which impacts the Snow River. These lakes have remained about the same volume but have produced some larger floods in recent years. One possible explanation is that with a thinner and weaker ice dam, the water can drain much more quickly, though further research is needed to understand the mechanics. Regardless, it’s a reminder that these lakes and events are unpredictable. How will rising temperatures affect these lakes? Glacier loss in Alaska is accelerating as temperatures rise. Due to the large volume of glaciers and the many intersecting valleys filled with ice in Alaska, there is a high probability that new lakes will develop as side valleys deglaciate, introducing new potential hazards. Many of these lakes are likely to develop in remote locations, and their presence may only be noticed in satellite images that reveal changes over time. Given the abundance of glacial lakes and their potential threat to human lives, early warning and monitoring systems are worryingly sparse. Efforts are underway, such as those in the Himalayas and Chile, but further research is needed to develop reliable, low-cost monitoring systems and to improve our understanding of these evolving hazards.

The accident safety report from the United States Army Combat Readiness Center is among the documents related to the April 27 crash near Healy, Alaska, that were released in response to a records request from The Associated Press. An analysis of the crash and findings and recommendations were redacted. At the time of the crash, the Army said the two helicopters from the 1st Attack Battalion, 25th Aviation Regiment at Fort Wainwright, near Fairbanks, collided about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Healy when they were returning from training. Healy is about 80 miles (129 kilometers) southwest of Fairbanks. The documents provide some new details. The helicopters were among 14 aircraft that were flying from Donnelly Training Area to Fort Wainwright on a route that included passing through a mountainous area, said the report released Friday. About 48 minutes into the trip, the flight lead took a planned right turn into a mountain pass, the report said. “As the flight of 14 aircraft entered the mountain pass, aircraft in the flight began to decelerate,” the report said. About 30 seconds after making the turn, one of the helicopters hit another and both crashed, the report said. Both aircraft were destroyed. The Army has identified the soldiers who died as Warrant Officer 1 Stewart Duane Wayment, 32, of North Logan, Utah; Chief Warrant Officer 3 Christopher Robert Eramo, 39, of Oneonta, New York; and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Kyle D. McKenna, 28, of Colorado Springs, Colorado. A fourth soldier was injured. That person’s name has not been released. There were two soldiers on each AH-64D Apache helicopter.

Following the crash, which occurred a month after nine soldiers were killed when two Army Black Hawk medical evacuation helicopters crashed during a nighttime training exercise in Kentucky, the Army temporarily grounded aviation units for training. In February, a Black Hawk helicopter from the Tennessee National Guard crashed in Alabama during a flight-training mission, killing two crew members.

Ron DeSantis recently told constituents under 65 not to take the new COVID-19 vaccines, despite Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration recommendations that everyone older than 6 months get the shots. DeSantis’s statement is not based on science or data, which came as no surprise to vaccine scientists like Dr. Peter Hotez. He’s been on the frontlines of what he describes as an aggressive and increasingly dangerous, often partisan, war on science. He details the roots of the problem, his personal experiences and his ideas for moving forward in his chilling new book “The Deadly Rise of Anti-Science.” Hotez is a professor of pediatrics and molecular virology, founding dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine, and co-director of the Texas Children’s Center for Vaccine Development. He joins host Robin Young to discuss the book. The cover of “The Deadly Rise of Anti-Science” by Peter Hotez. (Courtesy of Johns Hopkins Press) By Peter Hotez As bad as things had gotten by 2019 as a result of anti-vaccine campaigns that helped fuel the return of measles in the United States and that made daily life uncomfortable for me and other scientists, nothing quite prepared us for what was about to unfold with the emergence of COVID-19. For a few weeks at the pandemic’s outset, I thought there was a remote possibility that with the world worried about a looming public health impact, the anti-vaccine movement might perhaps go into hibernation or even retreat. Dr. Nancy Messonier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), warned in February 2020 about serious “disruptions to daily life,” and I thought this might prompt many Americans to clamor for safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. Many Americans were indeed eager to receive their COVID-19 vaccinations. However, the opposite also happened. As the pandemic unfolded, it became essential to implement new social-distancing measures and face mask requirements as the government launched its Operation Warp Speed program to accelerate the development of new mRNA (and other technologies) COVID-19 vaccines. These activities mobilized a counteroffensive in the form of a new version of the anti-vaccine movement that cared less about autism and more about personal liberties. Anti-vaccine activists embarked on a new propaganda campaign of “health freedom” or “medical freedom.” By invoking freedom rather than autism, the anti-vaccine movement had become increasingly political, first linking to the Republican Tea Party in Texas before expanding to far-right and conservative groups across the country. This trend had first begun in the 2010s, as anti-vaccine groups in America and extremist politics on the right found each other in unique and interesting ways. First, the anti-vaccine movement needed to reenergize, in part because its foundation based on phony autism links was unraveling. Many of us in the biomedical community provided convincing evidence that vaccines did not and could not cause autism. Detailed and summarized in my 2018 book, Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism, the evidence included large epidemiological studies showing that kids who received vaccines were no more likely to acquire autism than unvaccinated kids. Such findings were further supported by laboratory animal studies that could not find a relationship between vaccines and neurologic changes. In addition, we offered a compelling alternative narrative backed by years of biomedical research supported by the National Institutes of Health, the Simons Foundation, Autism Science Foundation, JPB Foundation, and other philanthropies, which identified multiple autism genes expressed in early fetal development. Therefore, while the thread of autism and vaccines continues among anti-vaccine groups, it is no longer the major driver. The bottom line was that anti-vaccine groups needed a new angle or message to maintain cohesion and to receive an infusion of funding. Linking to far-right elements provided both, even assisting them in the formation of new PACs to lobby or educate state legislatures voting on school vaccine exemptions. One of the first such PACs was Texans for Vaccine Choice in 2015, and I believe such politicization by creating PACs and related mechanisms benchmarks a period when children increasingly attended school without their full complement of routine immunizations ordinarily required for attendance. At the same time, the political far-right sought more adherents and followers. Anti-vaccine groups, including the disinformation dozen, provided “one-stop shopping” to acquire a significant cohort of people who might follow in the path of extremist groups. Through the anti-vaccine movement, potentially thousands of new people could augment the ranks of those professing allegiance to an extremist agenda. In this way, the anti-vaccine groups and the far-right found and mutually reinforced each other. Even groups linked to the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, such as the Proud Boys, began promoting an anti-vaccine agenda. In turn, anti-vaccine rallies could count on the insurrectionist groups to join their protests. The coalescing of the anti-vaccine and far-right created new synergies to amplify a reinvigorated anti-science disinformation empire. Its elements included open expressions of distrust of science by ultraconservative members of the US Senate, House of Representatives (especially its House Freedom Caucus), and some governors, and even efforts by these elected officials to humiliate scientists in public or threaten their employment. They included introducing bills to demand the firing of a prominent government biomedical scientist who served the nation for decades, holding hearings or roundtables to promote anti-vaccine viewpoints, and harassment of nongovernment biomedical scientists who work at universities or nonprofit organizations. Their actions against science and scientists operated through unprovoked and unjustified public pronouncements and—and much more. High-profile conservative news outlets such as Fox News regularly amplified these messages, and the scientific community came under fire from the networks’ highly viewed nighttime anchors. A third group, a carefully cultivated cadre of intellectuals or pseudointellectuals from universities and think tanks, gave academic cover to the assault from the far-right by producing well-crafted false narratives about the harmful effects of COVID-19 preventive measures. In turn, these activities fueled hate from White nationalists and other extremist groups, along with unwell or uneducated individuals, who interpreted the public commentaries on news outlets and podcasts as dog whistles. Finally, even the federal courts had an indirect role, especially conservative justices, who reversed government mandates for vaccines, masks, and other precautions, although in some cases it became difficult to attribute their rulings to ideological leanings versus their bona fide interpretation of the law. The impact of such anti-science activities was immediate on two fronts: First, it made scientists fearful of speaking out to defend the science of COVID-19 vaccines and preventions or to come to the aid of our colleagues under attack. The same might be said of many of our scientific and professional societies. More important, it caused populations in conservative stronghold areas to shun or defy COVID-19 vaccines and other preventions. This led to massive losses in human life as the virus ripped through unvaccinated populations across the nation, but especially in these regions.

Tuesday, the United States grew by a million square kilometers — the equivalent of nearly 60% of Alaska’s land mass. The State Department enlarged the country’s geography, citing international law, by defining how far under the sea the continental shelf extends. The new additions are spread across seven areas of ocean, and more than half of the claim is in the Arctic. “America is larger than it was yesterday,” said Mead Treadwell, a former Alaska lieutenant governor and former chair of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission. Decades of scientific study, dozens of ice breaker missions and detailed seafloor mapping went into making the claim, he said. “It’s not quite the Louisiana Purchase. It’s not quite the purchase of Alaska, but the new area of land and subsurface resources under the land controlled by the United States is two Californias larger,” he said. The State Department didn’t make anyone available for an interview Tuesday, but said in documents that the extended continental shelf claim was made according to the provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The U.S. Senate has never ratified that treaty, but the Biden administration decided to make the claim anyway. It’s a move Treadwell has long urged, as have other past chairs of the Arctic Research Commission. Other countries may raise an eyebrow at the unilateral action but “who’s going to challenge us?” Treadwell said. “Because nobody’s got an overlapping claim. If somebody came back and said, ‘Your science is bad,’ I think the United States would listen. But I don’t think science is bad. I think we’ve had very good science.” The State Department’s recognition of its extended continental shelf in the Arctic doesn’t conflict with a 1990 agreement setting the maritime boundary with Russia. “None of the fixed points delineating the outer limits of the continental shelf of the United States are located west of the agreed boundary with the Russian Federation,” the State Department said in a summary explaining its announcement. The U.S. and other countries already claim 200 miles off their coasts as their exclusive economic zones. They exercise rights in these zones over the resources in the seabed and in the waters above. Tuesday’s declaration of the extended continental shelf, beyond 200 miles from shore, doesn’t include jurisdiction over the water column or fishing rights. Treadwell said it’s still significant, because it gives the federal government control over the seafloor and any valuable resources that can be mined from it, as well as the right to say who can conduct research or lay pipelines across it. Some of the areas of ocean the U.S. has claimed as extended continental shelf are in the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Gulf of Mexico and the Mariana Islands. The large section north of Alaska plus a smaller patch in the Bering Sea total nearly the acreage of Texas. Alaska Public Media is one of our partner stations in Anchorage.

The door of the trailer was found across the street on the roof of another food truck near the beer garden of the Fairview Inn. The Fairview had many of its front-facing windows shattered. Immediately behind Talkeetna Tako is a residence owned by the Sheldon family. Reportedly, the home suffered significant damage. The Sheldons were not home at the time. Part of the roof of the truck landed in the Sheldons’ back yard. Talkeetna Fire Chief Eric Chappel says a propane leak with an unknown ignition source caused the blast. Cleanup began shortly after the explosion. By 9:00 am, almost all of the debris and glass had been cleared from the street. In addition to Talkeetna Tako’s owners, multiple locals turned up to help clear the debris.
