Chance Comanche, 27, was in the Sacramento County Jail Saturday evening after a warrant for first-degree kidnapping was issued in Las Vegas Justice Court early Friday morning. Comanche was allegedly involved in the disappearance of Marayna Rodgers, 23, sources say. Rodgers, a medical assistant from Washington state, had been visiting Las Vegas with friends in early December, her family told KLAS. She hasn’t been seen since December 6. While details of the investigation are limited, KLAS has confirmed that Comanche was taken into custody by an FBI apprehension team on Friday. Neither a criminal complaint or an arresting affidavit were immediately available for Comanche. Comanche was a member of the Stockton Kings, the G League affiliate of the Sacramento Kings. The team released Comanche on Friday. A team spokesperson declined to comment further on the matter. Comanche went undrafted after playing basketball at the University of Arizona and has spent the last two seasons with Stockton. The Stockton Kings played the G League Ignite team at the Dollar Loan Center in Henderson, Nevada on December 5, the day before Rodgers reportedly disappeared. It is unclear how long Comanche may have been in the Las Vegas area. The Stockton Kings then played the Rip City Remix in Portland, Oregon on December 7. A woman has already been taken into custody in connection with Rodgers’ disappearance. Sakari Harnden, 19, faces a first-degree kidnapping charge in connection with Rodgers’ disappearance. As of Saturday evening, she remained in a downtown Las Vegas jail on $500,000 bail. According to a criminal complaint, Harnden said she held or detained Rodgers against her will and without her consent for the purpose of killing her and/or inflicting bodily harm. Las Vegas Justice Court Judge Diana Sullivan set Harnden’s bail at $500,000 on December 14, according to court records. Conditions included high-level electronic monitoring. It also noted for the “State to notify the Court immediately if the alleged victim is located alive.” Harnden is believed to be the last person to see Rodgers before her disappearance. Judge Sullivan also issued the arrest warrant for Comanche. Comanche is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday afternoon in Sacramento County court, jail records showed. Harnden declined an interview with KLAS. She is represented by a public defender, records showed. A preliminary hearing for the kidnapping charge is scheduled for December 28. Loved ones told KLAS that Rodgers had a good job and would never leave her family back home in Washington state, or abandon her dogs she brought with her to Las Vegas. They believe Rodgers’ disappearance is suspicious. Anyone with information is urged to contact Las Vegas Metro Police at (702) 828-3111. Tips can be submitted anonymously through Crimestoppers at (702) 385-5555. Jasmine Lee, the CEO and founder of the Doc Ellis Foundation said that the foundation which advocates for missing and murdered people of color is looking into Rodgers’ disappearance.

Authorities on Friday identified those missing or killed in a southeast Alaska landslide this week as five family members and their neighbor, a commercial fisherman who made a longshot bid for the state's lone seat in the U.S. House last year. Timothy Heller, 44, and Beth Heller, 36 — plus their children Mara, 16; Derek, 12; and Kara, 11 — were at home Monday night when the landslide struck near the island community of Wrangell. Search crews found the bodies of the parents and the oldest child late Monday or early Tuesday; the younger children remain missing, as does neighbor Otto Florschutz, 65, the Alaska Department of Public Safety said in an emailed statement. Florschutz's wife survived. Florschutz, a Republican who previously served on Wrangell's Port Commission, was one of 48 candidates who entered the race to fill the congressional seat vacated when longtime U.S. Rep. Don Young died last year. He received 193 votes out of nearly 162,000 cast. In a candidate statement provided to the Anchorage Daily News back then, Florschutz said he was known for his ability to forge consensus. “As a 42-year commercial fisherman, I have worn many hats,” he said. “Besides catching fish, I have served in community elected positions, done boat repair, mechanics, welding, carpentry, business and much more.” Beth Heller served on the Wrangell School Board from 2019 to 2020 after several years on the district’s parent advisory committee. The Hellers ran a construction company called Heller High Water, said Tyla Nelson, who described herself as Beth Heller's best friend since high school. Beth and Timothy both grew up in Wrangell and married in August 2010, Nelson said. Nelson sobbed as she described her friend as a “fantastic human.” “And she was a wonderful mother,” she said. “She did everything for those babies.” Wrangell School District Superintendent Bill Burr said in an email Friday that counseling would be available for students and staff Monday when school resumes after the Thanksgiving break. “The loss of even one child is a very difficult time, and having an entire family with three students is devastating,” Burr wrote. The slide tore down a swath of evergreen trees from the top of the mountain above the community to the ocean, striking three homes and burying a highway near the island community of Wrangell, about 155 miles (250 kilometers) south of Juneau. One of the homes was unoccupied. The slide — estimated to be 450 feet (137 meters) wide — occurred during a significant rainfall and heavy winds. Wrangell received about 2 inches (5 centimeters) of rain from early Monday until late evening, with wind gusts up to 60 mph (96 kph) at higher elevations, said Aaron Jacobs, a National Weather Service hydrologist and meteorologist in Juneau.

Taylor Helmes joined Action News Now as a producer in 2021. Shasta County Registrar of Voters Cathy Darling Allen said there are less than 20 mail-in ballots that need to be counted, but that it shouldn\'t affect the special election results or delay certifying the election. SHASTA COUNTY, Calif. - A fentanyl scare holding up elections in several states, including California. The FBI is investigating envelopes lace with the deadly opioid sent to election offices in Georgia, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and California. Now, the Shasta County Elections Office is taking extra safety precautions, like having Narcan on hand for staff, in case any mail received is laced with fentanyl. Shasta County Registrar of Voters Cathy Darling Allen told Action News Now that they are getting a free donation of Narcan by the end of Monday. But until then, all the mail sent to the elections office last Thursday and on Monday has been isolated to be examined. The plan is to sort through that mail and count any mail in ballots on Tuesday. ""I think that there is definitely a feeling of concern, generally, and unfortunately I think that\'s the goal, right? To frighten folk and make it harder for us to do our jobs,"" Allen said. ""How do these new threats impact what you and election workers are doing, especially in the middle of a count right now with the special election?"" Action News Now reporter Taylor Helmes asked Allen. ""Obviously it\'s disconcerting and upsetting to know that there\'s someone out there in the world who wants to harm election officials for doing their jobs, that\'s not a great feeling for me or my staff,"" Allen responded. ""I feel strongly that fentanyl is really, really bad. And it\'s out there. It\'s in Redding, it\'s in Shasta County, it\'s everywhere,"" one woman told Action News Now. Allen said most of the mail that\'s been laced with fentanyl, or suspected of being contaminated, has been intercepted at a federal level by the U.S. Postal Service, before being delivered to any elections offices. Allen told Action News Now that the elections offices in Sacramento and Los Angeles counties that have been impacted were notified of the contaminated mail by the U.S. Postal Service. So far, there have been no impacts to the Shasta County Elections Office. One local postal worker told Action News Now that he had no idea about the recent fentanyl-laced mail, but that the inspection system the U.S. Postal Service has in place is really good at catching any mail or packages laced with illegal substances, especially after the 2001 Anthrax Investigation. Allen added that the elections office has been in touch with the Redding Police Department, the FBI, and the U.S. Postal Service for support and resources.

Carlson was the much bigger explosion. He has long been a furiously divisive figure. Conservative viewers rallied to his fiery, nightly condemnations of President Biden, Democrats and alleged left-wing media bias. Liberals condemned him for incendiary language that they complained gave credence to white nationalists and conspiracy theorists. In business terms, Carlson’s departure is also huge news. His show typically vied with “The Five,” also on Fox, as the highest-rated in all of cable news. On Thursday, the most recent day for which ratings were available as of Monday afternoon, Carlson was in the top spot, with a fraction under three million viewers. Carlson has, at time of writing, not commented on his departure. On air, Fox News’s Harris Faulkner said that the network and Carlson had “mutually agreed to part ways.” Here are some possible reasons why the dramatic move happened. Carlson was a central figure in the defamation case that had been taken against Fox by Dominion Voting Systems. The high-profile legal battle was settled last week, with Fox agreeing to pay Dominion $787.5 million. But the network did not commit to issuing an apology, instead merely saying that it was willing to “acknowledge” the court’s ruling “finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.” The case revolved around false claims about the 2020 election that were propagated on the network’s airwaves. Those included some incorrect — and wild — suggestions that Dominion somehow had a hand in flipping votes from then-President Trump to President Biden. But, in its efforts to prove that the network had acted with actual malice or reckless disregard for the truth, Dominion also uncovered private messages that told a different story from the one being told on air. On one occasion, for example. Carlson told colleagues that Trump lawyer Sidney Powell “is lying” in some of her claims. On another, Carlson sought the firing of a Fox reporter who had fact-checked a tweet from Trump. Many media observers thought that Fox, which is vastly profitable, would simply pay the settlement and continue down the same road as before. Now, it looks like that may have been wrong. If there were legal reasons why Fox decided to distance itself from Carlson, they may not be confined to the specific allegations regarding Dominion. Tangential to that case, a woman named Abby Grossberg on March 20 filed a legal suit against Fox News, Carlson and several others. At the time, Grossberg was head booker on Carlson’s show, though she was subsequently fired by then network. In her 79-page complaint, Grossberg framed her experiences as “yet another in the long line of cases chronicling the misogynistic environment that permeates Fox News.” Her suit also alleged that the atmosphere on Carlson’s show “subjugates women based on vile sexist stereotypes, typecasts religious minorities and belittles their traditions, and demonstrates little to no regard for those suffering from mental illness.” Grossberg alleged that she “felt coerced” to give misleading testimony in the Dominion case. But she also alleged that the work area for Carlson’s show included “many large and blown-up photos” of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in a swimsuit; that she was asked about whether a Fox personality with whom she had previously worked, Maria Bartiromo, was in a sexual relationship with Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), which she was not; and was subject to grossly inappropriate conversations about whether Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) or her Republican opponent last November, Tudor Dixon were “hotter and more f**kable.” Fox strongly denies wrongdoing in the case. But the allegations in themselves may still have weighed Carlson down in ways that he could ill afford. The reputational danger to Fox from the Dominion suit did not only come from the bogus claims of election chicanery. There was also a broader danger that loyal viewers of the network might begin to ask whether they were being conned. Perhaps the single most striking example came from Carlson. In one text, revealed in the discovery process, Carlson said of Trump, “I hate him passionately.” An assessment so incongruous with Carlson’s on-air attitudes to the former president had to raise questions. There was presidential buzz about Carlson at one point, though it has recently become more muted. Back in 2020, a Politico story suggested that if the anchor were to get into the 2024 race, there were many in the GOP “believing he would be an immediate frontrunner in a Republican primary.” Later developments — such as Carlson’s appearance last year at a key meeting of social conservatives in Iowa also set tongues wagging. Still, it strains credulity to imagine Carlson would depart Fox so abruptly, with so few hints dropped in advance, if this was really his intention. He will have plenty more time on his hands now, of course. Maybe that would make a run for office more appealing. But it seems equally likely he will land elsewhere on the media landscape, or try to plow his own furrow as another controversial former Fox News personality, Bill O’Reilly, has done. Not really, obviously. Fox News is hardly renowned for doing anything at the behest of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). But the fact that Carlson’s departure came right on the heels of pointed criticism from the New York Democrat incited plenty of comment from the host’s defenders. In an MSNBC interview broadcast Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez told anchor Jen Psaki — formerly President Biden’s White House Press Secretary — that Carlson and Fox were guilty of “very, very clear incitement of violence” and suggested some form of “federal regulation” should be deployed to curb such rhetoric. Glenn Greenwald, often a guest on Carlson’s show, characterized Ocasio-Cortez as having “demanded that the Govt. ban Tucker from being allowed on TV.” On the right, there was also more generalized sympathy for Carlson and frustration with Fox. “Wherever Tucker Carlson goes, America will follow!” Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo) tweeted. Donald Trump Jr., the former president’s eldest son, told conservative activist Charlie Kirk that Carlson’s departure “changes things permanently” and was “mind-boggling.” Michael Caputo, a longtime friend and advisor to Trump, tweeted a screenshot apparently showing him canceling his subscription to Fox Nation in the wake of the news. As for Ocasio-Cortez, she tweeted a news story about Carlson’s departure Monday and appended just one word: “Wow.” Submit Δ Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

In each of the three complaints, the winemakers made an ""inverse condemnation"" claim, essentially arguing that PacifiCorp operates as a government entity by virtue of being a state-sanctioned utility, and it took property — by damaging or decreasing its value — in an unauthorized form of eminent domain. Jim Bernau, owner of Willamette Valley Vineyards, said the fruit was just starting to ripen for the harvest when the wildfires burned through the Cascades.

An online fundraising effort says she contracted the bacterial infection after eating fish and is now a quadruple amputee. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently issued a warning about a bacterial infection that people can get by eating raw or undercooked fish or by exposing an open wound to coastal waters. A friend tells us this San Jose woman likely got this specific infection after eating undercooked tilapia. A San Jose mother’s life is changed forever. Laura Barajas, 40, has had her limbs amputated while battling a bacterial infection. “It’s just been really heavy on all of us. It’s terrible. This could’ve happened to any of us,” said Barajas’ friend Anna Messina. Messina says back in late July Barajas had bought tilapia from a local market for dinner. She cooked it and ate it alone. Within days, she got very ill and was then hospitalized. “She almost lost her life. She was on a respirator,” Messina said. “They put her into a medically induced coma. Her fingers were black, her feet were black her bottom lip was black. She had complete sepsis and her kidneys were failing.” Now, a month and a half later, Barajas is without her arms and legs. Messina believes the infection was caused by Vibrio vulnificus — a bacterial infection the CDC has been warning about. “The ways you can get infected with this bacteria are one-you can eat something that’s contaminated with it the other way is by having a cut or tattoo exposed to water in which this bug lives,” said UCSF Infectious Disease Expert Dr. Natasha Spottiswoode. Spottiswoode says the bacteria is especially concerning for people who are immunocompromised. The CDC says about 150-200 cases of the infections are reported each year and about one in five people with the infection die — sometimes within one to two days of becoming ill. “People should take sensible precautions like if you have a cut avoid getting immersed in water until it’s well healed,” Spottiswoode said. “If you are someone immunocompromised keeping an eye on these things and avoiding those high-risk activities and foods.” Messina says she and Barajas’ family are still waiting to learn more about what happened. She hopes people realize how precious life can be. “Be thankful for what we have right now because it can be taken away so quickly so easily,” Messina said. Messina set up a GoFundMe to help with her friend’s medical expenses. So far, it has raised more than $95,000. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

city council meeting took an unexpected turn Tuesday night after multiple white supremacist remarks were made by anonymous callers during public comment, delaying the review of a state-mandated housing plan The city was unable to post the meeting to its Youtube channel as normal due to the language and the video will be posted on its website with edits. The city tells KSBW 8 they will provide the full meeting upon request. During the public comment period for the city\'s state-required housing plan, an anonymous caller went on an antisemitic and racist tirade that was unrelated to the agenda item. The anonymous caller was able to finish their remarks. Afterwards, multiple, back-to-back hateful, explicit calls, Mayor Tyller Williamson interrupted the caller. ""I appreciate you providing public comment. We do have agenda item. Do you have a comment related to the item on the agenda?"" he said. The caller then went on to spout hateful comments towards Jewish and Black communities. ""I\'d have to say that was some of the most disturbing comments I\'ve ever heard. And I\'ve been in a lot of council meetings and planning commission meetings. And Mayor, I wish you had brought them into order immediately,"" one person said during public comment. According to the city\'s communication manager, Laurie Huelga, all the hateful comments were anonymous and made using Zoom, an option the city adopted during the pandemic to increase accessibility. ""The unfortunate consequence of that is that we lost control of who\'s coming in and they\'re trying to derail our agenda,"" Williamson said. He says he supports keeping phone and Zoom calls as an option for public comment. ""I think that at the very least we have to look at how do we quickly remove people from the Zoom who are disrupting the business operations of the council,"" Williamson said. City leaders believe it was a coordinated attack by people who do not live in Monterey. ""I had some initial conversations with staff that this was an organized group that posted about this with well intentioned public meetings across the country, and it just so happened that Monterey was one of those cities,"" Williamson said. KSBW was unable to independently verify that information, but according to the Anti-defamation League\'s Center on Extremism, there has been an increase in antisemitic speech and trolling efforts at public forums like city council meetings, some of which are by organized extremist groups like the antisemitic Goyim Defense League, white supremacist White Lives Matter network and the far-right Proud Boys. There have been recent similar disruptions in San Diego and the state of Maine. Monterey\'s 2023-31 housing plan will move forward and seek state approval as intended, but without formal approval by city council. Correction: The original article stated that city leaders said the audio was too explicit to share with the public and decided to not release an unedited version of the meeting. This has been corrected to say that the city ran into issues posting the video because of its content.
