(WPRI) — Police are investigating after a man was shot in broad daylight near Providence College. The shooting happened just before 2 p.m. Thursday in the area of Pembroke Avenue and Chad Brown Street. Providence Police Major David Lapatin said the victim was in a car when he was “shot several times” by someone in a different vehicle. The victim, a man in his 30s, drove himself to Roger Williams Medical Center, then was transferred to Rhode Island Hospital, where he’s now stable, according to Lapatin. At least 10 shell casings could be seen in the roadway, which has since reopened. Detectives were going door to door and interviewing witnesses in a neighborhood occupied mainly by college students. Lapatin said the victim was not a Providence College student. No one besides the victim was hurt, however, many of the residents were shaken up. Lauren Moriarty told 12 News she was walking home alone when the shooting happened about 100 feet away from her. “Two cars pulled up next to each other at this intersection and they started shooting at each other while they were driving,” she recalled. “They kept driving, and I turned around and ran back home because I didn’t know what to do. It was just scary.” Lapatin said detectives have a few leads, but it’s still early in the investigation. According to a spokesperson for Providence College, an alert was sent out to students as soon as school officials learned of the shooting. Thanks for signing up! Watch for us in your inbox.

(WPRI) — Providence police say a person was hit by a vehicle Friday morning on North Main Street. According to police, the vehicle had a green signal and was turning left from Rochambeau Avenue when it hit the pedestrian, who was crossing North Main Street with a walk signal. The collision caused the pedestrian to mount the hood of the vehicle and fall to the ground. The driver stopped immediately, according to information provided by police spokesperson Lindsay Lague. Police said the pedestrian complained of a head injury and was taken to Rhode Island Hospital for minor injuries. It’s not clear if the driver will face any charges or citations. The same intersection was the site of a deadly hit-and-run on New Year’s Eve. The victim, 57-year-old Edwin English, died about a week later. Police eventually arrested 31-year-old Ariel Acosta, who was charged with failing to stop in an accident resulting in death. Acosta was released on bail and is due back in court in May. She also faces several traffic citations. English’s death was the third deadly hit-and-run incident to happen on North Main Street in the past year. Safety advocates want to see changes to North Main Street. The North Main Street Task Force, led by Providence City Councilwoman Sue AnderBois, convened earlier this year to study how the safety of the area can be improved.
