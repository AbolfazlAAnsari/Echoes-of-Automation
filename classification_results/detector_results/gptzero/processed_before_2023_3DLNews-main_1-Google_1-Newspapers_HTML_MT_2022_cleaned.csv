Right now, the Bureau of Indian Affairs estimates that there are about 16,000 feral horses on the Blackfeet Reservation. “The horses are not good for the land,” shares Harvey Sansavere from the BIA Range Department. “Our acreage is limited, and most of the reservation land is only open as grazing units for five months to give the grass a chance to regrow. These horses are grazing year-round, though, which means the grass doesn’t get the chance to recover. We are seeing people pay for the grazing units and then go to put the cows on it, only to find that all the grass has been consumed by feral horses.” One rancher was confronted with that exact reality in the summer of 2020. After paying for a 10-year lease, a deal they hoped was going to be a lifesaver in the middle of the pandemic and drought, the rancher found that the unit was just bare dirt along with about a hundred head of unclaimed horses. That rancher was only able to use it for about three weeks that summer instead of the whole grazing season. “I can’t keep my cattle there,” he said. “There’s barely any grass for them to eat. I’ve run the horses out about once a week since that summer, but they just keep finding their way back in.” To read the complete article, pick up a copy of this week’s issue or subscribe to the Browning Glacier Reporter, Cut Bank Pioneer Press, Shelby Promoter and The Valierian newspapers at http://www.cutbankpioneerpress.com/site/services/ Log In Keep it Clean.

Awakened for a brief period during a seven-hour brain surgery Stroud needed to play while a surgeon monitored his brain. The moment was part of a more than a decade-long journey for the Whitefish resident as he sought a solution to a condition that had left him unable to play the instrument he loves. “They give you the guitar,” he says. “Here I am with two IVs in my left arm and one in my right hand, and an oxygen indicator, it’s really hard to play and they are holding the neck of the guitar. I thought I played awful.” Stroud, 67, suffers from focal hand dystonia, a neurological disorder that leads to impaired hand use that is characterized by involuntary and abnormal movements in the hands and fingers. Symptoms include subtle loss of control, lack of precision and curling of the fingers, and tremor, according to the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation. Estimates are that about 1% of professional musicians are affected by dystonia, but there are likely large numbers of musicians who remain unidentified, according to the foundation. Stroud says musicians are athletes of the small muscles often getting injuries after practicing hours per day, but in his case, that wasn’t the issue. “My hand moves fine, but it’s confused — it won't do what the brain is telling it to do,” he said. “You can have dystonia in other parts of the body, but this is very precise as it has to do with my right hand.

Then as life began to slow down some, he picked up his guitar again. “I changed careers because I knew it was going to be hard to make a living playing classical guitar,” he said. “For 24 years I didn’t really play much at all because I was involved in building my business. But then my youngest child was graduating high school and I gave him an electric guitar. Then I picked up the classical guitar out of the closet and got re-engaged.” He started playing again giving concerts, but around 2010 he started having problems using his hand — unable to make the precise movements necessary to play — eventually being diagnosed with focal hand dystonia. That began a quest to overcome it. After meeting with a neurologist who works with musicians, he tried getting botox injections designed to relax the muscles in the hand, but that wasn’t successful. Then he spent a year at a clinic in Spain going through exercises in an attempt to retain his brain, but that didn’t work either.

Anna East, tribal relations and education fellow with the Montana Digital Academy, talks about her work with the Digital Academy and Montana's tribes creating digital language courses. Over the past year, East has been designing courses for each Native language in Montana. Arrowheads and beadwork are some of the repatriated sacred artifacts now on display at the Fort Peck Cultural Resource Department in Poplar. Director Dyan Youpee said the blue and white bead symbols symbolize feathers. A bill requiring the repatriation of Native cultural objects has passed the U.S. House and Senate and is headed to President Joe Biden's desk to be signed into law. The Safeguard Tribal Objects of Patrimony (STOP) Act “prohibits the exportation of Native American cultural items and archaeological resources that were illegally obtained; provides for the return of such items, … and establishes and increases related criminal penalties.” Specifically, the bill increases the maximum prison term — from five years to 10 years — for someone convicted of selling, buying or transporting human remains or cultural objects that were illegally obtained. The bill also requires the Interior Department and State Department to arrange for the voluntary return of human remains and sacred items. The law also requires Interior to: refer people and organizations to tribes to facilitate the voluntary return of items; convene an interagency working group, and convene an Indigenous working group consisting of representatives from tribes to provide advice on issues concerning the repatriation of sacred items. Items of significance that are appropriate for public viewing will be showcased in the first ever Live Museum Event on the Fort Peck Reservation on Sept. 23. The Fort Peck Tribes earlier this year repatriated cultural items — including a beaded buckskin, rawhide drum with pictographs, beaded leather bags and a Dakota girl’s dress, among other things — from the University of Montana. Fort Peck Cultural Resource Department Director Dyan Youpee alleged that UM was not in compliance with the Native American Graves Protection Act (NAGPRA), a federal law stating that human remains and other items of cultural significance belong to lineal descendants and tribes. If signed into law, the STOP Act would build upon NAGPRA. Dave Kuntz, director of strategic communications at UM, said it’s the university's intention to be compliant with federal law. He added UM hopes to hire a repatriation coordinator, whose full-time job would be to work with tribes to return items of significance. UM in August received $99,314 from the National Park Service to support documentation and repatriation of such items.

Initial testing was completed on Oct. 7. Missoula Public Health is performing contact tracing and will communicate with individuals identified as a close contact. To protect patient confidentiality, no further details related to the patient will be disclosed. “MPX is still actively spreading in the United States,” said Missoula Public Health Officer D’Shane Barnett. “Individuals who are most at risk are encouraged to get vaccinated, take precautions, and screen potential partners for symptoms.” Anyone experiencing MPX-like symptoms should contact their healthcare provider immediately, he said MPX vaccine eligibility can be found on missoulainfo.com. Individuals can be screened for eligibility and get vaccine appointments by calling 406-258-3896. Symptoms of MPX can include fever, headache, muscle aches and backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, exhaustion, and a rash that can look like pimples or blisters that appear on the face, inside the mouth, and on other parts of the body. The illness typically lasts 2-4 weeks and most people get better on their own without treatment. At times, MPX can cause scars from the sores, the development of secondary infections, such as pneumonia, or other complications. The virus does not easily spread between people with casual contact, but transmission can occur through contact with infectious sores and body fluids; contaminated items, such as clothing or bedding; or through respiratory droplets associated with prolonged face-to-face contact. Individuals who believe they may have been exposed to MPX or have the characteristic rash or other symptoms, should contact their health care provider. There is no treatment specifically for MPX. However, because MPX and smallpox viruses are closely related, antiviral drugs (such as tecovirimat) and vaccines developed to protect against smallpox may be used to prevent and treat MPX virus infections. The need for treatment will depend on how sick someone gets or whether they are likely to get severely ill. DPHHS has pre-positioned a supply of tecovirimat in the state for use, if necessary. CDC does not recommend widespread vaccination against MPX at this time. Missoula Public Health and DPHHS will follow CDC vaccination recommendations for MPX vaccination and expanded criteria which may be recommended for the following individuals as of Oct. 11, 2022: Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP): • Adults over 18 who had exposure to individuals with confirmed infection. Post-exposure prophylaxis ++ (PEP++): • Adults who had multiple sexual partners in the past 14 days in a jurisdiction with known MPX This may include: • Known contacts who are identified by public health via case investigation, contact tracing, and risk exposure assessments • People who are aware that one of their sexual partners from the past 2 weeks has received a MPX diagnosis. • Gay, bisexual, other men who have sex with men, and transgender people who report any of the following in the past 2 weeks: • Group sex or sex with multiple partners. • Sex at a commercial sex venue or in association with an event, venue, or defined geographic area where MPX transmission has been reported. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP): Adults who meet one of the following criteria: • Individuals who have recently had multiple or anonymous sexual partners; OR • Partners of individuals who have had multiple or anonymous sexual partners; OR • Sex workers; OR Staff at establishments where sexual activity occurs (e.g., bathhouses, saunas, sex clubs); OR • Were diagnosed with gonorrhea or early syphilis within the past 12 months; OR • Persons experiencing homelessness with high-risk behaviors; OR • Are on HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis; OR • Are part of high risk cohorts identified by clinical staff in the correctional system; OR • Individuals deemed to have high-risk based on individual risk assessments.

It\'s a popular phrase you will hear when discussing dental marketing that is cast in the light as a cure-all for your advertising woes. While it\'s true that having brand authority is desirable for your dental practice, if you don\'t understand its core concepts and how to apply them to your business, it\'s simply jargon. The concept of brand authority boils down to a basic understanding of what we understand about a brand in concrete form. It\'s a perception of your dental practice\'s expertise within its industry or specialty. If your dental team is treated as experts in orthodontics by the general public, your clinic would have brand authority. It\'s important to understand you can\'t declare this status independently. You must earn it through the trust and good reputation your patients and community confer on your practice. However, you can influence this opinion of your organization through demonstrated action over time. Brand authority is all about earning your patients\' trust by proving your dental knowledge and care are of the best quality. This means those who come to you for oral healthcare know their hard-earned money is well spent at your office. Now that you have a better understanding of what brand authority is and why you need it, let\'s explore the steps involved to develop it for your dental practice: To better define your brand, you need to have a clear picture of your competition and what you bring to the playing field. Market research can be invaluable for this phase of developing brand authority for your dental practice. There are two primary areas to analyze: Target Audience Who is your ideal patient? First, you need to consider their demographics, like age, income, occupation, dental care, and lifestyle behaviors. These details can help you create a buyer persona to better understand what gets them engaged with your dental practice when it comes to oral healthcare products and services. Market Competitors Competitor analysis is the next step of the analysis process. Evaluate other companies that provide dental services in your specific niche. You need to figure out what areas of their marketing strategy work the best for their offices and what isn\'t. Also, take note of any design elements that may be supporting or hurting their branding. Dental practices with large patient bases are a great place to begin your research. If you had to pick five adjectives that currently describe your dental brand, what would they be? Do you feel it\'s accurate, or is there a different personality you want to pursue when you look at this list? It\'s essential you determine this aspect of your business early in this development phase. You need to also figure out what niche or specialty you belong to. After all, you won\'t always be appealing to every patient who finds your dental office. To brand your clinic effectively, you need to narrow down this aspect of your business because it will make it easier to create your story. A brand story shares your dental practice\'s core values and its mission statement with your audience. These two elements will help your office connect with current and prospective patients who share similar ideas as you when it comes to their oral health. If you aren\'t sure where to start with this phase, keep your primary focus on your dental practice\'s values and primary focus. Everything else will naturally flow from this starting point. While completing this exercise, keep in mind what services, treatments, and patient care options make your brand different from other offices in your area. The values, purpose, and unique characteristics you decide on will be a consistent aspect of your brand that your patients will see in everything you do. This step may not apply to everyone reading this article. But, if you\'re a new oral healthcare startup, the name you choose for your brand should convey your personality and support your credibility from the moment someone hears it. Keep your dental practice name concise so that patients can easily remember and recognize it. However, keep the future in mind. Should your operations expand by adding a partner or additional branch offices, will your name remain the same? If possible, pick a nearly future-proof moniker, meaning you can add on to it as necessary. For example, Piedmont Family Dentistry can become Piedmont Family Dentistry and Orthodontics when adding a specialty. You can go for less specific wording by using descriptive nouns and adjectives to describe what services you\'re recognized for, such as Smiles, Inc. Brand names made up of just a few words should evoke a clear idea of what your dental company is all about. Before printing up your business cards and sending off a weekly mailer request to be printed and mailed, research your name thoroughly. You can go to your secretary of state online and search a business database to ensure your dental practice has an original title. You should also do searches on Google and Yelp just to double-check there isn\'t someone already using the name you created. You don\'t necessarily need music to go with your slogan, but not using one for your dental office is a lost opportunity to have a brand asset that helps current and potential patients relate to your dental business. Don\'t let it worry you if you can\'t come up with a slogan on your own. You can always check out other services in your area by researching popular hashtags and slogans on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. Or, you can consult with dental marketing agencies like Adit, which has experience helping dental practices create their brand identities and logo development. The visual you create to represent your dental company when developing brand authority is equally important. Visual language involves more than just your language but your company\'s look and feel to patients and the public. So, when designing your website, newsletters, and even social media ads and blogs, you need a consistent appearance across all your assets. One of the best investments you can make in developing your brand\'s style is to create a style guide. This documentation will outline design expectations to keep your dental office\'s visual language consistent across different forms of collateral. Typically, the foundation of a style guide will cover at least the following five elements: Logo Your dental logo serves as more than a reminder of your company\'s name. It is a snapshot of your brand\'s visual style and values. All the elements you choose to represent your business visually should be incorporated into your logo. Your logo will be cohesive with the other assets that your patients interact with, from its color scheme to typography. Color Scheme A dental brand\'s chosen color scheme usually consists of anywhere from five to eight colors. These will be used to generate a heightened brand awareness that will instantly remind patients and competitors of your dental practice and its authority. When choosing the perfect color palette for your brand, make sure they are psychologically appealing and support your personality. For example, if your dental organization specializes in pediatric dentistry and promotes miles of smiles, you probably want to use primary colors in calming patterns. This scheme innately appeals to children\'s sense of service, caring for their feelings, interests, and breeds trust. You should also consider colors most commonly associated with your industry or dental specialty. For example, hospitals often have blends of white and blue to indicate cleanliness and trust. Dental offices frequently include green to indicate well-being. Media While you might assume that any picture with a bright, healthy smile is appropriate for your website, ad campaigns, or email newsletter--think again! The subjects in any photographs or videos you include need to represent your buyer\'s persona. If you serve a diverse community, you want to ensure your models are also diversified. Photos need to be relatable to the viewer to be most effective. This same principle applies to any infographics you post, videos you upload, and even the type of button styles used on your web pages. Every visual aspect of your content should represent your brand through color schemes, fonts, media, layout design, etc. Typography Fonts are a lot of fun when creating infographics, sales brochures, and ads for your dental office. However, the typography you choose will directly reflect your brand. You want to select a few typeface options that create a unique look that will instantly remind the reader of your company. Try to ensure the font styles you choose are: Most fonts are copyrighted, though there are some no-cost options available. However, it may be best to go ahead and purchase a few use licenses so you won\'t have to worry about infringing on the artist\'s intellectual property rights. As you can see, creating a style guide can answer many questions about what visual language should be used when creating collateral for your dental firm. However, you can also include elements, such as'}]"

Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen joins with law enforcement officials and legislators as he addresses crime and Governor Greg Gianforte's budget recommendations during a meeting in Billings on Wednesday. Attorney General Austin Knudsen press conference in Billings. State law enforcement leadership cited an increase in drug seizures and violent crime in pressing lawmakers Wednesday to invest in more agents, prosecutors and equipment going into the 2023 Montana State Legislature. Local legislators joined Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen in Billings, with Knudsen supporting Gov. Greg Gianforte’s budget recommendations for the state’s Department of Justice. A $4 million and $3.1 million investment into the DOJ for the fiscal years of 2024 and 2025, respectively, would cover the cost of new proposals for DOJ personnel in specific agencies, along with patrol vehicles and firearms. “We worked with [the governor’s office] to include funding in the executive budget recommendation to the legislature for 21 additional positions, largely law enforcement officers, including Montana Highway Patrol troopers, major crimes investigators, human trafficking and narcotics agents,” Knudsen said at the MHP district office in Billings. “We’re also seeking three new prosecutors for the state Department of Justice, so that when those 21 new law enforcement officers catch criminals, we make sure they go to jail and stay there.” Gianforte outlined his $14.4 billion two-year budget Dec. 7 in Helena, Lee Newspapers previously reported. With a surplus of more than $2 billion, the governor’s budget has hundreds of millions of dollars being invested in Montana State Hospital and the Department of Corrections. The state DOJ is currently allotted nearly $299 million from 2024 through 2025, according to the Governor’s Office of Budget and Program Planning. New proposals for the DOJ include bolstering the department’s efforts to combat human trafficking by adding four agents assigned to specific locations across the state to assist federal and local partners. A new prosecutor focused specifically on human trafficking was also a new proposal, with human trafficking cases initiated by the state DOJ increasing from 16 in 2021 to 64 so far this year. The DOJ’s Division of Criminal Investigation assisted the FBI in several kidnapping and human trafficking cases earlier this year. In October, Angelo Corey Stackhouse was sentenced in federal court to life in prison for drug trafficking and kidnapping. One of his victims was an underage girl living on the Crow Reservation. In stemming the flow of meth and fentanyl into Montana, the governor’s budget proposal has three narcotics agents added and one additional prosecutor. Agents with the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program seized more than 155,000 dosage units of illicit fentanyl in Montana from the start of 2022 through September. Meth continues to be the most prolific drug seized by law enforcement in the state, with the Attorney General’s Office reporting 172 pounds confiscated during that same time frame. However, RMHITDA members seized more fentanyl this year than all the previous years combined. “It’s truly staggering,” Knudsen said. Along with near-record amounts of illicit drugs seized, MHP Col. Steve Lavin said troopers on the state’s highways seized a record-setting amount of illegal firearms in 2022. The executive budget proposal has marked funding for five new troopers, and a data analyst for MHP. Other recommendations in the governor’s budget for the DOJ include: three more DCI agents dedicated to major crimes across the state such as murders, rapes and use-of-force investigations involving law enforcement, investigators for crimes involving vulnerable adults and internet crimes against children and more staff for the state’s Missing Murdered Indigenous People and Sex Assault Nurse Examiner programs.
