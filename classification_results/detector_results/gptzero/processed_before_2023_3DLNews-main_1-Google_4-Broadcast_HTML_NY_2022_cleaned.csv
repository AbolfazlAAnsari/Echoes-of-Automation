Get his official bio, social pages and more! Photo: Getty Images You wonder where the churches are. As American society is awash in new morality, as ageless conventions are toppled and condemned, as the teachings of millennia are dismissed and the very definitions of humanity are changed, where are the shepherds of the Savior’s flock, and what guidance do they give? For the most part, they are passive and silent. Or worse, they have gone over to the side of confusion. But seldom are they heard, and seldom do they lead, and seldom do they seem to be a light of the world. Nowhere do you find the courage and clarity of Isaiah, who foresaw this technique of the adversary and warned those who might be deceived by it. “Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil,” he wrote, “that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!” “Woe” means great sorrow and discouragement, a fundamental unhappiness. And that is where an increasing percentage of Americans are, lost and confused, just as an Old Testament prophet foresaw they would be. Yet Americans navigate these perilous times with the guideposts of biblical truth obscured and forgotten, their watchmen upon the walls silent and blind. The churches are often like salt that has lost its savor. While the world shouts that good is evil and evil is good, that men are women and women are men, that right is wrong and wrong is right. The absolute and eternal truths of humankind’s Creator are seldom heard, including across the pulpit. Religion, which in most cultures and in most eras shapes social attitudes and practices, has been silenced or co-opted in modern America. We have redefined marriage and gender, issues addressed in scripture, and the preachers of the gospel have looked the other way. We have rejected law, devalued work, preached entitlement, suppressed speech, and burdened portions of our society with ever heavier taxes – contrary to cultural practices rooted in traditional Christianity – and the Christian ministers have been silent. We have replaced love of neighbor with tribal hatred, and the structures of power in our society seem intent on pitting us against one another to the point of violence and social dissolution. Those institutions of power – the government, the school and university, the entertainment and news media – all preach a strange gospel, focused in large part on children, that confuses the mind and obscures the truth. And the churches are silent. Not only about what is the truth, but on the existence of truth. Religion declares that truth is absolute and eternal, that it is not subject to the opinion of man but is established by God. Situations may change, but truth never does, and the role of the religious has always been to proclaim the truth, to humbly seek to learn it from God and to share it with the world. Christians, Muslims and Jews have done that, and so have most believers of other faiths. Certainly, there are disagreements, and a free and tolerant society like the United States recognizes and accommodates that. But the overlap of common belief among the faithful is broad, and the divine principles valued in a Muslim home are often the same as those cherished in a Christian home, and the Catholic is not that much different from the Baptist. And the cause of all believers is largely the same – freedom and decency, the right to believe and live as you wish, and the common embrace of right over wrong. But American society has veered from that. There is no more right and there is no more wrong, and the immorality of yesterday is the morality of today. Good is called evil and evil is called good. There is no God and those who worship him are marginalized and ridiculed in society, the freedom of religion restricted to an hour a week behind closed doors. And those shepherds and pastors called to guard the flock are silent as it wanders into forbidden and dangerous paths. The ecumenical groups and councils of churches, having long since sold their souls for a mess of progressive pottage, are useless to the task. Some religious bodies seek accommodation with the social masters, ignoring the reality that those who try to appease the lion end up in its stomach. Individual ministers and congregations, perhaps fearful of public ridicule or a loss of non-profit status, are silent, like lambs to the slaughter. All while our children and society stumble through the fog of demonic deception, straying into the bondage and sorrow of those who do not know the truth and cannot be set free by its tenets. The war between evil and good rages on, and good is not fighting back. Its institutions have largely abandoned the field. And when the wicked rule, in government or in the pulpit, the people mourn. The battle for souls and safety is raging all around, and you wonder where the churches are.'}]"

Remember Fannie Mae & Freddy Mac? @caroljsroth tells me Biden is now using them to make sure YOU WILL OWN NOTHING: ""How do we make people struggling financially feel wealthier? We\'ll let them take ""equity"" out of their homes, which is buying votes...& likely highly inflationary."" The EU just approved one of the BIGGEST THREATS to freedom in America. The new rules FORCE American companies to follow their ESG standards. And not just giant corps that operate in the EU. If your business is connected to that supply chain in any way, YOU have to comply too.

Jun 1, 2024 Jun 1, 2024 Jun 1, 2024 Jun 1, 2024 Jun 1, 2024 TESTIMONIALS “The Sharon Q team has been hosting the Home IQ Radio Show on WYSL with Bob Savage and we are thrilled at the response from the listeners. There has been so much positive feedback and new business from the community! The experience is wonderful and we are so happy with the way this opportunity has worked out for our business.” “I once received a call from a guy who said Hey I’m so-and-so, and I own a small garage door company. I don’t need you right now, but I just wanted to let you know that if I ever needed computer help, I’d support you because you’e part of the WYSL family. I’ve been on the air since fall of 2012, and it took me about a year to see consistent results. From then on, I receive 1 new client per month on average from people who listen to my show, who trust and support me because I’m here. WYSL is a mom and pop station, a hidden gem in a cookie-cutter world. Its people are down-to earth people, my kind of people. It’s a place where the truth is still real.” “This has truly been THE most successful form of advertising we have ever done. Success for us is defined in two forms: 1. Hearing our current clients call us or email us to say that they heard the show and that they are dedicated WYSL listeners 2. Getting phone calls from new clients weekly that say that they have heard us on WYSL and want to schedule an appointment time with us. 3. The fan club,yes people want to meet me and tell their friends they met me! Do I see a return on our investment with WYSL? We calculated that we need to have a at least 5 clients each month to place insurance with us to cover the monthly cost of the show. Does that happen? Yes, it does. A slow week for us is getting only 1-3 new calls generated from the show. The calls are from individuals or couples wanting to have their insurance evaluated. That number grows to 4-12 new clients a month that are ready to switch their insurance or want to do so in the future.” “I can say that GoodNewsTalk response/feedback is increasing significantly. I think more people are seeking different /independent news sources vs the corporate media choices.” View FCC Public Inspection File | For assistance with Public File call 585-346-3000 or email info@wysl1040.com | FCC Applications Mailing Address:WYSL NewsPower 1040Box 236Avon, NY 14414-0236 Street Address – studios, officesand transmitting plant:WYSL NewsPower 10405620 South Lima RoadAvon, NY 14414-0236 Phone: (585) 346-3000Fax: (585) 346-0450 Website and live audio stream 24-7: www.wysl1040.com News Releases and News Stories: news@wysl1040.com Operational problems, questions: dangelo@wysl1040.com Sales inquires, advertising: savage@wysl1040.com General comments and questions: info@wysl1040.com © Radio Livingston Limited Website Design by Patrick Marketing NY'}]"

Wystąpi w sumie 12 zespołów marszowych, 700 klaunów oraz 10 grup artystycznych. Wisienką na torcie będzie oczywiście Święty Mikołaj. Ci, którzy chcą osobiście uczestniczyć w paradzie, powinni zjawić się przed 9:00 a.m. przy 77 ulicy i Central Park West. Przemaszeruje ona następnie 2,5 mili na południe. Trasa prowadzi z Central Park West do Columbus Circle, a następnie skręca na Central Park South, w kierunku 6-tej Alei/Avenue of the Americas. Na 34 ulicy parada wykona swój ostatni zwrot na zachód i zakończy się na 7 Alei przed Macy’s Herald Square.
