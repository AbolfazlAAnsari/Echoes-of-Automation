It’s the culmination of lots of available grassy fuels and hot and dry conditions expected through the summer months. Washington saw some of the fewest acres burned in a decade last year, after the second- and third-worst fire seasons on record in 2020 and 2021. But the Bolt Creek fire, which tore through more than 22 square miles of wilderness in eastern King and Snohomish counties last fall, may have been a dress rehearsal for more frequent fires along the western flank of the Cascades as climate change drives warming summers. Experts say all of Washington will be vulnerable to fire this summer, and Washingtonians should prepare their homes for fire and smoke. Last year’s quiet start to fire season highlighted the importance of a cool, wet spring. By mid-July, wildfires burned about 7,100 acres, or about 11 square miles, compared with roughly 320,000 acres the previous year. This May, Western Washington saw precipitation around 5% to 25% of normal, said Matthew Cullen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. It was the second-warmest May on record. Eight of Seattle’s 12 warmest Mays on record have occurred since 2013, Cullen said. Meanwhile, average summer temperatures in 21 West Coast cities have risen by about 2.2 degrees since 1970, with Medford, Ore., seeing the highest climb, measuring nearly 5 degrees higher, according to a Climate Central analysis. The Seattle area’s average summer temperatures climbed by 3.2 degrees, according to the report, and about 23 days each summer have been above normal temperatures. “We know what we’ve done to the atmosphere,” Washington state climatologist Nick Bond said. “The things that we’re seeing with the heat, that is, the rises in temperature, have been more at night than during the day; that’s consistent with greater concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.” The region is also seeing drier summers, Bond said. The last two decades have been on the dry side, with some exceptions. But it’s hard to pin that on climate change because it could just be random variability, Bond said. Predictions in a June 1 National Interagency Fire Center wildfire outlook showed the entire state of Washington lit up with above-normal fire potential from July through the end of September. Federal and state agencies, like the state Department of Natural Resources, coordinate to produce the outlook. “It does look like we’re in store for a well-above-average fire season in Washington,” said Matt Dehr, wildfire meteorologist for DNR. “And probably one of the worst fire seasons in the United States this year.” During normal conditions in the Pacific Ocean, the trade winds blow west along the equator, bringing warm water from South America toward Asia. La Niña, when the trade winds are abnormally strong, carries tropical rainfall west and causes cool-water upwelling off the west coast of the U.S. This typically manifests in the Pacific Northwest as wetter and cooler weather. After three years of La Niña, grasses exploded in the Columbia Basin and on the east slopes of the Cascades. Now, Washington’s grassy fuels are up to 10-year highs. Some areas in Eastern Washington, like where the Okanogan Valley transitions into the Columbia Basin, and across the foothills of the Cascades where the grasslands run into forest land, have been identified as areas of concern by DNR. Fire can quickly tear through grasses and torch nearby timber. “The bad thing is the fire danger is going to be high pretty much everywhere through the summer,” Dehr said. “Even west of the Cascades we’re a little bit concerned about how dry things are already looking.” There are about 22 million acres of forests in Washington state. About 43% are federal lands, about 20% are privately owned industrial lands, about 15% are nonindustrial private lands, roughly 12% are state-owned, and less than 10% are owned by tribal nations and local governments, according to estimates from the Washington Forest Protection Association. More than 13 million acres of private and state lands are under state fire protection, according to DNR. Western Washington is several inches behind normal precipitation for just the last 30 days and some areas are more than 10 inches behind normal precipitation for the last three months. Some areas of moderate drought have already been declared in Western Washington. Dehr said he expects that to get worse through the summer. The worst of it, however, won’t be realized without an “ignition event” like high winds that coincide with heat and dry fuels, Dehr said. In 2020, high winds helped fan the flames of 80 fires, and nearly 300,000 acres burned. But, during the 2021 heat dome, when temperatures soared above 105 degrees in Seattle and conditions were primed for devastating fires, Dehr said, a wind event never caused anything to ignite. El Niño conditions arrived earlier this month and could usher in a warmer, drier winter, which could be a cause for concern for the 2024 fire season, Dehr said. To prevent more severe wildfires as things heat up this summer, DNR has led prescribed burns on 637 acres in Central and Eastern Washington this year. Prescribed fire has a long, rich tradition rooted in Indigenous ecological knowledge, but a University of Idaho study found there was no significant increase in prescribed burn acreage in the Western U.S. from 1998 to 2018, as wildfires became increasingly frequent and intense. DNR in 2022 ignited the first prescribed burn season on state land in nearly two decades, marking a dramatic shift in land management. The practice can help cycle nutrients in the soil and create more open spaces and snags for animal habitat. The primary goal is reducing fuels for fires. Since January 2017, DNR has tracked more than 120,000 acres of prescribed fire across all land ownerships. As the East Coast woke up to a dense blanket of smoke from hundreds of thousands of acres of forest on fire in Canada earlier this month, a wildfire in Yakima County burned more than 800 acres, giving an early taste of wildfire season. DNR has responded to more than 470 fires as of Thursday, according to the agency. Even after a drizzly and cool Juneteenth weekend, most areas got no more than a half inch of rain, Dehr, the DNR meteorologist said. The Lake Sutherland fire started June 17 near Lake Crescent in the northern part of the Olympic Peninsula and burned more than 100 acres by June 20. The Columbia Basin received no precipitation over the wetter Juneteenth weekend, and a 4,200 acre grass fire had ripped through the landscape by Thursday. “My whole state is in the forecast for this summer being in the epicenter of this,” U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell said at a Senate Energy Committee hearing this month. To prepare for fire season, people who live in what experts call the wildland urban interface, or the space where homes or other structures meet or intermingle with the natural environment, should create a defensible space around their home. That could mean limiting the amount of flammable plants within 100 feet of the home. The area within 5 feet of the home should be clear of bark or mulch and plants containing oils or waxes. Homeowners should also prune low-hanging branches, and trim those near the home, porch and deck. Homeowners can also sign up for the state’s Wildfire Ready Neighbors program, a collaboration between DNR, wildfire-preparedness experts, regional fire districts and communities across the state to equip those most at risk during fire season. Through the program, homeowners have access to consultations from local wildfire experts and other planning tools. Across the state, people should make sure they have N95 masks on hand, as well as air purifiers or alternative filtration methods, like a MERV 13 filter taped to a box fan, in preparation for smoke. Nearly 90% of fires every year are human-caused, said Thomas Kyle-Milward, a DNR spokesperson.

The Lewis-Clark Twins were slated for two games at the Dwight Church Memorial tournament on Saturday at Harris Field. They ended up playing closer to three. In the batch of nearly 28,000 assessments Nez Perce County released earlier this month, there’s good news, bad news and ugly news. Allen Sutton Crystal Fleming Michelle Coles Tekita Bankhead Washington State University is featuring African American women’s voices in its keynotes to honor Martin Luther King. The MLK Celebration Planning Committee has been working year-round to curate events in tribute to King’s legacy. Apart from other institutions, the university will be holding events throughout the spring semester to give students more chances to attend. The series of celebrations kicked off Tuesday, during the National Day of Racial Healing, but Allen Sutton said there are opportunities every day to practice being racially compassionate and empathetic. Though Martin Luther King Day is one day on the calendar, the committee is continually planning projects throughout the year. Rather than scheduling events for one day, the committee uses Martin Luther King Day as an opportunity to begin cultural education for students, said Sutton, executive director for the Office of Social Justice Education and Outreach in Student Affairs and co-chairperson of the MLK Celebration Planning Committee. “It’s a lot of work,” Sutton said, “We wouldn’t be able to achieve our goals or plan the amount of events we do if we didn’t have a year-round approach. We assess all our programs to make sure students get something out of attending events.” Sutton said the reason MLK celebrations take place all semester is because there is so much ground to cover. He said it’s too much to fit into one day, and students may be too busy to attend some events. The committee’s goal is to teach people how to be racially compassionate and to provide cultural education. They make sure to have a wide range of topics to give students opportunities to participate in what the committee is trying to accomplish. “We feel like the values and the things that Dr. King fought for and died for hold a lot more relevance that can’t be held within a week or a day,” Sutton said. “We want to ensure our students have as much opportunity to learn and grow in those areas as possible.” The committee wants to teach students to be objective and think critically about racial issues that need to be addressed. Sutton said the work of diversity, equity, inclusion and social justice is under attack in America. Being aware of issues and the work Martin Luther King has done makes these types of programs even more important, he added. “There’s this movement to say ‘there’s no such thing as racism in America,’ or ‘it’s not a big deal, it’s not an issue,’’’ Sutton said. “But it is. These issues need to be addressed and we can’t just sweep them under the rug.” In past years, keynote speakers have primarily been male, Sutton said, and this year the committee wanted to highlight women’s voices in its celebrations. The committee found three keynote speakers, all women of color, to speak on social justice and racial education. The university will bring in its first keynote speaker, Crystal Fleming, for a discussion on “How to be Less Stupid about Race” at the Elton S. Floyd Cultural Center at 6 p.m. Feb. 7. Michelle Coles will speak on “Past is Prologue: Uncovering Our Past Holds the Key to a Better, More Inclusive Tomorrow” at 5 p.m. March 1 via Zoom. Tekita Bankhead will be WSU’s final keynote speaker, discussing “Race-Related Trauma and Coping Culturally-Specific Mental Health Concerns and Strategies” at 6 p.m. March 28 via Zoom. The committee also put together three service projects for the community to participate in. There was an MLK Day food drive Monday to help the Cougar Food Pantry and Community Action Center. People can still donate food to the pantry using bins located around campus. The university will also be collecting books and magazines throughout the month to be distributed to local women’s shelters, homeless shelters and prisons. Sutton said shelters and prisons struggle to receive proper reading material, and by holding a book drive the university can offer materials to those in need. Items can be dropped off at designated bins located around campus. Finally, the community can participate in Caring Cougar Cards at Butch’s Den from 12:30-1:30 p.m. Friday. People will be able to make cards for community partners across the U.S. to be sent to local hospitals, teen shelters and assisted living homes. Though the National Day Racial Healing has passed, Sutton said there are always ways to support people of color. “If you really want to support African American people, believe their stories and don’t feel like you have to walk a mile in their shoes,” Sutton said. “Nowadays, we have an empathy deficit. If you really want to help people of color, learn to be more empathetic and listen to their experiences.” The WSU Office of Social Justice, Education and Outreach has resources for anyone wanting to learn about cultures around the world. They offer different types of training and ways people can become more inclusive of others. The office is also a resource for people of color who are looking for support.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 5:44 pm MOSCOW — Valerie Mesenbrink never tires of seeing the confidence young men gain just by putting on a suit. Maybe it goes back even further, but this legacy of Monson fathers passing basketballs down to their sons at least traces back to Oscar “Swede” Monson, who coached at Menahga (Minn.) High School before World War II. Idaho is unique in that state law requires openness in government, both in meetings and records requests. MOSCOW — Valerie Mesenbrink never tires of seeing the confidence young men gain just by putting on a suit. For the latest updates Thursday on the gas outage, click here. More than 36,000 residences, businesses, schools and other buildings in the region are without natural gas following the rupture of a pipeline Wednesday afternoon north of Pullman. The gas interruption happened after a worker running an excavator damaged an underground pipeline around 12:40 p.m. Crews from Williams Companies, an energy company that owns the pipeline, were on the scene 4 miles north of Pullman working to fix the damage into the night Wednesday. Within hours of the rupture, gas service began to wane in southeastern Washington and north central Idaho. According to Avista Utilities, which provides gas service, the communities affected include Pullman, Moscow, Albion, Palouse, Uniontown, Colton, Genesee, Troy, Bovill, Deary, Asotin, Lewiston and Clarkston, the company said on its Facebook page. No gas means no heat for Avista customers who have gas-powered furnaces, and those with gas water heaters will be without hot water. The utility company said the outage “could last several days.” As for a more specific timeline, “that’s something we’re hoping to get our arms around tomorrow,” said Jared Webley, Avista’s senior communications manager. Starting at 5 a.m. today, Avista crews will be manually shutting off gas lines in a house-by-house process, Webley said. Workers won’t need to enter residences to turn off the lines. The company is also providing customers with instructions for shutting down their own gas lines. This will be done so the system can be “purged,” Webley said. The gas can’t safely be turned back on until the system is purged. Williams said in a news release that it anticipates the ruptured line being fixed this afternoon. But that probably won’t mean an immediate resumption of gas service. Once the system is purged and the gas is turned on, each appliance will have to be relighted. That task must be done by an Avista worker — not customers, Webley said. The workers will have to enter each building to relight furnaces and water heaters. Word about the gas outage quickly spread Wednesday afternoon. Stores in the Lewiston-Clarkston Valley sold out of electric heaters. Restaurants closed for the night. Some schools announced they will be closed today. The public kindergarten through 12th grade schools in Lewiston, Clarkston, Moscow, Genesee and Garfield-Palouse announced they will be closed Thursday. The University of Idaho will also be closed. The city of Moscow announced all of its nonessential business offices will be closed Thursday. Lewis-Clark State College announced classes will go forward as normal today, with school officials working on “temporary campus solutions.” Washington State University doesn’t anticipate any changes to its operation, said Phil Weiler, vice president for marketing and communications. Many buildings on campus are heated through a steam plant that is normally fueled by natural gas, he said. After the institution was alerted by Avista about the outage, it converted the steam plant to diesel fuel. Residents in the Lewiston-Clarkston Valley flocked to area businesses to purchase heaters for their homes or their relatives. Jake Kehret, of Lewiston, bought two heaters at Costco, one electric and one gas, to help his wife and teenager children stay warm. They also have plenty of blankets to help keep warm. “Our house doesn’t have a fireplace, which we were looking for (when buying a home) for this exact reason,” Kehret said. He said the experience will be like “doing a little indoor camping.” Steve Trimmell, assistant general manager at Costco, said business at the Clarkston store was normal until about 1 p.m. or 2 p.m., then people started coming in. “We sold every portable heater we have,” he said. The pipeline near U.S. Highway 195 was “accidentally damaged by a third-party,” Williams said in a statement to the media. There were no injuries, fires or explosions as a result of the accident, the company said. The weather forecast over the next few days in the area affected by the gas outage shows high temperatures in the upper 50s and lows right around the freezing point of 32 degrees. That will mean chilly nights for those without an alternate source of heat. Baney, Brewster, Pearce and Kuipers can be contacted at editor@dnews.com. Success!

Howard Schultz called a meeting of the seven store managers of the small coffee chain he’d just acquired. It was 1987. He put a blue dot on the bottom of a whiteboard, drew a great arc up and to the right, and told the managers that this is where the coffee company had to go. “We have seven years to get there, otherwise the big guys will eat us up,” Schultz said, in the recollection of an early manager in the meeting. Starbucks closes 8,000 stores as employees grapple with bias issues Starbucks chairman opens up on company’s race failures – and says its bathrooms are now open to all An era ends for Starbucks and Howard Schultz as he moves from being CEO (2017) Read more about Starbucks and Howard Schultz here >> Schultz, who announced his retirement from Starbucks Monday, went on to fulfill that growth ambition many times over, turning the Seattle company into a food and beverage giant that spans the globe and is often embroiled in controversies stemming from Schultz’s own idealistic and contrarian view of what a modern corporation should be. Schultz’s departure — effective June 26, or 26 years to the day since the company’s initial public stock offering — is a major milestone for the company and the man himself. But with Schultz, the move immediately renewed speculation over his political ambitions. Schultz made his least-forceful attempt to douse that speculation in an interview with The New York Times. “I intend to think about a range of options, and that could include public service,” Schultz said when asked if he was considering a presidential run in 2020. “But I’m a long way from making any decisions about the future.” Schultz’s name has been mentioned as a potential candidate for at least the last three presidential cycles. In 2016, he was on a list of vice presidential candidates under consideration by Hillary Clinton. Starbucks did not make Schultz available for an interview. Schultz’s departure from Starbucks marks the logical next step in a ratcheting-down of responsibilities that began about a year ago when he doffed the chief executive role and informed the company’s board of directors of his intentions to step down. In the last year, he’s only been spending two to three days a week in the office when he is in Seattle. But in other respects, the timing seems abrupt. In addition to being heavily involved in the company’s response to the arrest of two black men in a Philadelphia store in April – which delayed a planned announcement of his departure – the months ahead promise several important milestones for Schultz’s recent efforts to grow a premium brand within Starbucks, and for his long-held ambition of establishing Starbucks in one of the world’s great coffee-drinking countries. “You don’t get to choose the timing,” said Howard Behar, who formed a leadership triumvirate with Schultz and Orin Smith, collectively known as H2O, that ran Starbucks through two decades of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s. “He’s been talking about it for a long time.” Smith died March 1 and Behar, 74, said he too has had some health problems. Schultz, 64, silver-haired and looking trim in recent appearances, deserves to spend his remaining time on other endeavors, Behar said. “He’s an incredible guy that did an incredible job, and 36 years is enough as far as I’m concerned,” he said. “My opinion is he’s given it his all, and there’s a point in time where you’ve got to let other people run with it.” It’s hard to imagine Schultz stepping completely away from a company to which he’s devoted so much of his life, and with which he’s so closely associated. In a video on a personal website, Schultz, sitting in the Starbucks Capitol Hill Reserve Roastery, says, “Welcome to my new site. Yes, my new site.” (The domain for the revamped www.howardschultz.com was first registered in 1999.) He thanks supporters, comments on the importance of community and invites people to stay connected. Another part of the website allows people to join Schultz’s mailing list – which would come in handy in any future philanthropic or political endeavor. Reaction to a potential Schultz presidential run was mixed. A spokesperson for the Washington state Democrats declined to comment. Nick Hanauer, the politically active tech investor, said in a tweet, “Howard Schultz is a straight up Trickle-downer. A terrible idea for a president.” At Starbucks, Schultz will adopt the honorific title of chairman emeritus, but will step down from his position on the board of directors. While he said he plans to spend the summer with family and at work on another book, he also will host two major high-end Reserve Roastery store openings later this year, each with significant personal importance that he described as fitting bookends to his time with Starbucks. One, in New York City, evokes his childhood in the Canarsie Bayview Housing Projects in Brooklyn, New York. From there, Schultz became the first in his family to go to college. The other new store is the company’s first outlet in Italy – a Roastery planned to open in Milan in September – that will fulfill a career-long ambition of Schultz’s. Schultz visited Milan in 1983, where he was inspired by the “romance of espresso” and the culture in the coffee bars there to create the concept around which Starbucks would be built – the so-called “third place” where people could gather away from home and work. (This concept, of a private-public space to which all are welcome, was challenged during the Philadelphia incident, prompting Schultz to announce that Starbucks stores and bathrooms would be open even to customers who haven’t made a purchase.) Schultz said at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in March that until recently, he didn’t feel Starbucks “had the right level of respect” to set up shop in a country with such a deep coffee culture. But as a group of opera singers belted out the triumphal lines of Nessun Dorma, Schultz seemed to be signaling that he thought the company was ready. The original insight Schultz gleaned in Italy – about serving coffee beverages with a side of community –was not obvious at the time. Starbucks was founded in 1971 by Jerry Baldwin, Gordon Bowker, and Zev Siegl, as a purveyor of coffee beans and coffee equipment for people to brew themselves at home. Will Stiles, the store manager in that 1987 meeting, described the Starbucks that Schultz joined as a “quirky” company – a bunch of English majors rolling cigarettes and roasting coffee. “We were just bean-shovelers,” said Stiles, who was hired in 1982, a few months before Schultz. “He showed up in suits and we were all wearing cutoffs and flip-flops. And he was extraordinarily dynamic,” said Stiles, who left Starbucks in 1999 to take over Home Espresso Repair on Phinney Ridge. Stiles remembers “an incredible salesman” with a big vision. A few years after his fateful trip to Italy, Schultz left Starbucks and founded Il Giornale – named for a daily newspaper in Milan – and went on to acquire the erstwhile bean purveyor in 1987, launching the company on a growth trajectory that would take it to heights that perhaps only Schultz himself imagined at the time. “He could see things that people were not seeing obviously, and he also had the energy to pursue them,” Stiles said of Schultz. Starbucks today counts some 28,000 stores in 77 countries and had sales last fiscal year of $22.4 billion. Schultz, in his goodbye message to employees, was less focused on financial results. He has championed a vision of Starbucks as a corporation with a conscience, touting its employee benefits – employees are called partners because even part-time workers have been compensated in part with company stock since 1991 – and taking positions on some of the nation’s most divisive issues including immigration, gun control, poverty and race. Schultz had an estimated net worth of $2.8 billion, according to Forbes, most of which is in Starbucks stock. As of mid-December, he owned a little more than 3 percent of the company, a stake worth more than $2.4 billion at Monday’s closing price. In after-hours trading following Schultz’s announcement, Starbucks shares lost almost 3 percent, but recovered to end the extra session down slightly to $56.65. For local people who bought and held shares of stock in the coffee company that grew up in their hometown, the payoff was immense. The stock rose 21,000 percent since the June 26, 1992 initial public offering, Starbucks pointed out in its laudatory communications about Schultz’ departure. (That stock performance notwithstanding, some Seattleites say they will never forgive Schultz for the sale of the city’s NBA franchise in 2006. The new owners ultimately relocated the Sonics to Oklahoma City in 2008.) The company’s'}]"
