But before would-be home sellers and homebuyers get too excited about what sounds promising on the heels of 2023\'s very challenging housing market, the changes are expected to be slight through 2024, the housing market relatively flat and still challenging for many. Deseret News checked out housing and rental market predictions from Realtor.com, Zillow, Forbes and Redfin to identify potential trends in the housing market, from rentals to sales, including both new and existing housing. Here\'s how experts say 2024 is likely to shake out for those looking to move: Mortgage rates will likely fall — but not enough to make a huge difference. Mortgage rates seem to be backing off their recent high of 7.79%. And virtually all predictions say the rates will creep down slightly but stay above 6%, which is well above the low rates just a few years ago and higher than the rates currently enjoyed by 90% of those who carry a mortgage. In fact, two-thirds of mortgage holders have rates below 4%, making big moves for them unlikely. Home prices will stay flat or drop slightly — less than 2% — in most areas, though there are exceptions and it doesn\'t mean buying will be affordable for many people. The median home price was a bit higher in 2023 than in 2022. Realtor.com reported that since May 2022, buying a typical home with a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage and a 20% down payment ""meant forking over a quarter or more of the typical household paycheck."" And as interest rates rose in October 2023, that was 39%, while the historical average was 21%. Realtor.com predicts the share of median income will be just under 30% by the end of 2024, helped by income growth, that slight dip in home prices and a bit of a decrease in mortgage rates. Realtor.com says the typical purchase cost should slip to just under $2,200 a month.

For now, renting could be more affordable in most markets, compared to buying. The cost to rent will go down some in 2024 — again, not much.
