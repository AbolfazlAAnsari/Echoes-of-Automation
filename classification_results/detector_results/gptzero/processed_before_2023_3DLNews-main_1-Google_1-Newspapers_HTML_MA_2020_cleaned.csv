A scholar of slavery and issues of race, Orlando Patterson, the John Cowles Professor of Sociology, talks about the killing of George Floyd. Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard file photo Liz Mineo Harvard Staff Writer The killing of George Floyd, who died after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled into his neck for nearly nine minutes during an arrest, has spurred a wave of rage, anguish, and protests across the country. To better understand what is happening and what the future may hold, the Gazette talked with Orlando Patterson, the John Cowles Professor of Sociology. A scholar of slavery and issues of race, Patterson talked about the legacy of white supremacist ideology, racism in policing, and the ongoing, widespread discrimination and segregation in American life. He also explained why he hopes that the country can yet heal its racial divide, and sees particular promise in the young. GAZETTE: Two years ago, you spoke to the Gazette on the 50th anniversary of the Kerner Report, which blamed white society’s racism as the underlying cause of the race riots of 1967. You said then that maybe we needed another report that looks at the roots of the racial inequities in the country. What is your take now? PATTERSON: Reports are always useful if well done. There are now many studies of race and inequality, in fact it’s a virtual industry. There’s no shortage of thorough and well-informed research. But it would do no harm to have a group of people bring together the main results of the findings of recent studies, as well, including the views of influential people, not just academics, but also community, political, and religious leaders, who can say where they think we are and where we are going in terms of race relations in America. That’d be important especially now, after the killing of George Floyd. Many people must be asking themselves what has happened over the past half a century or more, since those first set of defining riots of the ’60s, not to mention the Rodney King riots in 1992. Is the element of white supremacy and chronic racism so deeply rooted that no amount of not just protests, but reform and institutional change is going to make a difference? That’s a depressing view. My sense is that there’s something new in these demonstrations. GAZETTE: What is new about these protests, compared to the protests of 1967, 1968, or 1992, or the more recent ones organized by the Black Lives Matter movement? PATTERSON: For one thing, and this is even true of the Rodney King demonstrations in 1992, the difference is the composition of the demonstrators. One cannot help but be struck by the significant proportion of the protesters who are white, Hispanic, and Asian. It was interesting, for example, that when the police brutally broke up a demonstration near the White House and trapped protesters on a road, a South Asian man took 70 of them in his house. My sentiment is that this is a more diverse, although still predominantly Black, expression of outrage. I think it has to do with the moment we’re living right now. People seemed horrified that we’re seeing this sort of thing after all these years, but they also sense that something is profoundly wrong. What’s terrifying about this moment is that the foundational institutions of our democracy are under assault, that the fundamental norms upon which our Constitution and our system of government rests are being threatened. GAZETTE: What similarities do you find between previous protests, including the ones that followed the Rodney King beating, and the ones led by the Black Lives Matter movement, and the current protests? PATTERSON: The common denominator is police violence and brutality. We have these brutal acts and killings, and we have outrage, protests, commissions, recommendations, and again and again, the police still continue in their old ways. They don’t seek to respect life and are prepared to brutalize someone for something as minor as passing a counterfeit $20 bill or jaywalking. The police are also very much part of one of the worst recent developments in American life: mass incarceration. It’s historically unprecedented, and it’s shameful that the country that claims to be the leader of the free world, although most of the rest of the world will consider that a joke, has the world’s highest number of people in prison: 2.3 million. And over 40 percent of those in prison are Black. This is really just astonishing, and the police have a lot to do with it, as well as prosecutors. GAZETTE: There have been other cases of police brutality in the past few years, but why do you think the killing of George Floyd has led to this wave of protests even beyond the United States? Why did it happen now and not before? PATTERSON: First, the whole thing was captured on video. And it was especially chilling because of the nonchalance, the sense of complete indifference, the disdain for someone’s life that the police officer showed as he killed Floyd. We have seen videos of brutality in the past, but this one came right after a series of police killings, and it simply reached the breaking point. When I saw the expression in that officer’s face and that three other officers were around him standing by as if this was just business as usual, I thought of Hannah Arendt and her phrase “the banality of evil.” What Arendt found most horrific was that ordinary people were able to commit horrible killings, and at the end of the day, they went back home to their nice homes and their nice families, and the next day they went back and killed again. I also think that the video came up in the midst of a pandemic, when people were feeling appalled at the incompetence and absence of leadership. GAZETTE: What role might the pandemic have played in this wave of unrest? PATTERSON: When we passed that critical milestone of 100,000 deaths, that called for a leader to express our collective fear and anxiety. We didn’t get that. People were really aghast at what was happening and at the reports that say that thousands of lives could have been spared if our leadership would have been more competent and less self-absorbed and concerned solely with the problem of reelection. The nation saw two big failures coming together: on the one hand, the absence of a proper health system and, on the other hand, the incompetent leadership. When the issue of police brutality came up with this video, people saw a link between the incompetent leadership, the failure of the American welfare state, and the resurgence of one of the worst aspects of American society: its white supremacist and racist ideology. GAZETTE: How does white supremacy fit into this? PATTERSON: What the killing has done is to show us that there still persists a hardcore white supremacy racist ideology, which rejects outsiders, anyone who is not white. That ideology is now ascendant as a result of the leadership in the White House. What I see is two great traditions in America that are competing. There is the liberal tradition, and there’s the equally dominant tradition of white supremacy, which comes out of the South but traveled northward. There is real tension between them. I’ve argued in my writings that there has been extraordinary progress in the changing attitudes of white Americans toward Blacks and other minorities. As late as the early ’60s, a majority of whites openly said they saw Blacks as inferior, and now there is an acceptance of equality, at least in their views. I’ve always said that this may be the great majority, but there’s still 20, 25 percent of whites who still embrace white supremacist views. This hard core of white supremacists is still there and have been encouraged and are leading a revanchist sort of movement. And that’s quite frightening.

Stringer/Sputnik via AP GAZETTE: To those who are not white supremacists but may be just be awakening to racial disparities in the nation, what would you like them to know about issues of race in the United States? PATTERSON: I don’t want to use the term “white people” in general terms because as I said before, what is special about these recent protests is the participation of whites in it, many of them young. But I also see middle-aged and some people my age. I want to emphasize that I think white Americans have gone through quite radical changes in their attitudes, and that we’re talking about a more likely 25 percent of Americans who are hardcore racist, but I think most Americans have quite decent views about race.

Robin Worrall/Unsplash Christina Pazzanese Harvard Staff Writer This is part of our Coronavirus Update series in which Harvard specialists in epidemiology, infectious disease, economics, politics, and other disciplines offer insights into what the latest developments in the COVID-19 outbreak may bring. When a disease outbreak grabs the public’s attention, formal recommendations from medical experts are often muffled by a barrage of half-baked advice, sketchy remedies, and misguided theories that circulate as anxious people rush to understand a new health risk. The current crisis is no exception. The sudden onset of a new, highly contagious coronavirus has unleashed what U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres last week called a “pandemic of misinformation,” a phenomenon that has not gone unnoticed as nearly two-thirds of Americans said they have seen news and information about the disease that seemed completely made up, according to a recent Pew Research Center study. What distinguishes the proliferation of bad information surrounding the current crisis, though, is social media. Kasisomayajula “Vish” Viswanath, Lee Kum Kee Professor of Health Communication at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said the popularity and ubiquity of the various platforms means the public is no longer merely passively consuming inaccuracies and falsehoods. It’s disseminating and even creating them, which is a “very different” dynamic than what took place during prior pandemics MERS and H1N1. The sheer volume of COVID-19 misinformation and disinformation online is “crowding out” the accurate public health guidance, “making our work a bit more difficult,” he said. “Misinformation could be an honest mistake or the intentions are not to blatantly mislead people,” like advising others to eat garlic or gargle with salt water as protection against COVID-19, he said. Disinformation campaigns, usually propagated for political gain by state actors, party operatives, or activists, deliberately spread falsehoods or create fake content, like a video purporting to show the Chinese government executing residents in Wuhan with COVID-19 or “Plandemic,” a film claiming the pandemic is a ruse to coerce mass vaccinations, which most major social media platforms recently banned. In order to be effective, especially during a crisis, public health communicators have to be seen as credible, transparent, and trustworthy. And there, officials are falling short, said Viswanath. “People are hungry for information, hungry for certitude, and when there is a lack of consensus-oriented information and when everything is being contested in public, that creates confusion among people,” he said. “When the president says disinfectants … or anti-malaria drugs are one way to treat COVID-19, and other people say, ‘No, that’s not the case,’ the public is hard-pressed to start wondering, ‘If the authorities cannot agree, cannot make up their minds, why should I trust anybody?’” Mainstream media coverage has added to the problem, analysts say. At many major news outlets, reporters and editors with no medical or public health training were reassigned to cover the unfolding pandemic and are scrambling to get up to speed with complex scientific terminology, methodologies, and research, and then identify, as well as vet, a roster of credible sources. Because many are not yet knowledgeable enough to report critically and authoritatively on the science, they can sometimes lean too heavily on traditional journalism values like balance, novelty, and conflict. In doing so, they lift up outlier and inaccurate counterarguments and hypotheses, unnecessarily muddying the water. “That’s a huge challenge,” said Ashish Jha, K.T. Li Professor of Global Health and Director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, during an April 24 talk about COVID-19 misinformation hosted by the Technology and Social Change Research Project at the Shorenstein Center for Media, Politics and Public Policy. “People are hungry for information, hungry for certitude, and when there is a lack of consensus-oriented information and when everything is being contested in public, that creates confusion among people.” “What I have found is a remarkable degree of consensus among people who understand the science of this disease around what the fundamental issues are and then disagreements about trade-offs and policies,” said Jha, who is a frequent commentator on news programs. “The idea of covering the science in a two-sided way on areas where there really isn’t any disagreement has struck me as very, very odd, and it keeps coming up over and over again.” Then there is the problem of political bias. This has been especially true at right-leaning media outlets, which have largely repeated news angles and viewpoints promoted by the White House and the president on the progress of the pandemic and the efficacy of the administration’s response, boosting unproven COVID-19 treatments and exaggerating the availability of testing and safety equipment and prospects for speedy vaccine development. Tara Setmayer, a spring 2020 Resident Fellow at the Institute of Politics and former Republican Party communications director, said what’s coming from Fox News and other pro-Trump media goes well beyond misinformation. Whether downplaying the views of government experts on COVID-19’s lethality, blaming China or philanthropist Bill Gates for its spread, or cheering shutdown protests funded by Republican political groups, it’s all part of “an active disinformation campaign,” she said, aimed at deflecting the president’s responsibility as he wages a reelection campaign. But turning around those who buy into false information is not as simple as piercing epistemic bubbles with facts, said Christopher Robichaud, senior lecturer in ethics and public policy at Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) who teaches the Gen Ed course “Ignorance, Lies, Hogwash and Humbug: The Value of Truth and Knowledge in Democracies.” Over time, bubble dwellers can become cocooned in a media echo chamber that not only feeds faulty information to audiences, but anticipates criticisms in order to “prebut” potential counterarguments that audience members may encounter from outsiders, much the way cult leaders do. “It’s not enough to introduce new pieces of evidence. You have to break through their strategies to diminish that counterevidence, and that’s a much harder thing to do than merely exposing people to different perspectives,” he said. While Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have all recently ramped up efforts to take down COVID-19 misinformation following public outcry, social media platforms “fall short” when it comes to curbing the flow, said Joan Donovan, who leads the Technology and Social Change Project at HKS. Since the national shift to remote work, many social media firms are relying more heavily on artificial intelligence to patrol misinformation on their platforms, instead of human moderators, who tend to be more effective, said Donovan. So many users suddenly searching and posting about one specific topic can “signal jam search algorithms, which cannot tell the difference usually between truth and lies.” The public needs to more closely scrutinize and be “much more skeptical” about what they’re reading and hearing, particularly online, and not try to keep up with the very latest COVID-19 research. These firms are reluctant to spark a regulatory backlash by policing their platforms too tightly and angering one or both political parties. “So they are careful to take action on content that is deemed immediately harmful (like posts that say to drink chemicals), but are reticent to enforce moderation on calls for people to break the stay-at-home orders,” said Donovan. Viswanath said public health officials cannot, and should not, chase down and debunk every bit of misinformation or conspiracy theory, lest the attention lends them some credence. The public needs to more closely scrutinize and be “much more skeptical” about what they’re reading and hearing, particularly online, and not try to keep up with the very latest COVID-19 research. “You don’t need to know everything,” he said. Putting the onus entirely on the public, however, is “unfair and it won’t work,” said Viswanath. Institutions, like social media platforms, have to take more responsibility for what’s out there. Public health organizations should be running effective communication surveillance of social media to monitor which rumors, ideas, and issues most worry the public, what is understood and misunderstood about various diseases and treatments, and what myths are circulating or being actively promoted in the community. And they need to have a strategy in place to counter what they’re picking up. “You cannot control this, but you can at least manage some of this,” Viswanath said. Though some COVID-19 misinformation and conspiracy theories are outlandish or even dangerously inaccurate, Robichaud said it’s a mistake to dismiss those who believe them as people who don’t care about the truth. Many cognitive biases get in the way of even the best truth-seeking strategies, so perhaps we could all benefit from a little more intellectual humility in this time of such great uncertainty, he said. “Most of us are, at best, experts in a tiny, tiny area. But we don’t navigate the world as if that were true. We navigate the world as if we’re experts about a whole bunch of things that we’re not,” he said. “A little intellectual humility can go a long way. And I say that as a professor: It’s true of us, and it’s also true of the public at large.” Cholesterol-lowering drug'}]"

Until early April, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott preferred to let cities and counties decide for themselves the wisest course of action. As more cases were reported, Lyle Larson, a Republican state representative from San Antonio, was calling for weeks for a statewide order. He understands the various interests the governor had to balance, however, including broader health care realities, such as 26 rural hospitals that have closed across the state since 2010. Where Americans live can have a lot to do with how they see the coronavirus crisis. In rural areas, there was initially a false sense of security. But that may be changing. People in rural areas have social distancing “already built into their lifestyle,” Representative Larson says, but when the statewide order went into effect, “people took that seriously.” The U.S. has adopted a state-by-state approach to battling the novel coronavirus. But there’s also a divide between steps taken in America’s large cities, where the disease hit first, and its rural counties, where people might not be able to even see their nearest neighbor. Now, as COVID-19 sweeps into small-town America – with two-thirds of rural counties reporting at least one confirmed case as of last week – a new pandemic geography is emerging. Rep. Vikki Goodwin’s district in Texas took swift action to protect residents from the novel coronavirus in early March. Austin canceled the popular SXSW festival for the first time in more than three decades, losing an estimated $350 million in revenue. But last week, 30 miles out in her district, which stretches into the sparsely populated Hill Country, the town of Lago Vista's golf course was still open – a week after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott issued a statewide stay-at-home order. In more suburban and rural stretches of Texas, there seems to be a sense that the virus is a distant, perhaps overblown, crisis. Where Americans live can have a lot to do with how they see the coronavirus crisis. In rural areas, there was initially a false sense of security. But that may be changing. Editor’s note: As a public service, all our coronavirus coverage is free. No paywall. “That’s a concern to me,” says state Representative Goodwin, a Democrat. “In rural areas the feeling is it hasn’t gotten there yet and it won’t spread. There’s maybe a false sense of security.” The U.S., as has been widely reported, has adopted a state-by-state approach to battling the novel coronavirus. But there’s also a divide between steps taken in America’s large cities, where the disease hit first, and its rural counties, where people might not be able to even see their nearest neighbor and social distancing has long been a way of life. The idea that “it can’t happen here” also plays on cultural suspicions that date back to Aesop’s Fables, where the country mouse tells the city mouse she prefers her plain food and simple life in the country with the peace and security that go with it. Now, as COVID-19 sweeps into small-town America – with two-thirds of rural counties reporting at least one confirmed case as of last week – a new pandemic geography is emerging. In a recent poll, 74% of Democrats support restrictive policies to protect people, including some infringements on civil liberties, as did 71% of Republicans. “The initial take among a lot of elected officials and Southerners in general, especially in rural areas, was ... ‘This is their problem. We don’t see it,’” says Cal Jillson, a political scientist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. “When you put the importance of church with the small government ethic and where people don’t want to be told what to do, it’s true, you can do the wrong thing for a good and understandable reason and still pay a very heavy price.” In rural America, that’s playing out from pews to boat ramps. In St. Augustine, Florida, some 10,000 people have signed Eric Hires’ petition to reopen the beaches of St. Johns County, despite the state’s 20,000 confirmed cases. “People have called me selfish, but this has become much bigger than me,” says Mr. Hires, a surfer in his 30s, in a phone interview. He points out the golf course was allowed to stay open, and says he just wants early and late-morning hours with no congregating. “I’m more libertarian. I don’t like the government infringing on rights or freedoms. But there is also an element of personal freedom. If you live near the beach and the ocean is your sanctuary, you should be able to go there.” Some 9 in 10 Texans live in or near a big city, but the state boasts vast stretches of ranchland, scrub, and desert. Until early April, Governor Abbott preferred to let cities and counties decide for themselves the wisest course of action. As more cases were reported, Lyle Larson, a Republican state representative from San Antonio, had been calling for weeks for a statewide order. He understands the various interests the governor had to balance, however, including politics and broader health care realities, including that 26 rural hospitals have closed across the state since 2010. “Some people don’t like the government making blanket declarations on what they can and can’t do, and there are others who want a total shutdown,” says Representative Larson. People in rural areas have social distancing “already built into their lifestyle,” he adds, but when the statewide order went into effect, “people took that seriously.” A handful of states with large rural populations have yet to order statewide lockdowns, trying to balance local interests against what former FEMA director Craig Fugate calls a “slow-rolling disaster.” “What is happening is that there is much less coordinated federal control in this emergency than in past ones, so you do see an absolute flowering of federalism driven by ... geography, demography, and ideological makeup,” says Mr. Jillson. “That means if you are in the South or Mountain West and you have a diverse state geographically – a few major cities and large open stretches between them – you have been conflicted as to how to proceed.” Noting a regional difference, “we’ve been pretty aggressive as a geography and I think that’s important,” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, said on CNN. Governor Whitmer issued a stay-at-home order in March, one of the first governors to do so, but Michigan remains one of the hardest-hit states, with about 25,000 cases. In contrast, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican, told a press conference in early""}]"

Low 51F. Winds light and variable.. Generally clear skies. Low 51F. Winds light and variable. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 8:06 pm Friendly’s Restaurants, the 85-year-old Wilbraham-based chain known for its Fribbles and ice cream sundaes, is filing for bankruptcy protection once again. Friendly’s, which once had multiple locations around the area — including one on Pleasant Street in Attleboro, one in Seekonk, one in downtown Foxboro and one at Wrentham Village Premium Outlets — is down to a single location in the 10 communities served by The Sun Chronicle: 10 Washinton St. (Route 1.) There are still restaurants in Swansea and Woonsocket. All of the chain’s 130 remaining locations, which stretch from Maine to Florida, will remain open while it restructures under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the company said. Friendly’s joins a growing list of well-established restaurant chains that are failing due to an unchecked pandemic in the United States. George Michel, CEO of FIC Restaurants Inc., Friendly’s parent company, said COVID-19 has had a “catastrophic impact” on operations. FIC will sell essentially all of its assets to the restaurant company Amici Partners Group. The pandemic has hit the restaurant sector very hard, particularly chains like Friendly’s that rely on people sitting down at tables. At least 10 chains have filed for bankruptcy protection since the pandemic began this year. Traffic at full-service restaurant chains in the U.S. plummeted 48% in the April-June period, according to NPD Group. Visits were down 25% in the June-September period, as restrictions were eased in some parts of the country. However, infections are surging again as colder weather arrives and industry analysts are assembling lists of larger chain restaurants most at risk of failure. Friendly’s, like most other chains that have stumbled this year, had already been struggling as its customer base aged and competition increased. In the pandemic, it became increasingly difficult to compete with chains that already relied on carryout and drive-thru, like Dairy Queen. Friendly’s has closed hundreds of locations over the past decade. The company filed for bankruptcy protection before, in 2011. Michel said Friendly’s had been trying to grow its carryout and delivery business and revamp its menu when the pandemic hit. Other restaurant chains that have filed for bankruptcy protection this year include the U.S. arm of Le Pain Quotidien, CEC Entertainment, the parent company of Chuck E. Cheese, California Pizza Kitchen, Sizzler and Ruby Tuesday. Despite the bankruptcy, the Chuck E. Cheese location in South Attleboro has reopened. Ruby Tuesday closed its city location last year. Its Wrentham Village Premium Outlets site is still listed as open. Material from the Associated Press was used in this story. Tom Reilly can be reached at 508-236-0332 or treilly@thesunchronicle.com.

'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Just weeks ago, police officers were viewed as being among the many heroes working on the front lines during the coronavirus pandemic. What a difference today. Now, after Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on the neck of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man resulting in his death, and the incidents of over-aggressive police tactics during the protests that followed, there are angry calls to defund police departments. Defunding the police carries a spectrum of meaning, but generally it means taking money from police budgets and giving it to social service and mental health sectors and programs for the disadvantaged. An ABC News poll released Friday found almost two-thirds of Americans oppose calls to defund police while 34 percent back the movement. Area police chiefs say police department budgets in small suburban communities are a fraction of that of larger communities. Losses in funding, they say, would directly affect services and undercut gains in community programs that refocus efforts to reduce crime and make policing more progressive. “Obviously, I think it’s a catastrophic idea,” said Attleboro Police Chief Kyle Heagney. Shortly after becoming chief over a decade ago, Heagney created a special unit called the Problem Orientated Policing team, or POP, which is already doing the work critics say needs to be done. The team partners with public and private social services agencies and volunteers in calls for domestic abuse, mental health and substance abuse issues, homelessness and other problem areas. “The POP team has even found jobs for people coming out of jail,” Heagney said. The Mansfield and Norton police departments also have POP teams and other area departments aim to do the same tasks with the staff they have. The theory behind the unit, the chiefs say, is to make the police department more responsive than reactive to problems in the community. Traditional police work of responding to a call and determining whether to make an arrest before going back into service is outdated, Heagney said. “It’s not problem solving,” Heagney said, “It’s not getting to the root causes of a situation.” Under the traditional model of policing, Heagney said, police would respond repeatedly to the same problem yet expect a different result. “It’s Einstein’s definition of insanity,” Heagney said. Attleboro Mayor Paul Heroux opposes the idea of defunding city police and pointed to the POP team as the progressive direction the department has taken under Heagney’s leadership. “That’s the cutting edge of policing services that allows us to be progressive,” Heroux said. While arrests capture the public and media attention, the hybrid work of POP teams involves a lot of behind-the-scenes work of phone calls and foot work to find people help instead of a ride to the courthouse. The POP team in Mansfield and the revamping of policies Mansfield Police Chief Ron Sellon started since becoming chief in 2013 has led to reductions in domestic violence case and drug overdoses, he said. Last year, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, recognized the Mansfield police department with its community policing award. Over the years, Sellon said the government has cut funding for mental health and drug treatment programs and “then they turn to the police departments and say ‘you guys handle it’.” Sellon and Norton Police Chief Brian Clark said they have wanted to apply for a state grant to have a full-time mental health counselor to work with police but have been unable to find funding. Instead of defunding police, there should be proposals to supplement the budgets of public and private mental health and other social services that work with police, Sellon said. Currently, area police departments partner with a host of volunteers and non-profits such as the SAFE Coalition, a regional group of community partners that provides support, education, treatment options and coping mechanisms for those affected by substance use disorder; Learn to Cope, a non-profit support network that offers education, resources, peer support for family members coping with a loved one addicted to opiates or other drugs, and New Hope, an Attleboro-based facility and program that helps victims of domestic and sexual violence. When there is a person in the throes of opioid addiction, Sellon said police call the SAFE Coalition. “(It could be) at 2 a.m, so we can get them treatment, which is what they need, instead of a jail cell,” he said. Sometimes, the number of beds in treatment facilities is limited because of the lack of state funding for those facilities. “We need more help with mental health. We need more help with opioid addiction,” Sellon said. “We’re not going to arrest our way out of mental health problems or opioid addiction.” Cutting police budgets would reverse the progress they have made working with local agencies and force a turn back to the more reactionary, traditional policing, the chiefs claim. In North Attleboro, Council President Keith Lapointe said most the of constituents he has heard from are concerned with the level of police training and whether they have body cameras, which they don’t. North Attleboro Police Chief John Reilly said he is a supporter for exploring the use of body cameras, but there are concerns about the financial costs and legislation currently being proposed about their operation. In Attleboro, Heagney said he supports using body cameras and has asked for funds in his budget to buy them for the past several years. They now carry a price tag of at least $200,000 and their use, by law, has to be negotiated with police unions, he said. A local activist, Dakota Walker of Mansfield, says he supports funding for police. But funds need to be scrutinized, he said, when it comes to buying new cruisers, computers or other things that don’t benefit the public. “I’m not looking to take money away when it comes to what the police need to help the people,” Walker said. He supports training for police so they can better deal with the public and perform their jobs better. He also said he supports funds to help people with mental illness, money for schools and other social services. Police chiefs agree there needs to be reforms in hiring and that there is always room for improvement on the way police perform their job. Heagney said it is time to end the state’s Civil Service system, which he said ties the hands of chiefs on hiring choices and makes it more difficult to remove bad police officers. “I think police officers should be made up of the communities they represent,” Heagney said, adding that after individuals take the police exam the chiefs have to choose from the list supplied by Civil Service list. Heagney said police departments nationwide need to be more representative of their communities and hire more persons of color and women. By doing so, Heagney said, police departments will have better police officers, better policing and a better police culture. “We’ve been more diverse than we’ve ever been,” Heagney said, who promoted the first woman to sergeant during his tenure. “We’ve been fortunate here, but I’d like to do more.” Area police chiefs say police officers get training at the academy and at in-service sessions in de-escalation techniques, use of force, mental illness and cultural sensitivity among other areas.

The workers, ages 23 and 40, were taken by medical helicopter to Massachusetts General Hospital with injuries described as not life-threatening, Fire Chief Antonio Marino said in a press release. An initial investigation indicates that the two employees were conducting routine maintenance when a pressurized hose began to leak and sprayed potassium hydroxide on them, Marino said. The 40-year-old employee was sprayed in the face and eyes with the chemical and seriously injured. Both were wearing protective eye equipment at the time, according to the fire chief. The chemical is used to adjust the pH level of the water, according to Michael Lavin, the public works director. The accident, categorized as a Tier 1 hazardous material incident, occurred about 9:20 a.m. at the plant at 655 Franklin St. (Route 140). A Tier 1 incident is one with the lowest risk to the environment and public health with containment and cleanup. The highest level is a Tier 5. Following protocol for incidents involving chemical exposure, fire officials called the state hazardous materials response team to the scene. The state Department of Environmental Protection was also notified. The hazmat crew assisted in cleaning up the small amount of liquid that spilled and ensured that all was safe at the scene, which was cleared at approximately 11:20 a.m., Marino said. Lavin said normal operations at the plant resumed after the incident. Local police and the Norfolk and Foxboro fire departments responded to the scene to assist.

North Shore news powered by The Daily Item August 6, 2020 by [email protected] A former executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, who was mayor of Lynn 50 years ago, Thursday took a wait-and-see viewpoint on a lawsuit led by the attorney general of New York that would dissolve the gun-right group. J. Warren Cassidy, mayor in 1970-71, said he was disheartened to hear of the suit. He also noted that the NRA and the state of New York have had a historically rocky relationship. Cassidy was the NRA’s executive VP from 1986 through 1991, and was succeeded by Wayne Lapierre, current CEO and executive vice president of the group. Lapierre is central to the suit that was filed in Manhattan State Court. Attorney General Letitia James claims in the suit that top executives illegally diverted tens of millions of dollars for lavish personal trips, no-show contracts for associates and other questionable expenditures. The suit also highlighted misspending and self-dealing claims that have roiled the NRA and LaPierre, in recent years — from hair and makeup for his wife to a $17 million post-employment contract for himself. “It’s disheartening for me to hear this,” he said. “New York and the NRA have been at odds for years. “I don’t have any knowledge of whatever Wayne spent money on,” Cassidy said, adding, “but of course he’s going to be a target. “If he did those things, the purchases, and the trips, and the lavish lifestyle, that is his responsibility,” Cassidy said. “However, the board of directors has the ultimate responsibility. They appointed him. They direct him. They can fire him.” James said, “It’s clear that the NRA has been failing to carry out its stated mission for many, many years and instead has operated as a breeding ground for greed, abuse and brazen illegality,” she said at a news conference. “Enough was enough. We needed to step in and dissolve this corporation,” after an 18-month probe, she said. “No one is above the law, not even the NRA, one of the most powerful organizations in this country,” James said. The lawsuit made only civil claims. James said the investigation was ongoing and any criminal activity discovered would be referred to prosecutors and the Internal Revenue Service. Simultaneously, the Washington, D.C., attorney general sued the NRA Foundation, a charitable arm of the organization designed to provide programs for firearm safety, marksmanship and hunting safety, accusing it of diverting funds to the NRA to help pay for lavish spending by its top executives. In a statement, NRA President Carolyn Meadows labeled James a “political opportunist” who was pursuing a “rank vendetta” with an attack on its members’ Second Amendment rights. “You could have set your watch by it: the investigation was going to reach its crescendo as we move into the 2020 election cycle,” said Meadows, who announced a countersuit by the NRA in federal court in Albany that could set the stage for a drawn-out legal battle lasting well past November’s election. The troubles, which James said were long cloaked by loyal lieutenants and a pass-through payment arrangement with a vendor, became public as the NRA’s deficit piled up and it struggled to find its footing after a spate of mass shootings eroded support for its pro-gun agenda. The organization went from a nearly $28 million surplus in 2015 to a $36 million deficit in 2018. James, a Democrat, argued that the organization’s prominence and cozy political relationships had lulled it into a sense of invincibility and enabled a culture where nonprofit rules were routinely flouted and state and federal laws were violated. Even the NRA’s own bylaws and employee handbook were ignored, she said. Though it is headquartered in Virginia, the NRA was chartered as a nonprofit in New York in 1871 and continues to be incorporated in the state. The Washington, D.C., attorney general’s office has been investigating the NRA Foundation for more than a year. It said its investigation determined that low membership and lavish spending left the NRA with financial problems and so it exploited the foundation to remain afloat. “Charitable organizations function as public trusts — and District law requires them to use their funds to benefit the public, not to support political campaigns, lobbying, or private interests,” Washington Attorney General Karl Racine said in a news release. “With this lawsuit, we aim to recover donated funds that the NRA Foundation wasted.” The New York lawsuit also named LaPierre and three other current and former executives as defendants: corporate secretary and general counsel John Frazer, retired treasurer and chief financial officer Wilson Phillips, and LaPierre’s former chief of staff Joshua Powell. While the lawsuit accuses all four men of wrongdoing and seeks fines and remuneration, none of them have been charged with a crime. LaPierre, who has been in charge of the NRA’s day-to-day operations since 1991, is accused of spending millions of dollars on private travel and personal security, accepting expensive gifts such as African safaris and use of a 107-foot yacht from vendors and setting himself up with a $17 million contract with the NRA, if he were to exit the organization, without board approval. The lawsuit said LaPierre, 70, spent millions of the NRA’s dollars on travel consultants, including luxury black car services, and hundreds of thousands of dollars on private jet flights for himself and his family, including more than $500,000 on eight trips to the Bahamas over a three-year span. Some of the NRA’s excess spending was kept secret, the lawsuit said, under an arrangement with the organization’s former advertising agency, Ackerman McQueen. The advertising firm would pick up the tab for various expenses for LaPierre and other NRA executives and then send a lump sum bill to the organization for “out-of-pocket expenses,” the lawsuit said. The lawsuit comes at a time when the NRA is trying to remain relevant and a force in the 2020 presidential election as it seeks to help Trump secure a second term. There has been an ongoing factional war within organization, pitting some of its most ardent gun-rights supporters and loyalists against one another. The internal battles reached a fevered pitch at its 2019 annual meeting where its then-president, Oliver North, was denied a traditional second term amid a tussle with LaPierre as he sought to independently review the NRA’s expenses and operations. He accused LaPierre of exerting “dictatorial” control. Chris Cox, the NRA’s longtime lobbyist and widely viewed as a likely successor to LaPierre, left after being accused of working behind the scenes with North to undermine LaPierre.

dumped spoiled food over his head, and it\'s not a regular event in the Levine household in Framingham. It was done to raise money to help those suffering with mental health challenges. It happened Friday afternoon, and those who tuned in online donated money for each item Levine happily allowed to be dumped on him. All money raised went to support the Movember Foundation, a charity event that raises funds and awareness for men\'s health. Levine, 20, knows what it\'s like to struggle with mental health. He attempted suicide in September as he started his junior year at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst With the support of family, friends and medical professionals, Levine is managing his mental health challenges. All this month, Levine has raised money for the foundation. Friday morning he reached the $10,000 mark, and increased his goal to $12,500. He hopes the ""food dump” will get him there. Donations can be made through the Facebook page, Adam Levine\'s Movember Fundraiser. Helping others is Levine\'s passion, but when it comes to his future, he knows that\'s up to him. “No matter how much work my sister and parents put in, the only person that can make me get better is myself,” Levine said. Levine’s story is one of struggle, perseverance and recognition that it’s OK to share one’s personal narrative. He hopes it will chip away at the stigma of mental illness, and help others share their stories and seek professional help. Levine’s suicide attempt occurred the night of Sept. 28 in an apartment he shared with college friends at UMass-Amherst. That evening, he couldn’t stop gambling on his mobile phone, and lost $1,500. The thought of not being able to control his gambling impulses is what Levine said “put me over the edge.” A family shares their struggle:: Hiding the hurt: Parents of Blackstone Valley Tech student talk about daughter’s suicide The result was an overdose of pills. Within minutes, and overcome with fear, Levine called his parents for help. But he couldn’t bear to talk to them, so he handed the phone to a roommate to convey the news. “I don’t remember anything after I gave the phone to him. I woke up 14 to 16 hours later in a hospital bed,” Levine said. The link between depression and suicide is apparent, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. About 2% of people treated for depression in an outpatient setting will die by suicide. For those treated for depression in an inpatient hospital setting, the rate of death by suicide is twice as high (4%). Those treated for depression as inpatients following suicidal thoughts or attempts are about three times as likely to die by suicide (6%), compared to those only treated as outpatients. Middle school is when feelings of loneliness and depression started for Levine. A “great place in life” is how Levine described his junior year at Framingham High School, when he was named a captain of the wrestling team, was a National Honor Society student and class president. Everything unraveled the night of the junior prom. Levine put a lot of work into planning the event, and when it was time for the formal dinner, all the seats at the tables with his friends were taken. “I felt very isolated. I didn’t know what to do,” Levine said. “I had very strong negative thoughts. I fixated on suicide.” More: He lost two brothers to suicide. A Mendon man runs 100 miles in 27 hours for suicide prevention. He drove himself to a nearby hospital, sat in the parking lot, and contemplated checking himself into the psychological ward.

Major depressive disorder is the leading cause of disability in the United States for people age 15 to mid-40s, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America.

permanently shutters on New Year’s Eve, it not only draws the curtain on one of Charles Street’s longest standing retail establishments after nearly four decades in business at the same location, but also leave behind one less of only a handful of remaining antique shops on what was once rightfully called Boston’s “antique row.” Jim Kilroy opened the store at 138 Charles St. on Feb. 1, 1984, immediately after the first delivery container arrived there, and passersby clamored around to get a closer look at the unusual selection of Scandinavian antiques and mid-century modern furniture he was selling. “The store had no sign at first, but people saw us unloading the shipment were curious and then they saw the merchandise, which wasn’t your typical antiques,” he said. “There was no mahogany, and it wasn’t American or English. It was totally sort of fresh and fashionable.” Over the previous month, Kilroy had enlisted family members, including his sister, Ann Kfoury, and others, to help him thoroughly renovate the approximately 1,500 square-foot space, which previously hadn’t been touched in 35 years. They did all the restoration, except the electrical work themselves, Kilroy said, including removing partitions, painting the ceiling blue and remodeling the basement. As for Kilroy, he had just returned to Boston after living in Europe for several years to be closer to his family, and his wife, Ruthi, was pregnant with their first child, Danielle. It wasn’t until later that he learned many of the other antique dealers on Charles Street pitied him then and believed that his store would never last with its selection of unconventional merchandise. The doubters were soon silenced, however. “I just opened the doors and people flocked in,” he said. “I was very lucky because people liked what I was selling.” Danish Country & Modern was also graced with good fortune early on when Mopsy Strange Kennedy, a frequent contributor to The Boston Globe at the time, featured the store in a small write-up with a photo in that newspaper’s Sunday edition on March 25, 1984, and which still hangs in the store to this day.

Additionally, another of his sisters, Carol Kilroy, has worked in the shop alongside his sister, Ann, for the past 15 years as well. Danish Country & Modern, meanwhile, has won numerous accolades over the years, including notably, Boston Magazine’s Best of Boston in 2012, as well as Yankee Magazine’s Best of New England in 2004 and again in 2009.
