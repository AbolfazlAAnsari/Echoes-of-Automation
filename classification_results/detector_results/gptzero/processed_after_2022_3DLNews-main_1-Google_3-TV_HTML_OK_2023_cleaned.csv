CLAIR, Mo. (Gray News) – The former Missouri teacher who made headlines for having an OnlyFans account said she has made nearly $1 million on the platform since she joined it over the summer. Former teacher Brianna Coppage revealed to Fox News the staggering amount of money she has made from making adult content. Coppage had been a teacher for five years, spending the last two at St. Clair High School as an English teacher before resigning after her OnlyFans page was discovered by school administrators and she was put on leave. Coppage noted that her annual teaching salary was $42,000, and she originally started the OnlyFans account to help pay off her student loans. “Missouri is one of the lowest states in the nation for teacher pay,” Coppage told KMOV. “The district I was working for is also one of the lowest paying districts in the state. I feel like times are tough. I have student loans. I have multiple degrees in education, and it would be helpful for extra money.” On Coppage’s teaching salary, she would have had to work for nearly 24 years to make the same amount of money she has made from OnlyFans in less than six months. Coppage said she now has tens of thousands of subscribers on OnlyFans and has “far exceeded” her teaching salary for the year. She has also paid off all her debt. “I’ve been able to pay off all my student loans, any car loans, any credit card debt. I have no debt now, and that’s really freeing,” Coppage told KMOV. “Being a teacher, I know I never would have been able to fully pay all of that off.” Although her OnlyFans account posts sexually explicit content, Coppage said she avoided showing her face because of her job as a teacher. Coppage’s OnlyFans content was originally discovered by the St. Clair School District after a link to the page was posted in a St. Clair Facebook group. Once the page gained so much attention in the community and even across the country, Coppage said she knew she couldn’t go back to the classroom and decided to resign. Coppage said her content was never advertised to her high school students, but adults in the community continue to bring up the subject. “I’m not advertising it to students, but adults in the community continue to do so,” Coppage told KMOV. “I just don’t think that’s OK. Students were never meant to see this. I know people are saying, ‘You taught high school. They were bound to find it at some point.’ Maybe. I was faceless. I did not use my real name.” While Coppage said she will miss her students and has grieved her career as a teacher, she doesn’t have any regrets. Coppage said if teachers are held to a high standard, she wants to see them paid accordingly. She also told Fox News she strongly believes people are allowed to have personal lives outside of their careers. Copyright 2023 Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.'}]"

The poll, published Tuesday from The New York Times/Siena College, found 24 percent of respondents who said they would vote for Trump in the upcoming election also say he should not be the nominee if found guilty in one of his legal trials, “even if he has won the most votes.” The former president has used his online platform, Truth Social, to attack legal officials overseeing his cases and encouraged his fan base to do the same. Though he is leading the GOP primary field by far, he has held that the prosecution comes from the left and is an attempt to ruin his campaign and chances for reelection. While some supporters say the outcome in court will affect their decision to support him, a majority of his supporters say it won’t matter. Seventy percent of Trump supporters believe the former president should still be the nominee. regardless of a potential conviction. The results remain mostly the same when examining respondents’ voting choices in 2020. Twenty-two percent said he would lose their support, while 70 percent said he wouldn’t, according to the survey. Just over half of respondents, 53 percent, believe it’s unlikely that Trump will be convicted at the end of his federal election subversion trial. Thirty-five percent say it is likely that he will be convicted, the poll found. Just over a quarter of his backers said it’s likely he will be convicted, while 61 percent say it’s unlikely the former president will be found guilty of a crime in the case. Twenty percent of self-identified Trump supporters think he should be sentenced to prison if he is found guilty of his alleged attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Even less believe the former president is getting a fair trial, the survey found. Nearly all of his supporters believe he has not committed a crime and the charges against him are politically motivated. The survey was conducted Dec. 10-14 among 1,016 registered voters and has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points for registered voters. Submit Δ Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

In a new CBS News poll published Sunday, 51 percent of respondents said they would cast their ballot for Trump, while 48 percent said they would vote Biden. When asked how they feel about a potential Biden-Trump 2024 rematch, people who backed Biden said they are nervous and frustrated by the prospect. The poll reiterates sentiments seen in other surveys this year in which a majority of voters said they would prefer that neither Biden nor Trump win. When it comes to personal finances, 45 percent said they’d feel better off under a Trump presidency while only 18 percent felt the same if Biden wins. Forty-eight percent said they would be worse off if Biden won. Those polled also suggested that war was more likely under Biden than Trump, with 49 percent saying the U.S. would increase its chances of partaking in a war compared with 39 percent under Trump. “Predictions more than a year out tend to look a little different a year later. Don’t take our word for it: Gallup predicted an eight point loss for President Obama only for him to win handedly a year later,” Biden’s campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement to The Hill. “Or a year out from the 2022 midterms when every major outlet similarly predicted a grim forecast for President Biden.” “Coming off those historic midterms, President Biden’s campaign is hard at work reaching and mobilizing our diverse, winning coalition of voters one year out on the choice between our winning, popular agenda and MAGA Republicans’ unpopular extremism,” Munoz added. “We’ll win in 2024 by putting our heads down and doing the work, not by fretting about a poll.” The CBS News poll was conducted from Oct. 30 to Nov. 3 with a total of 2,636 people participating in the survey. The poll’s margin of error was 2.6 percentage points. Updated at 6:31 pm. Submit Δ Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.
