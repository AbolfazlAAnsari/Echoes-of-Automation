Wade made them much more interested in voting this year, an eight-point increase from when the question was asked as a hypothetical in September, according to a new poll. The poll — conducted by Emerson College in partnership with All In Together, a nonpartisan women’s civic engagement organization — found that 56 percent of respondents said the court’s decision made them at least somewhat more interested in voting this year. Eight percent said it made them less interested and one-third said it made no difference. The court’s decision last week to overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, ending the country’s constitutional right to abortion, has fueled intense anger for many, with liberals hoping the ruling will galvanize voters to support Democrats. The decision has already led to major advertisement buys from groups like Planned Parenthood, which rolled out a $3 million campaign on Thursday hitting Pennsylvania Republican Senate nominee Mehmet Oz over his stance on abortion access. Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), who is in a tough reelection battle, also on Thursday launched an abortion-related television ad. The Supreme Court’s ruling has also led to a flurry of lawsuits in states across the country seeking to stop abortion restrictions that took effect in its wake. The poll found that more than two-thirds of respondents who said they were much more interested in voting this year — 68 percent — supported the generic Democratic congressional candidate. Among women, the poll found a 10-point swing for those saying they were much more interested in voting in the midterms because of the Supreme Court’s decision compared to September. Among women aged 18 to 29, the swing increased to 20 points. Just 5 percent of women said the court’s decision would make them less interested in voting in the 2022 elections, compared to 60 percent who said it would make them more interested. The poll of registered voters was conducted between June 28 and 29. The pollsters weighted the responses using turnout modeling for the midterm elections, and the margin of error is plus or minus 2.7 percentage points. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

Example video title will go here for this video Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video AUSTIN, Texas — On Monday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott joined KVUE live at 5 p.m. to discuss the latest headlines around Texas, including the Texas power grid, border policies and controversy regarding the release of hallway video from the Uvalde school shooting incident. Here is an edited transcript of Abbott\'s conversation with anchors Bryan Mays and Ashley Goudeau: Let\'s start with the topic on a lot of minds today in this triple-digit heat, our power grid. In February, you describe the grid as ""the most reliable and resilient than it\'s ever been."" It\'s July. We are being asked to conserve, voluntarily conserve. Are we prepared for potentially hotter August? So, if you look at the way the grid has performed so far, it\'s performed remarkably well. As you all were talking about tonight and many nights before tonight, we\'ve set record after record of high temperature and record demands for energy. And there was a conservation notice put out last night, and it was put out because of the concern that we might get within 2,300 megawatts of power supply surplus. It turned out we didn\'t even get close to that. So, this was an early warning of what could have happened. But in talking to the chair of the Public Utilities Commission, he told me that the tools that we\'ve put in place through the laws that we passed in the last session gave him the flexibility and ERCOT the flexibility they needed to ensure that we had even more supply than what we anticipated needing. Bottom line, we\'ve made it through all of these tough days with plenty of supply, and we believe that going forward with the tools that ERCOT now has and the PUC now has, we will be able to make it through the summer. Know this important fact: since Winter Storm Uri and since the new reforms that were put in place, no Texan has lost power as a result of any problem with ERCOT. All right, governor, let\'s turn to the border. You issued an executive order last week directing the National Guard and DPS to take migrants who unlawfully cross into Texas in between ports of entry to the ports on the border. Talk to us about the goal of that order. And while it has only been a few days, have you received reports yet on how it\'s going? Sure. Listen, I\'ve talked to the head of the Texas Department of Public Safety, and every single day they are returning people to the border. And the reason why we\'re doing this is because of the extraordinary illegal immigration that\'s taking place, which also is record-breaking. We\'ve had record-breaking month after month after month and year after year. And over the Fourth of July weekend, there were about 5,000 people who were apprehended in just the Del Rio sector alone. And, of course, there was the horrific deaths that we saw in that tractor-trailer truck. But that\'s just a small percentage of the overall deaths that are occurring on the border region every single day. In fact, the United Nations said that the border region between … the U.S. and Mexico is the deadliest border region in the world. And we have terrorists coming across the border and deadly fentanyl coming across the border. So there is a need for us as a state to try to step up and do what Washington, D.C., is not doing, and that is to return these illegal immigrants to the border in a way to try to cut down on the level of illegal immigration that\'s taking place. Governor, you mentioned the tragedy in San Antonio last month, and we\'ve heard from experts to say this isn\'t an isolated incident. This is happening more than we realize. What more can be done to prevent not only these people from getting into these drugs and getting into Texas, but tragedies like what we saw, what can be done to keep that from happening? So one easy thing that could be done, if the federal government were to do it, is to fully fund Border Patrol. Their Border Patrol is about more than 2,000 officers or agents short of what they need to be. If they had more agents, they could inspect more trucks and they could interdict people before they get into trucks like that before it happens, because the Biden administration is not providing that funding for those Border Patrol agents. I have ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety for them to increase inspections of trucks so that we can try to discover any migrants, any trucks like this before they to lose their lives. So the shortages began in January of 2021? So, if you would, the remarkable spike in the increase of the number of people coming across the border begin around January 2021, has done nothing but go up since then, setting all-time record highs consistently, which has put more strain on the Border Patrol agents, as well as on Texas law enforcement, as well as these communities on the border. Think, y\'all may have no idea what these towns and counties are dealing with on the border. Some towns and counties have more people coming into their county than have traditionally lived in their county, and they had no way of dealing with it. So the shortages, though, the actual officers, those shortages began in January of \'21? So what what the Biden Administration has done, they have reduced the force, the number of members in the Border Patrol agent force. But in addition to that, they have basically disbanded the role that ICE has played in all of this and have reduced their numbers also. As you know, the Texas House committee investigating the elementary school shooting met today. There are calls to release a hallway video, a request DPS seemingly supports. They said that they support that, but the Uvalde County DA is asking to hold off on that as the state\'s former attorney general. What\'s your take on how to balance those calls for transparency with ongoing investigations? Ashley, at this time, that video needs to be released, as well as the audio. So there\'s both audio and video of exactly what happened in that school and everything that does not contain the images of those who lost their lives, and the victims, should be released to the public. As you know, reporters have seen it, the stories have been written about it. There is no law enforcement reason that I can see why that video should not be released. And I\'m urging that that video be released to the public. The Texans need to know. But, frankly, the people of Uvalde, they deserve to get to know exactly what happened. And I urge that it happen very quickly. Well, governor, would you consider pushing it more, maybe you even releasing it yourself? Well, here\'s what I don\'t know as we speak right now, and that is whether or not the district attorney has a court order prohibiting the release of it. Absent something like that, I will be pushing for the release of it.

group of Texas middle-schoolers won NPR\'s 4th-annual Student Podcast Challenge, and learned a lesson about fake news and the limits of ""talking digitally."" The town of Rockwall, Texas, has a few claims to fame: Bonafide Betties Pie Company, where ""thick pies save lives""; the mega-sized Lakepointe Church; and Lake Ray Hubbard, which is lovely until the wet, Texas heat makes a shoreline stroll feel like a plod through hot butter. Now add to that list: Rockwall is home to the middle-school winners of NPR\'s fourth-annual Student Podcast Challenge. Their entry, The Worlds We Create, is a funny and sneakily thoughtful exploration of what it means that so many teens today are ""talking digitally,"" instead of face-to-face. It was one of two winning entries (the high school winner is here) chosen by our judges from among more than 2,000 student podcasts from around the country. The team behind the pod Rockwall hugs the eastern shore of the lake and got its name from a wall-like thread of sandstone that unspools beneath the town. ""Every street name sounds the same: Lakeshore, Club Lake, Lakeview, Lakeside, and so on..."" says the podcast\'s narrator, 8th-grader Harrison McDonald. ""If it sounds like our town is boring, that\'s because it is. But let\'s zoom into the center of one of those neighborhoods, on Williams Middle School."" That\'s where Harrison, fellow 8th-grader Blake Turley and 7th-graders Kit Atteberry and Wesley Helmer made the podcast, as part of librarian Misti Knight\'s broadcasting class. Knight began teaching Harrison and Blake last year, when they would make videos for the school\'s morning announcements. ""But then I realized how good [the boys] were, and so I would say this year, I\'m honestly more their manager,"" she laughs. Meaning, often Ms. Knight just gives the boys the roughest of ideas and encourages them to get creative. Which is why, when Harrison came to her with an idea for NPR\'s Student Podcast Challenge, she said, ""Why not?"" Harrison\'s interest in the contest surprised no one. He wears chunky headphones around his neck every day, like a uniform, and says he was raised on public radio. ""[My family] have a system. On long road trips, we listen to This American Life. On shorter road trips, we listen to Wait, Wait, Don\'t Tell Me."" Kit also brought a love of podcasting to the effort: ""My dad got me into listening to podcasts, and we would just listen to them in the car and listen to them in the house. You know, he never really got into music. He was mostly into podcasts,"" Kit says, especially The Moth. For their entry, Harrison, Kit and the team wanted to explore how students at Williams Middle School, and likely every other middle and high school in the country, interact on social media. Specifically, when they go on a platform like TikTok or Instagram and create anonymous accounts to share things about school and their classmates. ""People feel anonymous, so they feel like they can do whatever they want"" For example: An account dedicated to pics of students considered ""hot."" ""My friend was on there,"" Blake says, ""and I texted him, \'Hey, do you know that you\'re on this Instagram account?\' And he\'s like, \'What?!\' "" Most of these accounts ""aren\'t even gossip,"" Blake adds, ""they\'re just pictures of people sleeping, eating, acting surprised, acting sad."" One account was dedicated entirely to pictures of students sleeping in class. On some accounts, students are in on the joke, but often they\'re not, Harrison says. ""Through the internet ... people feel anonymous, so they feel like they can do whatever they want — and get likes for it without any punishment."" The boys found at least 81 of these accounts at Williams alone. Then they got a bold idea. Fake it till you make it ""After seeing all of these social media pages, we decided it would be fun if we just made our own profile and posted fake gossip to see the impact it has and how it spreads through a middle school,"" they explain in the podcast. Fake gossip is putting it mildly. ""We knocked on our school police officer\'s door and asked if he would pretend to arrest one of our A-V club members for the camera. Surprisingly, he actually agreed,"" Harrison says. It was the first video to go up on their new gossip account. ""We didn\'t think it would actually get anywhere, but less than 15 minutes later, we heard people starting to talk about it."" Next up: The boys staged a fight in the band room, hoping a shaky camera and sound effects added in post-production would convince their classmates it was bigger and very real. ""Some of us would have kids walking up to us daily to tell us how we got absolutely destroyed in that fight or how they didn\'t know we were in band. We were having fun with it now,"" Harrison says in the podcast. ""It didn\'t take long for our fake account to start getting more followers than any other gossip account we could find."" ""Our generation prefers talking digitally"" As a social experiment, these four middle-schoolers went from quiet observers of social media to the school\'s master muckrakers – even though everything they posted was utterly fake. In that way, the podcast works as a warning about the importance of media literacy — at a time when Americans half-a-century their senior are being suckered by social media every day. But the podcast isn\'t just a scold about fake news. It\'s also about how, for kids their age, this is communication. ""We don\'t pass notes, we send texts with our phones hidden under our desks,"" Harrison says. ""We don\'t tell people about incidents that happened in class, we post it on TikTok. Our generation prefers talking digitally with each other from a distance, [rather] than communicating with each other in the real world."" The boys named their podcast, The Worlds We Create. Ms. Knight, a veteran teacher, says she\'s seen these changes in students over the years. ""I just think there\'s a lot less talking and a lot more, you know, swiping through their phone instead of saying, \'Hey, guess what I saw today?\' "" Knight has even seen it in her own family. ""I would talk to my husband about, \'Oh, did you see our eldest daughter?\' She lives in California. \'She did this or whatever.\' And he would say, \'How do you know this?\' "" Her answer: ""\'Because I\'m following her social media and her friends\' social media.\' Because if you don\'t do that, she\'s probably not going to pick up the phone and call us and tell us."" Is that inherently bad? Knight says, no, not necessarily. She does get to see more of what her daughters and her friends, far and wide, are doing. The boys\' views are similarly complicated. All this ""talking digitally"" can be a real ""curse"" for teens, they say, especially when it hurts or excludes others. But it doesn\'t have to be that way. After all, the boys say, the whole purpose of technologies from radio to the telephone, TV to the internet, has always been to help us feel less alone and more connected – by helping us create worlds – and build communities – bigger than the ones we\'re born into.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) serve in the Senate. Musk made the comment in response to a tweet from former Tesla program manager Farzad Mesbahi, who is now a content creator, according to his LinkedIn profile. Mesbahi retweeted a post about a letter that Warren sent to the chairman of the board of Tesla, of which Musk is the majority shareholder, asking if shareholders have been hurt financially by Musk’s time running Twitter. “Elizabeth Warren is the last person I would ever want anywhere close to Tesla,” Mesbahi posted. Tesla stock has lost almost a third of its value since Musk completed his acquisition of Twitter at the end of October. Warren wrote in her letter that she is concerned Tesla’s board has “failed to meet” its “legal duty” to ensure Musk is not treating the company as his “private plaything.” She also asked how the board is handling “conflicts of interest, misappropriation of corporate assets, and other actions by Mr. Musk that appear not to be in the best interests of Tesla and its shareholders.” She noted that Musk’s deal to buy Twitter gave Tesla $1 billion in yearly interest payments to make, an amount that exceeds its annual cash flow.
