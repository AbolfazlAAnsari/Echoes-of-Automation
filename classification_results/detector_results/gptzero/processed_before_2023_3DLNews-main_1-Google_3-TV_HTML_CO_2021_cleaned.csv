After a fun vacation in Florida, Cody and Paige Petek and their two children were set to fly back to Des Moines, Iowa, on Sunday. During their layover in St. Louis, their 5-year-old son, who is nonverbal and has autism and a sensory processing disorder, was struggling to wear his mask. The Peteks say the Southwest Airlines crew refused to let them into their connecting flight. Dr. Vince Hassel, who was also flying to Des Moines, says people started lobbying to get the boy on board after the crew refused. “They weren’t going to let the kid on the plane if he didn’t put this mask on. He kind of had a bandana around his neck, and he just wasn’t having it and throwing a fit. Just to watch this play out was absolutely horrible,” Hassel said. As the scene was playing out, the family says the 5-year-old had a seizure, but his medication was on board the flight to Des Moines. The Petek family says they had to drive home from St. Louis in a rental car. What should have been an hourlong plane ride turned into a nearly six-hour drive. Anthony L. Marchetti Jr., the Peteks’ lawyer, believes Southwest violated the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Transportation Security Administration’s policy states that people with disabilities who cannot wear a mask because of the disability are exempt from having to wear one. “There’s clear guidance from the Department of Transportation as to what the airlines should do. None of that happened here,” Marchetti said. In a statement, Southwest cited federal law requiring everyone 2 years of age and older to wear a mask during travel. The airline says it “considers applications for exemptions” from passengers with disabilities, and the child “did not have an exemption.” The airline says employees offered to book a hotel for the Peteks, so the family could try the trip at a later time. Instead, the family chose to drive, and the airline says it gave them a full refund. Copyright 2021 KCCI via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.'}]"

CBS4 Medical Editor Dr. Dave Hnida said there are a number of reasons for the decrease in an interview on CBSN Denver. ""First and foremost, we are starting to vaccinate people and that is certainly very helpful,"" he said. ""The second thing has to do with behaviors. People\'s behaviors are just really consistent. I think people are getting used to things such as masking and social distancing. It\'s really the norm these days."" Hnida also pointed out we have not had much holiday travel recently. But the most interesting reason may be Hnida\'s third point: seasonality. ""We know viruses tend to react to things like temperature, humidity, even the amount of sunlight during the course of the day."" ""We\'re thinking COVID actually may have some sort of seasonality response. It may actually begin to decrease as we head towards spring. We\'ll see if that continues to be the case."" Hnida also said part of the decrease outside of Colorado has to do with the continued lack of testing, pointing out in many places it is still hard to get a test. ""With the number of tests going down we\'re not picking up as many cases of COVID as we otherwise might."" And finally, he said the number of people who have already been infected means the virus has fewer people to infect, even if some people are getting COVID a second time. ""At this point in time, we know we\'ve had at least 30 million Americans diagnosed with COVID, we actually think the number of cases is probably triple that because not everybody gets tested."" ""Overall, thenews is very, very good. We know that the vaccine is effective. We know that the vaccine is safe. We are seeing behaviors and other factors come into this. It\'s not time to let our guard down. If we just just the course, we are going to see some brighter days ahead. I\'m very optimstic.""
