HAFNER: But the menhaden has become a kind of poster child for the Chesapeake Bay. The small silver fish are a crucial part of the base ecosystem. They're a key food source for everything from ospreys to bigger fish, like striped bass, that local sport fishers treasure. Now, Dollar and others worry menhaden are at risk of disappearing. He says he sees drastically fewer fish than he used to. DOLLAR: The density of the schools where it might be, you know, size of a football field is now just maybe a tennis court, and you see those smaller and smaller numbers. HAFNER: Sport fishing and conservation groups pin the blame on one company, Omega Protein. It's the last player from an industry that once spanned the East Coast harvesting menhaden from Maine to Florida. Virginia is the last place on the Atlantic that allows this type of fishing, which turns millions of menhaden into fish meal and fish oil. It's been controversial for decades, but in recent years it's become even more heated. Local fishermen sometimes post videos of Omega's boats on social media complaining about the scale of the industry, which uses purse seines, or giant nets, to scoop up massive swarms of menhaden. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Absolutely destroying what's left of the Chesapeake Bay. HAFNER: Critics now want state officials to shut down Omega in the Bay, but Omega says the industry is already tightly regulated. Monty Deihl is CEO of Ocean Harvesters, which runs Omega's fishing fleet. MONTY DEIHL: First of all, you know, we've been fishing here since 1878. The footprint of menhaden fishing in the Chesapeake Bay is as low now as it's probably been in 60 or 70 years. HAFNER: He shows me around the company's plant in Reidsville, Va., and points out giant bins holding the previous day's catch. Oh, wow (laughter). That's a lot of fish. DEIHL: So that's what a million menhaden looks like. HAFNER: From these bins, he says, the menhaden move through the plant. DEIHL: We use 100% of that fish. You know, we cook the fish, we squeeze it, we press it. HAFNER: The resulting fish meal and fish oil goes into products like pet food and omega-3 supplements. Deihl says banning Omega from the Chesapeake Bay would force the whole plant to close, costing more than 200 local jobs, and he says critics are ignoring the data. DEIHL: They're not being objective about the fishery. You know, they don't understand the fishery, and they're not listening to the science. HAFNER: That science is at the center of the debate. The overall population of Atlantic menhaden crashed during the 20th century, but it bounced back after commercial fishing was limited. Rob Latour studies menhaden at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. ROB LATOUR: Quite frankly, if this were any other species, I think we'd all be celebrating. HAFNER: But the available data looks at the fish's habitat along the entire East Coast. Critics worry that could obscure a decline happening specifically in the Chesapeake Bay. Latour says that could be true, but it needs to be studied. LATOUR: I don't fault people for thinking about that, but it's a very complicated thing to actually determine with sufficient evidence scientifically. The things you need to know, we don't know. HAFNER: Advocates want more research to close that data gap. After a year of negotiations, they hoped Virginia lawmakers would approve a new study this session. But instead, the study was tabled until at least next year. LEE WARE: It's a big disappointment for the bill not to go forward. HAFNER: Delegate Lee Ware, a Republican from west of Richmond, sponsored the bill. WARE: This species is so important to so many elements of the Bay. HAFNER: Conservation groups say Omega lobbied against the bill, though the company denies that. Dollar, the fishing captain, has been involved with conservation for 30 years. He says there's an old saying in fishery politics. DOLLAR: It's a marathon, not a sprint. I've amended that. When it comes to menhaden, particularly in Virginia, it's an ultramarathon, not just a marathon. HAFNER: That ultramarathon continues. Advocates are already asking state regulators to halt the fishery until more is known about potential impacts. For NPR News, I'm Katherine Hafner in Norfolk, Va.

in history and struggling to pass even basic things like annual spending bills. Last week, that chaos spread to the Senate, with Republicans questioning the once rock-solid leadership of Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell after a bipartisan border deal fell apart. One of McConnell's detractors, Missouri Republican Josh Hawley, had this sarcastic characterization of what played out. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOSH HAWLEY: Oh, I think Republican leadership has shown they're a well-oiled machine. I mean, they just do great. I mean, it couldn't be improved upon - absolutely have it all together, you know, very, very impressive. ELLIOTT: Ouch. NPR political correspondent Susan Davis joins us now to discuss the state of Senate leadership. Hi, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Debbie. ELLIOTT: So is it fair to say that Mitch McConnell is politically weakened? DAVIS: Yeah, you know, for sure. But this didn't just happen this past week. This has been happening ever since, really, Donald Trump was elected president back in 2016. His rise has weakened longtime establishment leaders like Mitch McConnell. And frankly, the Republican base doesn't like Mitch McConnell. Trump doesn't like Mitch McConnell. But Mitch McConnell has been able to hold Senate Republicans behind him through some pretty rocky years. He was further weakened in 2022, if you recall - 10 Republicans voted against him serving as their leader when they failed to win the majority in the midterm elections. And we can't ignore his recent health problems. His absence from the Senate and his public freezing episodes have certainly taken a toll, at least on the perception of his strength within the party. ELLIOTT: So how much influence is Trump on Senate Republicans, and is that complicating McConnell's ability to get things done? DAVIS: You know, it depends on the issue, but certainly on the two issues of the day, both border security and aiding Ukraine, he is at odds with Donald Trump, and that has weakened him. More senators would like to be aligned with Donald Trump going into this election in their own primaries versus Mitch McConnell. Trump doesn't want to give Joe Biden a win on the border, and he just fundamentally opposes more money for Ukraine. McConnell himself has spent months trying to rally support within the party for action on Ukraine. He's been rolled on it in the past, and frankly, it's still unclear if he's going to be able to get the votes to get it done. ELLIOTT: So we all watched all the drama in the House with the leadership change there. Is there a possibility that McConnell could face some sort of a challenge to his leadership here amid Congress? DAVIS: Almost certainly not - you would need a majority of Senate Republicans to say they wanted to reopen their leadership slate. They are not there. I don't think any Senate Republican looked at what happened in the House as something that was good for the party or for their internal party relations, not to mention the fact you just can't beat someone with no one. And there's almost no clear alternative to McConnell right now. Leaderships do happen, though, right after Election Day. So Republicans are going to have to decide this question again in November. Publicly, McConnell has said that he does plan to serve out his term, which runs through 2026. But it's not clear whether he's going to stand for a leader again in the next Congress. But keep in mind, he's already earned a place in history. He's already the longest-serving Senate leader of either party and the longest-serving senator in Kentucky history. ELLIOTT: McConnell has been the Senate Republicans' top election tactician for more than two decades now. How involved do you expect him to be in this year's campaigns? DAVIS: Yeah, and this is something that's really important to keep in mind despite all the turmoil that's been playing out. Republicans are still heavily favored to win control of the Senate this November. And it is fair to say that no one has invested more in winning Senate majorities than McConnell. His allied groups are once again expected to put hundreds of millions of dollars into these swing state races. But yeah, he's not a popular figure. You're not going to see him out there publicly campaigning for candidates. He's always been much more of a backroom player. The big question here, beyond McConnell's health, is if Trump wins, you know, it'd be really unlikely Trump would want to see McConnell stay on as leader. And that could weigh significantly on how Republican senators look at who they want to be in their party leadership. ELLIOTT: So as we look to the future, if not McConnell, who? DAVIS: Well, you know, Senate leadership races tend to be peaceful affairs. The two parties both usually decide who they want to lead them, and that's usually done by acclamation. There hasn't been a truly competitive race for Senate leader since the '90s. But, you know, Trump's Republican Party doesn't lend itself to peaceful transitions all the time. There are three names you hear the most when you ask about the future of the Senate Republican leadership. It's the three Johns - that would be Cornyn of Texas, Thune of South Dakota, and Barrasso of Wyoming. They're all men. They're all white. They're all current or past members of party leadership. And they all come from safe conservative seats where Donald Trump is wildly popular and likely to win this year. ELLIOTT: So stay tuned. That's NPR political correspondent Susan Davis.

Jason Chaffetz and Nicole Parker discuss the congressional chaos as the House rejects the proposed border bill on ‘Fox News @ Night.’ U.S. Customs and Border Protection has tracked over 1 million migrant encounters since Oct. 1st, when fiscal year 2024 began, a CBP source told Fox News Digital on Wednesday, the earliest this mark has ever been reached. The number is roughly 100,000 encounters higher than the same period last year, when the U.S. saw 908,000 encounters. This is the earliest the U.S. has ever reached the 1 million encounter mark, according to the CBP source. The U.S. is also tracking a higher number of Chinese migrants crossing the border. Chinese illegal immigrants made up the fastest-growing group of border crossers last year, and fiscal year 2024 is on track to shatter that record. The CBP encountered over 37,000 Chinese migrants last year, but they have already encountered nearly 20,000 since October. The CBP source says they have encountered roughly 150 Chinese migrants per day this fiscal year. GOP SENATORS RALLY AGAINST BIPARTISAN BORDER DEAL, CITING BIDEN’S POWER TO SUSPEND ‘EMERGENCY’ BILL The news comes just after a bipartisan immigration bill crashed and burned in Congress this week. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and other critics of the bill argued that it would ""normalize"" 5,000 border encounters each day. MAYORKAS LASHES OUT AT ‘BASELESS’ GOP ALLEGATIONS AHEAD OF KEY IMPEACHMENT VOTE ""That works out to 1.8 million a year. That works out to about 6 million illegal immigrants over the three years of Biden…. So the idiotic Republican proposal was let\'s be for two thirds of the border invasion that Biden has allowed,"" Cruz told Fox News on Tuesday. The House of Representatives also failed to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in a vote on Tuesday. The House voted mostly along party lines, but Republicans suffered a number of defections that torpedoed the 216-214 vote. Four Republicans ultimately voted no: Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., Ken Buck, R-Colo., Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., and Blake Moore, R-Utah, who switched his vote at the last minute in a procedural move to be able to bring the resolution back to the floor. GOP LAWMAKER ON KEY IMMIGRATION SUBCOMMITTEE SLAMS MAYORKAS IMPEACHMENT Lawmakers voted on a resolution combining two articles of impeachment that accused Mayorkas of having ""refused to comply with Federal immigration laws"" and the other of having violated ""public trust."" A Cabinet secretary has not been impeached since 1876, when Secretary of War William Belknap was impeached. The House of Representatives failed to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in a vote on Tuesday. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Border crossings have set several records in recent months. December saw 302,000 migrant encounters alone, the highest total for a single month ever recorded. It was also the first time a monthly total had exceeded 300,000.

It was recently reported a shipwreck was uncovered during the January storm. The report said the shipwreck photographed is believed to be the Esk, but one of the Eastern Shore’s many interesting wrinkles of history arises here. According to local author and historian Curtis Badger, there were actually two ships named the Esk which shipwrecked off Paramore Island in the same week in 1888. “That is one of the most incredible stories I have ever come across. I had known about the wreck for years and had gone out to Parramore years ago and photographed the wreck with the lifesaving station in the background. But when I was researching the book Wilderness Regained, I found that there were actually two ships named the Esk, and both of them wrecked on the shoals of Parramore during the same week in 1888. The story is on page 128 of the book,” he said. The first Esk was a 148 ton schooner that wrecked on Sept. 7. 1888, two miles south of Parramore Beach Station. According to Shipwrecks on the Virginia Coast by Richard and Julie Pouliot, all seven crewmen were saved although the the ship was a total loss (valued at $7500). She was transporting a cargo of dyewood (valued at $3500) from Maracaibo, Venezuela to Providence, Rhode Island under a master named Watt. The home port of the Esk was Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. Details of the first wreck and rescue of the seven crew members are detailed in “Annual Report of the Operations of the United States Life-saving Service for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1889” pg. 103. The ship was grounded 250 yards offshore and required multiple firings of a Lyle gun to get a line secured for the rescue of the master (William F. Watt) and his six crewmembers. The ship grounded approximately 2 miles south of the Parramore Life Saving Station. However, Badger believes the wreck uncovered and photographed is the other wreck. That Esk was carrying guano, a popular fertilizer at the time, and a crew of laborers from the Caribbean back to Norfolk. She was swept up in a hurricane on either September 7 or 8, and blown off course. The ship was declared lost with all aboard in 1890. “News accounts of the other Esk, the one carrying dyewood and bound for Rhode Island, say that the crew was rescued by the life-saving service, but the ship was pounded to pieces in the surf. The Esk carrying the guano sank in deeper water and was preserved until it was washed up in the northeaster,” said the local author. The Peninsula Enterprise of September 15, 1888 reported: “The British schooner Esk, of Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, bound from Maracaibo, South America, to Providence, Rhode Island, with a cargo of 180 tons of dyewood, valued at $3,500, stranded on Parramore’s Beach off the eastern coast of this county, during the furious gale last Saturday night, and the vessel is now a total wreck. The captain, W. F. Watt, and the entire crew, all of Nova Scotia, were rescued by the crew of the life saving station in charge of Capt. N. B. Rich, at imminent peril to their own lives. The cargo was also saved, and is now in the hands of the underwriters. The schooner was valued at $7,500 and partially insured. Capt. Watt, in a letter to us expresses gratitude to Capt. Rich and crew for “noble services rendered him and his crew.” The remains of the Esk have appeared and disappeared several times over the last 136 years. According to Badger, the ship carrying guano was first uncovered in 1900 during a nor’easter. The photo of the remains of the Esk was taken several years ago and was included in Shipwrecks of the Virginia Coast. Despite the depredations of souvenir hunters, worms, rust and shifting sand, substantial portions of the wreck remain, a tribute to the oak timbers that make up her frame and the iron fittings that reinforce them. “I don’t think anyone really is aware that there were two ships named Esk, and they both wrecked off Parramore within days of each other in 1888,” Badger concluded. “This is one of the great stories of Eastern Shore history.” WESR Radio PO Box 460 Onley, Va. 23418 Sales or Info : (757) 787-3200 Fax: (757) 787-3819'}]"

The WDBJ7 Investigates team obtained the police report that shows a possible reason behind the dog’s death. A woman told a Carroll County Sheriff’s deputy her dog, Ghost, disappeared December 21, 2023. She found him the next day in an embankment off the side of the road in an Amazon cardboard box, covered in blood and beaten to death. Law enforcement traced the box back to the woman’s neighbor, Alexander Davis, Jr. The police report states Davis, Jr. told his neighbors he killed their dog, “because he found his chickens dead a few days prior and believed they took his dead chickens and ‘hauled them off’. He said when he [saw] their dog, he ‘killed him and hauled him off too’.” A necropsy report from Virginia Tech Veterinary Teaching Hospital reveals Ghost died from blunt sharp force trauma to the head from a pick axe/hammer or two different weapons.

(WDBJ) - A man from Fries is facing charges after allegedly beating a dog to death. Alexander Davis, Jr. is charged with felony larceny of an animal and misdemeanor animal cruelty. The WDBJ7 Investigates team obtained the police report that shows a possible reason behind the dog’s death. A woman told a Carroll County Sheriff’s deputy her dog, Ghost, disappeared December 21, 2023. She found him the next day in an embankment off the side of the road in an Amazon cardboard box, covered in blood and beaten to death. Law enforcement traced the box back to the woman’s neighbor, Alexander Davis, Jr. The police report states Davis, Jr. told his neighbors he killed their dog, “because he found his chickens dead a few days prior and believed they took his dead chickens and ‘hauled them off’. He said when he [saw] their dog, he ‘killed him and hauled him off too’.” A necropsy report from Virginia Tech Veterinary Teaching Hospital reveals Ghost died from blunt sharp force trauma to the head from a pick axe/hammer or two different weapons. The report states “the dog was alive, and most likely conscious, for all the blows to the head.” According to the police report, when Davis, Jr. was arrested, he told the deputy he did beat the dog to death, and “he wish it wouldn’t have came down to it. He stated the reason he beat the dog to death was because he believed the dog was getting in his chickens and he placed foot traps around his chicken coops.” Court records show Davis, Jr. is out on bail. WDBJ7 has reached out to the Carroll County Commonwealth’s Attorney to clarify why the animal cruelty charge is a misdemeanor and the animal larceny charge is a felony. We have not heard back yet.
