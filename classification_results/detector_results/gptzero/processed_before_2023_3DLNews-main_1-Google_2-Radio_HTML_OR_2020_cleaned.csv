chaos. Instead of blowing up into fine fragments, the corpse rained back down in large chunks. While a car was crushed, no one was hurt, fortunately. KLCC’s Brian Bull talked to former KATU-TV reporter Paul Linnman, who covered the bizarre fish tale - and for a while, found himself wishing it away. Linnman related to Bull how he got the assignment back in 1970. Linnman: My problem was, I didn’t want to cover the story to begin with. I was a young reporter, I was 23 years old. By that time I’d already covered a presidential primary in Oregon, I covered an all-night negotiation, when the Oregon State Penitentiary was on fire when the inmates took it over in a riot. And having a great time early in my career. And then the news director called me in and said, “Why don’t you go to the coast today and cover the story.” And I said, “What are you talking about?” He said, “Well, they’re going to dispose a whale down there.” “And I said, “Eh…can somebody else do that?” (laughs) He said “They’re going to use dynamite,” I said, “When do I go? (laughs) They put us on a private aircraft that the station had leased and l had never heard of that happening before. So I figured it was a pretty big deal. CLIP FROM ORIGINAL NEWS REPORT: “It had to be said, the Oregon State Highway Division not only had a whale of a problem on its hands, it had a stinking whale of a problem.” And so when we got down there, sure enough it took place much as we expected it would, and the explosion if you’ve seen it before, and you probably have, it looks like any explosion you see in the movies and so forth. CLIP: BOOM!! (cheers, whoops) And so that part of it was expected. What wasn’t expected was that it would blow whale parts all over everybody that was there. Then it became kinda scary, there was a feeling on the part of myself and the photographer Doug Brazil, that were at one point running for our lives as this very dense material hit the ground all around us. Up until to that moment it went as planned (laughs). And to this day I refer to it as the whale that refuses to die. Because it’s been a part of my life virtually every day in the last 50 years. Somebody’s mentioned it to me one way or another. Bull: By the way, you talk about being a reporter at 23 and you’d already done these very remarkable stories. At the same time many reporters feel that they are going to be remembered for one story, for better or worse. Do you feel like you’re branded with this whale story? Linnman: I suppose in certain ways I am. I’ve got to tell you, Brian, I’ve gone up and down with how I feel about the whale through the years. There were times 10-15 -20 years ago, where I just assumed it not be ever mentioned to me again. I was really, really tired of it. But then I got over that, and I kind of accepted what was going to continue to happen in my life as a result of that one story, and my bottom line conclusion is…most of us, even reporters who do very good work, are not remembered at all. So if you’re remembered for anything, that’s a pretty good deal. Mine is a kind of a silly remembrance, but I’ll take it (both laugh) Bull: This Spring, the City of Florence actually announced a new namesake for one of its city parks. As it turns out, it’s being called as “Exploding Whale Memorial Park.” I was curious if you’d been out there or not. Linnman: I have not, my wife and I were asked to be Grand Marshals of the Rhododendron Festival Parade in May. That was canceled. We did a virtual parade and sent down some video. And then when they announced the name of the new park, which is along the river by the way and it’s nowhere near the explosion site on the beach.

Bull: No, I had not heard about that (laughs). That’s amazing. It certainly still has a life of its own, and I’m guessing Paul, when you and I have both left this earth, 50 more years from now, that they’ll still be talking about it.
