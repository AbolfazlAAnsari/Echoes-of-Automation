Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:31 pm The NTSB said four bolts on the Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft\'s faulty panel were missing Four of the bolts securing the panel of a Boeing 737 MAX 9 Alaska Airlines jet that blew off mid-flight last month were missing, according to a preliminary investigation published Tuesday. The National Transportation Safety Board\'s initial report into the January 5 incident said the lack of damage or deformation around the holes ""indicate that the four bolts that prevent upward movement of the (door) plug were missing before the plug moved upward off the stop pads."" The agency has collected written documents and photos showing that Boeing employees removed four bolts from these locations during an inspection at the Renton plant in Washington State prior to delivery of the aircraft last October. That operation had been carried out to replace five damaged rivets in the cabin of the aircraft. Other photos taken after the rivets had been replaced show that at least three of the bolts had not been reinstalled. This door plug was used to block an exit that was not intended to be used, as the model already has enough emergency exits in this configuration. On 5 January, the panel flew off mid-flight after the Alaska Airlines MAX 9 took off from Portland, Oregon bound for Ontario in California. The incident caused only minor injuries. Alaska Airlines reported finding ""loose equipment"" following its own preliminary inspections. United Airlines, which owns the largest fleet of 737 MAX 9s at 79 aircraft, said it had discovered ""bolts that needed additional tightening"" during checks. In recent months, Boeing aircraft have experienced a series of problems and the US-based company has had to slow its deliveries as a result. At a congressional hearing Tuesday, the new Federal Aviation Administration chief, Michael Whitaker, said it was necessary to step up oversight of Boeing following the Alaska Airlines incident. ""There have been issues (with Boeing) in the past, and they don\'t seem to be getting resolved,"" he told a hearing of the House of Representatives subcommittee on aviation. ""So we feel like we need to have a heightened level of oversight to really get after that,"" he added. tu/da/mlm Originally published on doc.afp.com, part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange.

Ronnie Rondem. From left, Kathy Hoffman, Dan Anderson, Cye Roodehchi, Charles Feyt, Jay Walsh, Jack Walsh, Janette Walsh, Georgina Farris and Don Hoffman worked with Milton Veteran Memorial Markers to make the tribute happen. MILTON, Ga. — After a years-long battle with cancer, retired Col. Ronnie Bjarne Rondem passed away in early January with his wife, Julie, by his side. He was 80. When Providence Lake Homeowners Association President Don Hoffman heard that Rondem was ill, he sprung the community into action. Through the support group, Helping Hands, the Providence Lake community built a schedule to deliver meals to Rondem and his wife. “Ronnie Rondem was a longtime and active member of the Providence Lake community here in Milton,” Hoffman said. “Unfortunately, after just a few days of delivering meals to them, Ronnie passed away.” With the help of Bill Lusk, founder of Milton Veterans Memorial Markers, Hoffman organized a neighborhood effort to display American flags in honor and recognition of Rondem’s life and service. Hofman, Lusk and other community volunteers lined the streets of Providence Lake with nearly 1,000 American flags Jan. 29. Visitation and funeral services were held at the Northside Chapel on Crabapple Road Jan. 30-31. A military honors service Jan. 31 at the Georgia National Ceremony near Canton followed. Lusk said he first met Rondem more than 20 years ago through the Atlanta Vietnam Veterans Business Association. The two men remained close friends through their work growing the Milton Veterans Memorial Markers. “I miss him, he was a true American patriot and a hero,” Lusk said. “The United States was his adopted home, and he loved the United States and the U.S. Army.” Col. Ronnie Rondem was born in 1943 to a Norwegian family in Oslo. When he was just 12 years old, he immigrated with his parents and older sister to Brooklyn, New York. In a 2010 interview with the Atlanta History Center, Rondem said he only knew two phrases when he arrived in the United States, “good night” and “just one moment, please.” As an elementary school student, Rondem said he was instructed to say the phrase when he answered the phone for his parents. With the help of his older sister, Rondem quickly learned English by translating “War and Peace” by Leo Tolstoy. Rondem and his family moved to New Jersey and then New Hampshire, where he graduated from high school. Before reaching the most senior field-grade military officer rank, Rondem served as a medic and then completed the Army’s Officer Candidate School. He served as a platoon leader with the 196th Light Infantry Brigade on his first tour in Vietnam. Between his two tours in Vietnam, Col. Rondem commanded a unit at Fort Carson, Colorado, that was deployed twice to Chicago in 1968, following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and during protests at the Democratic National Convention. When Col. Rondem returned to Vietnam for his second tour, he was assigned to the 101st Airborne Division. His numerous decorations include the Silver Star, Legion of Merit with an oak leaf cluster, Bronze Star, Meritorious Service Medal with four oak leaf clusters, Air Medal and Army Commendation Medal. He also was awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge and the Parachutist Badge. Col. Rondem left active duty in 1972, completed his bachelor’s degree from the University of Texas at Arlington in 1973 and worked in human resource positions in the oil and gas industry. He was inducted into the Infantry Officer Candidate Hall of Honor in 1992. Col. Rondem served in the Texas National Guard and U.S. Army Reserves before he retired in 1996. In 2000, Rondem retired from Colonial Pipeline Company in Atlanta. From left, Bill Lusk and the late Ronnie Rondem discuss the history of Milton Veterans Memorial Markers at Old Blind Dog Irish Pub in 2021. Both veterans co-founded the nonprofit in 2015. When Milton incorporated in 2006, Bill Lusk won a seat on the first City Council. His idea for creating an identity for the new city was to honor veterans. Lusk began the tradition in 2007 of placing memorial markers along roadways to promote patriotism, instill pride in the city and recognize deceased veterans. Lusk handcrafted the markers with materials he purchased, completing 50 in the first year. By the fourth year, Lusk said Rondem and others joined to assist him with the markers. While all markers are designed and built by Lusk, he said Rondem’s effort to begin accepting donations from the community grew the capabilities of the veterans’ group. Spurred by Rondem’s idea to see the organization funded through donations, Milton Veterans Memorial Markers officially became a nonprofit shortly after it formed a board of directors in 2013. Lusk said Rondem served on the Board of Directors until he became too ill 18 months ago. Lusk said the organization will place 850 memorial markers on Ga. 9 and in the Crabapple area for Memorial Day and Veterans Day this year. Each marker comes with a flag. The organization is expanding its reach this year to include the Providence Lake community. A post on the organization’s Facebook page Jan. 28 sent condolences to Col. Rondem’s wife and three children, Monika, Jeanette and Christopher. “Ronnie was a ‘Giant,’ and while he will be missed, his legacy will always be weaved within the fabric of our Milton community,” the post read. “Ronnie certainly made his mark here and beyond — Godspeed to our brother and dear friend.” All of us here at Appen Media want to know, and try to help answer, the questions you have about our community.

The Department of Family and Children Services (DFCS) is seeing an increased need for foster homes in both Polk and Haralson Counties. We are searching for individuals who can provide a safe, nurturing environment for a child. Children who enter foster care aren’t there because they did something wrong. Foster care is intended to be temporary while the agency is committed to ensuring the safety and well being of children who experience out of home placements due to safety threats in their own home. To fulfill this commitment, DFCS recruits and works closely with relatives and members of the community who are interested in serving as temporary caregivers and adoptive parents for children in foster care. If you would like more information on becoming a foster/adoptive parent, please call 877-210-KIDS.

drove a new wave of COVID-19 infections across the United States in early January, including in Arizona, where state data indicated a rise in those experiencing symptoms of respiratory illnesses like the flu and RSV. The “tripledemic” is how physicians and medical providers nicknamed all three viruses\' seasonal surge. Numbers published by the Arizona Department of Health Services show a slowing in Influenza and RSV activity, though they remain higher than the average for the last five seasons for the week ending Jan. 27. AZDHS data also indicates that coronavirus infections have stabilized, remaining below the average of the last three seasons. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\'s latest county snapshot categorizes overall respiratory illness activity in Arizona as ""moderate."" Though case numbers have trended downwards, the winter season can still drive more infections of respiratory illnesses. Here are a couple of things to know about the CDC\'s latest COVID-19 guidelines and how to avoid getting infected during the “tripledemic”: If you start to experience symptoms, which include shortness of breath and fever, among others, or you know you have been exposed to COVID, you should get a test. At-home tests have become the quickest way to determine whether an individual has been infected with COVID-19. They are sold at drugstores like CVS, Walgreens, Fry\'s and other retailers. Individuals can also order free test kits and receive them in the mail from the federal government at www.covid.gov. These sorts of tests are Antigen tests that involve swabbing the inside of the nostril and then placing the swab in a liquid solution which is used on a test strip. Individuals can see results in approximately 20 minutes. The CDC published recommendations for what to do if you have COVID-19 in May 2023. A blog post on their website lists four points: Protect yourself and others if you have COVID-19, stay at home for at least 5 days, wear a mask around other people for 10 days and get medicine if you think you might get very sick. The CDC clarifies that you should call your doctor as soon as you know you are sick with COVID-19.

More: 5 things Arizonans should know about new COVID vaccines (and they\'re not called boosters) RSV, or Respiratory Syncytial Virus, is identified as a common respiratory virus by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RSV is an illness that most people can recover from in a week or two. However, depending on underlying conditions and other factors in an individual\'s health, RSV can be serious. Symptoms for RSV show up within four to six days of getting infected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have identified these symptoms tied to RSV: Runny nose, decrease in appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever and wheezing. The CDC adds that the symptoms do not appear all at once but in stages. More severe infections can cause bronchiolitis, an inflammation of the small airways in the lung, pneumonia, and an infection of the lungs. In May 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Arexvy, the first RSV vaccine for use in the United States. The vaccine manufactured by GSK plc, a British pharmaceutical company, is intended for individuals 60 and older to help prevent lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by RSV. Since then, the FDA has approved a second vaccine, the first intended for pregnant individuals to prevent RSV in infants. Pfizer’s Abrysvo is indicated for individuals at 32 through 36 weeks of gestational age to prevent LRTD in infants from birth to 6 months of age. Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness that most individuals know as the flu. Aside from the typical runny nose and sore throat, infected individuals can display symptoms like fevers, body aches, fatigue and headaches. The flu virus spreads through droplets, as described by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Most experts believe that flu viruses spread mainly by tiny droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze, or talk,” as a blog post details on the CDC website. If you are sick with the flu, it is good to know that individuals are most contagious in the first 3-4 days after the illness begins.

A broken septic tank lid and promise from the seller to provide a new septic system before closing appeared to have solved the issue. Then record rains came in January and before the new system could be installed. The fifty-year-old septic system failed. Even with the new septic system, Moore says heavy rains result in more failure. She came before the Colbert City Council on Monday for the third time in two years asking for help. Moore claimed the septic issues stem from stormwater runoff at Project Street. This time the council laid out a plan. After consulting with Moore before the meeting, the council determined to contract with Jason Smith to install a culvert on Project Street which would extend to North Fourth Street and continue down the street to divert runoff. Culverts on North Fourth Street will be replaced and ditches will be cleared of debris. The council told her they would wait to start the project until the ground dries from heavy rains, a survey could be completed to determine the right of way, and impacted homeowners sign a release for work on their property. Council member Michelle Cole recently said this project was already next on the city’s list of drainage projects. In addition, council member Chris Peck told the audience that he’d heard around 10 homes in the city had their septic systems impacted with the record rains in January this year. After the meeting Moore said, “I am convinced that the city officials really do care about my circumstances and I want to share that they are truly trying to help me.” Log In Keep it Clean.

This strategic move ensures the continued operation and clean energy generation at these facilities for the state’s regulated utility provider. The solar power plants are located in Stephens County and Chattooga County. The acquisition of these operating solar power plants expands Cherry Street Energy’s capabilities in the markets it serves. The company currently owns, operates, and maintains over 100 solar power systems across the Southeast, providing competitively-priced electricity to customers such as Porsche Cars North America, Gulfstream Aerospace, and the City of Atlanta. “Continuing to expand our portfolio of operating capacity in our home state of Georgia allows us to further support the system with reliable, renewable power,” said Michael Chanin, CEO of Cherry Street Energy. “These acquisitions enable us to expand our portfolio of solar and battery storage assets, which power the growing demand for clean, reliable, and affordable electricity.

These reliability and resiliency upgrades will occur alongside existing solar power plants, which makes economic sense and enhances our ability to serve the system with predictable capacity.” Chanin said.

Periods of rain. Low 64F. Winds SE at 5 to 10 mph. Chance of rain 60%. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:41 pm Note from David Carroll: This week marks the 10th anniversary of my newspaper column. It all started with one paper, the North Jackson Progress in Stevenson, Alabama, and now, here I am: the slowest rising columnist in America! To mark this momentous occasion, here is the first column I ever published. For those of us in the news business, it’s a busy time of year: winter. You know the drill: reporters on every mountain, endless video of salt spreaders and pothole patchers, and wise old news anchors reminding you to protect your pipes. But by far the most cherished tradition is the school-closing list. I asked some older friends about school closings in the pre-broadcast days. How did they get the word out? One former principal said, “We didn’t close much. Most of the schools were in neighborhoods. Some kids had to walk a mile or two, but if we had heat, we had school. If we didn’t, the kids would turn around and walk home.” But eventually, schools started closing, and superintendents learned the quickest way to spread the news was to call radio stations. The deejays took nonstop phone calls, with school officials trying to get through. At the same time, kids were calling to ask if their school was closed. The radio guy would compile an alphabetical list, meaning the students of Walker and Whitfield counties would have to sit tight as he waded through the Andersons, the Bradleys, and the Cobbs. When I got into radio, I learned the rules: be nice to the callers, read the closings on-air frequently, and make sure no one was tricking us. Sometimes a bold 6th grader would call in, trying to lower his voice, and say, “This is Superintendent Elliott from Dade County. All schools is closed today.” I’d say, “Uh, really, Mr. Elliott? I’m a little busy right now, could I have your phone number? I will call you right back.” (Pause) “Click!” Busted. We had to be careful in the days before Caller ID. Later, TV got into the act. The expansion of local morning newscasts provided more time to show the school closings list. It also inspired a few pranksters. One morning a guy called my channel, asking us to add “Anthony’s House of Cheese” to the list. A producer, flooded with legitimate calls, dutifully took down the information and entered it into the computerized list. For several hours, at the very top of the business closing list, was “Anthony’s House of Cheese.” We later realized there was no such place. But all day, some guy was laughing as he watched this go out to thousands of people. We tightened up after that. Although to be honest, if someone ever opens a House of Cheese, I would be most appreciative. Since those days, Facebook has become a popular source of information. When the first snowflake falls, people flock to my station’s Facebook page for updated school closings. As the School Patrol reporter, I pitch in to post the latest information. But no matter how clear we try to be, there are constant misunderstandings. We’ve learned that many people confuse Chattooga County in northwest Georgia with “Chattanooga” County in Tennessee, which does not exist. Unfortunately, not everyone is aware of that. So I have a plan. One day, perhaps my final day on the job, if it’s really, really snowy, and truly every single school is closed, I would like to issue this statement: “We are announcing with 100% certainty, that EVERY SINGLE SCHOOL in the universe will be closed today. This includes all schools in every city, every town, every county, public, private, boarding, religious, home, charter, technical, elementary, middle, high, colleges, junior colleges, universities, online, virtual, vocational, medical, dental, barber, beauty, business, GED, adult, preschool, pre-K, kindergarten, nursery, driving school, Sunday School, Vacation Bible School, and even schools of fish. Every one of them, in every state, in every commonwealth, in every nation, on every continent, on every planet will be closed today. There are no exceptions. Enjoy your day off, everyone!” Within a few seconds, I guarantee my phone would ring.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:16 pm Mike Dugan CARROLLTON — Army veteran and conservative businessman Mike Dugan has announced plans to step down as state Senator for the 30th District of Georgia to run for U.S. Congress in Georgia’s 3rd Congressional District. This follows Rep. Drew Ferguson’s recent announcement that he will not seek re-election. “I am proud of the service and successful track record I have been able to provide for my constituents over the last decade serving in the Georgia State Senate,” Dugan said in a news release. “I was dedicated in delivering steadfast results for economic development, public safety and education, as well as championing legislation that best serves and cares for our military — active duty, veterans and their families. I look forward to putting my experience to work on a larger scale for Georgia in the U.S Congress.” Javascript is required for you to be able to read premium content.

In a statement released last week, Raffensperger said getting rid of runoffs following the November elections would give Georgians a holiday-season pause from politics. “Next year, there will be a contentious presidential election – and families across Georgia will be settling down for the holidays shortly after,” he said. “Let’s give them a break and take another costly and unnecessary election off the Thanksgiving table. I’m calling on the General Assembly to visit this topic next session and eliminate this outdated distraction.” Raffensperger raised the issue of runoffs last December after incumbent U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., defeated Republican challenger Herschel Walker in a runoff. However, it didn’t gain any traction during this year’s legislative session. While some second-place finishers in general elections have gone on to turn the tables and win runoffs, Warnock finished first in both the 2022 general election and runoff, lending credence to the argument that general election runoffs are an unnecessary waste of tax dollars. Georgia lawmakers have made changes to the vote threshold general election candidates must meet to avoid runoffs since 1968, when voters approved a constitutional amendment requiring the governor’s race to go to a runoff if none of the candidates received a majority of votes in the general election. After Democratic incumbent Sen. Wyche Fowler lost to Republican challenger Paul Coverdell in a 1992 runoff, the General Assembly’s then-Democratic majority reduced the 50%-plus-one vote requirement to avoid a runoff to 45%. That worked out for the Democrats four years later when the late Max Cleland won the seat of retiring Sen. Sam Nunn with more than 45% of the vote but less than 50%. Republicans responded to that 1996 loss when the GOP won control of the legislature in 2004. During their first legislative session in power, Republicans changed the requirement back to the 50%-plus-one threshold. Georgia and Louisiana are the only two states that feature general election runoffs. A handful of other states – mostly in the South – limit runoffs to primary elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the vote.'}]"

Jacorey Derrelle Pearson A Newnan man faces several charges after allegedly driving recklessly with unrestrained children in the car. Jacorey Derrelle Pearson, 34, is charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, driving on a suspended license, reckless driving, marijuana possession (misdemeanor), narcotics possession, child restraint violation, stop sign violation and going inside a guard line with weapon/ liquor/ drugs. The incident occurred around 4 p.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 6, when police reported seeing a car run a stop sign at the corner of Lovelace and Pratt at a high rate of speed. After pursuing the vehicle, police located the car on the side of the road, and the driver, identified as Pearson, was located in the back seat, along with five unrestrained children, ranging from ages 6 months to 9 years old, authorities said. Pearson alleged to police he had been in the back seat the entire time. During a search of the car, police reportedly located a small bag of marijuana and a firearm. Pearson was arrested and transported to the Coweta County Jail where, during booking, investigators allegedly located cocaine on his person.

February 7, 2024 By Wayne Clark LANETT — Members of the Lanett City Council met in a Monday afternoon work session to receive input from a newly organized airport committee. Members of that committee recently made a trip to Prattville to see how a medium-sized city runs its airport. Discussing that visit with the council were Chambers County Development Authority (CCDA) Executive Director Chris Busby, Bill Scott, Mike Ballard and Dan DeJournette. Also making the trip was Council Member Tifton Dobbs. The council is trying to decide whether to have an airport manager run the airport, have an airport authority doing that or contract it out to what’s known as a fixed base operator, or FBO. Richard Carter served as the manager in 2023 but resigned to take a job with the Clayton County, Georgia Police Department. He took that job because it gave him ample opportunities to fly a plane or helicopter, and flying is his first love. He is staying on with the airport on a part-time basis until the council decides how it’s to be run in the future. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires that someone be at an airport on a regular basis to check on fuel, to see if the runway lights are working properly, meet with pilots who land and so on. Bill Scott told the council that the committee went to Prattville last Friday and were most impressed with what they saw. “We met twice before the trip,” he said. “We are fortunate to have Lanett airport. It’s one of the best around this region. In our meetings we discussed the opportunities it presents and the problems that need to be overcome. There are some short-term problems that that could be dealt with over a few weeks or months. It could take longer to put things in place to do it the right way. We must be sure we are meeting the requirements of the FAA and the Alabama Department of Transportation.” Scott said there’s an immediate need to make sure someone is overlooking operations on a daily basis. Safety should always be the top priority with any airport, Scott said. This involves making sure local fire departments have been adequately trained in knowing how to deal with an aviation-related accident. “We need to encourage them to do that,” he said. Scott added said a long-term goal concerns whether the airport should be run by a city department or to have an airport authority. There’s also a need to market what’s there in the way of a regional airport. It would be a good idea, for example, to have some signs on I-85 getting it across that there’s an airport at the next exit. “If done right, this airport will have long-term benefits for our local economy,” Scott said. “It will help create jobs and generate business activity with corporate planes coming in. There could be some bad consequences if we don’t act quickly. The airport is a great asset, but there are liabilities. It’s a great thing for the community, but we could be one accident away from people being hurt or killed.” That could mean massive lawsuits against the city and the FAA closing the airport. “It would be very embarrassing for something like that to happen,” Scott said. Close to $20 million has been invested in the development of Lanett Regional. A 3,100-foot runway was closed in favor of building a new one that’s more than a mile in length. There’s a nice new terminal in place that’s now serving as the office for the CCDA. Improvements are continuing for the taxiway and apron. Scott emphasized the importance of doing this the right way. “I have lived in Lanett for 25 years,” he said. “I know how important it is to seek grants for projects like a new city park. If we mess this up it will make it harder to get grants for any project.” Councilman Dobbs said that last Friday’s trip had been eyeopening for him. “It was educational,” he said. “I have a new perspective on having a city FBO or a contracted one. The impression I got in Prattville is that an authority is the best way to go. City officials aren’t that concerned with making money off their airport. They just want to make sure a contracted FBO is running it properly.” Dobbs said that Prattville had done great work in promoting its airport and getting the public involved with such events as an egg drop from a helicopter at Easter and having Santa Claus arrive by plane during he Christmas season. This draws big crowds and has everyone excited about what’s going on. Dobbs said he wasn’t opposed to having a contracted FBO but that they should be an advisory board governing operations. That board, he said, should have at least one member of the council. “We were wonderfully received in Prattville,” said Mike Ballard. “I saw some good things on how they were involving the community with their airport. From that I could see what a great opportunity we have to have a better place to live and work by making the most of this airport. We need to involve people in all walks of life. They have done a great job of that in Prattville.” There are two training schools operating out of the Prattville airport, and there’s lots of touch-and-go sessions with pilots learning to take off and land. The committee will soon visit the airport in Cullman, Alabama. “It’s going to be hard to beat what we saw in Prattville,” Ballard said. DeJournette said that Lanett airport can be the catalyst for future growth for not just Lanett but also for Valley, West Point and the entire local area. He suggested making a stronger effort to promote Lanett Regional on social media to engage youth on the opportunities provided at the airport. Southern Union State Community College, for example, is starting an aviation program. This could lead to careers in the field of aviation. “The airport can be a way of getting our young people to have a role in moving the city forward,” DeJournette said. “We can reach people in so many ways with the airport.” Council Member Tony Malone said the city needs to “get its ducks in a row” in making the right decisions and in promoting the airport. “We need a safety program in place,” he said. “We need an airport manager or an advisory board to run it for us.” The city is advertising for a manager to succeed Richard Carter. Mayor Heard said that three applications have come in thus far. Scott pointed out that an airport authority runs the airport in Prattville. “There’s lots of ways to set it up,” he said. “An authority sets up policies, the rules and provides oversight,” DeJournette said. “The FBO is responsible for compliance of the regulations. They have a public relations officer who comes up with ways of getting youth involved, corporate outreach and the like.” Chris Busby said that what needs to be done now all boils down to structure. “Will it be an authority or a city department?” he asked. “You can contract with an FBO or create one. Prattville created an FBO with local people who are devoting their time on behalf of the city. They won a competitive bid to do it. An FBO can be a national company, a regional one or can be done by local people. What’s important now is to have the structure under which they operate. Let’s determine that structure first.

Sponsored by: THE ROYAL BUFFET A senior Hezbollah official says the Lebanese militant group\'s intensified attacks along Israel’s northern border show Israeli leaders that an all-out war would be costly. Iran-backed Hezbollah militants launched dozens of rockets Friday, in a third day of retaliation for Israel\'s killing of a senior commander in an airstrike. The Israeli military said approximately 35 projectiles were identified Friday. Cross-border attacks by Israel and Hezbollah have been taking place almost daily since the war in Gaza began in October. The escalation comes as some Israeli leaders have threatened all-out war to silence Hezbollah’s rocket fire. Hezbollah also seeks to pressure Israel during the cease-fire negotiations in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas. The U.S.-led campaign against Iran-backed Houthi rebels has turned into the most intense running sea battle the Navy has faced since World War II. That\'s what its leaders and experts tell The Associated Press, whose journalists visited U.S. ships off Yemen in recent days. The fight against the near-daily attacks by the Houthis has been overshadowed by the Israel-Hamas war raging in Gaza. More than 50 vessels have been clearly targeted by the rebels. Other fire has endangered shipping through the vital Red Sea corridor. It appears the warfare likely only will intensify, putting the U.S. and allies more at risk. Yemen’s Houthi rebels have launched a boat-borne bomb attack against a commercial ship in the Red Sea, further escalating their campaign despite a U.S.-led campaign trying to protect the vital waterway. In a warning to shippers, the British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center described the vessel on Wednesday as being hit in its stern by a small white craft southwest of the Houthi-controlled port city of Hodeida. A Houthi military spokesman later claimed the attack. He described the attack as using a “drone boat,” drones and ballistic missiles. The use of a boat loaded with explosives raises the specter of 2000’s USS Cole attack, a suicide assault by al-Qaida that killed 17 sailors on board. The Oklahoma Supreme Court has dismissed a lawsuit of the last two survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre who were seeking reparations. The nine-member court on Wednesday upheld the decision made by a district court judge in Tulsa last year. The suit was an attempt to force the city of Tulsa and others to make recompense for the destruction by a white mob of the once-thriving Black district known as Greenwood. The two survivors of the attack, who are both now over 100 years old, sued in 2020 with the hope of seeing what their attorney called “justice in their lifetime.” A third plaintiff, Hughes Van Ellis, died last year at age 102. The latest proposal for a cease-fire in Gaza has the support of the United States and most of the international community, but Hamas has not fully embraced it, and neither, it seems, has Israel.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday the negotiations will continue. But he said Hamas had requested “numerous” changes, adding that “some of the changes are workable; some are not."" Voting on reservations across the country has historically been exceedingly difficult, with tribal voters sometimes having to travel long distances to their polling place or facing barriers because they don’t have a physical address. In Nevada, the state has now granted tribes a new right that advocates hope will greatly expand voting access — the ability to cast ballots electronically. But what some see as a small measure of justice to equalize voting rights for a people long disenfranchised raises security concerns for others, with potential implications far beyond Nevada’s 28 tribal communities. The French interior minister says French authorities in New Caledonia have regained full control of their Pacific territory’s capital after two weeks of unrest that left seven people dead. Gerald Darmanin said Friday in a post on X that ""a major police operation has taken place successfully” in the last area of Noumea that was under the protesters’ control. New Caledonia has had decades of tensions between those seeking independence and France loyalists. The violence flared on May 13 in response to attempts by the Paris government to amend the French Constitution and change voting lists in New Caledonia. France declared a state of emergency on May 15 and rushed in hundreds of troop reinforcements to help police. The jury in Donald Trump\'s criminal hush money trial has found the former president guilty of all 34 felony counts against him. They delivered their verdict late Thursday afternoon after two days of deliberations that spanned 9 1/2 hours. Prosecutors accused Trump of falsifying internal business records to cover up hush money payments tied to an alleged scheme to bury stories that might torpedo his 2016 White House bid. He has denied any wrongdoing and had pleaded not guilty to all 34 counts of falsifying business records. Trump sat stone-faced with his eyes looking down as the verdict finished being read. For hundreds of Russian soldiers taken prisoner, phone calls home can offer a bit of comfort and hope. It\'s a lifeline unavailable to Ukrainian POWs, whose families have gone without hearing their voices. Now, Ukrainian families of POWs are demanding an end to the calls to Russia. They\'re appealing a decision to block a petition that got more than 25,000 signatures. The families’ anger and the petition rejection come amid widespread reports of systematic mistreatment of Ukrainians in Russian captivity. Ukraine has regularly opened its main POW camp to the Red Cross, the U.N. and journalists. The Associated Press recently visited the western Ukraine site.

the year has finally come. Around the country, students are getting ready to sit down with their families to talk about financial aid and fill out their Free Application for Federal Student Aid or FAFSA. The FAFSA is an online application that students in the U.S. use to apply for federal student aid. The form determines a student’s eligibility for grants, loans and scholarships to help pay for college. In previous years, students could fill out the FAFSA during the first week of October. This year, however, the release was delayed to make way for a new simplified version predicted to be available in early December. That release date ended up being delayed by almost a month, becoming available on January 3rd. The form and all its changes are now available for students to complete and submit. The official deadline to submit the form for the 2024-2025 school year is June 30th, with corrections being able to be made until September 14th, 2025. Students are encouraged by the Office of Education and the state of Georgia to submit their FAFSAs as soon as possible. The most notable change in the new FAFSA is the decrease in questions. The overall number of questions has decreased from approximately 108 to just 36. The updated version excludes two “roadblock questions” that played crucial roles in determining eligibility for federal aid. The FAFSA will no longer ask students to register for Selective Services or if a student has had any prior drug-related convictions. The term “contributor” is another new addition introduced in this year’s FAFSA. A contributor refers to anyone providing information on a student’s FAFSA form. Contributors are determined by a student’s dependency, tax filing and marital status. Contributors can be a student, parent or spouse. Applicants and their contributors must have their own StudentAid.gov accounts to complete the FAFSA. There is also a new process for submitting information needed for the FAFSA. This year, federal tax information will be transferred directly from the IRS into the form. Contributors will have to grant consent to this transfer when applying online. If students do not receive consent, they will be ineligible for student aid. When it comes to how student financial aid is calculated and awarded, two big changes are being made. Firstly, the Estimated Family Contribution is replaced by a new variable, the Student Aid Index. The SAI is similar to the EFC and is used to gauge someone’s need for financial aid compared to other students. This change is more than a simple rebranding, however. The SAI uses a different formula for its calculation and could potentially affect the amount of aid students receive. The second and largest change to how financial aid is calculated is the exclusion of the “sibling discount.” In the past, FAFSA determined aid eligibility by dividing the EFC among household members in college. With the removal of the EFC, this “sibling discount” no longer plays a role in calculating financial aid amounts. This change marks a significant change in aid eligibility for some. Under the new SAI, students with siblings in college will potentially have changes in their aid eligibility and the aid received by their siblings.With these new updates to the FAFSA, students must prepare for potential changes to their financial aid. While some students will receive more aid through these new SAI calculations, others may receive less. The sooner students complete their FAFSA, the earlier they’ll know the amount of their financial aid amount. More information on these changes can be found on the Student Financial Management Center’s website. https://sfs.gsu.edu/fafsa-tips/. Copyright © 2024 | Georgia State Signal | By Daniel Varitek'}]"

She puts what is truly important first, and focuses her instruction on life skills and exposure so that students who leave her class are ready to take on the world,” he continued. Gerrells specifically noted that Stroud creates learning opportunities for students that they might not get in other settings. “Her students are bakers, coffee makers, cashiers, accountants, mail people and more,” he said. Stroud explained that with a grant from the Lumpkin County Education Foundation and the assistance of Striker Marketing and local photographer Austin Martin, they have been able to create a unique enterprise for her students. “Last year we got a grant to start a coffee cart business called Javability. We sell several items to the faculty on Fridays and get to work various events. We even got to work an event where we served coffee to the state superintendent, Richard Woods,” Stroud said. Stroud is on a mission to show how much people with special needs have to offer. “I feel like it’s my job to give my students opportunity to show others what they can do. So I really, really focus on their strengths and building up their confidence, and other stuff will come once they’ve bought in. They can do so much more than I think they even know, and so it’s awesome seeing them get more confident and want to learn more things,” she said. FAMILY TIME Stroud said her favorite thing to do in her free time is to spend time with her loved ones. “Family, since I’ve been little, has always been the most important thing,” she said. Stroud’s husband Zack teaches and coaches football at the neighboring high school. “We’ve been very busy this year with that, because the season turned out much longer than we even thought it could be,” she said with a smile. Stroud said she and her husband also share a terrier mix named Bailey “that’s pretty much like our daughter.” CHANGING ATTITUDES Gerrells said Stroud has an authentic passion for advancing the interests of special students. “She educates her peers, other students, and even myself on how to be more inclusive and makes our school better for everyone with disabilities,” he said. And Stroud said she has been pleasantly surprised at the positive reception to her efforts. “Everyone has bought in here so much, supporting us at our coffee cart or our school spirit shop, so our kids can participate in other activities throughout the school,” she said. “I cannot say enough good things about how supportive our faculty and staff is.” Stroud said it’s a positive sign that both she and LCHS teacher Luke Maloney were both honored for their special education work this year. “For our programs to get so much visibility and recognition and the kids’ hard work to be recognized is amazing, and it’s just a testament to the culture that we’ve been able to create for our kids here,” she said. Stroud was insistent that the honor really belongs to her students. “They’re the ones who are doing all the hard work. I’m just the representative of it, I guess.” This is the final article in a Nugget School Spotlight series highlighting the recently named Teachers of the Year. We would like to thank system-wide winner Liz Stroud for everything she has done for Lumpkin County’s students. Read The Dahlonega Nugget, Dahlonega, GA The Dahlonega Nugget Mailing Address: P.O.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:31 pm Palaeohypotodus bizzocoi tooth. (McWane Science Center via SWNS) By Stephen Beech via SWNS A new species of shark that was one of the ocean’s top predators following the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago has been discovered in the United States. The fossilized teeth were found 100 years ago in Alabama but had remained hidden in a box in a collection until they were re-examined. The shark is a new species of Palaeohypotodus - which means “ancient small-eared tooth” - in reference to the small needle-like fangs present on the sides of the teeth. It has been named Palaeohypotodus bizzocoi, in honor of the late Dr. Bruce Bizzoco who served as a Dean at Shelton State Community College, for his lifelong commitments to education and the preservation of Alabama’s history. Research team leader Jun Ebersole, Director of Collections at McWane Science Centre in Birmingham, Alabama, explained that the discovery of the shark was accidental. The late Dr. Bruce Bizzoco (1949-2022), for whom the new species is named. (McWane Science Center via SWNS) He said: “A few years ago, I was looking through the historical fossil collections at the Geological Survey in Alabama and came across a small box of shark teeth that were collected over 100 years ago in Wilcox County. “Having documented hundreds of fossil ï¬\x81sh species over the last decade, I found it puzzling that these teeth were from a shark that I didn’t recognize.” He quickly realized that the teeth belonged to a new species. David Cicimurri, Curator of Natural History at the South Carolina State Museum, said: “Perhaps one of the coolest aspects of this shark, is when it lived – the Paleocene, approximately 65 million years ago. ""This is the time period from just after the death of the dinosaurs, where over 75 percent of life on Earth went extinct.” He says the shark was a leading predator during the time when the oceans were recovering. In Alabama, much of the southern half of the state was covered by a shallow tropical to sub-tropical ocean during the Paleocene. Palaeohypotodus bizzocoi teeth. (Ebersole et al. via SWNS) Lynn Harrell, Paleontologist and Fossil Collections Curator at the Geological Survey of Alabama said: “This time period is understudied, which makes the discovery of this new shark species that much more signiï¬\x81cant. “Shark discoveries like this one give us tremendous insights into how ocean life recovers after major extinction events and also allow us to potentially forecast how global events, like climate change, affect marine life today."" As part of their study, the team compared the fossil teeth to those of various shark species living today. Cicimurri explained that shark teeth diï¬\x80er in shape, depending on where they are located in the mouth. He added: “By studying the jaws and teeth of living sharks, it allowed us to reconstruct the dentition of this ancient species and showed that it had a tooth arrangement that diï¬\x80ered from any living shark."" The team has now conï¬\x81rmed more than 400 unique species of fossil sharks and bony ï¬\x81shes which, according to Mr Ebersole, makes Alabama one of the richest places in the world in terms of fossil ï¬\x81sh diversity. The findings were published in the journal Fossil Record. Originally published on talker.news, part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:25 pm Last Friday on February 2, Punxsutawney Phil predicted spring was right around the corner since the groundhog (or woodchuck) did not see its shadow. Groundhog Day has been celebrated since 1887, and the 137-year long celebration takes place at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Each year, thousands tune into the showing - whether for entertainment or true belief - to hear each year’s prediction. Many Charlton Countians will be pleased to hear that warmer weather will come sooner rather than later - if you believe Groundhog’s Day predictions to be true. Locally, the county has experienced rapid changes in temperature and precipitation throughout the winter months. So just maybe, locals may see a change in seasons should Punxsutawney Phil’s prove true. The day’s origin is even more interesting than its folklore. According to the Library of Congress, Groundhog’s Day is celebrated in various places such as the United States and Canada. The folklore regarding Groundhog Day is rooted in European culture like German and Pennsylvania Dutch. Additionally, Groundhog Day is related to two other common holidays: Halloween and Mayday. The three celebrations all come from the same cycle of pre-Christian festivals, and are holidays that fall midway between a solstice and an equinox. The celebrations were seen as seasonal turning points. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular images. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

the Osceola Event Company inside the historic Osceola Hotel, was all about working together to make today just a little better than yesterday. That theme was echoed by the selfless actions of this year’s Citizen of the Year recipient, Steve Dickman. He was cited for his efforts to go above and beyond the call of duty of his job description, giving extra time and energy and helping to improve the conditions of Lake Seminole and make the lives of all Seminole County citizens just a little bit better. Dickman took action to engage lake stakeholders and governmental interests and join together to save Lake Seminole from further decline by controlling the lake’s invasive weeds. As a successful businessman, and with his experience as an engineer, he enlisted neighbors, and was the driving force in the formation of the Non-profit 501(c)(3) group Stewards of Lake Seminole, an organization created to preserve and enhance Lake Seminole as a valuable resource for all its stakeholders. Dickman commented, “I am totally surprised, honored and humbled by the award. So many people are involved in helping the Stewards of Lake Seminole affect a positive change for our lake and consequently our communities. Our team of officers, directors and volunteers share their time, knowledge and passion for the lake without reward. It is important to know that none of our efforts are possible without the support and partnership with the U.S.A.C.E. from the local ACF River Projects team to Colonel Jeremy Chapman in Mobile, AL. The Corps often gets a bad rap. Their activities are limited by their funding and that can only come from the Federal government. Congressman Bishop and his team have been, and continue to be, supportive of our efforts. As a result, the lake will benefit from an additional $500,000 funding to the Environmental Research and Development Center this year and a $1,080,000 for Lake Seminole is awaiting final budget approvals by the Senate and the President. Equally important is the work our State Representative Gerald Greene and State Senator Sam Watson have done to generate State funding to fight Cuban bulrush and other invasives. Recently our Seminole County Board of Commissioners approved funding for mechanical equipment to help reclaim and restore access to lost fisheries and wildlife habitat. Together, the support of our federal, state and local governments has been phenomenal, and this support is the direct result of our 254 sponsors who have personally invested in preserving and enhancing our lake and communities. It has been said, ‘It takes a community to raise a child.’ It also takes a community to save a lake. Lake Seminole is our ‘Golden Goose.’ Visit us a stewardsoflakeseminole.com” The evening, attended by almost 200 local citizens, began with some social networking time, comments from Congressman Sanford Bishop, and recognition of the students in this year’s Youth Leadership class. The dinner, which was catered by Gay’s Foods, was the enjoyed by all. The featured speaker for the event was Mary Beth Brownlee, former director of One Sumter and the current director of One Valdosta-Lowndes, an organization created to serve as a catalyst for growth and change. Brownlee spoke on the importance of teamwork and utilizing the individual talents of each person in the community to move forward more effectively. Pictured above are Farm Family of the Year, John, Haley, Beau and Caroline Hanna, Mark and Deanna Hanna and Hudson and Charlton Hanna Farm Family of the Year Following Brownlee’s presentation, Chamber President Sarah Avery recognized the outgoing and incoming Board of Directors.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:57 pm Managing Editor A 90-year-old Walton County man died from what appears to have been an accidental fire caused by his clothes igniting after working on a chainsaw. Walton County Fire Rescue Assistant Chief Craig League reported that at 11:19 a.m. on Thursday, Jan. 11, WCFR responded to a medical call on Navajo Trail. “Upon arrival it was determined that a 90-year-old man was deceased,” League said. “The cause of death appears to be from an accidental fire. The decedent had been working on a chainsaw and spilled gasoline on his clothing. The fumes from the gasoline ignited when he came close to a fire in his fireplace. The victim was able to extinguish the fire on his clothing, but not before sustaining severe burns.” League said the incident is still under investigation by the Walton County Fire Marshal’s office, the Walton County Sheriff’s office as well as the Walton coroner’s office. MOTORCYCLE WRECK, FIRE WCFR also responded last week to the scene of a fire involving a motorcycle crash on Hwy 20 at Rosebud Road. The motorcycle was fully involved. The driver of the motorcycle was not injured, however, officials said. Rosebud Road was closed while the fire was extinguished.

Current zoning conditions for this proposed development require that “the building be limited to no more than 10,000 square feet total,” according to county documents. Baker told commissioners in January that Next Step is looking to better serve a growing number of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The request was postponed again Feb. 6, to allow for more time for discussion.

Six people, including Baker and an attorney for the nonprofit, spoke Jan. 2 in favor of the request, citing the need for the organization to expand its services to continue to care for individuals and families in need. Three people at the public hearing opposed the request, saying that while they support the nonprofit, they have concerns about the size of the two-story building and parking lot in a rural area. Baker originally filed an application in April for the expansion, with plans for a building totaling 16,200 square feet. Commissioners held a public hearing in May, where neighbors and some commissioners expressed similar concerns. In June, the board allowed Baker to withdraw the request without prejudice. Next Step Ministries has been open for about 10 years, and operates out of a 4,600 square-foot two-story structure on the property.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:24 pm The Blackshear Times is a weekly community newspaper located in Blackshear and Pierce County, Ga. Issues are regularly published and placed on newsstands Tuesday and delivered to subscribers Wednesday, except when postal holidays alter the schedule. The Times\' news coverage focuses primarily on Pierce County, its cities and communities, as well as broader issues affecting its residents. Its circulation is approximately 3,600. The Blackshear Times is part of the Head Publishing family of newspapers, which also includes The Waycross Journal-Herald and The Brantley Beacon. Publisher and President respectively, husband and wife team Rick and Sandy Head were excited to acquire the newspaper where they both got their start, working under former editor and owner Robert M. Williams Jr. Shortly after taking ownership of The Blackshear Times, the paper was moved to its new location at 126 NW Central Avenue in historic downtown Blackshear, GA. Previously, Matt Gardner owned The Blackshear Times and served as the editor and publisher. He shepherded the publication through difficult times, including the Covid-19 outbreak, before selling to Head Publishing. Former editor and publisher Robert M. Williams Jr. bought into The Blackshear Times and Pierce County Publishing Company April 15, 1971, at age 20. In March 1976, Williams became sole editor and publisher when he bought out partners Roy Chalker Sr. and Wilkes Williams. Robert moved The Times into a building previously known as Oak View Pharmacy, located on the corner of Gordon Street and Carter Avenue. The building was constructed by the late Quinton Boyette as a pharmacy building for Kenneth and Katherine Henley. The Henleys purchased the land from the late Mack Carter. During that time, the early newspaper issues were produced by desktop publishing, wherein cold type is assembled into page and sent to off-set shops. The Times currently uses a computerized newsroom to produce its products. The newspaper operation moved to a new downtown location at 113 SW Central Avenue in 2003. The Times relocated two doors down to 121 SW Central Avenue in September 2012. The Times is centered between Main and Taylor Streets, facing railroad tracks running through the heart of Blackshear. Mr. Williams owns the company with his wife, Cheryl. Both of the Williamses have served as president of the Georgia Press Association. The name of Pierce County\'s weekly newspaper has been The Blackshear Times since October 10, 1889. Exactly who came up with the name is not known, although E.Z. Byrd stated in an editorial on April 17, 1902, that ""we presume it was Mr. B.D. Brantley, our present treasurer, who gave The Times its name."" The paper was being published by The Times Publishing Company. It was owned by The A.P. Brantley Company. On March 2, 1911 E.Z. Byrd, who had been owner of, or with, the county newspaper for 23 years, announced that he was selling The Times to Col. C.A. Sydnor. The Times would have eight owners over the next 15 years. Owners following Sydnor included H. (Harry) Johnsen, partners W.L. Knight and R.D. Thomas, W. Boyce Bailey, partners F.X. Ebner and G.M. Shepard, Jack Williams, W. Kirk Sutlive and Carl Broome. Carl Broome eventually sold the newspaper to sons Lee and Dean Broome. Dean became sole owner of The Times in 1958, after having managed and edited the paper for 12 years under his father and as co-owner and editor with his brother, Lee. Little change would occur in the operation after the takeover. On March 5, 1970, Dean Broome sold The Blackshear Times to Donald L. Ferrell. When Ferrell bought the newspaper, he was one of the triad known as the Pierce County Publishing Company. His partners were Roy Chalker Sr. and Wilkes Williams. Ferrell was president of the company.

Jack Kingston, left, talks with Advanced ATC executive vice president John P. Fisher in the air traffic control tower at Valdosta Regional Airport during a visit in 2014. The federal government has promised $3 million to help with replacing the Valdosta airport’s tower. VALDOSTA — The federal government announced Thursday it will provide Valdosta Regional Airport with $3 million to help replace the airport’s traffic control tower. The grant is part of $970 million earmarked for 114 airports, a statement from the Federal Aviation Authority said. The money is part of a $5 billion grant program to modernize airport terminals. Other airports receiving money to improve or replace traffic control towers are located in Duluth, Minn., Middle River, Md., and Harlingen Texas. “Today’s funding not only helps modernize airports to meet the needs of travelers today and for years to come but also creates good-paying job opportunities in communities both large and small,” said FAA Associate Administrator for Airports Shannetta R. Griffin. Management at the Valdosta Regional Airport was not available for immediate comment. In a 2023 interview, Jim Galloway, the regional airport manager and executive director, said the current air tower and general aviation terminal needs to be replaced as it hasn’t been upgraded for more than 70 years and older buildings are more expensive to maintain.

Circuit Court of Appeals at the federal courthouse in Washington. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal appeals panel ruled Tuesday that Donald Trump can face trial on charges that he plotted to overturn the results of the 2020 election, rejecting the former president\'s claims that he is immune from prosecution. The decision marks the second time in as many months that judges have spurned Trump\'s immunity arguments and held that he can be prosecuted for actions undertaken while in the White House and in the run-up to Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. But it also sets the stage for additional appeals from the Republican ex-president that could reach the U.S. Supreme Court. The trial was originally set for March, but it was postponed last week and the judge didn\'t immediately set a new date. ""We conclude that the interest in criminal accountability, held by both the public and the Executive Branch, outweighs the potential risks of chilling Presidential action and permitting vexatious litigation,"" the judges wrote. The trial date carries enormous political ramifications, with the Republican primary front-runner hoping to delay it until after the November election. If Trump defeats President Joe Biden, he could presumably try to use his position as head of the executive branch to order a new attorney general to dismiss the federal cases or he potentially could seek a pardon for himself. The appeals court took center stage in the immunity dispute after the Supreme Court last month said it was at least temporarily staying out of it, rejecting a request from special counsel Jack Smith to take up the matter quickly and issue a speedy ruling. The legally untested question before the court was whether former presidents can be prosecuted after they leave office for actions taken in the White House related to their official duties. The Supreme Court has held that presidents are immune from civil liability for official acts, and Trump\'s lawyers have for months argued that that protection should be extended to criminal prosecution as well. They said the actions Trump was accused of in his failed bid to cling to power after he lost the 2020 election to Biden, including badgering his vice president to refuse to certify the results of the election, all fell within the ""outer perimeters"" of a president\'s official acts. But Smith\'s team has said that no such immunity exists in the U.S. Constitution or in prior cases and that, in any event, Trump\'s actions weren\'t part of his official duties. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is presiding over the case, rejected Trump\'s arguments in a Dec. 1 opinion that said the office of the president ""does not confer a lifelong \'get-out-of-jail-free\' pass."" Trump\'s lawyers then appealed to the D.C. appeals court, but Smith asked the Supreme Court to weigh in first, in hopes of securing a fast and definitive ruling and preserving the March 4 trial date. The high court declined the request, leaving the matter with the appeals court. The case was argued before Judges Florence Pan and J. Michelle Childs, appointees of Biden, a Democrat, and Karen LeCraft Henderson, who was named to the bench by President George H.W. Bush, a Republican. The judges made clear their skepticism of Trump\'s claims during arguments last month, when they peppered his lawyer with tough questions and posed a series of extreme hypotheticals as a way to test his legal theory of immunity — including whether a president who directed Navy commandos to assassinate a political rival could be prosecuted. Trump\'s lawyer, D. John Sauer, answered yes — but only if a president had first been impeached and convicted by Congress. That view was in keeping with the team\'s position that the Constitution did not permit the prosecution of ex-presidents who had been impeached but then acquitted, like Trump. The case in Washington is one of four criminal prosecutions Trump faces as he seeks to reclaim the White House this year. He faces federal charges in Florida that he illegally retained classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate, a case that was also brought by Smith and is set for trial in May. He\'s also charged in state court in Georgia with scheming to subvert that state\'s 2020 election and in New York in connection with hush money payments made to porn actor Stormy Daniels. He has denied any wrongdoing. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.
