When Local 5’s Michele McCormack first met Matthew Demeny in September of 2021, he showed her the large scar on his head. It was where doctors inserted a titanium plate to keep his skull intact. Because the case was still going through the courts, he couldn’t say what happened to him until now. In a recent interview, he said his back was turned to the shooter. “When my fiancée yelled and I turned around, that’s when he did it,” Demeny recalled. “He pulled out a gun and shot me.” The violence happened during a family tubing party in July of 2021. It wasn’t until February of this year, that Demeny’s cousin’s partner, Cornelius Russell, pleaded no contest to Aggravated Battery with intent to cause great bodily harm. Demeny acknowledges that he had to retrieve a beer can from the river that somebody else had let float around. But to this day, he has no idea why Russell targeted him. “We were drinking and whatnot, but there was never any confrontation. Never any bad looks or yelling. I remember looking at him and saying ‘Why do you have a gun?’ and then I remember waking up in the water.” Witnesses scattered that day. Some nurses who happened to be there helped his fiancee keep his skull together and help stabilize him along the shoreline. Russell was given seven years under the deal that included dropping additional charges including having a handgun as an already convicted felon. When offered the opportunity to address the court, he remained silent. The lack of apology or explanation was especially disappointing for the victim. “When somebody does something like that, that affects somebody else’s life there are certain answers that should be answered faster. Especially when he turned himself in while I was still lying in a coma in the hospital bed.” Instead of answers, Russell’s defense said they would raise questions and reasonable doubt if the case ever went to trial. “There was no firearm recovered,” noted Alex Gelhar who is Assistant State Public Defender. “No bullet or shell casing. And at a prior motion hearing the defense pointed out various items of evidence that were not preserved by law enforcement or the state.” When asked if his client wanted to accept responsibility Gelhar said he would stick with his prepared statement. Waupaca County District Attorney Kat Turner told Local 5’s Michele McCormack that the state would have presented its expert to testify that Demeny was shot. But, as the Assistant D.A. explained in court, conflicts emerged between the hearing dates and the victim’s work schedule. “If the victim told us I will not attend court dates, from the state’s perspective we don’t have a case,” said A.D.A. Ben Szilagy. “There’s not a triable matter.” Demeny said repeated delays with the defendant’s first attorney took up all of his time off. D.A. Turner also agreed that the first private attorney was incommunicative and delayed the case initially. However, once the Public Defender took over, it took ten months to conclude. Demeny added that he’s been under great financial pressure. His injury left him unable to return to his house framing business. He makes far less at an automotive yard now. Despite a $40 thousand victim’s assistance payment from the government, since he was uninsured he has more than $100,000 in outstanding medical bills. “Just a lot of problems, ya know,” said Demeny his voice started to quiver and tears coming to his eyes. “Problems physically, mentally, and financially.” Demeny said he taught himself how to walk and keep his balance again since there was no money for rehab.

(Gray News) - Charlotte, a 12-to-14-year-old stingray, is pregnant in a tank with no male stingrays. At first, Brenda Ramer, the founder of The Aquarium & Shark Lab at Team ECCO in Hendersonville, North Carolina, said she didn’t believe it. “People have written and said, ‘Well, they can hold male sperm for years. I’m like, she’s never been around a male until we put those two little boys in here,” she said. Ramer said she noticed the bite marks on Charlotte’s body, a habit of mating sharks. The sharks with whom Charlotte shares a tank are named Moe and Larry. Ramer said one of them could be the father of Charlotte’s pups. Moe and Larry were thought to be too young to reproduce. The aquarium will soon find out if that’s true. The other explanation and the more likely scenario: Charlotte is going through a very rare process called parthenogenesis, where the eggs develop on their own without fertilization and create a clone of their mother. “And with our bamboo shark up in the corner, we’ve had an experience of parthenogenesis with her 14 different times,” Ramer said. She said they studied that process in sharks but said it doesn’t happen much in rays in captivity. The last full study she said took place a quarter of a century ago. “It’s a once in a bluest of blue moons experience,” Ramer said. The aquarium has been closed for renovation but reopens its doors Thursday. “We’re kind of expecting a deluge, which is great and that’s fine. You know, we want people to come and see her and talk to us about her,” Ramer said. She said she is working to set up a livestream of the tank so as many people as possible can see the pups, as many as four, when they are born. Ramer said if they are born alive, she hopes to keep the family together but will have to get a tank almost double the size to Charlotte’s current home. Updates on Charlotte’s condition will be posted to the aquarium’s Facebook page. Copyright 2024 Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved. WLOS via CNN Newsource contributed to this report.'}]"

The foreign ministers of the three countries met in the Paris suburb of La Celle-Saint-Cloud to have talks about Ukraine, amid other issues. They discussed reviving the so-called Weimar Triangle, a long dormant regional grouping that was designed to promote cooperation between France, Germany and Poland. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who met with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin on Monday, said he wanted to “revitalize” his nation’s relations with its key European partners. “There is no reason why we should be so clearly militarily weaker than Russia, and therefore increasing production and intensifying our cooperation are absolutely indisputable priorities,” Tusk said in arguing for the European Union to become “a military power” in its own right. The diplomatic push came after Trump shocked many in Europe over the weekend by appearing to invite Russia to invade any NATO member not spending enough on its own defense. “‘You didn’t pay? You’re delinquent?’” Trump recounted telling an unidentified NATO member during his presidency. “‘No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You gotta pay. You gotta pay your bills.’” The Republican front-runner’s words at a campaign rally were particularly shocking for front-line NATO countries like Poland, which experienced both German and Soviet occupation during World War II and later spent decades under Soviet control. Anxieties run high there over the ongoing war just across Poland’s eastern border. Speaking alongside Tusk in Berlin, Scholz blasted Trump’s comments. “NATO’s promise of protection is unrestricted — ‘all for one and one for all,’” Scholz said without mentioning the former president by name. “And let me say clearly for current reasons: Any relativization of NATO’s support guarantee is irresponsible and dangerous, and is in the interest of Russia alone.” “No one can play, or ‘deal,’ with Europe’s security,” the chancellor added. Earlier Monday, Scholz inaugurated a new ammunition factory, underlining Europe’s efforts to ramp up weapons production. Tusk also urged European nations to invest more in military projects in order “to achieve as quickly as possible… in the next dozen or so months, much greater air defense capabilities, much greater production capabilities in terms of ammunition.” Asked about Trump’s remarks, Tusk said they “should act like a cold shower for all those who continue to underestimate this increasingly real threat which Europe is facing.” Macron, speaking alongside Tusk in Paris, said Europe’s will “to further supply and meet Ukrainian needs is crucial,” after leaders of the 27 EU member nations sealed a deal to provide Ukraine with 50 billion euros ($54 billion) in support for its war-ravaged economy.

Trump’s remarks raised concerns that if reelected, he could embolden Russia to attack other countries besides Ukraine. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg issued a statement Sunday saying that Trump’s remarks put American troops and their allies at greater risk. NATO does not require its 31 members to pay bills, but they are expected to invest a certain percentage of their own budgets — ideally, 2% of their gross domestic product — on defense. Some countries, like Poland, have long met the target. Other European nations ramped up their military spending after Russia invaded Ukraine almost two years ago. Speaking in Rome, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani dismissed Trump’s threat as “electoral campaign joke,” but said it was legitimate for all NATO members to do their part. Italy hasn’t yet reached the 2% GDP defense spending target. “To have more influence within NATO we need a Europe with its own army,” he said. “We must look forward, because it is fair that Americans are asking us to do our part, we must have equal responsibility.” Germany, with a post-World War II political culture of military caution, was a frequent target of Trump’s ire during his presidency for falling short of the 2% target, But Berlin announced plans to step up military spending after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and plans to hit the benchmark this year. France’s military budget grew in recent years and reached the level of about 2% of GDP. Tusk returned to power as prime minister of his central European nation in December after eight years of rule by a national conservative government that often took an antagonistic stance with European allies, particularly Germany. As a result, Warsaw’s influence in Europe diminished. The Weimar Triangle was created in 1991 as Poland was emerging from decades of communism as a platform for political cooperation among the three nations. Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski noted Monday that he and his French and German counterparts “meet at a dramatic, but also solemn moment.” Russian President Vladimir Putin “must not be allowed to win this war.

AP’s earlier story follows below. A jury in Michigan reached a verdict Tuesday in the involuntary manslaughter trial of a school shooter’s mother in the deaths of four students in 2021. The jury began deliberations Monday, after seven days of testimony ended Friday. Prosecutors say Jennifer Crumbley was grossly negligent when she failed to tell Oxford High School that the family had guns, including a 9 mm handgun that her son, Ethan Crumbley, used at a shooting range on the weekend before the Nov. 30, 2021, attack. The jury — six men and six women including some gun owners or people who grew up with guns — had sent a note to the judge Monday afternoon asking if it could “infer anything” from prosecutors not presenting Ethan Crumbley or others to explain specifically how he got access to a gun at home to shoot up Oxford High School. “The answer is no,"" Oakland County Judge Cheryl Matthews said. “You’re only allowed to consider the evidence that was admitted in the case.” Prosecutors say Jennifer Crumbley had a duty under Michigan law to prevent her son, who was 15 at the time, from harming others. She’s accused of failing to secure a gun and ammunition at home and failing to get help for her son’s mental health. The morning of Nov. 30, 2021, school staff members were concerned about a violent drawing of a gun, bullet and wounded man, accompanied by desperate phrases, on Ethan Crumbley’s math assignment. He was allowed to stay in school following a meeting with his parents, who didn\'t take him home. A few hours later, Ethan Crumbley pulled a handgun from his backpack and shot 10 students and a teacher, killing four peers. No one had checked the backpack. The gun was the Sig Sauer 9 mm his father, James Crumbley, purchased with him just four days earlier. Jennifer Crumbley took her son to a shooting range that same weekend. “You\'re the last adult to have possession of that gun,” assistant prosecutor Marc Keast said while cross-examining Jennifer Crumbley last week. “You saw your son shoot the last practice round before the (school) shooting on Nov. 30.

bladder issue."" (CNN) — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin transferred his duties to his deputy as he is hospitalized for treatment for symptoms “suggesting an emergent bladder issue,” according to the Pentagon. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks assumed the functions and duties of the top spot at the Pentagon shortly before 5 p.m., Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement. The White House, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and Congress have been notified. The rapid notification of Austin’s visit to the hospital – the first statement from the Pentagon was released within three hours – came after the defense secretary acknowledged failures in notifying the administration and the public about his previous hospitalization. Lloyd was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center around 2:20 p.m., Ryder said. The press secretary did not say how long Austin would be staying at the hospital. “We will provide an update on Secretary Austin’s condition as soon as possible,” Ryder said. Austin traveled to the hospital with unclassified and classified communications systems that are required for his duties. Austin was diagnosed with prostate cancer in early December and underwent a procedure to treat the cancer on December 22. That procedure required general anesthesia and an overnight stay at Walter Reed. He then returned to the hospital on New Year’s Day after suffering from complications as a result of the procedure. Austin’s unannounced hospitalization, which was not disclosed to the media or President Joe Biden and other senior administration officials for days, raised major questions about transparency within the administration. Republicans have been highly critical of how the Pentagon handled Austin’s illness, and the defense secretary is scheduled to testify to the House Armed Services Committee at the end of the month about his failure to notify key government leaders. Austin remained in the hospital for two weeks, then worked from home for another two weeks as he continued his recovery. On February 1, in his first news conference since his hospitalization, Austin acknowledged that his handling of the diagnosis and the hospitalization was a mistake. “We did not handle this right, and I did not handle this right. I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public. And I take full responsibility. I apologize to my teammates and to the American people,” Austin said. Last week, the Office of the Secretary of Defense completed a 30-day review of the notification procedures around a transfer of responsibilities. At a news briefing Thursday, Ryder said Austin has received the review and is reviewing it. Ryder also said much of the review is classified, but the Pentagon would try to make public as much as possible. “We remain committed to being as transparent as possible about the review, and we’ll have more information once the secretary’s review is complete,” Ryder said.

Mahomes threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Mecole Hardman in overtime, and the Chiefs rallied to beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 on Sunday, becoming the NFL\'s ninth repeat Super Bowl champs.

But San Francisco settled for a field goal. SEE MORE: McEntire shines at Super Bowl with 50 years of anthem performances Purdy, Christian McCaffrey and the Niners jumped ahead 10-0, but that’s no big deal for Mahomes and the Chiefs in the Super Bowl. They’ve trailed by 10 points in all three of their victories, including last year’s 38-35 win over Philadelphia. Mahomes wasn’t at his best early and threw an interception. But with the game on the line, he was a magician once again. He finished 34 of 46 for 333 yards and two TDs. The Chiefs were hardly dominant during the regular season and entered the playoffs as the AFC\'s No. 3 seed. They won at Buffalo and at Baltimore in the postseason — the first road playoff games of Mahomes\' career — and entered the Super Bowl as 2 1/2-point underdogs, according to FanDuel Sportsbook. “The Kansas City Chiefs are never underdogs. Just know that,” Mahomes said. They became the first team to win consecutive Super Bowls as underdogs; the Philadelphia Eagles were slight favorites a year ago. The game turned when San Francisco’s Ray-Ray McCloud couldn’t scoop a punt that hit teammate Darrell Luter Jr.’s leg and the Chiefs recovered at the 49ers 16, leading to Mahomes\' go-ahead TD pass to Valdes-Scantling. The Niners answered on the next possession with Purdy tossing a 10-yard TD pass to Jennings for a 16-13 lead. Moody’s extra point was blocked. Niners coach Kyle Shanahan gambled on fourth-and-3 from the Chiefs 15, passing up a chance for a tying field goal. Purdy hit George Kittle for a 4-yard gain and then found Jennings for the score. Shanahan resorted to trickery for the only touchdown of the first half. Jennings, a wide receiver who had never thrown a pass in an NFL game, tossed a 21-yard TD to McCaffrey. He was hit as he threw a wobbly pass across the field, but McCaffrey snagged it and sprinted to the end zone. Shanahan fell to 0-2 as a head coach in Super Bowls and 0-3 overall, including a loss when he was offensive coordinator for Atlanta. That was the game in which Brady and the Patriots rallied from a 28-3 deficit to win in OT. “When you go against guys like Tom Brady and Pat Mahomes, you never feel comfortable with a lead. Those guys are two of the best to ever play the game,” Shanahan said. There were plenty of stars in the building as the NFL brought its biggest game to this gambling mecca — once a taboo idea. Jay-Z, LeBron James and Paul McCartney were among the celebrities in the crowd. Post Malone sang “America the Beautiful,” Reba McEntire performed the national anthem and Usher electrified the crowd at halftime. He brought out a number of guests, including Alicia Keys, H.E.R., Jermaine Dupri, Lil Jon and Ludacris. Attendance was announced at 61,629 at the relatively compact Allegiant Stadium, the smallest crowd in Super Bowl history except for the pandemic game in Tampa, Florida, three years ago. It didn\'t start out well, but thanks to Mahomes, those fans ended up seeing one of the best Super Bowl finishes. Fans will get to celebrate the Chiefs on Wednesday, Valentine\'s Day. The parade will begin at 11 a.m. Trending stories at Scrippsnews.com'}]"

(AP) — Diversity initiatives would be defunded or banned from universities and other public institutions under a slate of bills pending in Republican-led legislatures, with some lawmakers counting on the issue resonating with voters in this election year. Already this year, Republican lawmakers have proposed about 50 bills in 20 states that would restrict initiatives on diversity, equity and inclusion — known as DEI — or require their public disclosure, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural. Republican legislators in Wisconsin brokered a narrowly approved deal with regents in December for the state’s public university system to limit diversity positions at its two dozen campuses. Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos later said he had only just begun to remove “cancerous DEI practices” and requested a review of diversity initiatives across state government. The regents, who switched their vote after choosing not to remove DEI initiatives, did so after Republicans threatened to not confirm them after their terms were up. This is the second year Republican-led state governments have targeted DEI. This year’s bills, as well as executive orders and internal agency directives, again focus heavily on higher education. But the legislation also would limit DEI in K-12 schools, state government, contracting and pension investments. Some bills would bar financial institutions from discriminating against those who refuse to participate in DEI programs. Meanwhile, Democrats have filed about two dozen bills in 11 states that would require or promote DEI initiatives. The bills cover a broad spectrum, including measures to reverse Florida’s recent ban on DEI in higher education and measures to require DEI considerations in K-12 school curricula in Washington state. The Supreme Court’s June decision ending affirmative action at universities has created a new legal landscape around diversity programs in the workplace and civil society. But DEI’s emergence as a political rallying cry has its roots on campus, with Republican opponents saying the programs are discriminatory and promote left-wing ideology. Democratic supporters say the programs are necessary for ensuring institutions meet the needs of increasingly diverse student populations. Republican Oklahoma Sen. Rob Standridge, who has authored four bills aiming to hollow out DEI programs in the state, said it has become a salient campaign theme. “I think it’s become more of a political thing,” Standridge said. “In other words, people are using it in their campaigns in a positive way. So now all of a sudden, maybe the people that didn’t care before are like, well, wait a minute, I can use this on a flier next year. And Trump brings light to it, too.” The organizations that help power the conservative agenda say DEI’s emergence at the center of political debate makes their crusade against it ripe for expansion. “This has opened a window of opportunity, and we don’t want the window to close,” Mike Gonzalez, a fellow at powerful conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, said in an interview. “We want to meet this window with a robust policy agenda.” In South Carolina, Rep. Josiah Magnuson, who introduced legislation to restrict DEI, said the issue reflects a growing sentiment among Republican lawmakers that ideologies disfavored by conservatives grow with the help of campus bureaucracies. “We’re finding that our colleges and universities were kind of off the rails, and we need to rein them back in,” Magnuson said. “And so I think that’s another thing that’s providing a growing impetus to get our state universities under control.” Not all Republicans are unified about which government approach is best suited to eliminate DEI. In Oklahoma, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt signed an executive order in December barring state agencies and universities from spending money on the programs. Standridge said it’s not clear what authority the order would have because Oklahoma’s universities are regulated by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, not the governor’s office. “I appreciate the executive order but, arguably, it doesn’t really have the authority to force the schools to do anything,” Standridge said. “I ran several bills thinking maybe the moderates that are in control of the Senate would allow us to do something against DEI.” For Washington state Sen. Marko Liias, DEI is crucial to serving a diverse society. Liias introduced a bill in the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2023 to weave DEI concepts into the state’s K-12 learning standards. The bill, which is up for consideration again in 2024, is designed to meet the needs of a diversifying student population, he said. “I think the opposition is organized around a political agenda, whereas I’m trying to respond to a diverse community that I represent and the experiences that they’re bringing to me,” Liias said. “So it’s sort of reality versus theory, what’s happening in our families and schools versus an agenda driven by national foundations. That’s the divide.” Republican-led Florida and Texas were the first states to adopt broad-based laws banning DEI efforts in higher education. Since then, other state leaders have followed. “The idea to study how much we were spending on DEI came from me seeing what other states were doing. Specifically, Ron DeSantis in Florida,” said Mississippi State Auditor Shad White, a Republican. In a 2023 report, White said Mississippi’s public universities are spending millions on DEI programs instead of student scholarships. In the opening weeks of Mississippi’s 2024 session, Rep. Becky Currie introduced a bill that would implement sweeping bans on not only DEI offices but also on funding campus activities deemed “social activism.” The bill has been referred to a House committee. Currie declined to be interviewed. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed a bill into law on Jan. 30 that makes the state the latest to prohibit diversity training, hiring and inclusion programs at universities and in state government. Cox has called using diversity statements in hiring “bordering on evil.” The crackdown on DEI is part of the same legislative project as the earlier movement to restrict the academic and legal ideas termed critical race theory, said Jonathan Butcher, a research fellow in education policy for The Heritage Foundation. Critical race theory is a way of thinking about America’s history based on the idea that racism is systemic in the nation’s institutions. “There is no separation. DEI is the application of critical race theory. DEI officers are the administrative control panels that are putting critical race theory into place,” Butcher said. Rep. Fentrice Driskell, Florida’s Democratic House minority leader, thinks the ideological motive behind restricting DEI is intertwined with an economic agenda that downplays the role of identity in exacerbating inequality. “It’s a flashpoint because the conservatives like to talk about meritocracy as their vision for a society where everybody can advance,” Driskell said. “Real life is actually more complicated than that. And that is what DEI programs are there to solve.” Associated Press writers Trisha Ahmed in Minneapolis, David Lieb in Jefferson City, Missouri, Hannah Schoenbaum in Salt Lake City and Todd Richmond in Madison, Wisconsin, contributed to this story.

the U.S. to pause or suspend military aid to countries that violate international protections of civilians. This could make it easier for the Biden administration to secure funding for Israel and Ukraine. And former President Donald Trump on the campaign trail, saying he would encourage Russia to attack NATO allies if they didn\'t fulfill their financial commitments to the alliance. NPR political correspondent Sarah McCammon joins us now to sort all this out. Good morning, Sarah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hi, Debbie. ELLIOTT: So we\'ll get to Trump in a moment. Let\'s start with the new conditions on military aid. How would they make it easier for the administration to secure funding? MCCAMMON: Yeah, this move from the White House - it appears to be aimed at shoring up divisions within the Democratic Party. President Biden, you know, has offered a strong support for Israel since the Hamas attacks that killed more than 1,200 Israelis, with hundreds of hostages taken into Gaza - many still there, as we just heard. Israel\'s response has killed at least 28,000 people in Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials. And with that continued devastation, Biden has been under pressure from the left wing of the Democratic Party to roll back support for Israel. So some Democrats and human rights groups have welcomed this step from Biden. But some have also raised concerns about how well this directive would be enforced. For now, the Senate is working on a $95 billion standalone military aid package without a border deal attached to that. ELLIOTT: Let\'s talk a little more about that military aid package. Remind us how we got here. MCCAMMON: So you\'ll remember, there was a bipartisan deal negotiated by Republican Senator James Lankford last week that had just about everything Republicans had said they wanted as far as a border deal. It would have reformed asylum laws, given the president more authority to close borders and expel migrants, along with aid for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan. Senate Republicans voted to block that after former President Trump pushed back on it. He suggested Democrats would agree to the border deal because it would help them in the presidential election. So Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer decided to move forward with military aid alone. And that bill may get a vote in the Senate this week. ELLIOTT: OK, Sarah, now let\'s talk about the comments that former President Trump made while campaigning in South Carolina yesterday ahead of that state\'s upcoming primary. What exactly was he saying about NATO? MCCAMMON: Well, Trump again claimed credit, as he has before, for getting NATO members to pay their share to support the alliance while he was in office. But he took it further this time. He claimed that one of the presidents of a, quote, ""big country"" asked him what would happen if they did not pay and were attacked by Russia. And here\'s what Trump said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: You didn\'t pay. You\'re delinquent. He said, yes, let\'s say that happened. No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills. MCCAMMON: So again, suggesting he would encourage Russia to attack NATO allies - and we want to make clear, Debbie, NATO allies do not owe the U.S. money for NATO-related efforts. Trump also renewed his attacks on President Biden. He alluded to the big headline this week that came out of a special counsel report, raising questions about Biden\'s age and memory. ELLIOTT: Well, that\'s certainly been the buzz in Washington this week or this past week over that special counsel report and what it could mean for President Biden\'s reelection. What\'s your take, Sarah? MCCAMMON: Well, as you\'ll recall, on Thursday the special counsel looking into Biden\'s handling of classified documents announced that it had decided not to bring criminal charges. But the special counsel said that Biden had presented himself to investigators as a, quote, ""sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory"" - you know, not the headline you want when you\'re running for reelection. Now, it\'s important to note the special counsel was appointed by Trump. Democrats have been making that point, including Vice President Kamala Harris. On Friday, she reminded reporters that these interviews with the special counsel happened the same weekend as the Hamas attacks on Israel and said that Biden was in the front and on top in responding to that crisis. She said the report\'s characterization was gratuitous and politically motivated. ELLIOTT: Thanks, Sarah. That\'s NPR political correspondent Sarah McCammon. MCCAMMON: Thank you.

There’s financial insecurity: it’s hard to find a good job and make ends meet. It’s hard to find an affordable place to live, much less buy a house. There’s political insecurity: how safe are our democratic systems from authoritarianism and extremism? And there’s existential insecurity: the feeling of being mortal, and of not knowing what the future holds. Today’s guest argues that there’s another type of insecurity: manufactured insecurity. This type of insecurity, argues Astra Taylor, is manufactured by capitalism, but it actually serves to undermine our ability to be more secure. Insecurity, argues Astra Taylor, is the defining feature of our times. And acknowledging our shared insecurity can make us more collaborative, more curious, more empathetic, and look sideways to recognize potentially powerful commonalities. Today, filmmaker, writer, and organizer Astra Taylor joins guest host Chali Pittman to unpack her work on insecurity, months after publishing a new series of public talks focused around the idea of insecurity. These talks were put on by the high-profile Canadian lecture series, the Massey Lectures, which invites thinkers and organizers to give high-profile talks each year (previous Lecturers include Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Doris Lessing, Noam Chomsky, and Margaret Atwood). As the 2023 Massey Lecturer, Astra Taylor’s talks, and a companion book, are titled “The Age of Insecurity: Coming Together as Things Fall Apart.” You can listen to them for free at the CBC, and buy the companion book here. Her previous books include Remake the World: Essays, Reflections, Rebellions, Democracy May Not Exist, But We’ll Miss It When It’s Gone, and the American Book Award winner The People’s Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age. She regularly writes for major publications, has directed three documentaries — Zizek!, What is Democracy? and Examined Life. Her work has appeared in many journals and magazines, including The New York Times, the Nation, the Intercept, the New Yorker, the New Republic, and so on. As an organizer, she was active in the Occupy Wall Street movement, and co-founded the Debt Collective, a debter’s union that’s had some success in pushing for student debt relief. She’s also toured with the band Neutral Milk Hotel. You can follow her on Twitter at @astradisastra. Astra Taylor will give a virtual talk at the UW-Madison Havens Wright Center for Social Justice on Tuesday, February 13 from noon-1:30pm.

National National National National National National National National National National National National National National National National Published on By LAS VEGAS (AP) — With the run she’s having, how could Taylor Swift be on anything other than the winning side? She embraced her boyfriend Travis Kelce and the couple locked lips on the field at Allegiant Stadium after his Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in the Super Bowl. Moments earlier, Swift smiled with her eyes looking misty from tears as she stood next to Kelce’s mother while he held aloft the Lombardi Trophy, shouting “Chiefs nation!” and bellowing a chorus of “Viva Las Vegas.” Minutes before that, she was smothered by celebrity suite mates, who at various points included Blake Lively, Ice Spice and Lana Del Rey, when the Chiefs scored the winning touchdown in overtime, set up by a key reception by Kelce for a first down. It was the second straight Super Bowl win for the Chiefs, but the first since Swift became fan-in-chief. She and Kelce began dating shortly before the season started. It completes an epic stretch for Swift, who won album of the year a week earlier for a record fourth time at the Grammys, where she also announced a new album dropping in April before jetting off to Japan for a series of stadium shows. Soon after flying halfway around the world to get to the game, she strolled through security to enter the stadium along with Lively, Ice Spice and her mom, Andrea Swift. She cuddled with Lively during Post Malone’s performance of “America the Beautiful” and won what appeared to be a beer chugging contest, slamming her cup down to an appreciative roar from the fans. She was spotted talking to Kelce’s brother, Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell in one of the private boxes that reportedly cost more than $1 million. Del Rey joined the celeb-packed suite in time to catch Usher’s halftime show. Swift flew on a private plane across nine time zones and the international date line from the last of four shows at the Tokyo Dome to arrive about two hours before kickoff. The time change allowed her to land in Los Angeles and make the final hop to Las Vegas. The 14-time Grammy winner walked in wearing a black outfit with a red jacket slung over her shoulder, apparently getting the memo from Kelce and many of the Chiefs. He wore a shimmering black suit, quarterback Patrick Mahomes wore a sharp black suit of his own, and even Chiefs coach Andy Reid wore a black blazer as the Chiefs leaned into the role of the villains. “Anti-Hero” also happens to be the lead single from Swift’s Grammy-winning album, “Midnights.” “She’s unbelievable. She’s rewriting the history books herself,” Kelce said a day after the Grammys. “I told her I’ll have to hold up my end of the bargain and come home with hardware, too.” Swift began dating Kelce after he said on his “New Heights” podcast that he had tried and failed to give her a friendship bracelet during her performance at Arrowhead Stadium. Kelce then invited her to watch him perform at the home of the Chiefs, and she surprisingly showed up for their Week 2 game against Chicago. Swift soon became a regular at games, both home and away, frequently sitting with Brittany Mahomes, the wife of Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes.

Fifty years later, a splinter group formed the Rotary Club of Kenosha West. Now the two groups are re-linking. They'll be meeting jointly for lunch on the first and third Thursdays of every month at the Stella in downtown Kenosha. In a news release, Rotary officials said the club will continue to support various community endeavors through revenue raised from its annual softball tournament. It'll also continue an essay contest for high school seniors that leads to the awarding of scholarships.

Drone video captured by TMJ4 shows the trail of destruction. Multiple structures appear to have been completely flattened.

The storms left a swath of destruction that included dead and missing cows, roofs blown off of homes, destroyed storage sheds and barns, trashed vehicles and shattered windows. Video shows drone footage of tornado damage in Evansville, Wisconsin: At least one tornado was confirmed south of Madison and the National Weather Service was investigating reports of several more spawned from storms that swept across the southeastern part of the state around 5:30 p.m. on Thursday, said meteorologist Taylor Patterson. There were no reports of significant injuries. Local emergency management officials reported dozens of buildings, power lines and other structures that were damaged in the path of the storm that formed in eastern Iowa and died out near Milwaukee. The temperature was a record high for the date: 59 degrees.

The stronger El Nino this year does make it warmer than normal, but it’s hard to say from this one event how significant of a role climate change played, the meteorologist Patterson said. “But with a lot of things that have been going on with climate change, you get more severe events and then you get more impactful severe events,” she said. Tornadoes are most common in Wisconsin over the summer months between May and August. Since 1948, between November and February fewer than a dozen tornadoes total had been reported before Thursday, according to the weather service. Conditions collided in Wisconsin late afternoon on Thursday creating the perfect conditions for tornadoes to form, Patterson said. That included rapidly warming temperatures that topped out at a record-tying 55 degrees Fahrenheit (13 Celsius) in Madison and more moisture with rapidly rising air, creating thunderstorms, Patterson said. Weather service teams will determine how strong the tornadoes were and how many formed. Photos and video shot near Evansville that were posted on social media show a tornado with lightning flashing around it. Dan Wagner, 76, and his 40-year-old son, Andy, couldn’t make it to the basement before the tornado hit their house near the Artis farm. Andy Wagner said he curled into a ball and hoped for the best as windows shattered and the sound of metal on metal filled their home. “It was like the house took a deep breath, and (then) the windows all exploded. I’m in the fetal position on the floor,” he said. “I thought I was going to die.” It’s about time to watch on your time. Stream local news and weather 24/7 by searching for “TMJ4” on your device.

They added a young child with the woman was critically hurt and another man nearby was wounded. Houston Police Chief Troy Finner said the woman entered the church with a long gun and a backpack shortly before 2 p.m. on Sunday, accompanied by a child about 4 or 5 years old. He said the child was in critical condition after being taken to a hospital. The shooting happened between services at the megachurch that is regularly attended by 45,000 people every week, making it the third largest megachurch in the U.S., according to the Hartford Institute for Religion Research. Osteen’s televised sermons reach about 100 countries. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said “Our hearts are with those impacted by today’s tragic shooting and the entire Lakewood Church community in Houston. Places of worship are sacred.” “She had a long gun, and it could have been a lot worse,” Finner said at the news conference.

Video footage on social media showed the electric vehicle burning, sending up a huge plume of black smoke. “The vehicle was not transporting any riders and no injuries have been reported. We are working closely with local safety officials to respond to the situation,” the company said. The San Francisco fire department said it turned over the case to the police who were investigating the cause of the attack. The fire department on social media posted pictures of the charred remains of the car, along with saying that a firework inside the vehicle started the blaze. The San Francisco police department was not immediately available for comment. Last week, a driverless Waymo car collided with a cyclist in San Francisco, causing minor injuries and the incident is being reviewed by the state’s auto regulator. On Oct. 2, a pedestrian hit by another vehicle was thrown into the path of a self-driving Cruise vehicle and dragged 20 feet (6 meters). California suspended the company’s driverless testing license, and Cruise pulled all its U.S. self-driving vehicles from testing.
