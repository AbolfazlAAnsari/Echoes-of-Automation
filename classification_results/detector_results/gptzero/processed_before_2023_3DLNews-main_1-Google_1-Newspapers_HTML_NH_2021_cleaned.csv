One might think the sun, our planet\'s source of heat, is responsible, and it may be, but only very slightly. The actual culprit is a high-pressure system, or anticyclone, that\'s essentially a mountain of warm air built into a wavy jet stream. The sun, however, could be responsible for something more destructive and imminent, claim many on social media. ""A massive solar storm heading towards Earth could affect GPS, internet and satellites,"" reads an image shared in a July 14 Instagram post that has received nearly 500,000 interactions, according to CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned social media analytics tool. A July 13 post on Facebook claims the event has experts worried the storm\'s ""strong winds may trigger a geomagnetic storm in Earth\'s atmosphere,"" and may even have a more widespread terrestrial impact by knocking out ""power grids in some parts of the world."" USA TODAY has reached out to the posters for comment. Fact check: Beam of green light photographed over Indonesian volcano is a meteor This all sounds very concerning. But the posts\' portends of a looming solar-related disaster aren\'t at all true. There are no forecasts for upcoming major solar storms, and these posts seem to reference one that occurred earlier in July. The claims appear to derive from articles published in Indian news outlets such as Times of India, Hindustan Times and the Indian Express. All articles, claiming NASA as a source for their information, allege ""a solar storm"" would hit Earth around July 13. Solar activity did happen, but much earlier. ""The sun emitted a significant solar flare peaking at 10:29 a.m. EDT on July 3, 2021,"" NASA\'s Solar Dynamics Observatory said in its official blog. A solar flare is an intense burst of electromagnetic energy associated with sunspots, according to the space agency. How often these bursts occur corresponds with where the sun is in its 11-year solar cycle, a period during which the fiery star flips its magnetic fields between its north and south poles. Fact check: Claim about Alyssa Carson preparing to go to Mars is missing context The solar flare was registered as a powerful X1-class sun event, according to the U.S. Space Weather Prediction Center, or SWPC, which tracks solar weather events. The X1-class flare – the most powerful of the three main types – along with a medium-sized M2-class flare, led to brief but noteworthy radio blackouts, according to both SWPC and space advocacy group The Planetary Society. No other significant satellite concerns or downed power grids were reported. The claim a solar flare may trigger a geomagnetic storm in Earth\'s atmosphere is also unfounded. Readings of the Planetary K-index, a measure of our planet\'s geomagnetic disturbances, indicated there were some moderate magnetic changes during the July 3 flare, but not enough to cause even a minor storm, reported Raleigh, North Carolina, NBC affiliate WRAL. Since then, there have been no significant solar storms or geomagnetic disturbances noted by SWPC. Fact check: Conflicting reports surrounding purported Carl Sagan quote The last time a solar storm caused mayhem on Earth was on March 13, 1989, when the entire Canadian province of Quebec suffered a massive power failure, which also disrupted electricity to parts of the Northeastern U.S. The event has since been known as the Quebec Blackout. Based on our research, we rate FALSE the claim a massive solar storm is imminently approaching Earth. A massive solar flare was observed on July 3 and led to some brief radio blackouts but nothing else. Since then, there have been no significant solar storms or geomagnetic disturbances noted by the Space Weather Prediction Center. And none are expected in the immediate future.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:10 pm The ruins of Madame Sherri’s Castle in Chesterfield remain roped off Monday after a portion of the staircase collapsed over the weekend. CHESTERFIELD — The remains of Madame Sherri’s Castle have attracted visitors for decades, with the stone ruins being almost as captivating as the stories — and rumors — about the woman the home once belonged to. In the wake of the staircase’s partial collapse this weekend, locals are reflecting on the landmark and what to make of the loss. The upper arch of the staircase toppled sometime between Saturday evening and Sunday morning, according to numerous reports from visitors who posted about it on Facebook. Lynne Borofsky, chairwoman of the Chesterfield Conservation Commission, said she hopes the collapse will caution future visitors. “I think this will draw attention to the fact the staircase should not be climbed on,” she said, describing how she’s seen people scaling the structure despite signs prohibiting it. “That’s a good thing to come from this.” The steps are all that remain of Madame Sherri’s Castle, which was built in 1931. Audrey Ericson, the historian of the Chesterfield Historical Society, described Madame Sherri as akin to a “folk hero,” as it’s difficult to distinguish which stories about the woman are true. “We have few people in town we could call more famous,” Ericson said. The property, in the woods off Gulf Road, is owned by the Society for the Protection of N.H. Forests, and the conservation commission has long helped maintain the site. Carrie Deegan, reservation stewardship and engagement director for the Forest Society, drove out to Chesterfield on Monday to assess the stability of what’s left. While the partial loss of the stairs is unfortunate, she said, there is still plenty of reason to visit Madame Sherri Forest, and she hopes people will start to notice the beauty beyond the ruins. “The property itself has some spectacular hiking,” she said. But for Cody Barcomb of Winchester, who has been trying to photograph the staircase in every season — and just had winter to go — the loss hurts. “Something like this collapsing, it just reminds me of when the Old Man [of] the Mountain collapsed,” he said, referring to the iconic collection of cliffs on Cannon Mountain that fell in 2003. ”It’s just one less beautiful thing in the state.” Though it’s still not clear what exactly caused the arch to collapse, Deegan said it appeared the mortar between the stones had disintegrated. There hadn’t been any indication that the arch would collapse imminently, she noted. “It surprised us as much as anyone,” she said. “It’s a cool and much beloved site in New Hampshire, but it is a 90-year-old stone ruin — this was always a possibility that we knew might happen.” Borofsky, of the conservation commission, had also long anticipated the structure’s toppling. “I had been watching it crack for really the last 25 years,” she said. “I’ve watched the staircase and other pieces of the structure slowly go back into nature.” The Chesterfield Conservation Commission cordoned off a section of the area on Sunday, and the Forest Society expanded the restricted area on Monday. Ensuring safety is the Concord-based organization’s primary concern right now, Deegan said, as it’s still unclear how unstable the ruins are. Forest Society President Jack Savage said there aren’t currently any plans to reinforce the rest of the staircase. These articles are being shared by partners in The Granite State News Collaborative.

A handful of other respondents were also in this camp including Sarah Yake, who said she had talked with a member of the Native American Guardian Association who said the Green Mountain icon was “absolutely beautiful artwork that is to be celebrated.” Nicholas Willis of the Native American Guardian Association said that Chieftains was a generic term and that Native Americans do support these images and associations. Green Mountain alumni Mindy Munroe said that as a woman who’s married to a Scotsman, the term Chieftain means the leader of a clan and that the term is not just about Native Americans. Overwhelmingly, however, other participants weighed in against both the name and logo by a margin of 2-1. Two GMUHS students spoke at the forum, and both were against the continuation of the name and the mascot. Junior Greta Bernier said that chanting “Go Chieftains” feels wrong, saying she wants a mascot that feels inclusive to everyone and that its “time to change the mascot.” Student Luna Burkland said that the mascot was a stereotype and was not a good representation of the school. She also noted that many indigenous people were protesting mascots across the county that were similar to theirs, and asked, “Why is it any different for us?” GMUSD board member Abe Gross, speaking as a member of the public, also said that the current logo and indigenous association and objectification was a challenge. He said that it does not seem that the best thing to do is ignore it. “What will be the legacy of Green Mountain into the future?” he asked. Green Mountain parent Deborah Velto spoke of being visited by her Navajo friend and being embarrassed and shameful of all the Chieftain imagery. She said that the alumni were holding onto an outdated tradition and were contributing to an “aggressive climate” shaming students and other community members for wanting a change. Cavendish resident Sarah Stowell agreed that the imagery still seen at the school is problematic. “Holding onto the past for the sake of the past seems like it’s a… futility,” she said. Chester community member Cheryl Joy Lipton said that a rebrand was not possible since the word Chieftains was so closely tied to Native American imagery. She compared the use of the swastika, which was originally a Celtic symbol, but could now only be associated with its Nazi Germany association. Cavendish resident Jen Leak also agreed it was not possible to rebrand and that reducing people to an image based on a person’s race was dehumanizing. Carol McRanahan, commissioner of Native American Affairs and an elder and member of Abenaki community, said the symbol is disrespectful to her. She noted that Abenaki never wore a headdress. “The misconception that the Indian chieftain is honoring us is off the mark,” she said. She also pointed out that the word “Chieftains” was a word termed by the colonizers and was not a part of the Abenaki culture. She also pointed out that Green Mountain was the last school in Vermont that’s holding onto this type of mascot. Other comments included the need to upgrade the logo much like the building needs upgrading; that the logo was a divisive issue that would continue to cause problems; and the need to adopt symbolism that does no harm.

Wilderson retorts: as a consequence of the Black social and historical status, Black suffering is fundamentally and irreconcilably different from that of other subjugated classes. He even goes so far as to name non-Black minority groups the “junior partners” of the White. The struggle for liberation amongst other groups is legitimate, yet it is still predicated upon Black sadistic subjugation.

Republicans announced it would be welcoming Congressman Madison Cawthorn, Congressional Candidate Karoline Leavitt and Republican digital personality Alex Bruesewitz to campus for an event entitled ‘The Future of the Republican Party.’ The Dartmouth College Republicans’ announcement of high-profile speakers was notable, especially because the club has largely been dormant for the past two years following internal turmoil and leadership struggles, which The Review has extensively covered. Nonetheless, the prelude to Sunday’s event evoked significant campus-wide opposition — event advertisement posters were vandalized, multiple campus groups issued swift condemnations, College Republicans members reported instances of harassment, and it even elicited a protest. This brouhaha begets the question: Why are people upset and what’s at stake? Before diving into the accusations, it is important to understand the general backgrounds of the invited Republicans. Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-NC), at 26-years old, is the youngest member serving in the 117th Congress. In 2020, he defeated a Trump-endorsed Republican primary challenger in his North Carolina district and later won in the general election. Karoline Leavitt, a 23-year old NH native, previously served as President Trump’s Assistant Press Secretary and is currently Rep. Elise Stefanik’s (R-NY) Director of Communications. She is also running for U.S. Congress in NH’s First Congressional District. Alex Bruesewitz, aged 24, is the founder of political consulting firm X Strategies and holds a significant digital presence with over 111K Twitter followers. According to College Republicans Vice-President Chloe Ezzo ‘22, the event aimed to showcase the next generation of Republican thinkers and potentially inspire students of similar ages to become involved. As is the case with most campus events, the College Republicans attempted to advertise the panel through posting flyers in public spaces. However, many were quickly torn down. The removal of posters was a repeated phenomenon; despite College Republicans printing and installing new posters throughout the week, almost all replacements faced the same fate. Multiple members of the organization, verified by The Review, personally witnessed other students removing the posters. One student, who asked to remain anonymous, shared a particularly egregious experience with The Review. While [s]he was studying in a dormitory common room, a group entered and attempted to tear down CR event flyers. While the group initially left after politely being asked not to remove the posters, a smaller group returned to claim it was their “freedom of speech” to rip the flyers. As the students proceeded to reach for the flyer, our source said [s]he raised her hand to de-escalate the situation and try to foster a civil conversation; however, [s]he was physically grabbed, and a member of the group promptly tore up the poster. The following morning, the student woke up to see crumpled event posters under her door, presumably from the same offending party. The event also drew the ire of several campus groups. One week prior to the event, the Dartmouth Democrats issued a statement that proclaimed: “Any benefit these speakers’ words could bring to the diversity of thought and pool of intellectual ideas at Dartmouth would be more than exceeded by the damage of their fear mongering and lies.” This proclamation was notable as it expressed condemnation from Dartmouth’s largest student organization. The Review reached out to Dartmouth Democrats Communications Director Gabriela Rodriguez ‘23, but received no response. The Dartmouth Editorial Board also released a condemnation of the event, urging the College Republicans to “pick speakers who make a habit of telling the truth,” particularly in reference to the panelists’ positions on the 2020 Presidential Election and COVID-19. The Dartmouth also accused the College Republicans of engaging in “the same thoughtless and sensational tactics that initially led to their relative disappearance from campus life,” referring to the failed February 2020 featuring then-NH Senate Candidate Corky Messner which was cancelled due to dubious claims of violent threats. Indeed, The Review extensively covered that debacle and was the first to report on the dramatized allegations which catalyzed implosion and spurred resignations in the College Republicans. Nevertheless, there are stark differences between this week’s event and the 2020 Corky Messner one. In 2020, the College Republicans deliberately provoked students by issuing a campus-wide email with a subject heading that read “They’re bringing in drugs.” The Review also criticized this incendiary headline in its reporting almost two years ago as counterintuitive to constructive discourse on campus. However, this year, no provocative statements were issued; advertisements and emails simply included the title of the event — “The Future of the Republican Party” — and photos of the speakers. Opposition to the 2020 Messner event was due to offensive messaging surrounding an important discussion on the bipartisan issue of border security. This time, opposition was due to the mere presence of the speakers themselves. Admittedly, from a policy lens, I am not quite fond of Rep. Madison Cawthorn and the other speakers. Being vaguely familiar with their rhetoric and propositions, I don’t find their commentary to be particularly insightful. Unlike him, I do not believe the 2020 presidential election was stolen, and I believe politicians and representatives should play an active role in encouraging the public to get vaccinated. Nevertheless, I also don’t believe it is right to condemn and attempt to derail an event featuring an elected official serving in one of the nation’s highest offices. Freedom of expression inevitably leads to uncomfortable situations; however, it also invites the opportunity to challenge ideas. Unfortunately, not all campus criticism towards the event was constructive, to say the least. As event posters were ripped down, many were replaced by slanderous leaflets defaming the College Republicans, Cawthorn, Leavitt, and Bruesewitz with extreme language. One poster that circulated was titled “Silence Fascists, Protect Students, Protect Freedoms,” and stated “the ‘free speech’ defense is a lie” and to “let [the College Republicans] cry ‘free speech’ as we tear down their posters.” A similar poster labelled Karoline Leavitt a “pro-forced birth extremist [who supports] cops who murder civilians,” and another flyer accused Cawthorn of being a “white supremacist, imperialist, misogynist and sexual predator.” In total, four different poster templates were circulated around campus to express opposition to the event. Notwithstanding the extreme language, The Review admires these activists’ dedication to arts and crafts. While no campus group took responsibility for tearing down posters and replacing them with vitriolic flyers, it is presumable that the culprits were members of two campus far-left organizations: The Dartmouth Radical and Dartmouth Young Democratic Socialists. The Review reached out to these organizations but did not receive a response. However, it is plausible these campus clubs were behind the anti-event poster campaign, since these organizations also organized the event counter-protest. Dubbed the “Dartmouth Against Hate Rally,” roughly 50 students gathered outside Moore Hall during the Sunday event to chant generic protest slogans as attendees entered the auditorium, using rhetoric remarkably similar to language on the defamatory flyers. So, following this brouhaha in the lead up to the event, one might wonder: How did the panel actually go? On a positive note, the actual panel proceeded with few interruptions.

I did some googling and it turns out striped maples are a lot of people’s favorite tree. As trees go, they truly have an endearing personality. Why so popular? First there are the common names: striped maple for the green and brown striped bark of the young tree, goosefoot maple for the goosefoot-shaped leaves and snakebark maple because of the intricately-patterned bark that resembles snake skin. According to the Wild Seed Project, “Snakebark maples belong to a botanically and geophysically interesting group, or clade, of the widely distributed maple family. The snakebark maples have only one representative in North America, Acer pensylvanicum, while fourteen species are found in Asia, the greatest diversity of all the maples found on that continent.” I bet there is an interesting story in evolution behind this distribution. The distinctive, striped bark makes this the easiest tree to identify in our woods. No other tree has this kind of bark. I think this is another reason people tend to love these trees. I do believe identifying a tree brings us closer to it; it's like learning someone’s name as we make a new friend. Striped maple leaves are fairly distinctive. Like all maples, they have lobed leaves arranged in an opposite pattern along the branch. They usually have three forward-pointing, triangular lobes which are finely toothed. The leaves are floppy and paper-thin and range from a couple inches to a foot in size. Nature News: Leave no stone turned — Making rock stacks disturbs habitat The ones I saw were turning a pale yellow. They won’t attract leaf-peepers with the intensity of their autumn colors, but the pale yellow positively glows with an ethereal light in the dark understory. Aside from the variety of wildlife who eat its seeds, leaves and bark, as a generally small tree, striped maples provide diversity to the woods, adding a middle layer between the upper canopy and forest floor. Another possible reason for its popularity is this is a tree that usually grows at our level, not towering above us like the stately pines, oaks, beech and maple, and not hidden on the forest floor. They are human-sized and therefore approachable. In addition to the reasons given above, this is one of my favorites because of its distribution. It likes moist upland woods. I most commonly see striped maples on hikes in the mountains, though the first striped maple I ever met was on a tiny hill in coastal York, Maine. Their natural range extends from southeastern Canada down to the mountains of northern Georgia. If the above isn’t reason enough to love this tree, striped maples have a fascinating sex life. They are known, scientifically, as sequential hermaphrodites, meaning they can change their sex. Striped maples are dioecious - a given tree is either male or female (unlike monecious trees that have both male and female flowers). It turns out most striped maples in a forest are males. At some point in a male striped maple’s life, some switch gender (as soon as just three weeks before flowering!). Nature News: Green elf cups create prized colorful wood One idea is that this is in response to stress; when the trees get older or are stressed by too much grazing or changes in light levels, the male trees switch to female and set seed as a way to ensure they parent some offspring before dying (for a more detailed discussion of this check out “Striped Maple-Sex in the Understory” at learnyourland.com). If you are re-wilding your backyard, this is a tree to think about planting. Squirrels and grouse eat the seeds; rabbits, deer and moose like the bark and young shoots. They are home to a large number of moths and butterflies, attract native pollinators when in flower and have a beautiful form year round. The University of Maine Cooperative Extension has more information if you are interested in adding these to your backyard.
