The smallest planet in our solar system was getting photographed Friday by a European-Japanese space probe making its closest trip past the sphere on its seven-year mission. The BepiColombo mission made its first flyby of Mercury around 7:34 p.m. ET on Friday, passing within 124 miles (200 kilometers) of the planet\'s surface. ""BepiColombo is now as close to Mercury as it will get in this first of six Mercury flybys,"" the European Space Agency (ESA) said on Twitter. During the flyby, BepiColombo is collecting science data and images, and sending them back to Earth. The mission, jointly managed by the ESA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, launched in October 2018. It will ultimately make six total flybys of Mercury before entering orbit around the planet in December 2025. The mission will actually place two probes in orbit around Mercury: the ESA-led Mercury Planetary Orbiter and the JAXA-led Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter, Mio. The orbiters will remain stacked in their current configuration with the Mercury Transfer Module until deployment in 2025. Once the Bepicolombo spacecraft approaches Mercury to begin orbit, the Mercury Transfer Module part of the spacecraft will separate and the two orbiters will begin circling the planet. Both probes will spend a year collecting data to help scientists better understand the small, mysterious planet, such as determining more about the processes that unfold on its surface and its magnetic field. This information could reveal the origin and evolution of the closest planet to the sun. During Friday\'s flyby, the spacecraft\'s main camera was being shielded and unable to capture high-resolution images. But two of the spacecraft\'s three monitoring cameras will take photos of the planet\'s northern and southern hemispheres just after the close approach from about 621 miles (1,000 kilometers). BepiColombo will fly by the planet\'s night side, so images during the closest approach wouldn\'t be able to show much detail. The mission team anticipates the images will show large impact craters that are scattered across Mercury\'s surface, much like our moon. The researchers can use the images to map Mercury\'s surface and learn more about the planet\'s composition. Some of the instruments on both orbiters will be turned on during the flyby so they can get a first whiff of Mercury\'s magnetic field, plasma and particles. The flyby has a timely occurrence on the 101st anniversary of Giuseppe ""Bepi"" Colombo\'s birthday, the Italian scientist and engineer who is the namesake of the mission. Colombo\'s work helped explain Mercury\'s rotation as it orbits the sun and enabled NASA\'s Mariner 10 spacecraft to perform three Mercury flybys rather than just one by using a gravity assist from Venus. He determined that the point where spacecraft fly by planets could actually help make future passes possible. Mariner 10 was the first spacecraft sent to study Mercury, and it successfully completed its three flybys in 1974 and 1975. Next, NASA sent its Messenger spacecraft to perform three flybys of Mercury in 2008 and 2009, and it orbited the planet from 2011 to 2015. Now, BepiColombo will take up the task of providing scientists with the best information to unlock the planet\'s mysteries as the second mission to orbit Mercury and the most complex one to date. ""We\'re really looking forward to seeing the first results from measurements taken so close to Mercury\'s surface,"" said Johannes Benkhoff, ESA\'s BepiColombo project scientist, in a statement. ""When I started working as project scientist on BepiColombo in January 2008, NASA\'s Messenger mission had its first flyby at Mercury. Now it\'s our turn. It\'s a fantastic feeling!"" Little is known about the history, surface or atmosphere of Mercury, which is notoriously difficult to study because of its proximity to the sun. It\'s the least explored of the four rocky planets of the inner solar system, including Venus, Earth and Mars. The sun\'s brightness behind Mercury makes the little planet hard to observe from Earth, too. BepiColombo will have to fire xenon gas constantly from two of four specially designed engines in order to permanently brake against the sun\'s enormous gravitational pull. Its distance from Earth also makes it difficult to reach -- more energy is required to allow BepiColombo to ""fall"" toward the planet than is needed when sending missions to Pluto. A heat shield and titanium insulation have also been applied to the spacecraft to protect it from intense heat of up to 662 degrees Fahrenheit (350 degrees Celsius). The instruments on the two orbiters will investigate ice within the planet\'s polar craters, why it has a magnetic field, and the nature of the ""hollows"" on the planet\'s surface. Mercury is full of mysteries for such a small planet, just slightly larger than our moon. What scientists do know is that during the day, temperatures can reach highs of 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius), but the planet\'s thin atmosphere means that it can dip to negative 290 degrees Fahrenheit (negative 180 degrees Celsius) at night. Even though Mercury is the closest planet to the sun at about 36 million miles (58 million kilometers) from our star on average, the hottest planet in our solar system is actually Venus because it has a dense atmosphere. But Mercury is definitely the fastest of the planets, completing one orbit around the sun every 88 days -- which is why it was named for the quick, wing-footed messenger of the Roman gods. If we could stand on the surface of Mercury, the sun would appear three times larger than it does on Earth and the sunlight would be blinding because it\'s seven times brighter. Mercury\'s unusual rotation and oval-shaped orbit around the sun means our star seems to quickly rise, set and rise again on some parts of the planet, and a similar phenomenon occurs at sunset.

(KY3) - Investigators found the bodies of 50-year-old Shawna Kipp and 59-year-old Don Kipp in their home after a fire Wednesday morning. Shawna’s friends, and coworkers spoke out about their loss. “If you had her in your life, you were so incredibly fortunate,” said Crystal Copeland. Over the last ten years, Copeland and Shawna Kipp have become close friends. “When you met her, you immediately felt comfortable and at ease and just at peace with her because... so kind and giving of herself and her time and her love,” Copeland said. “Absolutely genuine. You would never doubt that her care and compassion was just who she was. She didn’t know how to be any other way.” Copeland works with bail bonds and judicial services. She met Shawna through her work at Dee Wampler’s law office. “I mean, if she was gone one day, we missed her,” Wampler said. Wampler said Shawna had worked for him for about ten years. “Dependable, consistent, well-liked,” he said. “She was a ten.” Wampler said Shawna started as a secretary, but quickly worked her way up to become the office manager. Before working for him, she was an executive assistant at the Springfield-News Leader. Wampler said she was continuing to grow and achieve. “She had some college credit and was attending MSU and getting her degree in business,” he said. Shawna and her husband Don’s home went up in flames early Wednesday morning. Their bodies were found inside. Investigators have not revealed how they died. The Kipps had five children between them and multiple grandchildren. Wampler’s staff learned about Shawna’s death the day of the fire. Hearts are still hurting in the office. “It’s a tragedy. I don’t know the details yet,” Wampler said. “All I can say is, we’ll miss her.” Copeland said Shawna could brighten anyone’s day with a smile that will be sorely missed. “If you were loved by Shawna you knew you were loved immensely and wholly,” Copeland said.

Pittsburg Sheriff Addresses Fake News Surrounding Cassidy Rainwater Case DALLAS COUNTY, Mo. – “99.999999% of what has been posted to social media is CRAP,” stated Dallas County Sheriff Scott Rice, addressing fake news surrounding the Cassidy Rainwater case. Sheriff Rice addressed misinformation and rumors on social media Thursday evening, October 7, 2021. Someone reported Rainwater missing in August. No one had seen her since July. The FBI got a tip about her whereabouts and alerted the Dallas County Sheriff’s Office. They obtained a search warrant and collected evidence from the home of James Phelps. Authorities later arrested him and Timothy Norton. Prosecutors have charged both suspects in the kidnapping of Rainwater. But, she is still missing. Authorities are releasing information as they decide appropriate, reminding folks that this is an ongoing investigation. “We are working in the real-world and this is an active ongoing investigation. When all members of the prosecution team believe that it is appropriate to release information, we will keep you informed. Until that time, I can tell you we have all parties involved with Cassidy Rainwater’s case in jail and we expect additional charges to be filed in the coming days,” stated Sheriff Rice on social media. The following is Sheriff Rice’s statement via the Dallas County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page. “Addressing Fake News:There is a lot of misinformation and rumors regarding the Cassidy Rainwater case being circulated across social media and various news platforms. While I understand the impatience and curiosity of the people, I’m going to give you a piece of advice. It is not a good idea to listen to “a crime reporter/blogger “or Tic Tok videos that is sitting in their apartment or their mommy and daddy’s basement eating Great Value cheese puffs and drinking box wine with grand intentions of being a social media superstar. If you are hanging on very word is this type of crap, believing it to be fact, you are living in a fantasy world. This isn’t a tv series or movie where we go to commercial break and have lab results in 15 minutes. Searching a crime scene for 7 days 24 hours a day takes that long, 168 hours. 99.999999% of what has been posted to social media is CRAP. Law Enforcement Officers must play within the rules of the American Criminal Justice system. While the system has its faults, it’s still the best system in the world. We are judged by a jury of our peers with a Judge presiding over the case, a Prosecutor who presents the case, and a Defense attorney who defends their client. This is where ALL facts of the case come out, not Tic Tok, Facebook, or any other social media outlet. NO, you are not entitled to a play by play of an ongoing investigation. If you want to be in the know, we are hiring along with every other law enforcement agency in the country. We are working in the real-world and this is an active ongoing investigation. When all members of the prosecution team believe that it is appropriate to release information, we will keep you informed. Until that time, I can tell you we have all parties involved with Cassidy Rainwater’s case in jail and we expect additional charges to be filed in the coming days. If you are not a resident and are planning a trip into our Beautiful County to sightsee, remember a few things. While the citizens of Dallas County are friendly, neighborly, caring, and kind people, we do not like those who show up to trespass, litter, vandalize, harass, or destroy property. If this is your intention, you are not welcome here and we will prosecute you for this. Sheriff Rice.” On August 26, 2021, the Dallas County, Missouri Sheriff’s Office took a missing person report. The reporting party told authorities that Cassidy Rainwater had been missing since July 25, 2021. The Sheriff’s Office says she has associations in Dallas, Laclede and Greene Counties in southwest Missouri. After the report of Rainwater’s disappearance, authorities questioned James Phelps at his home on Moon Valley Road. Investigators believe he was the last person to be in contact with her. According to a Fox affiliate, Phelps acknowledged that Rainwater had been staying with him while she got back on her feet. However, he claims he hadn’t seen her since she left his property a month prior. Authorities looked in the loft on his property where she was staying. They found it “stripped” with no personal belongings of Rainwater’s. They then left the property. On Sept. 16, the FBI office in Kansas City received an anonymous tip, which included a photo of Rainwater in a cage. The FBI forwarded that information to the Dallas County Sheriff’s Office. That same day, the Sheriff’s Office got a search warrant for James Phelps’ phone. They found several photos of Rainwater locked in a cage, according to court documents. During a search of the property, deputies and federal agents took items for the investigation. Authorities have not disclosed what those items were. Since the tip and search of the property, authorities have arrested two people. Prosecutors charged James Phelps and Timothy Norton with felony kidnapping. According to court documents, investigators said Norton admitted he helped Phelps to restrain Rainwater. Norton and Phelps are in the Dallas County Jail without bond. The suspects appeared in court on Tuesday, Oct. 5, 2021, via Polycom for a criminal hearing. The courts set a preliminary hearing for November 5 at 9:30 a.m. Investigators say the home of alleged kidnapper James Phelps burned to the ground late Monday night, October 4, 2021. Multiple fire crews responded to the scene on Moon Valley Road in the Windyville area of Dallas County, Missouri. They worked to put out hotspots. According to a Fox affiliate, while out there, a Dallas County deputy found something that resembled a tripwire. The Springfield bomb squad responded to investigate. Authorities say they detonated an explosive device near the area of the fire. Previous Article: Home of alleged kidnapper James Phelps burns down COPYRIGHT 2022 BY KOAM NEWS NOW. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
