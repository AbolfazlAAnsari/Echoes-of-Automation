(Image from U.S. News & World Report) It was a short reign at the top for the Rocket City. After coming in at No. 1 last year, Huntsville has fallen to No. 2, according to U.S. News & World Report’s 2023-2024 Best Places to Live report. This is still an improvement from two years ago, when Huntsville was No. 3. The new No. 1 is Green Bay, Wisconsin. That city was No. 3 in last year’s rankings. U.S. News & World Report Real Estate Editor Devon Thorsby said this of Huntsville’s one-spot drop: ""Huntsville saw its scores for desirability and quality of life improve this year, but slight drops in affordability and its job market were the biggest causes of losing the top spot in the Best Places to Live rankings to Green Bay, Wisconsin,” he said. “Of course, that doesn’t mean Huntsville performs poorly in either of those categories – it’s the fourth most affordable place to live out of the 150 metro areas ranked, and is No. 9 for its job market. “This year we incorporated how the cost of goods and services compare to other metro areas into our affordability score with housing costs, which led to a very slight drop for Huntsville’s score. “For the job market, the average annual salary doesn’t appear to be rising quite as fast as some other parts of the country, but still has a rock-bottom average annual salary."" Mayor Tommy Battle said he takes pride in this achievement. “Huntsville is proud to once again join this impressive listing of dynamic cities,” Mayor Battle said. “Whether we’re #2, #1 or #15, we’ll continue our focus on sustainable growth and maintaining the exceptional quality of life that our residents deserve.” Three other Alabama cities made the Top 150: Birmingham fell from No. 71 last year to No. 80 this year; Montgomery jumped to No. 94 after coming in at No. 125 last year; and Mobile hit No. 115, up from last year’s No. 130.

(Atlanta News First) - Atlanta is mourning the loss of a beloved legend in baseball. Levi Walker, Jr., known by the community as Atlanta Braves mascot Chief Noc-A-Homa, died Friday afternoon with family by his side. Walker served as the Braves’ mascot from 1966 to 1985 and became famous for doing a dance on the pitcher’s mound before games and interacting with fans and players. In July 2022, the 80-year-old chief was rushed to the Northeast Georgia Medical Center after his health began declining. READ: Former Braves mascot Chief Noc-A-Homa in failing health “I’ve been blessed by the fans to be the mascot for the Atlanta Braves,” Chief Noc-A-Homa said last year. “He loved baseball,” Walker’s daughter, Gwyn Walker Newman, said. For Walker, a full-blood member of the Odawa Tribe, the mission was simple: he wanted to represent Native Americans on a large stage. In the late 60s, he noticed there wasn’t a lot of representation going on with Atlanta Braves mascot Chief Noc-A-Homa, who to that point, was portrayed by white men. His former wife, Mary Mularz, recounted how Walker convinced the Braves to let him take over the role. “He goes in with his full Indian outfit on and says that he wants to speak to the general manager, and the secretary says into the phone, ‘There’s an Indian out here who wants to talk with you,’” she said. Perhaps surprisingly, Braves management agreed, and a legend was born. For the next 17 years, the Chief became a fixture of Atlanta baseball at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. One reporter even wrote that kids might not know who Jeff Burroughs or Andy Messersmith were, but they sure as heck knew Chief Noc-A-Homa. “People I went to high school with, friends, other adults tell me, ‘We didn’t go to see the Braves. We went to see your dad,’” Walker Newman said. “They went to see my dad!” On-field feats that included pre-game rain dances and perfect form running. He was there when Hank Aaron hit his 715th home run and when Rick Camp hit his only home run. The Chief was a celebrity who would draw a crowd in public. Noc-A-Homa rubbed elbows with Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter and rock stars like Jerry Reed, but he always had time for his biggest fans: the kids, visiting them at stadiums and hospitals. “He was probably probably 6-8, something like that, and he was dying,” Walker Newman said, recalling a trip with her father to see a child with leukemia. “My dad made him happy.” In fact, it’s hard to find any photos or videos of the Chief where people aren’t smiling. Even after Chief Noc-A-H retired before the 1986 season, the persona lived on in a generation of fans. “People would flock around him, because they loved him,” Newman Walker said. “He had this charisma.” That charisma was important to create an environment that could cross over cultural barriers and help Atlanta fall in love with baseball. “I’m going to miss him,” Walker Newman said.

(CNN) — General Motors’ stronger-than-expected third quarter profit was greeted by an an expansion of the strike at the company by the United Auto Workers union. Just hours after the earnings report was released the UAW announced that 5,000 members would go on strike at one of GM’s most profitable plants. The Arlington, Texas, assembly plant that produces full-size SUVs like the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, the GMC Yukon, and the Cadillac Escalade. The union pointed to the better than expected GM financial results as the reason for its strike. “As we’ve said for months: record profits equal record contracts.” said UAW President Shawn Fain. “It’s time GM workers, and the whole working class, get their fair share.” While the company results were good, they were not a record for the quarter. The $8.9 billion in adjusted income over the course of the first nine months is up nearly 11% from the same period last year, when GM did report a record profit. But the cost of the strike is likely to cause full-year income to fall from last year’s record levels. The company said that the strike cost it $200 million in its first two weeks of the quarter. But those costs have risen since then, with $600 million in costs during the first three weeks of this month, or about $200 million a week. That’s because Tuesday’s expansion of the strike at GM is not the first time that UAW has increased the reach of the work stoppage at the company. GM said there was no reason for an expansion of the strike, and that the union and company were making progress at the bargaining table. “We are disappointed by the escalation of this unnecessary and irresponsible strike,” said the company’s statement. The UAW has been on strike against GM as well as rivals Ford and Stellantis since September 15. The targeted strike started with work stoppages at one assembly plant for each of the automakers and 12,700 on strike but has grown since then. There are now more than 45,000 autoworkers on strike, with 14,200 members on strike at GM alone. The union has previously struck two assembly plants at GM, in Wentzville, Missouri, and Lansing, Michigan, as well as a network of 18 parts and distribution centers nationwide. GM has offered the UAW a record contract with the pay scale increasing 23% over the life of the contract that runs through 2028, along with cost-of-living adjustments to protect workers from rising prices and larger contributions to their retirement accounts. But Fain told members on Friday that GM and the other automakers can afford to pay even more and that the union needs to win an even better contract to make up for concessions the union provided in the past when the companies were struggling financially. The company withdrew its guidance to investors about profits for the full year. “We made the decision to pull the guidance mainly due to the uncertainty around the strike,” said CFO Paul Jacobson in an interview on CNBC. “We don’t want to speculate where the next plant might be hit or how long it might last.” He said before the strike the company was performing at the top end of its earlier earnings guidance. He said he believes investors understand the situation with the strike hitting results. “There’s obviously uncertainty out there. I think the answer is to try to get everybody back to work as quickly as possible, and that’s what we’re committed to do,” he said. “The negotiations get very, very complicated at the table. I’d rather leave those [details] in the room. We’re doing our best to meet the UAW where they’re asking, and where we’re able to do that.” As to the third quarter results, company’s earnings per share rose to $2.28, up from $2.25, in the past quarter. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv had forecast earnings would decline sharply to $1.88 per share. Investors look closely at that measure when judging financial performance. GM’s adjusted net income slipped to $3.1 billion from $3.3 billion a year earlier. But the company boosted its earnings per share over the course of the year by buying back its own stock, a controversial tactic critics say artificially inflates companies’ share price without improving a company’s finances. Revenue rose 5% to $44.1 billion, which also topped forecasts of $43.7 billion. In a letter to shareholders, GM CEO Mary Barra addressed the strike and the cost of whatever new contract is reached. “It’s been clear coming out of Covid that wages and benefits across the US economy would need to increase because of inflation and other factors,” Barra wrote. She said the company’s current offer to the union “rewards our team members but does not put our company and their jobs at risk.” “Clearly, given the industry’s changing pricing and demand outlook and higher labor costs, we have work to do” to hit the company’s stated earnings targets in years ahead, she said. “The work has already begun and I’m confident we will achieve our targets and grow from there.” The strike is not the only headwind faced by the company. While US profitability is strong, international operations were only slightly better than break even, even though US sales amounted to only 42% of its global sales. The strike is affecting only the company’s US operations. While US sales were up 21% from a year earlier, supply chain issues, particularly a shortage of computer chips, limited the inventory of its vehicles for sales. But sales in China, which had been GM’s largest market, fell 14%, which the company attributed to greater market competition there. Its Chinese sales are now nearly 20% below US sales. The company also reported its costs rose nearly $1 billion compared to a year earlier, which it said was primarily driven by EV-related costs, lower pension income and higher warranty costs. It said the mix of vehicles sold also trimmed about $600 million off of its operating income in the quarter compared to a year ago, which it said is due a more normal mix of vehicles with the greater supply of products for sale. And operating income from GM Financial also slipped about $200 million from a year ago in the face of higher interest rates. But it offset much of those costs with the strong sales and pricing, which together lifted operating income by about $1.2 billion. Shares of GM were little changed in early trading following the report and the strike announcement. The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.
