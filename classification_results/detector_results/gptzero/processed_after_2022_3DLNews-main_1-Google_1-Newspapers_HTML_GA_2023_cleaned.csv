Low 67F. Winds light and variable.. Cloudy skies. Low 67F. Winds light and variable. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:10 pm Matt Henry with a 30-plus pound Clarks Hill Lake Striper. Let’s be honest, there may be no more perfect a gun than a good rimfire. Specifically, a good .22 long rifle. Whether in a pistol, revolver, semi-auto rifle, or a bolt gun, this is just a fun cartridge to shoot! .22s make me feel like a kid again, and that’s not easy. I get a grin as big as the big bend of Florida when I just think of shooting one of my .22s. There are lot of good reasons why this is so, but it all boils down to just good clean fun! A .22 is too often looked at as a child’s gun or something only beginners would shoot. I would argue that there is not a more important gun you can buy than a good .22 rimfire. Why? Simple. It is a gun with little to no recoil, it’s affordable to shoot, it comfortably teaches the basics, it doesn’t require a 200-yard range to practice on. These are all positives in my opinion. Shooting a .22 at 30 to 50 yards and learning to head shoot squirrels, rabbits, coons and other small game is a great way to become a very fine rifleman or pistol shot. Now, if you are new to guns or wanting to get into shooting, what .22s should you look for? That is a good question. For an all-purpose .22 rifle, two come to mind. The 10/22 Ruger, which is probably the most popular .22 ever made. Next, is a good bolt action .22 of some kind. Ruger and CZ make excellent and extremely accurate ones for very affordable prices. One of my favorites is the Ruger American with 16-inch barrel in 22LR. I run mine with a Vortex 3-9 by 40 scope on it and have taken squirrels out to 75 yards. I have shot it out to 100, but that is a far shot in the woods… For a pistol or revolver, what do you need? Reliability. Period. That’s first and foremost in your consideration. In my opinion, that means something along the following lines: Ruger Single Six is one of the best revolvers you can get, in my honest opinion. I’ve owned several of them and still do. I love them, and for the money they are awesome. For a semi-auto, I would recommend a Browning Buckmark Camper if you can find one. It’s a simple gun with no frills, but, in my experience, it always goes bang with almost any ammo. If you pick a Buckmark, that is suppressor-ready you can have an incredibly quiet and reliable gun. It’s fun to shoot and mostly accurate beyond our ability to shoot. Let’s no longer leave the .22 in the background. Let’s bring these fun guns back into the forefront of the American shooting experience. If you don’t have a couple, then consider this permission to go out and buy a few! Load up on ammo and take the whole family out shooting. It’s good clean fun and then you can all go small game hunting. I can smell the squirrel wings now.

But just before 6 p.m. on the sixth day of fall, five people wearing headlamps carefully descended about 25 of the cave’s 444 wet, rock steps to the gate. There they set up a harp trap designed to catch bats as they leave one of the largest hibernacula in the state at dusk.Tonie Rocke, Ph.D., research scientist for the U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) National Wildlife Health Center, and an energetic interagency team of biologists dressed head to toe in protective suits and worked feverishly on a cold September night under a full moon. Wearing the protective suit was part of the protocol of the mission when working in bat roosts. Just outside the mouth of the popular summer tourist attraction, the team tested the efficacy of a potentially lifesaving treatment for the animals. The treatment is a vaccine that helps protect bats from white-nose syndrome, which is caused by a fungal infection. It is one of the most devastating wildlife diseases and has killed millions of bats across North America since its emergence in 2007.“Vaccinating bats was one of the alternative management strategies identified during our structured decision-making workshop,” said Rita Dixon, Ph.D., state wildlife action plan coordinator for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. “Because Tonie Rocke had started her vaccine trial, we had the opportunity to work with her to vaccinate bats at Minnetonka Cave as a preventive measure in advance of the disease.”Up until last year, there were no signs of Pseudogymnoascus destructans, or Pd, which is the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome, among the winter residents of the cave. This is the seventh location, including bat colonies and maternity roosts, Rocke’s team has visited this year to administer an experimental vaccine authorized for field trials by the USDA. Minnetonka Cave serves as a winter roost for at least seven bat species and is one of the largest and most species-rich bat habitats in the state. In June 2022, Idaho Fish and Game found that six bats in this cave tested positive for Pd. These included three species, Little Brown Myotis, Long-legged Myotis, and Yuma Myotis – all of which are susceptible to white-nose syndrome.The fungus thrives in cold dark environments, grows on a bat’s skin and is easily spread. Pd is normally found within a cave one or two seasons before bats develop white-nose syndrome.Rocke represents the part of the USGS that conducts research on wildlife diseases.

Rocke said the vaccine is mixed with a raccoon pox virus vaccine vector, which is a kind of vaccine that only affects the bats for a short time. The research is to learn whether boosting the bats’ immune system for a little longer will help them ward off the effects of the fungus. The treatment is likely to be most effective prior to or immediately after the fungus shows up in a cave where bats hibernate.Dixon said they didn’t see any clinical signs of white-nose syndrome or anything else concerning on the bats that took the 10-minute journey through the assembly line.

Editor’s note: This is the fourth in a series of profiles of Coweta County municipalities. The first profile, on Sharpsburg, ran in the Aug. 16 edition of The Newnan Times-Herald. The second, on Senoia, ran in the Aug. 30 edition and the third, on Turin, ran in the Oct. 4 edition. Grantville is a city in transition – and with that comes hard work, growing pains and a lot of change. But it also brings growth, business and, if done right, economic prosperity, according to some of the local business owners and community leaders. Sean Kilpatrick, who opened the Beyond Mountains Coffee Shop in downtown Grantville about 15 months ago, said he has seen things happening in the city in the time he has been working there. “I think the socioeconomic demographic is changing,” Kilpatrick said. Grantville is becoming a young city with the average age of residents at about 32, and residents are doing well with average household incomes of just more than $80,000, according to Grantville Mayor Richard Proctor. But it’s more than that, Kilpatrick said. “I think the influence in Grantville is that there are more people sitting at the table making decisions but then also buying in and investing,” he said. “And they’re bringing with them experience from other places.” Promoting growth The city’s population has been sitting steady for more than a decade even as the rest of the county has been growing by leaps and bounds, said Proctor. Al Grieshaber, who has been serving as Grantville’s city manager since 2015, said that’s at least in part because the city’s leadership liked it that way – but that seems to be changing. “Our present administration has an eye to smart growth, starting with upgrading our utility system to handle it,” he said. Proctor agreed. Since he’s been in office, he said, he and the council members have been working hard to address insufficient infrastructure. For instance, he said that now 98 percent of Grantville residents now have access to high-speed internet through Comcast, and the company will cover new developments in the city. He anticipates that within 10 years, the population of Grantville will balloon from 3,369 to about 10,000, and with it the commercial offerings to serve those residents, Proctor said. “I also envision us having some things out on (U.S. Highway) 29 like a grocery store, some other eating places,” he said. “I envision the downtown becoming just a very special place to come, to have festivals, attract music.” There are already some signs of life in the city’s downtown, but there’s a long way to go. Main Street is bisected by the railroad and on either side is a depot — one, a passenger depot that was renovated about five years ago, the other a freight depot that will be renovated soon. The city was recently awarded and accepted a grant to renovate it for use as a venue. Currently, the rest of the downtown is a hodgepodge of renovated buildings, businesses, dilapidated buildings and empty buildings. Remnants of history The mill village and the former Grantville Hosiery Mill are remnants of what was once the city’s largest employer. According to the West Georgia Textile Trail website, the mill began operating in 1896 or 1897. The mill was expanded in 1899 and again in 1903, bringing the number of employees to 125, the website states. By 1957, the mill employed 600. Housing was built around the mill to accommodate the hundreds of employees, and much of that housing is still occupied. Eventually the mill changed hands and the new owner, Flaggs-Utica Corporation, shut down the hosiery mill and modernized the yarn mill. After changing hands a couple more times, the mill was shut down completely in 1980 under the weight of competition from foreign imports, the website states. The city purchased one of the decaying mill properties in the city’s Mill Village, and council members are currently planning to demolish the building and use the property to create a venue for city residents, and maybe even the whole county, Proctor said. The old mill sits within the city’s Historic District, which has been listed on the National Register of Historic places since 1991. It’s been a source of debate as the city’s Historical Commission and council members wrangled over whether the building was salvageable. The residents of Mill Village have had a front porch view of the old mill’s slow ruin, and many came to a public meeting about a year ago to argue both for and against saving the structure. Selma Coty, a former member of the city’s Historical Commission and a resident firmly in the “save the mill” contingent, said the city needs to honor its history. But she’s afraid the structures that helped build Grantville and make it unique will soon slip away, Coty said. But she also knows development has to happen to keep the city growing and thriving, Coty added. She noted that when WinPak moved into Senoia, it created a wave of growth, and now Senoia is flourishing. Developing Grantville The mill is just one part of hundreds of acres of property within the city limits that could be developed, Grieshaber said. Currently there are 509 acres of undeveloped land on Minnie Sewell Road, 196 acres along Interstate 85 and two more properties along Highway 29, totaling just over 100 acres. “We would certainly enjoy industrial development in an appropriately zoned location,” he said. For instance, 209 acres on Minnie Sewell Road are zoned industrial, he said. Property off Exit 35 of Interstate 85 has been proposed for industrial use but isn’t zoned industrial currently, he said. There is also acreage near Highway 29 that potentially could be rezoned industrial under certain circumstances, Grieshaber said. But any of the properties could be used for residential, industrial or commercial growth, he said. “They can all be rezoned if the appropriate need is there,” Grieshaber said. Still, Proctor said he doesn’t see the city becoming an industrial base again. Since the city lost its mill, it’s become a bedroom community with people commuting to work in other cities and coming home to Grantville. He believes people enjoy that escape to a quieter, more rural area, Proctor said. Grieshaber agreed. “I think it is inevitable that when you have a community such as Grantville that is safe and secure for the residents, it becomes very attractive,” he said. Challenges and opportunities But the city has to address some challenges. The city is approaching its sewer capacity — it’s at 98 percent capacity with its current infrastructure, Proctor said. He believes the solution is on the horizon, although he said he couldn’t release any details yet. And it’s not only insufficient infrastructure that has hurt the town. For years, Grantville leadership’s inability to get along has been well documented in The Newnan Times-Herald. Name-calling and bickering has led to lawsuits, difficulty keeping boards filled and a general lack of progress. Coty, a resident'}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:58 pm Tiger senior Brooks Longgrear waits to run in Friday’s season home opener against Islands. The roar of the two-time state champion Metter Tigers is definitely being heard in the early days of the 2023 season as Metter has come away with three straight wins in the first week of baseball action. On Feb. 16, the Tigers won their season opener over Wheeler County 2-1 while playing in Alamo. Both of Metter’s scores came in the fifth inning when Brooks Longgrear scored on a ground out by Jayden Deloach and Trey Hall scored on a sacrifice fly by Seth Dekle. The game turned into a pitcher’s duel, with both teams strong on the mound. Tiger junior Rustan Rigdon was the winning pitcher for Metter. The righty went four innings, allowing zero runs on one hit, striking out nine and walking one. Kaliq Jordan threw three innings in relief out of the bullpen. He recorded the last nine outs to earn the save. Hall and Jordan had one hit each to lead the Tigers. Defensively, Metter committed no errors, and Kaden Hobbs had the most chances in the field with 13. Against Toombs County in Lyons on Feb. 20, the Tigers opened scoring immediately en route to their 5-4 win. The first run came in the first inning when Kaliq Jordan scored on a wild pitch and Brooks Longgrear scored after a batter was walked while bases were loaded. Toombs County tied things up at the bottom of the first. After two scoreless innings, Metter added a third score in the fourth. Bases were again loaded when Kaliq Jordan drew a walk, allowing Tyranski Spann to score. Metter now had a 3-2 lead. In the sixth, Metter added two more when a single by Trey Hall scored Rustan Rigdon and Reco Coney to advance the Tiger lead to 5-2. Toombs answered with one run in the sixth and one run in the seventh, but it was not enough as Metter went on to take the win. Reco Coney was on the mound for Metter, going one inning, allowing two runs on two hits and striking out two. Hall, Jordan, Longgrear and Rigdon had one hit each for Metter. In the home opener of the season, Metter took a decisive 8-1 win over Islands of Savannah on Friday. The Tigers got the bulk of their score -- six runs -- thanks to a huge first inning that was driven by singles by Kaliq Jordan, Brooks Longgrear, Jayden Deloach, Smith Dekle and Carter Gainous. Trey Hall, Rustan Rigdon, Jordan, Longgrear, Dekle and Gainous all crossed home plate. Metter’s remaining two scores came in the bottom of the third when Smith Dekle doubled on a line drive, scoring Deloach before crossing home plate himself on an error by the first baseman. The Islands’ lone score came in the fourth inning. Jordan was the winning pitcher for Metter. He lasted four innings, allowing three hits and one run while striking out four and walking one. Rustan Rigdon threw three innings in relief out of the bullpen. Metter had 11 hits in the game, with Jordan, Dekle and Longgrear each managing multiple hits for the Tigers. Jordan led with three hits in three at bats. After hosting Calvary Day in Savannah on Tuesday, the Tigers will travel to Athens on Friday to take on Prince Avenue Christian at 7 p.m. They will be on the road on Friday, March 4, when they travel to Savannah to take on Savannah Christian at 2 p.m. and will travel to Emanuel County Institute for a 5:30 p.m. match-up on March 7.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:04 pm In my last column I talked about unicorns. This week it is time to talk about something more serious: donkeys and elephants. We all know how rarely these political animals get along, but I have some good news. A recently proposed bill, HR 4756, is one of those infrequent examples of bipartisan cooperation. Being a newspaperman, the bill concerns a subject very near and dear to my heart: local news. As national news outlets and online “reporting” descend further into a maelstrom of partisanship and unreliability, members of the two big political parties seek new ways to encourage local news outlets and small businesses at the same time. Cutting through all the legalese, HR 4756 offers tax credits of up to $5,000 the first year and $2,500 thereafter to qualified small businesses that advertise with local newspapers. Killing two birds with one stone, the bill will give tax breaks to small businesses and it helps protect one of the last bastions of reliable fact-based reporting, the local newspaper. So far the bill’s list of supporters come from both sides of the political aisle and all across the country: André D. Carson (D-IN), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), William R. Keating (D-MA), Mike Lawler (R-NY), Marcus J. Molinaro (R-NY), Chris Pappas (D-NH), Jill Tokuda (D-HI) and our own Earl “Buddy” Carter (R-GA). Whatever one’s political party or personal feelings about “Buddy” Carter, it speaks well of him that he supports local newspapers. It says a lot when politicians of both parties can find common cause. The bill reads in part: “The term ‘local newspaper’ means any print or digital publication if the primary content of such publication is original content derived from primary sources and relating to news and current events, such publication primarily serves the needs of a regional or local community, the publisher of such publication employs at least one full-time local news journalist who resides in such regional or local community.” What is specifically important is the focus on “original content derived from primary sources”. The ominous implications of A.I.-generated content loom on the horizon, threatening a host of human jobs, including that of writers. It must be remembered that these “large language models” are designed to analyze, interpret and mimic preexisting written and spoken content. By their very nature they regurgitate, vomiting pre-processed information back up at the user. They do not use primary sources, especially for local news, because they are not out in the field and even if some of their content is original, it is almost certainly also derivative. A newspaper is an organization of flesh and blood men and women who “serves the needs of a regional or local community”. A.I. is a soulless product. It serves the needs and ideological bent of its corporate masters. The disclaimers on their user interfaces warn the unwary that it can give false information and incorrect answers. Meanwhile, with sober transparency, this piece appears in a section clearly marked “opinion”. It is based upon verifiable information from public sources, but as a servant of the local community a newspaper clearly labels anything with a particular slant upon facts or events one way or another. I’m telling you my slant. I think this bill is a good thing. If you take the time to read it, I think you will agree with me. We don’t have to agree on economic or foreign policy, the debt ceiling or anything else, but the nature of this country should always be that what we can agree on, we can easily make happen. I hope we can make this happen. On this very page, beneath the publisher’s information, The Blackshear Times quotes Thomas Jefferson, “When the press is free and every man able to read, all is safe.” Those are the words we in the newspaper business live by.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:10 pm During his career with the Greene County Sheriff’s Office, K-9 Deputy Oby was responsible for having made untold numbers of alerts that led to the seizure of various narcotics and cash during his 11 year career. GREENSBORO, Ga. — Condolences are being extended to Deputy Lt. Patrick Paquette and the Greene County Sheriff’s Office from law enforcement agencies across the state with sad news that the agency’s beloved K-9 Deputy “Oby” is dead. He was 13. Since he was 18 months old, Oby was not only Paquette’s loyal and dedicated partner in law enforcement, but a member of the Paquette household. Oby passed away about 9:30 a.m. Monday at the University of Georgia Veterinarian Clinic in Athens. Paquette said he took Oby, a Belgian malinois, to the clinic because he could no longer stand on his four legs and he was having problems breathing. “I knew I had to try to get him help quick,” Paquette said. He later learned that there was nothing that could be done for Oby. Plans were underway to formally retire Oby sometime later this month. Greene County Sheriff Donnie Harrison shared the news of Oby’s death Monday morning via social media. “It is with a heavy heart that the Greene County Sheriff’s Office announces the passing of K-9 Deputy Oby. Oby passed away unexpectedly this morning. Deputy Oby joined the Greene County Sheriff’s Office on Oct. 12, 2012, and was assigned to K-9 Handler Deputy Lt. Patrick Paquette. Throughout his career of service the Greene County Sheriff’s Office and the citizens of Greene County, his alerts led to numerous arrests for payloads of illegal drugs and the seizure of well over $1 million dollars in cash and assets. Deputy Oby was a valued member of the sheriff’s office and will be missed, tremendously.” A memorial service is tentatively scheduled for sometime early next week. “He had some issues with his hips, and I’d been actually working him only about twice a week, hoping he might get to feeling better with a little more rest,” Paquette said. “So, he had not been coming to work quite as often as he had been doing everyday for several years with me.” Paquette said he had had other K-9 deputies before Oby, but none compared to him. “He was one of a kind,” Paquette said. “He just had a special knack for working. And he wanted to make me happy.” Together, Paquette and Oby formed a most unique bond, and dynamic team when it comes to fighting the war on illegal drugs. “He was always there with me through it all,” Paquette said. “I will never ever forget Oby. He was so much more than a dog and a partner; he was family.” Check out this week's edition of The Lake Oconee Breeze. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular images.

Marsha Buford Human trafficking. Unless you’ve been actively involved in anti-trafficking organizations, those two little words were probably not a part of your lexicon five or 10 years ago. Human trafficking – also known as modern slavery – is defined as the exploitation of another person for sex, labor, or services. It is one of the most misunderstood social justice issues of our time and is often misrepresented in movies, books, and yes, the news. With this widespread misunderstanding, I’d like to address a few common myths. Myth #1: Slavery doesn’t exist anymore. According to the most recent Global Estimates of Modern Slavery, an estimated 50 million people worldwide were living in situations of modern slavery in 2021. But because this issue is illegal and under-reported, these numbers are only estimates. The problem, however, is big and real. Myth #2: Human trafficking only happens overseas. Human trafficking happens in every country, state, and community around the world. In 2021, 494 minors with an average age of 14 were identified as victims of human trafficking in Georgia. Savannah is no exception due to its high poverty rate, international port, booming tourism industry, and the crossroads of Interstate 95 and I-16. In fact, Chatham County ranks fourth in the state – out of 159 counties – for human trafficking. Myth #3: Rescue is welcomed by survivors and brings immediate relief. Any rescue effort can be disorienting for victims, who often have a fear of law enforcement and distrust for strangers. Survivors have to give testimony about their abuse, which further traumatizes them, and it is not uncommon for them to hide from police. Rescue is only the beginning of a long healing process. Myth #4: Traffickers are real-life boogeymen who set traps to lure and snatch children. According to data collected by the Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative, victims are familiar with their traffickers in more than 60 percent of cases. Family members – often parents with substance abuse issues selling their children for drugs – are involved in nearly half of human trafficking cases. When the abuser knows their victim, it is easier to coerce them. Myth #5: There is nothing I can do about it. The late South African President Nelson Mandela said, “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” Take time to learn the facts about human trafficking and pause when you see sensational and lurid social media stories. Check reputable sources and leverage trustworthy anti-trafficking organizations before spreading fake news. While the problem of human trafficking is complicated, it takes all of us working together to put an end to it. Rev. Marsha Buford is founder and pastor of The House of Favor Full Gospel Ministries in Savannah, and the president of the Board of Directors of Tharros Place, a Savannah nonprofit serving underage survivors of human trafficking.'}]"

Conference officials were quite giddy with the arrangement, CBS making the SEC games national contests. A kid like Brock Bowers could wake up on Saturday and begin watching SEC football while he ate his cereal. He could then watch games across the country, bringing about a “Longest Day” routine of him on Saturdays. Early on, he was attracted to SEC competition and ultimately signed with the Bulldogs. It has been a popular and productive marriage—the quiet, reserved tight end from California’s wine country playing in the conservative community of Athens, Georgia. It would be interesting to determine how many kids west of the Mississippi have similar stories. One could easily suggest that the Brock Bowers story would not have come about had CBS not made SEC football a national game. The league’s membership embraced the network officials and particularly the announcers. When Verne Lundquist and Todd Blackledge started calling SEC games, it was a red-letter day for Southeastern Conference football. Suddenly, the league, which was formed in 1933, became dominant, winning national championship after national championship. Initially Georgia was on the outside, looking inward. But when the Bulldogs signed Kirby Smart as their head coach in December of 2015, things changed dramatically for the UGA football program. He came to town with spectacular credentials, having played and coached for Georgia, his alma mater, but his highest praise came from what he accomplished at Alabama, coordinating the Alabama defense for Nick Saban. He knew what it took to coach and recruit to win a national title. He experienced initial success, winning eight games in his first season, including a 31-23 victory in the Autozone Liberty Bowl over TCU, 31-23. It wasn’t long before I had a conversation with Verne Lundquist about Kirby, knowing he had worked with the Bulldog coach for game preparation sessions for SEC telecasts. His glowing tributes to Kirby were substantial. One of the compliments about the new Georgia coach was that he was an excellent communicator. “Of all the assistants I have worked with,” Lundquist said, “he was a favorite. So smart and so insightful.” Today, if you pin Lundquist down, he will not insult any of his other friends in the SEC, but he will wink and say, “We really do like going to Athens.” He and his wife, Nancy, were popular across the league. They were very social and made everybody feel good. I have often wondered if the network brass—the suits in New York—truly realized just how much goodwill and respect this delightful couple brought about for CBS. Lundquist became friends with head coaches, assistant coaches, sports information directors—even fans. He and Nancy will be in Atlanta this weekend for the championship. A phone call this week brought gushing comments from the Lundquist address in Steamboat Springs where they live—about making it to this game one more time. He is very close to officials of both schools. He will not choose to root for a particular team, but he will be happy to enjoy fine dining and fellowship. I know this about him. He will enjoy the trip to Atlanta, and he will enjoy a good time with one and all. He will salute the champion, but when it is over, he will endure a little hurt for the runner-up team. The SEC never had better friends than Verne and Nancy Lundquist.'}]"

Todd began as Nahunta’s police chief on September 5 and has been splitting his time between the two cities balancing the positions’ various duties. This is not a common occurrence as police chiefs are often dedicated to only one location; however, Todd explained that Homeland’s department is technically a part-time agency. The chief is still serving our county and intends to continue keeping Homeland safe while also improving and developing Nahunta’s department. During his time in Homeland, Todd has several accomplishments to be proud of. For example, the Homeland Police Department grew from a two-man department with a lot of thefts to a six-man department. Additionally, he has worked toward news cars, equipment, mobile data computers in the vehicles, body-worn cameras for all officers, a highly trained staff and state of the art evidence room and procedures. Todd hopes to apply Homeland’s successes to Nahunta “and give their citizens a department they can be proud of.” In just the short amount of time as chief, he has started hiring officers. The department can support four full time and five part time employees. “I see a lot of agencies struggling to get quality candidates,” Todd explained. “We are fully staffed in Homeland, and I have officers calling me weekly asking to come work in Homeland. We are in need of good quality officers in Nahunta and have already hired a few that are very sharp.” Juggling both positions has proved difficult. However, Todd is approaching his roles in the two cities meticulously and carefully. “I live by something my father always said, ‘If you love what you do, you will never work a day in your life,’ and I truly love and have a passion for this work,” Todd said. Todd praised Homeland, saying that the city’s officers are “some of the best in the state,” and he will continue to put their professionalism and desire to serve up against any department in Georgia. “I am fortunate to have them,” Todd said. “I know I can be difficult at times to work for but at the end of the day, they know I have their best interest in mind and that I care about the people we serve.” Overall, Todd has served 32 years as a police officer.

Photo story, Photos, Spotlight, Top Headlines, Topstory Leave a comment 4,950 Views Ever since Hurricane Idalia hit the city of Valdosta, Georgia, on Aug. 30, 2023, Valdosta State University has made efforts to clean and restore what has been lost. A campus-wide power outage occurred on Wednesday, Aug. 30 at 10:30 a.m. Generators were active during the power outage throughout the VSU Police Department, Information Technology systems, and VSU Emergency Operations Center, but not in residential halls. Power began restoration on campus Friday, Sept. 1, and the last building was restored with power on Thursday, Sept. 7. Initially, 166 trees were recorded as snapped or fallen on VSU’s campus. An additional 20 to 25 trees were lost due to destabilization. “We currently estimate that VSU lost more than 200 trees due to Hurricane Idalia,” Monica Haynes, Landscape and Ground Superintendent, said. “We do plan to do some future plantings once we evaluate where the need is greatest.” Several facilities on campus suffered tree damage, including both of the softball and baseball batting cages, Langdale Hall, Georgia Hall, Former FCA House, and multiple fences on campus property. Campus is slowly but surely recovering from tree debris. “VSU is utilizing public debris removal services provided by the City of Valdosta as well as engaging our own contractors for debris removal,” Alan Rowe, Director of Public Safety and Chief of VSU Police Department, said. “County-wide estimates top 1 million cubic yards of tree debris. I anticipate campus and the city could take five-seven weeks or longer to completely clear all debris.” Written by Kennedy Hill, Photo Editor.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:03 pm Robert Plant’s second solo album, “The Principle of Moments”, was released forty years ago on July 15, 1983. It is my favorite album on which he has sung. Though he was lead vocalist for Rock legends Led Zeppelin, I discovered his solo albums around the same time I heard his former band’s releases. Though they are formidable and among my favorite records, I feel that Plant demonstrates the greatest skill and taste of his career on this album. It showcases his ability to sing with a broader palette of tones, and his accompanying band is masterful in their support for each song. Like his initial solo recording, 1982’s “Pictures At Eleven”, Plant is joined on “The Principle of Moments” by guitarist Robbie Blunt, keyboardist Gerald “Jezz” Woodroffe, bassist Paul Martinez, and on five of the songs, Genesis and Brand X’s Phil Collins playing the drums. Two other songs feature former Jethro Tull virtuoso Barry “Barrimore” Barlow drumming. The production by Plant, Benji LeFevre, and engineer Pat Moran, is clean and expansive. The instruments are mixed in a way that pronounces their sonic qualities and yet melds their tones interactively. No matter how it is delivered, whether on a home stereo, through headphones, or in my car, the album satiates my desire for musical excellence. Leading off the record is the moderate, funky “Other Arms”, a tune by Plant and Blunt which revisits the territory first heard on the previous record, the band seem eager to keep the live feel of its interaction burning brightly. Plant has always been a terrific live performer, one who takes the energy of his bandmates in and pushes back with his extravagent, emotion-fueled performances. He is also a capable lyricist steeped in the traditions of Rock decades prior to his own performances. “Other Arms” pays tribute to some of these concepts, with the internal strife of a romantic partnership coupled with the ensuing search for that partner once they have evaded the relationship. Interestingly, “Other Arms” was a number one song on August 13, 1983 on Billboard’s Top Tracks, a chart which now has been renamed the Mainstream Rock chart. The chart was designed to follow the airplay of songs which had not been single releases but had been played on Album Oriented Rock (AOR) broadcasts. These AOR stations played songs from the albums of artists, and the Top Tracks chart kept track of the songs which received the greatest amount of airplay for these tracks. Second track “In The Mood” composed by Plant, Blunt, and Martinez, was a November single from the album. Collins’s drumming is more evident on this song because of his trademark single-headed tom tom fills throughout the song. Blunt and Woodroffe create a dreamy soundscape with their solo interplay, and Plant presents a seductive vocal. The single reached number 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 4 on the Top Tracks chart. The final song but first single from the record, “Big Log”, was released in July of 1983. Co-written by Blunt, Plant, and Woodroffe, its rhythm track features Woodroffe’s programmed Roland TR-808 drum machine. The glassy-toned guitar playing of Blunt presents a Spanish melody that drives the song’s slow, majestic sound. Woodroffe’s keyboards, Martinez’s bass guitar, and Plant’s reserved, emotive vocals make the song a classic track in the singer’s career path. It reached number 11 on the United Kingdom’s Singles chart, and number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. Like “Other Arms” and “In The Mood”, it reached the Top Tracks chart’s upper register, landing at number six. To my best recollection, my introduction to “Big Log” came sometime in the summer of 1984 when my cousin Cathy visited with my family for a couple of days, bringing with her both of the Plant albums released up until that point. I recorded them on a blank 90 minute TDK tape, then listened to them repeatedly for years afterward, allowing their grandeur to seep into my musical psyche. I have since purchased both records multiple times. They are both mood elevators whenever I listen to them. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles. Success!

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 6:14 pm ATLANTA — Among health care-related bills that advanced in the Georgia Legislature on Crossover Day is one that moves the state closer to getting medical marijuana products to Georgians who need it. House Bill 196 moves to the Senate after the House voted 170-2 Monday to increase the number of medical marijuana licenses that can be issued by the Georgia Access to Medical Cannabis Commission. Crossover Day is the deadline for bills to clear at least one legislative chamber to remain alive this session. The commission, created through a 2019 law, issued two Class I licenses and four tentative Class II licenses for medical marijuana in July 2021 after receiving more than 70 applicants. In an effort to resolve pending lawsuits from the applicants that weren’t awarded licenses, HB 196 would allow the commission to award up to four more Class I licenses that allow growing, cultivating and manufacturing THC oil in an indoor space no more than 10,000 square feet; and up to seven more Class II licenses that allow up to 50,000 square feet of indoor space for growing, cultivating and manufacturing low THC oil. THC is a psychoactive compound in marijuana. The bill states that the total number of Class I and II licenses can’t exceed 15 production licenses. HB 196 provides provisions for when the number of licenses can be increased in the future, based on the number of patients added to the THC Oil Patient Registry, which consists of patients who have a medical card to receive the oil to treat medical illnesses and conditions. The bill would also make the commission subject to the Administrative Procedure Act and laws governing open meetings and open records, and establishes a legislative oversight committee. Among other health care related bills that crossed over to the opposite chamber is HB 383, which would increase penalties for violence committed against health care workers. Called the Safer Hospitals Act, the bill stipulates that a person who commits aggravated assault or aggravated battery on a health care worker while on or within 100 yards of a hospital campus would be subject to three to 20 years in prison. The bill passed in the House in a 170-5 vote. Georgia senators were also nearly unanimous (55-1) in approving SB 246, which would create a state loan forgiveness program for Georgia nurses. To qualify for the loan forgiveness, the applicant must be licensed and practicing in the state with at least a mater’s degree and currently employed and has been employed for at least one year as a faculty member of a nursing program at a postsecondary institution in a position that requires an advanced degree in professional training. The Georgia Board of Health Care Workforce would determine the repayment schedule and amounts. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

Jon Ossoff\'s office. The total money for Georgia in this round of grant awards for corridor identification is $1.5 million. That amount follows an $8 million in awards announced in April 2022 that began GDOT\'s service development plan for the corridor, according to GDOT\'s project website. ""This is a long-term project that will require cooperation and strong execution at all levels of government, but it has the potential to unlock huge gains in mobility and quality of life for Georgians,” Ossoff said in a press release. For GDOT, the next steps for the study are in the early stages and still being organized, said Jill Nagel, GDOT\'s district 5 communications officer in an email. But the project webpage lays out some of its elements. The project schedule stretches into 2028 when the breadth of necessary design and planning would be completed before construction, according to the schedule on the project\'s site. That timeline encompasses about seven phases. Three of the phases are planned for a stretch between 2023-2025 which would include identifying alternative routes based on need and conducting an environmental assessment for the project. A cost-benefit analysis is slated for 2026, which would also be when the department identifies potential funding sources for construction. The schedule ends with an environmental impact statement in 2028 to satisfy the National Environmental Policy Act. Johnson said he supports passenger rail service from Savannah to Atlanta and believes there is demand for it in the city. Johnson has met with Ossoff about reestablishing rail services in the area, he said. That includes potentially upgrading the city\'s Amtrak station, which hasn\'t changed since Johnson would travel to Savannah during the Summers to visit family some 20 years ago, he said. ""We need to enhance our railway,"" Johnson said. Evan Lasseter is the Savannah and Chatham County Government Reporter for the Savannah Morning News.'}]"

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Employee Furloughs Part of Upcoming Budget Luke Roberts Star Editor The Ocilla Mayor and City Council held a public hearing as part of the approval process for the FY 2023-24 budget on Thursday evening, June 29, followed by a called meeting. Tension ran high in both proceedings, as city employees voiced concerns about furlough days in the city’s proposed budget. Things only escalated during the called meeting as the council continued recent discussion into the South Central Drug Task Force (SCDTF), crescendoing when SCDTF Captain Chip Bowen announced his resignation from the agency. After the public questioning of SCDTF agents Sean Fitzgerald and Bowen during a meeting earlier this month on June 6, Ocilla Mayor Horace Hudgins placed Ben Hill County Sheriff Lee Cone on the agenda. Armed with a folder containing dozens upon dozens of documents, Sheriff Cone proceeded to speak about cases involving the SCDTF agents, as well as the relationship between his staff and the SCDTF agents. He also expressed his disappointment in comments made about members of his staff during a previous city meeting. Many in the audience, and some on the council, expressed confusion as to exactly what Sheriff Cone was presenting at various times during what was a lengthy presentation. Sheriff Cone, who did accuse one of the SCDTF agents of committing a crime {perjury) despite possessing documentation refuting his claim, concluded by urging the mayor and council to “look into the documents” regarding a particular case involving the SCDTF agents. However, when city council member Claire Clayton Stone expressed her desire and willingness to review the documents, Cone declined to provide said documents and instead recommended the city obtain the documents via an open records request. Shortly thereafter, SCDTF Captain Chip Bowen, who makes up one-half of the local drug task force, announced his resignation and cited a number of reasons for doing so, including having his certification “threatened” by Sheriff Cone, and being “publicly belittled” at a previous city meeting. Bowen also said “it has become obvious” that he is “not respected, nor wanted by the current administration.” Sources tell The Star that Bowen’s departure, coupled with what was described by some as “unnecessary but clearly intentional meddling” by some at the city puts the future of the near-entirely federally grant-funded SCDTF in jeopardy. Bowen stated, “Since July of 2019 I have served the city of Ocilla with dignity, pride, and integrity. In a little more than four years of service I have sworn to 245 arrest warrants, executed approximately 100 search warrants, and personally arrested 94 drug offenders in Ocilla and Irwin County, while assisting in approximately as many arrests. “I have seized hundreds of thousands of dollars of illegal poison that fills the streets in our communities. I have also seized illegally obtained property and funds in such great amount that the SCDTF vehicle I currently drive was paid for in cash with not one single tax dollar spent. When I began at the SCDTF our financial situation was critical, but as of today we currently are self-sufficient financially and have enough funds to buy any piece of equipment we need at no cost to the taxpayers, and not one dollar of said money comes from the grant. Those funds have been earned by the current SCDTF Agents alone. Not to mention the approximately 200 illegally possessed firearms I have taken out of the hands of offenders and convicted felons. “To this point in my narcotics career, I have yet to lose a single case in court for any reason, and I have been involved in the three largest narcotics seizures in the history of Irwin County along with my partner Sean Fitzgerald. “I have been able to accomplish all of the above without ever being reprimanded by my superiors in any way. I have never been alleged [to have committed] any crimes, excessive force complaints, or wrongdoing. I have done my absolute best to serve with equality in mind, for I believe that the law reads black and white with no gray area. “Now, however, I have recently had my certification threatened by a Sheriff of another county, who I once had great respect for. I have been publicly belittled in front of the City council and local taxpayers by a man [Joe Saxon of the City of Ocilla] that has no direct authority over me or the SCDTF. I have had my integrity and capabilities questioned by people who have known friendships with repeat drug offenders, and all the while I have simply continued to work, keep my head down, and serve to the best of my ability. “With all of that said it is with great sadness that I announce my two weeks’ notice of resignation from the SCDTF. It has become very obvious that despite my endless efforts, I simply am not respected, nor wanted by the current City administration. Any person that sat through the City Council meeting on June 6, 2023, can attest that for an hour I was essentially put on trial on matters that had already been discussed in appropriate settings prior to that date. “It has become clear that the problem here is not with the SCDTF itself, but rather a personal issue with me as a person and employee. Therefore, I will hold my head high and know that I served this community with the utmost dignity while upholding my oath to the fullest.” Many in attendance joined together in ovation as Bowen turned and exited the meeting room. His wife, Cady Giddens Bowen, looked directly as Joe Saxon, City of Ocilla Director of Standards & Compliance, and asked if he was “happy” with what had transpired before directing her attention to Mayor Hudgins and asking him the same question. Neither Saxon or Hudgins responded. Bowen’s announcement spurred comments from several citizens, including Scott Carver, Chairman of the Irwin County Commission. Members of the commission have voiced support for the SCDTF and opposition to the city’s recent dealings with the SCDTF. A visibly angry Carver addressed the mayor and council with a brief statement, “Mayor, y’all just let one heck of an agent walk out the door.” Carver provided The Star with a lengthy statement the morning after the meeting that addresses the city’s prior “demands” made to the SCDTF (some of which he called “frivolous”) via the now infamous letter the city presented to the SCDTF, the idea to look into possible consolidation of some city and county services, and the city’s ISO fire rating, which recently worsened and led to the increase in insurance costs for many residents. Carver’s full statement is featured in its entirety later in this article. Ashton Harper, who has worked closely with the SCDTF agents in recent months, questioned what he perceives as the mayor and council’s “lack of support” for the SCDTF agents. Harper praised both drug agents, Fitzgerald and Bowen, for their “dedication” to their craft and also spoke of the high level of “integrity” they bring to the job. He also cited his fear for local residents, citing an increase in drug and gang activity and violent crime, should the SCDTF cease to exist. Irwin County High School Principal Jared Luke, who has seen firsthand the negative effects drugs and gangs can have on local youth, piggybacked off what Harper said and stated, “Mayor, all I know is y’all better have a plan.” Several council members, including Lisa Cook, Patrice Y.W. Manley, and Lemora Moses, all said they support the SCDTF, and that they “never wanted or even considered” doing away with the SCDTF, despite the letter the city presented to the SCDTF that specifically states is to “inform you [the SCDTF] of our pending consideration to withdraw from the SCDTF.” Cook added that her “concern” regarding the SCDTF was related to “language in the grant itself,” a concern that Cook had referenced in a previous meeting. Knowing the “concerns” Cook expressed had been addressed, Star Editor Luke Roberts asked Saxon and County Chairman Carver if it was true that the issues with the grant had been addressed and if the city and county will be in compliance with the language in the grant as it’s currently constituted. Both Saxon and Carver affirmed what Roberts asked. Roberts also asked if the letter the city council officially voted on and approved for the letter to be presented to the SCDTF. Multiple city officials confirmed that the council did not vote and approve for the submission of the letter to the SCDTF, though they were all aware of the letter. It should also be noted that the Governing Board of the SCDTF (the mayor, city police chief, county chairman, and sheriff) has met illegally for several years, as no one from the Board has publicly announced and/or posted the Board’s meeting dates, times, and agendas, clear violations of Georgia’s Open Meetings Act. Roberts also asked if it was “appropriate” for a “high-ranking city official” to contact the District Attorney’s Office regarding a'}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:33 pm The Valdosta Daily Times had to reset the front page of its afternoon edition on Nov. 22, 1963 for the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. “Kennedy Shot to Death in Dallas, Dies After One Hour at Hospital” That was the double-deck, banner headline that greeted readers of The Valdosta Daily Times on the afternoon of Nov. 22, 1963. The lead paragraph of the Associated Press story under this headline read: “DALLAS — President John F. Kennedy, thirty-sixth president of the United States, was shot to death today by a hidden assassin armed with a high-powered rifle.” Things were happening so quickly on that Friday afternoon of 60 years ago that AP incorrectly listed JFK as the 36th president, when he was actually the 35th president. But the deadline was tight for numerous newspapers across the U.S. In those days, The Valdosta Daily Times was an afternoon newspaper. News of Kennedy’s assassination meant the front page had to be torn apart and re-designed to accommodate the bulletin news items that Kennedy had been shot in Dallas and then died. With presses ready, there wasn’t time to change many of the inside news pages and still get the paper on the streets by afternoon. The editorial page of that same day has stories with headlines reading “Republicans Make Leap Forward,” discussing GOP strategy against Kennedy for the 1964 presidential campaign, and “Kennedy Veers to the Right,” an article about the Kennedy administration’s legislative woes with Congress. Additional stories about JFK’s assassination in The Valdosta Daily Times would follow in the next several days. And stories about JFK, his life, presidency and assassination have been the subject and fodder of newspaper articles, magazine spreads, books and movies ever since. The Kennedy retrospective came immediately after his death. By January 1964, veteran Time magazine White House correspondent Hugh Sidey had a straight-forward JFK biography in book stores. The book was one of the building blocks of the post-Kennedy mythos of Camelot, America’s “loss of innocence,” the dashing and smashing of the New Frontier. Sidey’s opening description of Kennedy, written a year earlier, set the mostly reverential tone for “John F. Kennedy President” — “Six feet; 172 pounds; 45 years old; a profusion of nondescript hair slightly out of control, strands of gray now on the fringes; gray-blue eyes; coarse and weathered skin with a fading trace now of Florida sunshine; straight mouth; a vestige of a second chin — a single human out of the world’s three billion, selected in this staggering lottery by the American electorate to control more power, either destructive or constructive, than any other man in history.” Since the publication of Sidey’s JFK biography, the world’s population has surpassed 8 billion, and tales of Kennedy’s life, death and legacy have figuratively grown to similar proportions. From the moment Jack Ruby shot and killed JFK’s assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, in front of millions of television viewers and the unsatisfying subsequent Warren Commission report, theories surrounding the assassination have multiplied from the feasible to the bizarre. Since Sidey’s volume, hundreds of books and movies have explored darker dimensions of JFK’s life with relevant and strange allegations: the womanizing, a reported affair with Marilyn Monroe and dozens of other women, including a woman connected with a mob boss; that JFK was linked to Marilyn Monroe’s death; that he was addicted to pain killers and other prescription drugs for numerous debilitating injuries and maladies; that his father, Joe Kennedy, bought the election for his son and had JFK’s Pulitzer Prize-winning “Profiles in Courage” ghostwritten. There are numerous books, films and critiques on JFK’s administration, with some historians arguing that he was one of America’s greatest presidents, others arguing that he had the potential to be a great president and others noting that any greatness JFK attained is due to his assassination rather than his administration. The list is nearly endless. Though 60 years have passed since his death, the films and stories, the myths and allegations surrounding JFK continue to grow. Some new dimension to his life always seems to be ferreted out and the American public remains fascinated by it all. He is demonized and praised. Some historians have claimed JFK was a borderline pain-pill junkie while president; meanwhile, essays, such as an Esquire magazine article early in the 2000s, touted Kennedy as the greatest man of the 20th century. But why six decades after his death does JFK continue to fascinate? True, Kennedy was the last president to die in office but he wasn’t the only one. The first was William Henry Harrison, the ninth president, who died in 1841 of pneumonia about a month after taking office. Zachary Taylor, the 12th president, died in 1850 of cholera. Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president, was assassinated in 1865 by John Wilkes Booth. James Garfield, the 20th president, was assassinated in 1881. William McKinley, the 25th president, was assassinated in 1901. Warren G. Harding, the 29th president, died of a heart attack in 1923. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 32nd president, died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1945. And Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. From 1841 to 1963, every generation experienced a president dying while in office. Many American generations witnessed more than one presidential death. But we are a more than a half century since a president has died while in office — the longest period in American history that no sitting president has died. The second longest stretch was 52 years, the period from George Washington being the first president in 1789 with no sitting-presidential deaths until President William Henry Harrison died a month after his inauguration in 1841. Since Kennedy’s assassination, the majority of living Americans have never experienced the death of a sitting president. Americans 60 and younger have no memory or personal knowledge of a president dying in office, except for what they have seen and heard thousands of times about Kennedy’s death. And that repeated experience of viewing his life and death may be another important factor in why Kennedy still resonates with the American public. Kennedy was arguably the first TV president. Analysts, such as Theodore H. White in his classic book, “The Making of the President,” have claimed that Kennedy’s telegenic looks, his youth, his vigor, his charm, his eloquence, were perfect for the relatively new device of television in the 1960s. White notes how viewers responded to Kennedy’s suave good looks as opposed to Richard M. Nixon’s sweaty, five o’clock shadow in their televised debate of 1960. White and others have asserted that Kennedy’s appearance during the televised debate helped him squeak by the more experienced Nixon in the election. Through television, Kennedy entered people’s homes. For the first time, Americans could enjoy the comforts of their homes while watching a president walking and talking, playing with his children, addressing domestic and international matters and crises. They could hear JFK speak, watch his lips move, see him refuse to wear the traditional top hat to his inauguration — as these events happened — while they sat in their living rooms. “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country” spilled from JFK’s lips straight to the person sitting in an easy chair. People felt like they knew him because they saw him on TV in their homes. His assassination and subsequent funeral assured part of the long fascination with Kennedy and cemented television’s place in American households. Though the nation mourned the deaths of past presidents, they could mostly only read or hear about them. People wept at the news of FDR’s death in 1945 but most of the coverage of his funeral in that pre-television era was provided by newspapers, radio or newsreels at the local theater. People had often heard FDR’s voice in their homes during his radio fireside chats but his face was relegated to newspaper and magazine photos and jumpy newsreel films. Most Americans didn’t even realize Roosevelt was usually confined to a wheelchair until years after his death because they rarely saw him. Not so with Kennedy. He may have suffered health problems but he was constantly visible on TV, his death was shown on TV and anyone with a television set in 1963 — and by then most households had one — could mourn alongside the widowed First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy. They immediately witnessed young John Kennedy Jr. raise a hand to salute his father’s passing coffin. and we’ve been living with those images ever since. With these images, Kennedy became more than a president. He became part of a communal mythology. With so many photographs, so much television footage of Kennedy, he is always young and eternally handsome — though given the prevalence of the era’s black and white film, it is often'}]"

According to Louise, the final reunion for this group of MHS graduates went well, as she had planned. “There were originally 46 members of our class,” Louise reflects, “Nine members were present at the reunion, and there are 19 classmates still living.” Louise admits that planning for a class reunion involves more than simply finding a place to meet. She had had to maintain records of class members through decades of moves, transfers, and even deaths. Over the years, she turned to her copy of the 1953 Metterite, the school’s yearbook, to make sure no classmates were left out. “I researched phone numbers and contacts until I eventually located all 46 of my fellow MHS graduates,” Louise states. She was surprised that every one of the members of the Class of 1953 maintained some connection with Metter. “Everyone in the class had some roots here,” she is glad to say. In doing her research, Louise noticed that not everyone who started high school with the Class of 1953 graduated. “Some of our friends didn’t graduate,” she says sadly. The class president recalls that times were different in the early 1950’s, not too long after the end of World War II. “Times were hard, and some children had to quit school to help their families to make ends meet,” she recalls. Remembering her school days, Louise says that she first attended a county school. “I went to first through seventh grades at the old Union School,” she shares. That large wooden school building sat on the corner of Highway 121 North and Rosemary Church Road in the northeastern section of Candler County. According to Louise, she lived close enough to the school that she would often walk home. Her mother, Mary Lou Bird, was a teacher in that school building. Thinking back on her time at Union School, Louise says she doesn’t even have a photograph of the old school building that is no longer standing. All that remains of the Union School is the water pump and well under a shelter behind the Union Community House that sits adjacent to the site of the long-gone school. Before transferring to high school at Metter High School, Louise says that her class had a graduation ceremony to celebrate their transition from Union School to MHS. Starting school at Metter High School in eighth grade, Louise says that she went from having two classes in a room at Union School to having classes in the building on South College Street in Metter that now houses the offices of the Candler County Board of Education. “Rain or shine, we would walk across the street to the two-story building every day for lunch,” she recalls. The school’s lunchroom was located on the second floor of the building that is now the Candler County History Museum. Louise shares, “We didn’t think that much about the hard times that we were going through back then. We just went to school.” Thinking back on going to school in the 1950s, Louise explains something that younger people may not know. Up until the Class of 1950, public education ended at the end of the eleventh grade. Louise explains, “There was no graduating class in 1951 because that was the year that the twelfth grade was added. She says that her grade was often called a “T grade” because they were a part of the transition from eleven grades to twelve. At the class’s 70th celebration of the completion of high school, the nine class members in attendance played a game that Louise created. “My daughter called it ‘Scramble!’” she laughs. The game was a list of questions such as “Where was the cafeteria? Who was voted the wittiest” and such. To help the now-octogenarians with getting the answers correct, Louise included on the puzzle sheet, the answer to each question with the letters mixed up. The honorees and guests enjoyed trying to figure out each answer. Through the years, the Class of 1953 had many reunions with Louise as their leader. Until the class reached the 50-year reunion mark, they met every five years. “In 2003, at our 50th reunion, we voted to have a class reunion every year,” she explains. “We have had a lot of reunions!” This final reunion for the Class of 1953 was held at Bevrick’s in Metter. Seven of the attendees were from the Metter area, and two came from South Carolina. Each of the class members present had a guest to come with them. Louise’s older son Jimmy Lanier, his wife Montell Clifton Lanier, and Louise’s younger daughter Jill Lanier Bowen were the class president’s guests and helpers for the event. As the reunion came to an end, members of the Class of 1953 lit a candle in memory of their classmates who have passed away since graduation from high school. All of those present joined hands as classmate Sonny Paul Trapnell gave a farewell benediction marking the end of the class gathering for annual reunions. “This is the end of an era,” admits Louise. She, like her classmates, will miss their annual get-togethers, but the planning and even attending has become too much for most of them. Louise says that she hopes class members will stay in touch even though they will not be having reunions. To encourage those gathered to continue to communicate with each other and as a reminder of their time together, Louise presented everyone with an ink pen emblazoned with “Metter High School Class of 1953.” And with that, the president of the Class of 1953 put down her gavel.

According to the incident report, deputy Regan Chapman and Cpl. Jaleel Brown were dispatched to 748 Buck Drive regarding a domestic/suicide attempt. Before arriving at the home, they met Amanda Thomas standing on Harrison Road with EMS. She was upset and had marks on her legs. She told the deputies her boyfriend, Caleb Castleman, had locked himself in his camper on the property and was threatening to kill himself. The couple worked together at Huddle House. Thomas led Chapman and Brown to the camper owned by Castleman’s grandparents, crying and walking with a limp. Deputies Justin Sanders and Kevin Williams arrived and helped clear the camper, but Castleman was not inside. The home reeked of marijuana, and it was apparent that a fresh joint had just been smoked inside. Thomas told deputies that Castleman had access to multiple guns and often had a knife with him. She said they had been together for about four months, and he frequently had episodes where he would become angry. She said that they worked the night before at their job at Huddle House and had plans to get up and go to the Christmas parade in Bolingbroke, but she overslept that morning, and he became angry. They began to argue, and Castleman picked her up and threw her.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:15 pm The indictment in Georgia against former President Donald Trump is photographed Monday, Aug. 14. AP Photo/ Jon Elswick ATLANTA — Georgia’s law requiring grand juror names to be included on indictments could make its way to lawmakers’ desks for a rewrite when legislators meet for the next legislative session in January. The law became spotlighted after the Aug. 14 high-profile indictment against former President Donald Trump and 18 others by a Fulton County grand jury for alleged election interference. The Fulton County Sheriff’s Office said it was made aware when threats against some of the 26 grand jurors whose names and personal information, including their purported addresses and social media accounts, were posted on what appeared to be Trump-supporting websites. “We take this matter very seriously and are coordinating with our law enforcement partners to respond quickly to any credible threat and to ensure the safety of those individuals who carried out their civic duty,” the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office stated Aug. 17. CNHI reached out to at least a dozen of the grand jurors for comment but did not hear back. Speculation made its rounds on social media that the Fulton County Superior Court erred in not redacting the jurors’ names before making the indictment public. However, the practice of publishing grand juror names is standard in Georgia — something several law professors and lawmakers said they weren’t aware of until the Trump indictment in Georgia. “I actually don’t know where that practice comes from (I didn’t realize it existed until last week),” Caren Morrison, associate professor of law at Georgia State University, said in an email. Added Democrat State Rep. Ruwa Romman: “I did not even realize that was a thing in Georgia. I guess a part of me always assumed that those names are protected and then I found out that they’re not and that was a shock to me personally.” Pete Skandalakis, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, said he plans to bring forth some proposals to lawmakers regarding revisions to the juror name publication concern and other related proposals. In most states, such as Alabama and Tennessee, only a designated foreperson chosen by the jurors signs the indictment, as with federal cases. The foreperson must sign onto the indictment with the consensus of the state’s designated threshold of jurors. Some states allow prosecutors to request that juror names be available only to attorneys involved in the case. “I think it’ll be up to the Georgia legislature how they want to decide it, but I plan to have those conversations with legislators,” Skandalakis said. A look into Georgia’s grand jury indictment process A 1914 case, Willerson v. State of Georgia, became pivotal in Georgia’s grand jury indictment process and interpreting the indictment form. In that case, a Murray County Superior Court grand jury presented charges against the defendant, Sid Willerson, for the selling of alcoholic beverages. The indictment bill was signed by the jury foreman and Willerson moved to quash the presentment of the charges from the grand jury on the ground that the names of the grand jurors did not appear on the bill, despite there being a section on the form for their names to appear. Willerson was ultimately convicted and later appealed to the Court of Appeal in Georgia, questioning the validity of an indictment where the grand juror’s names were omitted from an indictment. The Appeals Court sided with Willerson, stating that listing the grand juror names on the indictment would be a method of showing compliance, such as for the requisite number of grand jurors to return an indictment and the composition of the grand jury. Some cases since 1914, however, have argued that the omission of grand juror names should not make an indictment unauthentic. In one case, it was noted that grand juror minutes could be made available to show grand juror names and participation. But most courts in Georgia have ruled that name omission from an indictment is a “fatal defect,” according to a case study provided by Skandalakis. “The defendant has a right to know who’s sitting on the grand jury so (that) they could challenge (that) any grand jury members should they have been disqualified, you know, for not being properly qualified,” Skandalakis said. Georgia’s code section 17-7-54 sets the standard for every indictment form. The form requires the name of the county of the indictment, the name of the person being charged, the charge(s), “to wit” the persons bringing the charges and the form is to be signed by the jury foreperson. “Because the language is ‘to wit,’ the grand juror names need to be on the indictment,” Skandalakis said. “And Georgia has no mechanism at this point for how we can can go before a judge and say, ‘Please, for due cause let’s keep these names sealed.’” While at least 16 jurors must be present for all juror discussions, 12 votes are needed to move a case or indictment forward. Indictments, however, do not specify which jurors voted for or against, and the names of those who weren’t present for the vote are crossed out on the indictment. Skandalakis said it’s customary for jurors to be informed on how indictment forms work and that their names will appear on the indictment. “So there is an awareness that their names will be subject to public scrutiny — plus they’re sworn in and open court,” Skandalakis said “Every grand jury, every jury that comes into open court, and they’re sworn in right there in open court. Everything has to be done in open court.” “But whether or not they understand completely, I don’t know. But I think most people understand it’s a public service because that is reiterated a number of times,” he said. A juror’s concerns about their name being public isn’t a likely reason for the juror to be dismissed or excused from a case, but a judge could consider such concerns, Skandalakis said. “But the issue that we have in this country is some people simply don’t want to serve on grand juries and juries. They just don’t want to take the time out of their schedule to sit and our entire process based upon citizens coming into the criminal justice system and serving,” Skandalakis said. “(Our system is) average citizens that come in and serve, and if everybody’s trying to get out of jury duty, that’s going to create a huge problem for not only defendants in the state but for litigation in general.” Romman said she is open to Skandalakis’s plans to revise the grand juror indictment law to provide some juror protections, while allowing public transparency in the court system. “I do think that the public has a right to know what their government is doing.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 6:18 pm VALDOSTA , Ga. — Robert Greene’s “Aberration” is one of 95 films that was screened during the seventh annual South Georgia Film Festival March 3-5 at Valdosta State University. A Moultrie resident, Greene plans to graduate from VSU in 2024 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Mass Media and a Minor in Art, specifically three-dimensional art. This is his first time participating in a film festival, and he is “very excited to hopefully meet other passionate creators like myself during the screenings while also being able to show off my work.” The South Georgia Film Festival celebrates the art and industry of film, particularly those films that showcase the beauty of South Georgia and its people. Preference is given to filmmakers from Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, and South Carolina, but the festival also includes films from across the United States and around the world. Selected films represent a variety of categories, including shorts, features, family friendly, high school student made, and college student produced. VSU: What are your career plans after graduation? ROBERT GREENE: After graduation I hope to join the media industry with work in advertising/promotional material. VSU: Tell us about your film. GREENE: My film is about a photographer who, after finding an unknown creature in a photo, begins to grapple with her own sanity. The runtime, with credits, is 6:53. VSU: What inspired you to make this film? GREENE: My main inspiration for my film was early cinema horror films. With restricted budgets the directors of the time had to find creative ways to get their vision made, and I find this really inspiring. As a student filmmaker I also have almost no budget to work with and end up relying on many techniques used in these old films, which spur on new ideas in my own work. VSU: Where was “Aberration” filmed? GREENE: The majority of the film was shot locally in Valdosta, Georgia, at a friend’s home. The opening scene, which takes place in woods, was filmed in Moultrie, Georgia. VSU: What are some highlights of this filmmaking experience? GREENE: The biggest highlight was working with the people on set. For the entire shoot it was just me, Kara Manley, and Susannah Traina, and if you didn’t know any better you would have thought we were making a comedy. I think it’s safe to say we all had a fun time making this project together. VSU: What challenges did you have to overcome? GREENE: A very hard challenge was creating this film by myself. I had Kara Manley, who starred in the film, also help as a producer, so thankfully I had someone to run test screenings for and give me feedback on the initial story, but for the majority I was doing this on my own. I wrote, shot, ran audio, lighting, managed script and shooting schedules, music, folly, editing, the list keeps going. VSU: What advice do you have for other emerging filmmakers? GREENE: If you have an idea for a film you want to make, go make it. If you have a phone, use it. If you have a camera, use it. Get some friends together and make whatever it is in your head. It doesn’t need to be perfect. We get better with each film we make, so keep making them. VSU: What’s next for you? GREENE: I’m currently working on making a few small personal projects while I continue to write out the story for my senior short film, which I will start making later this year.. VSU: How do you hope “Aberration” impacts audiences? GREENE: I hope people just have an enjoyable time watching my film. At the end of the day that’s all I’m hoping for with all the short films I make. Greene calls Moultrie home. He says his “biggest supporters have always been my family. With whatever kind of help or support I need, I always know my parents or sisters will be there to help me. In “Aberration,” Kara Manley plays Clemm and Susannah Traina plays Eliza. Manley served as producer and Robert Greene as writer, director, editor, and everything else. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.

Editor’s note: The True Citizen received information via email October 29, 2023, that some residents in Willow Oak Estates were greatly concerned about activities taking place on approximately 40 acres owned by a nonprofit, Father’s Heart of Georgia. The email contained a petition signed by 14 neighbors, but not yet submitted, complaining to the Burke County Board of Commissioners that the group’s activities violated noise-related ordinances. Additionally, the activities on the property were described as “militant” in nature, instilling fear and “rocking” the community. The author of the email expressed dissatisfaction with the way the Burke County Sheriff’s Office was handling complaints. “…but if our Sheriff department is in the wrong here and continues their lack of law enforcement, it could drive someone to take the law in their own hands, maybe then it’ll be news worthy,” the email stated. Morris Williams (left) and Jimmy Harris (right) met at the office of The True Citizen Friday, November 10 to answer questions about activities on approximately 40 acres on Quaker Road. The True Citizen interviewed two of the neighbors who mentioned rumors of military-like cadence sounds, animal sacrifice and several hours of gunfire. The True Citizen made open records requests with the Burke County Sheriff ’s Office, spoke with Scott Lee of the Planning Commission and County Manager Merv Waldrop prior to reaching out to the nonprofit’s founder, Jimmy Harris. Harris willingly agreed to a face-to-face interview and Morris Williams willingly attended after the invitation was extended to him. In response to rumors that the FBI and/or CIA may be monitoring the activities on the property, The True Citizen reached out to Sheriff Alfonzo Williams for assurance that moving forward with the story was “safe” from a law enforcement perspective. Sheriff Williams gave us the “okay.” Jimmy Harris moved to the CSRA when he was stationed at Fort Gordon. He retired from the U.S. Army in 2009 with the rank of Sergeant First Class. His wife, Sheila, also served in the U.S. Army. They created the nonprofit, Father’s Heart of Georgia, to respond to the needs of single mothers and their children. “We were both in the military and about service,” he said. “We understand that it’s about giving back. She was a single mom and I was a single dad. When we see some of the things that go on with single moms and the struggles that they go through…that was something that was placed on my wife’s heart. We decided to run with it.” The nonprofit purchased the Burke County property with the intention of constructing a transitional housing building. However, for now those plans are on the back burner. In the meantime, Father’s Heart of Georgia has partnered with Rebirth of a Nation. Like all denominations, there are sects of the Messianic Hebrew religion. However, Morris Williams is the pastor of the Augusta church. He said creating strong marriages and strong homes are the emphasis of his ministry. A Google search of “Children of the Diaspora” includes all persons who maintain ties with a specific country of origin in relation to their family’s background. Morris Williams pointed out his church is not an all-Black church and many different ethnicities are involved. His church believes developing self-identity is found within the traditional family structure. Not unlike many conservative Christians, he believes that most of the problems in today’s world are rooted in the dissolution of the traditional family unit. “You don’t see too many people or churches that are focused on that,” Morris Williams said. “You see a lot of problems that come out of us as a people and different things that we struggle with… a lot of us in prison, a lot of us had fatherless homes.

Like many with a survivalist mentality, Morris Williams and Harris see the value of gardening, raising animals for meat source, fishing, hunting and knowing the medicinal purposes of herbs. Like many others, Williams pointed to changes in the food supply including pesticides and bioengineered ingredients as part of the appeal of knowing how to grow one’s own groceries. “It’s better to put the stuff back under your control,” Morris Williams said. “You can see the animals that you are raising, you know the seeds that you are putting in the ground. You know how to fish. You are teaching young men how to go out and hunt and process their food, all these things that were common years ago.” Harris’s son lives on the land to take care of the animals. Morris Williams said his church goes out to the property periodically to garden, tend to the animals and engage in target practice. The church also advocates for the use of bootcamp type exercises to develop self-discipline in youths. Additionally, the church celebrates Feast of the Tabernacles once a year. The eight-day celebration commemorates the journey of the Jews out of Egypt before they entered the promised land. Members from congregations in other cities join the Augusta members in the observance. The event consists of loud praise music. It includes living off the land and sleeping in tents. Seminars instruct on herbal care and building campfires. Attendees participate in firearm training. This year’s event took place October 13-October 23. Harris sent a letter to the BCSO in advance informing them of the activities. In the letter, Harris pointed to “precautions” taken with the intention of causing the least amount of disturbance to the neighbors. The group rented a portable building to help reduce the sound. Tarps were hung to increase privacy. Lighting generators were turned off by 11 p.m. Sound was reduced to a minimum between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. Roving guards were placed on the property to ensure safety. Still, it wasn’t enough for the two neighbors The True Citizen interviewed. Records indicate the BCSO was dispatched to the property, after one complained around 2:50 p.m. October 17.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:03 pm Meredith Lord, from left, Carter Grant and Natalie Lord, granddaughters of Sidney Lord (seated) all attend Ivy League colleges. Meredith and Natalie Lord are both SHS graduates. LIVE OAK — Sidney Lord, a Suwannee County native and lifetime farmer, and his wife, Patricia, have three granddaughters attending three different Ivy League Colleges this fall. Who would have thought that could be possible? Two of the granddaughters graduated from Suwannee High School. Meredith Lord, daughter of Jackson and Michelle (Clark) Lord and a 2016 SHS graduate, is finishing her senior year at Cornell University studying Agricultural Science and Business. Natalie Lord, a 2018 SHS graduate, the class valedictorian and also the daughter of Jackson and Michelle, is in her sophomore year at Yale University studying Economics and Mathematics. Both young women were born and raised in Suwannee County. The third granddaughter, Carter Suzanne Grant, daughter of Kevin Adrienne (Lord) Grant of Jacksonville, is attending Princeton Theological Seminary pursuing her Master’s of Divinity, to become a Presbyterian minister. Carter’s mother, Adrienne, also grew up in Suwannee County. Carter is a 2014 graduate of Allen D. Nease High School in Ponte Vedra. “I am proud of all three of these girls” Lord said, “but remember, I’ve got some more grandkids coming along too. And, I’ve got a grandson, Jarrett Grant, at University of Tennessee studying to be an engineer.” When asked specifically about the accomplishments of the three granddaughters, Lord replied that it is not too surprising because all three come from a long line of strong women. He said that one of his own sisters, Dorothy L. Lord, was the first woman to be College President of a Georgia two-year college. Dr. Lord served as President of Coastal Georgia Community College for 19 years, and received the prestigious Eve Award in 2005 for her success in establishing a second campus in Kingsland, Georgia. Dorothy’s list of accomplishments is long, and she began advocating for the advancement of women in education when she was about the same age as these young women. And, like her niece Natalie, she too was a Suwannee High School valedictorian, class of 1960. All three young women are granddaughters of Sidney and Patricia Lord of Live Oak, and the late Janice (Carter) Lord. Meredith and Natalie Lord are the granddaughters of Edwina Clark of Live Oak and the late Ronald Clark. Carter and Jarrett Grant are the grandchildren of David and Suzanne Grant of Seneca, S.C.

After a hard fought battle against the No. 10 ranked team in AAA, the Lady Dogs fell just short in their return to action for the first time since March 26. After a big non-region road win over Athens Christian, the Dogs put up a good fight against No. 2 Hebron Christian in a home loss.

The Hart County High School boys and girls tennis teams split against Franklin County to set them up for the Region Tournament at Oconee County High School on April 9 and 10. After not playing a full game since March 19, the Dogs picked up back-to-back road wins to prepare for a gauntlet of an ending to the regular season. After losing six straight games, the Diamond Dogs responded with a series win over Stephens County while also edging past Eastside on the road.

Boom City USA heading into the New Year’s holiday, and a team of local youth helped handle the rush of people buying fireworks for the big end-of-the-year celebration. “This is the make-it or break-it time of year for us,” said Store Manager Marsha Pickens. “We couldn’t do what we do this time of year without 20 young people from the local area helping us out. We have so many people coming here, especially on the 30th and the 31st. We are also really, really busy around the week of July the Fourth.” Boom City’s big warehouse just off Extt 77 on I-85 is the place to go for any celebration. Something that’s growing in popularity is what’s known as the gender reveal. When a young woman finds out she is pregnant and her husband, friends and family members want to celebrate, setting off fireworks is a good way to get across that you are really happy about something. People with ties to India celebrate a holiday known as Diwali. It’s in November, and people will buy fireworks for that. Those with ties to the United Kingdom celebrate Guy Fawkes Day on November 5th. It’s a day to light bonfires and to set off fireworks in the lighthearted recollection of a failed plot to blow up Parliament in 1605, two years before the founding of Jamestown. The highlight of these celebrations is the burning of Guy Fawkes in effigy. Pickens wants people to see Boom City as a place to go whenever they have reason to celebrate. Some local high schools send flaming rockets to the sky after winning a home football game. “One man came in here to get some sparklers for his little girl’s doll,” Pickens said, “and the daughter really loved it. Some people celebrate weddings with fireworks. If you have something to celebrate, we have a lot of items here we can help you with.” The five-inch, six-inch and seven-inch mortars are popular heading into New Year’s Eve. These cardboard tubes are sealed at one end to prevent hot gases from the lift charge from escaping underneath. When launched, the missile travels at an estimated 200 feet per second or 135 miles per hour. They are harmless when launched overhead, but do not need to be pointed at any ground-level object. Rockets can go from 50 to 300 feet in the air, depending on their size, quality and atmospheric conditions. At their apex, they explode with a loud bang or crackles, sending colorful streamers in the air. “One good shot from a mortar will make you go ooh! and ahh!” Pickens said. “We have some fireworks that will light up in red, white and blue and some that send down parachutes. One of our items will fire 62 shots and will last up to two minutes. It lights up the whole sky and is absolutely beautiful.” An ever-popular item is the Roman candle. Some have three shots and some ten. Boom City has been in the local area since 2005, and Pickens has been with them since the following year. Assistant managers Kimberly Price and Ashley Atkins have been there for several years as well. Boom City has a huge assortment of firecrackers, missiles, rockets, spinners, sparklers and many other items. “We have plenty of best-sellers like Excaliber, High Falutin’, Chasing Booty, Bent Rail and American Pastime,” Pickens said. “People like our wedding sparklers and gender reveal items.” Boom City usually sells wall-to-wall by July 4th. It will take them several months to restock the big warehouse, and they will sell out again on New Year’s Eve. In late December, Boom City gets lots of business from Troup and Chambers counties. “We also get lots of people from Opelika, Auburn and Phenix City on the Alabama side and people from Newnan and Atlanta on the Georgia side,” Pickens said. “A lot of people traveling on I-85 stop here to pick up some fireworks. There’s no telling where they could be from.” Pickens is well pleased with young people from the local area who work at the store this time of year. “They are good kids, and we are glad to have them,” she said. Some of the crew man the cash registers in the check-out line. Others escort customers out the side door once they have made their purchases. Some work the parking lot, helping people find a parking space and seeing they get out onto Phillips Road with no trouble when they are leaving. One of the top sellers for the past 15 years has been a brand known as Loyal to None. As long as it’s popular, Boom City USA will be loyal to it and its snarling pirate logo. Other popular items include the Saturn Missile Battery, Full Speed (a seven-inch artillery shell), a newer artillery known as Grandissimo, Wing It!! Gorilla Warfare, Hit the Road Jack, Blonde Joke, Old School Cool, Bells and Whistles and Sassy. Gone but not forgotten is Boom City’s mascot, Wilton. A giant, blow-up gorilla that once sat on top of the building, Wilton has been retired. He’s more of an art object now. There are paintings of him both on the front and on the south side of the building. The same image graces t-shirts worn by the staff. “It was an adventure having Wilton on top of the building,” Pickens said. “When a big gust of wind came by he’d often get blown off the top and sometimes across the road.” Several years back, Wilton once made it across Phillips Road and landed in a field near the Huguley family cemetery. Another time he was blown a good distance from the store and landed on a cell tower. “We got him down, sewed him up and put him back on top of the building,” Pickens said. Boom City USA is big in promoting safety. They encourage everyone using fireworks to always follow safety guidelines. Firefighter Mike is their spokesman and has a long list of safety rules he wants everyone to follow. They are listed at www.boomcityusa.com.'}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:12 pm VALDOSTA – A Valdosta resident has received the keys to her newly reconstructed home almost one week before the upcoming holidays. The city unveiled Mary Myers’ new home, located on 719 East Mary Street, early Friday morning. Myers was accompanied by excited family members who were eager to celebrate during the ribbon cutting ceremony. She said the reconstructed home is the new family house. Her family members have started decorating plans. “I feel very blessed. I just thank [the City of Valdosta] very much for everything that [they’ve] done. It is truly a blessing from God,” Myers said in an interview. City Council Members Vivian Miller-Cody of District 1 and Sandra Tooley of District 2 — along with City of Valdosta Manager Richard Hardy and Assistant Manager Catherine Ammons — presented Myers with the new house key. “For me, this is one of the most important programs that we have in the city. To be able to give a family a roof over their head [and] to be able to provide somewhere that they can have family gatherings is one of the most important gifts that we can give any citizen,” Ammons said in an interview following the unveiling. “I felt like Santa Claus. To be able to give them a key a week before Christmas to give them the opportunity to gather around now during the holiday’s a feeling like no other. Completing another CDBG project is another step the City of Valdosta is taking in addressing housing. “We’re always looking to increase our affordable housing or to give our citizens more options so that’s something that’s a priority for us,” Ammons said. The project was completed with funds from the Community Development Block Grant Program. Neighborhood Development and Community Protection Manager Anetra Riley said the City of Valdosta has participated in the CDBG program, being an entitlement community since 2004. The Valdosta City Council receives annual funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The council allocates funds for the Community Development Block Grant to address housing. Riley said the amount of allocation the city receives in a year determines the number of projects they can complete. “Every year we have an application process that begins the first Monday in January through April 30th. Mrs. Myers applied, and she received funding. We demolished her home and rebuilt her a new home,” Riley said in an interview after the ceremony. Myer’s home reconstruction project took about eight months to complete. The CDBG projects can take approximately one year to complete depending on whether the home is being rehabilitated or completely reconstructed. Riley explained that interested applicants must own their home, have a clear title and occupy the residence for their application to be considered. If an applicant was not chosen and received a denial letter but wishes to be considered in another year, they must submit a new application in the next application period.

defensive lineman Jonathan Jefferson (94) reaches for an interception. The Georgia Bulldogs defeat the Charleston Southern Buccaneers 56-7 at Sanford Stadium in Athens, Georgia, on Saturday, Nov. 20, 2021. (Photo/Jessica Gratigny; @jgratphoto) Three of Georgia football’s transfers have committed to their new schools. Defensive lineman Jonathan Jefferson, offensive lineman Austin Blaske and pass rusher C.J. Madden all announced their transfer destinations. Jefferson, who was one of the first Bulldogs to enter the portal, announced he was transferring to Southern Methodist University on Dec. 12. The 6-foot-3, 295-pound defensive lineman registered only one tackle this season and six in the three seasons he was with the Bulldogs. The former four-star prospect from the 2021 class was expected to have a bigger role with the Bulldogs but saw his playing time drop drastically throughout the season. Jefferson joins an SMU team that recently went 11-2 and won the American Athletic Conference championship. The Mustangs could be losing several players on the defensive line as all but one of their rotational defensive linemen are seniors including Elijah Chatman, the unit’s leading tackler and Elijah Roberts, the team’s leader in sacks. Jefferson could provide a significant upgrade for SMU in a spot where the team appears thin for the 2024 season. Blaske, who announced his decision to enter the portal the same day as Jefferson, announced on Dec. 15 his decision to transfer to the University of North Carolina. The 6-foot-5, 310-pound offensive lineman has spent time as a depth piece at every position on the offensive line and has spent the most time at center and tackle. Blaske competed for the starting left tackle spot this season but ultimately lost out to Earnest Greene III. Three to four of UNC’s starters may not return for another year unless some take their COVID year. This opens up plenty of opportunities for Blaske at several different positions. His inclusion could help the Tar Heels, who went 8-4 this season, find further success up front. Madden, who also announced his decision to enter the portal on Dec. 4, announced on Dec. 16 that he would be transferring to Purdue. The 6-foot-4 redshirt freshman had three tackles with the Bulldogs this year and will finish his Georgia tenure with that many. Madden quickly fell behind established starters like Chaz Chambliss and fellow Georgia transfer Marvin Jones Jr. but eventually fell behind true freshman Damon Wilson Jr. and even Samuel M’Pemba towards the end of the season. As he enters his third season as a collegiate athlete, Madden has a chance to replace senior Kydran Jenkins, who may depart the program after being second on the team with seven and a half sacks. Madden could play opposite of sophomore and team leader in sacks Nic Scourton, who put up 10 this season. Madden will join a Purdue team that had one of its worst seasons in the past few years, as the team went 4-8 and missed a bowl game under first-year head coach Ryan Walters. Now, Madden will have an opportunity to find success with a second-year coach and a change of scenery.

Not pictured, but in attendance, was councilwoman Linda Pilgrim. Sharon Swanepoel photo | The Walton Tribune Following the swearing-in of now mayor Stephanie Moncrief, councilwoman Rachel Davis and councilwoman Maxine McClanahan, the full all-women Walnut Grove City Council took their seats Thursday night to begin the city’s business. Already seated were council members Linda Pilgrim and Erica Miles. Moncrief, at the time in the capacity of mayor-pro tem, opened the City Council meeting in the absence of outgoing Mayor Steven Mark Moore. The outgoing mayor did not attend the final meeting of his term. City Attorney Tony Powell then administered the Oath of Office to Moncrief, followed by Davis, who were each joined in the ceremony by their families. McClanahan, joined by former Walnut Grove city council member Carol Witcher, then also took the oath of office before taking her seat on the council. Following what had been a somewhat contentious election season, on Nov. 7, Moncrief was able to defeat Moore for the mayor’s seat and McClanahan and Davis were the two top vote-getters in the field of four city council candidates with Ty Arnold and Dominic DiGrado coming up short. With all the men out of the running, Walnut Grove City Council can now claim to be the first all-women city council in Walton County. According to recently elected council membver Maxine McClanahan, it is also historic for Walton County and somewhat of a rarity in the state of Georgia. “I do not believe Walton County has ever had any of our cities with an all-female council. In fact, my research finds that it is a rarity in the state. I have only turned up two occurrences, one in 1974 in Walthourville which was a council appointed (vs. elected) by the then Governor Jimmy Carter. There was an elected council for Pine Lake, GA a few years ago,” McClanahan said. Log In Keep it Clean. Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexually-oriented language.

On Sunday night, the WGA announced they had reached a tentative deal that would end one of Hollywood’s longest-ever strikes. The deal, which must now be ratified by the union’s 11,500 members, would impose new rules around the use of artificial intelligence and boost residual payments for streaming shows. Film students, hoping to graduate into a functioning industry, were excited. The Writers Guild initially struck alone but was later joined by the screen actors’ union, SAG-AFTRA, who voiced similar concerns about decreased pay in the streaming age and the emergent use of artificial intelligence. Both unions sought guarantees that generative AI would not be used to replace the labor of artists and writers. While AI cannot currently compose original art on its own, producers have become interested in using it as an auxiliary tool in the screenwriting and acting processes. The unions viewed this as an existential threat. The strike halted production across the country. Production in the state of Georgia was not immune. Big-name projects like Season 5 of Netflix-hit Stranger Things, Marvel’s Blade and Cobra Kai stopped in the middle of production. Kelsey Moore, the executive director of the Georgia Screen Entertainment Coalition, stated the productions in the state had “ground to a halt.” Many were concerned with the film industry strike’s impact on Georgia’s economy, with the industry investing $4.4 billion in the state in 2022 alone. Elsewhere, upcoming Film and media students at Georgia State, home to the state’s largest film program, are also concerned. “It’s scary,” said Emma Wirt, a third-year film student who recently added a Marketing minor in fear of future job scarcity. “Even though the strike ended, AI could evolve to basically end employment in film and writing.” While independent production houses come to terms with unions and continue to shoot across the state, the decreased number of productions, especially large ones, could severely dampen GSU’s successful track record of professional placement. The strike – which has impacted the pocketbooks of all film and media professionals, from those who provide Kraft services to make-up artists and costume designers, is set to end. Conyers-based writer Lamont Ferrell hopes the deal proposed by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers will protect writers and crew alike from the dangers of Artificial Intelligence. However, that does not mean production will restart. AMPTP is still yet to agree on a deal with SAG-AFTRA. Producers and studio heads’ concessions to writers could signal their willingness to negotiate with actors and allow all productions to commence across The Peach State.

Rincon Police are still looking for one of the three subjects who attempted to take more than $2,000 worth of merchandise from the Lowes store on Hwy. 21 in Rincon on June 25. Hansbrough was terminated by Lowes for violating store policy that prevents employees from stopping persons attempting shoplifting. “They say that if you see somebody stealing something out the door, not to pursue, not to go out. I lost it,” Hansbrough said. “I grabbed the cart. I don't actually remember going out but I did. And I grabbed the cart that had the stolen items in (it).” One of the subjects punched Hansbrough in the face, causing one of her eyes to swell and blacken. Now, nearly a month later, her black eye is almost healed she said. Hansbrough admits her mistake was just being overwhelmed by instinct. The 13-year employee didn’t expect to get terminated. “I just got tired of seeing things get out the door. I just … I lost it,” Hansbrough recalls. “I basically lost all the training. Everything they tell you to do, I just … I just lost it. “I didn’t expect to get terminated,” she added. “Maybe a reprimand or a suspension.” As for her future, she said, “I’m going to look for a new job. I can’t sit at home. I’m not that type of person.” Hansbrough said she started at Lowes as a cashier, but eventually became a “live-nursery specialist” when they found out she knew a lot about plants. “My father worked at a nursery and I just kind of tagged along when I was little,” Hansbrough explained. She held that position for a few years until it was eliminated, “And I was just a customer service associate with live plants.” She added that Lowes let her keep her hours and her pay rate. “Everything was the same. I just didn’t have the title.” If the case goes to a trial, she said, “If they do need me, I will be there.”""}]"

22-23 Revenue and Expenditures Report by Sami Mastrario Tensions were high when County Commissioners Brad Calhoun and Dana Whiddon faced concerned Turner County citizens at the latest budget hearing meeting held on Thursday, June 15 at the Turner County Agricultural Center. Since the meeting is not a called meeting but instead a public hearing, the other three County Commissioners were not required to be present. It was standing room only as well as several citizens sitting in the hallway due to lack of space in the room. Commission members present: Dana Whiddon, Brad Calhoun (Chair). Also present: Cherysh Green-Caldwell (County Manager) Last week, The Wiregrass Farmer reported that a 4 mil hike in taxes would be required to cover the proposed 2023-2024 budget the county department heads had presented to the commissioners for the next fiscal year. After Wednesday’s budget hearing, all reports were saying that they balanced the budget with no need to raise taxes or cut services, but rather pull money from reserves and money from the Jail Fund. What changed in the 24 hours? That was discussed in exhaustive detail at the beginning of Thursday’s budget hearing. The meat of the issue comes down to the amount of money they are pulling from reserves versus the amount of money they are pulling from the Jail Fund. When the commissioners all left with a balanced budget on Wednesday evening, the proposed idea was to pull money from reserves as well as use the full jail fund of $500,000. Commissioner Whiddon went home and continued to review the numbers presented at Wednesday’s meeting. After review, she determined she was not satisfied with pulling as much money from reserves because the County has bled that well almost dry. She called the county manager, Mrs. Cherysh Green-Caldwell early the next morning to express her and Commissioner Burgess’s reservations and asked that Mrs. Green-Caldwell reevaluate the budget again and reach out to Chairman Calhoun. At Thursday’s budget hearing, a new budget was presented with a 1 mil tax increase that still has Mrs. Whiddon concerned. Commissioner Whiddon: Just want to make sure that I understand. So this is not the budget that we walked out with last night? If this budget was not presented and worked through with the whole board, then this is not a valid budget. We can’t present it because we haven’t had an open board discussion. Commissioner Calhoun: We went through every budget for the last few weeks. Commissioner Whiddon: But we are modifying budgets and we are adding a tax increase. We didn’t talk about that last night. Commissioner Calhoun: We most certainly talked about a tax increase, They talked about a 4 mil tax increase, a 2 mil tax increase. Commissioner Whiddon: But the budget last night did not include a tax increase. Commissioner Calhoun: It did not. It did not include a tax increase because you and Joe [Commissioner Burgess] were not going to vote to accept that. To only take $250,000. Y’all decided y’all wanted $500,000 from the Jail Fund. Commissioner Whiddon: Because we were concerned about taking $500,000 from the reserves. That is what I expressed. Commissioner Calhoun: I get what you are concerned about. I am concerned about that. Commissioner Calhoun: But this budget doesn’t rectify that. We are still taking $500,000 from reserves. Commissioner Calhoun: But we are taking $250,000 from the Jail Fund. Not $500,000. Commissioner Whiddon: But we are also raising the Jail budget by $250,000. Commissioner Calhoun: That is correct. Commissioner Whiddon: So now we are spending $2 million on the jail instead of $1.5 million. Commissioner Calhoun: Whatever the math works out to. Commissioner Whiddon: So we are not dealing with the health department. We are not making whole any of the cuts. We are not reinstating the janitorial contract. This $250,000 mil rate increase is 100% going to a budget already fully funded.That’s concerning. Commissioner Calhoun: Is there a question? Commissioner Whiddon: No, I am just making a statement that’s concerning that we are raising taxes to add to a budget that we fully funded. The concerns Commissioner Dana Whiddon presents are valid. The 1 mil increase budget that was presented does not address the problem of pulling money from reserves because the anticipated new budget presented at Thursday’s budget hearing still shows having to pull $500,000 from reserves. It does show a reduction in use of the Jail Fund. The current reserves account balance as discussed at the Budget hearing on Thursday sits at roughly $1.4 million dollars. Some of that money is already “reserved” for this fiscal year. Commissioner Whiddon took the time to discuss why pulling more money from reserves is an issue when asked by audience member Cristi Brown Ellis: Commissioner Whiddon: So what we have in our Georgia 1 fund which fluctuates a little bit but ~$1.4 million. The other part is that we have not closed out this fiscal year yet and so we have had several expenditures that we didn’t budget for that may impact that. We had the defined benefits come in and we budgeted $150,000 but it came in $424,000, so there is a gap there that is going to have to come from reserves. When we did the pay raise for $2.00/hr, we spent it based on the projection that the Sheriff might bring in $4.2 million so if that doesn’t happen, that difference will have to come out of reserves for this fiscal year. And then we had several other expenses that we made. Until the books are cleaned up, right now we are running behind, so it may reduce that $1.4 million. Continuing after some back and forth with Cristi and Commissioner Calhoun about poor money management by the County, Commissioner Whiddon offered some more clarification: Commissioner Whiddon: My concern is that we were still tapping $500,000 more [from reserves for fiscal year 2023-2024]. We budgeted to take $550,000 this year [for fiscal year 2022-2023]. So take $500,000 from that $1.4 million and we have $900,000. Now we are going to take $500,000 this year. You are at $400,000. That is where we are at if what we projected happens. So that is what made me concerned to call and say, I think we need to reconsider using all of that money that isn’t going to force us to take it from reserves. Because I feel like we can still be balanced, we can still not raise taxes, and that would be an answer to addressing our spending out of reserves. Obviously Mr. Calhoun didn’t agree with that and that’s fine. That is why there are 5 of us. But I think that that is the answer. Mr. Calhoun doesn’t agree and two other board members don’t agree. That is why we are here with the raising of taxes. It can be done, we just have to have the willpower to do it. After that statement, discussion on the Jail Fund versus the Reserves fizzled out as other audience members chimed in their concerns with various aspects of the budget. Mr. Dustin Land questioned Commissioner Calhoun about the 90% increase in budget for the Sheriff’s department and Jail budget differences from 2013 to current requests. Dustin Land: Mr. Chairman, in 2013, the Sheriff’s budget was $972,000. Now it is $1.8 million. Why the 90% increase? Commissioner Calhoun: You will ask him specifically. Dustin Land: I am asking you as Chairman of the Commission. You gave him the money, why the increase? Commissioner Calhoun: I will be glad to answer your question, you don’t have to be so aggressive. Dustin Land: Answer the question and quit deflecting. Commissioner Calhoun: I am not deflecting. I am saying he can give you the exact. Basically, we are on the interstate with more patrol cars. Do you have the # of the revenue that we brought in in 2013? Dustin Land: Fines and Fees? 2 million dollars. Commissioner Calhoun: Do you have the number through this month? County Clerk Wilson: Through April. County Manager Green-Caldwell: The report I ran on May the 30th, I am not sure when the data was updated, was 3,305,426. Dustin Land: So my question is when has the Sheriff brought in $4 million. Has it ever happened before? Commissioner Calhoun: Never. So I am so tickled that we are going to do it this year. I think Mrs. Mary Lee brought in $3,685,000 last year going from memory? Around $3,700,000. And we had only had $2,700,000 budgeted to bring in do you remember? County Manager Green-Caldwell: 2022 anticipated was $2.7 million and actual brought in was $3.7 million. Dustin Land: So why are we raising taxes. Commissioner Calhoun: Because we spent. Dustin Land: That’s the problem I am trying to get to. Y’all spent. Commissioner Calhoun: You know why we spent? It’s because stuff has went up over the years. Everything. I don’t know what hasn’t gone up. And this year we have'}]"

In a statement to the Miami Herald, Aldi CEO Jason Hart clarified that not all stores will be converted into Aldi locations. “We are evaluating which locations will convert to the Aldi format to better support the neighborhoods we’ll now have the privilege of serving,” he said. Stores that aren’t converted will retain their old Winn-Dixie branding and style. It is currently unknown if the Bainbridge store will remain the same or undergo conversion.

The newspaper is operated locally as part of Metro Market Media, a Gainesville-based company that also owns The Times in Gainesville and the Dawson County News. Forsyth County News reporters are dedicated to covering issues of development, education, crime and other local topics important to the residents of Forsyth County. As professional journalists, their role is to report as completely and impartially as possible verifiable facts so readers can, based on their own knowledge and experience, determine what they believe to be the truth. That is often an ongoing pursuit as journalists work to uncover stories and follow those stories wherever they lead, regardless of preconceived ideas. The news they report is separate from the opinions shared in the Forsyth County News, which include those by columnists, political cartoonists and readers who submit letters to the editor. The presentation of both news and opinions is designed to educate, entertain and foster community conversation. Readers are encouraged to challenge and sharpen their perceptions based on that presentation. And we encourage readers to do the same for our staff, offering news tips, criticisms and questions. The Forsyth County News was founded in Cumming in 1908 by Joe Patterson, who sold the newspaper to Roy P. Otwell in 1927. Otwell combined the Forsyth County News with the North Georgian newspaper. He remained chief editor and owned the newspaper for 27 years. Charles Smithgall Sr. purchased the Forsyth County News in 1954. He operated the paper for several years before selling it to News Corp in 1970. At that time, News Corp published the Gwinnett Daily News, the Winder News and the Forsyth County News. Robert Fowler sold News Corp to The New York Times for $103 million in 1987. By 1994, Swartz-Morris Media had acquired both the Forsyth County News and the Forsyth Forum newspaper, merging the two into today's Forsyth County News. In 2018, Metro Market Media, owned by Charles Hill Morris Jr., purchased the Forsyth, Dawson and Gainesville papers. As Forsyth County’s only paid circulation local newspaper and most visited local media website, the Forsyth County News remains committed to informing and entertaining readers as Forsyth County’s premier media outlet.""}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:10 pm SPARTA, Ga. — Local and state law enforcement authorities are working to determine the circumstances surrounding the death of a Sparta woman found inside a residence Saturday morning. The victim died at Atrium Health Navicent Baldwin hospital in Milledgeville, according to a press release from Sparta Police Chief Tommie Walker Jr. The police chief identified the victim as Jaquashia Rhodes. Walker said police officers were dispatched following “an undisclosed complaint” at a residence on the 300 block of Powelton Avenue at 11:20 a.m. “Upon reaching the scene, officers were approached by an individual from the western side of the residence, who informed us that a female had sustained a gunshot wound,” Walker said. After entering the residence, officers discovered Rhodes laying on her left side on the floor of a bedroom, Walker said. “It was stated that Ms. Rhodes had been unintentionally shot,” Walker said. Police officers detained a man for questioning at the scene but no one had reportedly been charged in connection with the shooting as of Monday afternoon, authorities said. “Those present at the scene attested that the incident was accidental in nature,” Walker said. Rhodes received medical attention at the scene by firefighters/first responders with Hancock County Fire Rescue and personnel with the Hancock County Emergency Medical Services following the shooting. She was taken by ambulance to the emergency department of Atrium Health Navicent Baldwin hospital in Milledgeville where she later died. Walker said agents with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation Region 6 Office in Milledgeville were called to assist the police department with the investigation. The shooting remained under investigation Monday by the Sparta Police Department and the GBI Region 6 Office. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

Haint is an old southern word for ghost or evil spirit. It dates back to 1300s Europe; derived from the verb “hanter,” meaning to stalk or inhabit. If you’re from the South, you’ve probably heard of “haint blue,” or maybe have a porch ceiling that color. But do you know why? “Haint blue” was the color the Gulla Geechee people, descendants of enslaved Africans along the South’s barrier islands, painted their ceilings, believing it would ward off haints. From the islands, haints traveled inland, across the South. Ann Hite, award-winning, best-selling author of “Haints on Black Mountain,” is working with Georgia Writers Museum to research haints in Eatonton. Her work as a “haint expert” and master storyteller helps craft local lore into dramatic performances produced by Greensboro theatre company The Arts Barn. All of the stories shared are 100% true, except for the parts that are completely made up. If you’ve been ghost hunting with Georgia Writers Museum in the past, this is a brand-new way to experience the hauntings. You can still use your own mobile devices to take photos / videos and an app for EMF readers (electro-magnetic frequencies) like they do on Ghost Hunters. We’ll show you how, and perhaps you’ll meet a ghost. Check out this week's edition of The Lake Oconee Breeze. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular images.
