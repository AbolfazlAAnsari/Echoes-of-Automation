At the same time, sinners reconcile with the Church and the community, which are also wounded by our sins. Every time we sin, we hurt ourselves, other people, and our relationship with God. In Reconciliation, we acknowledge our sins before God and His Church. We express our sorrow in a meaningful way, receive the forgiveness of Christ and His Church, make reparation for what we have done, and resolve to do better in the future. The forgiveness of sins involves four parts: contrition, confession, penance, and absolution. ‚Ä¢ Contrition: a sincere sorrow for having off ended God and the most important act of the penitent. There can be no forgiveness of sin if we do not have sorrow and a firm resolve not to repeat our sin. ‚Ä¢ Confession: confronting our sins in a profound way by admitting them aloud to God through the priest. ‚Ä¢ Penance: an important part of our healing process, the penance is imposed by the priest as the means for us to make reparation for our sins. ‚Ä¢ Absolution: the priest speaks the words by which ""God, the Father of Mercies"" reconciles us - sinners - to Himself through the Suffering, Death, and Resurrection of His Son-Jesus Christ. Rite of Reconciliation 1. The priest greets and blesses you. He may share a brief Scripture passage as well. 2. Make the Sign of the Cross and say: ""Bless me father, for I have sinned. My last confession was..."" (Give the number of weeks, months, or years since your last confession.) 3. Confess all of your sins to the priest. The priest will help you to make a good confession. If you are unsure about how to confess or feel uneasy, please let the priest know and ask him to help you. Answer his questions without hiding anything out of fear or shame. Place your trust in God, our merciful Father, who wants to forgive you. 4. Following your confession of sins say: ""I am sorry for these and all of my sins."" 5. The priest assigns you a penance and off ers advice to help you to be a better Catholic. 6. Say an Act of Contrition (like the one below), expressing sorrow for your sins. 7. The priest, acting in the person of Christ, then absolves you from your sins. Act of Contrition O my God, I am heartily sorry for having off ended you, and I detest all my sins because I dread the loss of heaven and the pains of hell, but most of all because they offend you, my God, who are all good and deserving of all my love.

of Lake Okeechobee intended to help revive wilting marshes and Florida Bay. In the lawsuit filed in federal court, U.S. Sugar argued the reservoir will violate a rule included in the federal law authorizing Everglades restoration in 2000. Known as the ""savings clause,"" the rule required the Army Corps to maintain water supplies to farms and utilities as it worked to revive marshes and undo decades of damage from flood control. WLRN is here for you, even when life is unpredictable. Our journalists are continuing to work hard to keep you informed across South Florida. Please support this vital work. Become a WLRN member today. Thank you. The lawsuit also argues that a stormwater treatment marsh attached to the reservoir ‚Äî and expected to be completed first ‚Äî will need lake water to operate during the dry season. The lawsuit argues that would have ‚Äúa significant, unstudied effect on water supply and those entities that depend on it.‚Äù Growers asked the court to send the project back to the Corps for a new environmental analysis. The lawsuit is the latest skirmish in the ongoing battle to bring more water into marshes and Florida Bay after decades of flood control that helped sugar fields flourish. In 2019, sugar growers sued the Corps when it lowered the lake to avoid flushing dirty water to the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie rivers. The discharges, loaded with nutrients from farm and stormwater run-off, can trigger toxic algae blooms. In recent months, as the Corps ironed out a new lake management plan, a consultant who represents sugar growers repeatedly raised concerns about water supplies. The plan, now being finalized, will raise lake levels by more than a foot, to help preserve supplies. But after complaints by environmentalists, the Corps may alter dry season reserves to provide more water to marshes. Jacksonville Commander Col. Andrew Kelly defended the Corps\' work in a weekly briefing Friday, saying the agency will balance water supply for both the environment and farmers. ‚ÄúWe go through a very, very deliberate process, not only with our [environmental] analysis, but with all of the analysis it takes to figure out the best infrastructure to be put in the ground in the right place,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo we\'re pretty confident that the infrastructure plan that we have going forward is a good one.‚Äù Kelly also said the new lake management plan would ensure sugar farmers‚Äô water supply. ‚ÄúWe\'re committed to improving water supply,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand certainly holding on to the performance gains that we\'ve made up to this point.‚Äù Kelly would not speculate on potential delays if the court grants growers‚Äô demand that neither the treatment marsh ‚Äî being built by the state ‚Äî nor the reservoir be used until a new environmental assessment is done. The 6,500-acre treatment marsh needed to clean water from the reservoir is expected to be completed by 2023. Kelly said the 10,500-acre reservoir will be done by 2028 or 2030. ‚ÄúAs the lawsuit progresses, we\'ll see how it works out. But as we go, we\'re continuing and committed to making Lake O water management the best we can,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd we are committed to continuing all of the infrastructure that we\'ve got going with Everglades restoration.‚Äù The lawsuit argues the Corps used a lower lake baseline, calculated after a new management plan was drafted in 2008 to protect the frail dike. Instead, sugar farmers say the Corps should have used a higher baseline that determined lake water distribution before the 2000 Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan was approved.
