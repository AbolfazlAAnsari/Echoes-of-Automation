Nair said about two or three weeks ago, a bullet came flying through the waiting room and ended up going through a window, through a wall and into the bathroom. ""One of my patients was washing his hands, ducking down to wash his hands, thank God,"" Nair said. ""Because if he was standing up straight, I\'m sure it would\'ve hit him. This is not what we want to face while we\'re practicing medicine trying to save lives and comfort lives. ""I just hope that we never see that again."" He said there are several cameras on his building and surrounding buildings, but so far, they haven\'t provided much closure. ""We\'ve got most of these people on camera, but the authorities have never been able to catch them,"" he said. Nair said he\'s speaking out because he wants people to know what\'s happening and he\'s hoping a united front with other businesses in the area will eventually make the crime stop. ""We\'ve stayed in this area because of the people,"" Nair said. ""We\'ve stayed in this area because we\'ve built those relationships. I feel very committed to this community despite everything that\'s happened. I just want people to know we\'re here for them. Hopefully they\'re here for us, and we all just need to work together to try and prevent what\'s happening.""
