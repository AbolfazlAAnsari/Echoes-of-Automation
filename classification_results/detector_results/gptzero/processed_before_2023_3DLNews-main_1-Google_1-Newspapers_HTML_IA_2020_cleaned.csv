DeWitt Police Officer Jacob Costas earned the department’s Meritorious Service Award for his actions on a January 28 call. Costas’ restraint to not fire his weapon — while going against standard law enforcement training and procedure — potentially saved the life of a DeWitt resident. On January 28, police officer Jacob Costas was at gunpoint. He remembers, vividly, how the man holding the gun acted. He was angry and sad at the same time. Costas remembers how the man reached behind his back, into his waistband, and pulled out what looked like a revolver. He recalls how the man lifted the gun and pointed it at him. Costas remembers peering down the barrel of his own Glock 23, his finger tight against the trigger. But he also remembers the look in the man’s eyes. It was a look — an unspoken connection — that gave Costas pause, a split second of hesitation that was the difference between life and death. Costas trusted his intuition that the man on the other end of that gun didn’t want to shoot. He bet his life on it, and he was right. Answering the call Shortly after 6 p.m. on Jan. 28, Costas, a six-year veteran of the DeWitt Police Department, was leaving a CPR training in DeWitt when a call came over the radio. His shift had just ended, but he listened anyway. He doesn’t turn his radio off until he walks into his house. A domestic situation was unfolding in DeWitt, and the only officer on duty at the time was Sgt. Shawn Zeimet, who was waiting for a tow truck at a vehicle accident nearby. Costas responded to dispatchers, latched on to the call, and was briefed over the air. An apparently intoxicated man was acting angrily and “waving a gun around.” While Costas was en route, more information was relayed. The man could be heard by the dispatcher yelling in the background. “He was saying something like, ‘if the police come I’m going to kill ‘em.’” Costas said. “He was mad.” Costas arrived on the scene in DeWitt two minutes later and parked about 50 feet to the north so he could walk up on foot. It’s a strategy law enforcement officers use to approach at an appropriate angle and gain a tactical advantage. But as Costas stepped out of his car, he heard a “pop.” “I was in the middle of turning my radio on and opening and closing the door,” he said. “It was loud. I heard that and I felt like I needed to get up there quickly,” Costas said. Costas ran from his vehicle to the property line only to find the noise he’d heard was the man slamming the door of his house. In a matter of seconds, Costas found himself at the edge of the property with no cover. “He hadn’t seen me yet, but we made contact once I ran up into the yard,” said Costas. He knew to be cautious after previous dealings with the man. The man had been suicidal in the past and was a known drug user, Costas said. “We made contact right away. He was outside, I was kind of on the edge of his yard,” Costas said. “He caught me in a weird situation. You’re trained to find a good cover and use your angles to your advantage, but when he came out I was kind of out there in the open.” Costas immediately began talking with the man. “He was obviously amped up,” Costas said. “I tried to de-escalate the situation. First thing you want to do is make sure you can see his hands. I could only see one at the time. I said ‘hey man, let me see your hands.’” “He said, ‘I ain’t got nothing.’” Costas then confirmed both of the man’s hands were empty. He asked the man if he was armed. “He initially said ‘yes,’” Costas said. “I explained to him what I was going to do. I wanted to keep him the least agitated as I could. I said ‘Hey man, I just want to pat you down for weapons, is that okay?’” The man then told Costas he wasn’t armed after all. Costas, though, wanted to check for himself. “I was like ‘okay, well, I want to check for myself. I want to verify for my safety and everyone else’s safety and then we can start talking,’” Costas said. “And that’s when he said ‘No, man, this is my house. It’s my house.’” Costas tentatively approached until he was about 15 feet from the man. Then, things escalated. The man reached behind his back into waistband of his jeans, Costas said. “You know what that reach is for,” Costas said. “He’s not reaching to keep his pants from falling down. So, I draw my weapon and said ‘dude, don’t.’” But it was to no avail. The man’s hand swung around with the gun in it. He originally pointed the it at the ground, Costas said. “I’m trying to gauge the situation, and I can see in his eyes that he’s debating,” Costas remembered. “That’s when I started giving him verbal commands to drop the weapon. I said, ‘dude, come on, drop the weapon. Put it down.’” The commands didn’t work. “He said ‘F*** you. Kill me. Kill me.’” Costas recalled. The man raised the gun and pointed it at Costas. Both men were at gunpoint. “I’m trying to prevent (shooting him). That’s something no one wants to do,” Costas said. “At that point, that’s when I start my trigger press. There’s a lot of factors you want to consider before you shoot. Obviously, your own safety, if he’s pointing it at you, you’re more than justified to use deadly force. But you want to make sure of what’s behind him, see if there’s another officer. If I were to shoot and miss will it go into his house and hit his kids?” But, in a quick reversal of fortune, the man threw the revolver on the ground. At this point, Zeimet arrived on the scene and ran up to Costas’ location. He and Costas secured the man and obtained the gun, which turned out to a realistic-looking BB gun. “But, he didn’t know that (it was a BB gun),” Zeimet said. “And that dang thing look real. Even up close. You couldn’t tell up close really without examining it.” Costas said from the time he left his car to the moment the man’s gun hit the ground, no more than 20 seconds had passed. “It felt like forever,” he said. Mind of an officer Before Jan. 28, in his six years as an officer in DeWitt, Costas had never had a gun of any kind pointed at him. Training, along with stints overseas in the Army, had prepared him for the situation. While driving to the scene, Costas tried to prepare his mind the best he could. When responding to a call, previous knowledge of the subject can be both a blessing and a curse, he said. It’s important to use previous encounters as a resource, but not become jaded by them. “You can compare it to a similar situation,” Costas said. “But every situation is dynamic and there are intricacies and aspects that can change the whole scenario. You tell yourself to take it as it comes. Don’t automatically assume that you’re about to go shoot somebody.” In other words, expect nothing and everything. That’s why, when Costas heard the initial “pop,” he sprang into action. However, in this case, it backfired. He was caught in the open, completely exposed. “You always want to put yourself in a tactical situation that’s to your advantage,” said DeWitt Chief of Police Dave Porter. “That’s why when you see cops in restaurants, we sit in a corner with our backs to the corner. We can see what’s going on. It’s tactical, I guess that’s how we are wired.” Costas knew he was at a disadvantage. De-escalation was the best tactic at that point, he figured.

Press photo by Kelly Terpstra Skiing across the frozen landscape of the Tosanak Recreation Area is a fun way to stay active and burn off some calories. No “expert only” signs or the threat of an avalanche came attached to this snow-packed endeavor. That’s not this sport. While cross country skiing may sound similar to downhill skiing, it’s not. “When they think of skiing, they think of the downhill skiing and speed. That’s completely different,” said Floyd County Naturalist Heidi Reams. “Cross country skiing is as simple as walking. You’re basically just sliding your feet.” Floyd County Conservation hosted open cross country skiing Saturday near Marble Rock at Tosanak. Young and old could pay a minimal equipment rental fee, learn about the sport or take a trip around the many trails in the 370-acre area filled with wildlife habitat. “When you get your skis on, you can just go right on the track and ski with ease,” said Reams. “We have a loop out here so people that haven’t done it before can get a hang of it. Then they go out on the trails.” Reams said several families came out to experience the beautiful winter day, snap the special boots onto their skis and take a trek into nature’s snow-draped winter wonderland. “Only your toe is attached. So you still walk and do your regular motion, it’s just that you just kind of drag your feet,” said Reams. “The poles are just there for balance. They’re more like when you use a walking stick. You don’t really use the poles to push off. You stay up on the snow. You don’t sink down in.” Reams said one can burn 400 calories in just an hour of cross country skiing. “It’s a good aerobic exercise,” she added. Reams also had hot chocolate on hand in the Learning Center building of Tosanak, so folks could take a break to warm up if they so desired. Above-average temperatures this week made the snow a little more difficult to navigate. “It hurts it a little bit. The warmer temps make the snow sticky,” said Reams. But as long as there is snow cover and the trails are groomed, anyone with a pair of boots and skis can come out and enjoy the easy-to-learn adventurous skill set. “It helps if you lean a little bit forward because if you have something slippery on your feet and you lean back – your weight is going to kick your feet up,” said Reams. “It’s just a walking motion,” she said. “The most important thing is not to overdress. Typically, everyone comes all bundled up and once you get moving you’ll definitely work up a sweat.” Prospective skiers can bring their significant others for some nighttime skiing next month on Saturday, Feb. 15. That’s when Floyd County Conservation has the Sweetheart Stroll planned. Reams said trails will be candle lit with ice luminaries so couples can ski the trails during the evening. She said the event is geared for adults. “It’s amazing what you can see at night. Everyone is all worried about being able to see. Once you get away from street lights and house lights your eyes will adjust and you can see a lot better than you think,” she added. Reams said kids as young as 5 or 6 come out to ski with their parents at Tosanak. “We have youth skis. We can go pretty tiny,” she said. The Fossil and Prairie Foundation purchased the ski equipment in 2011 and youth gear was added shortly thereafter. Reams said Floyd County Conservation can rent out about 46 pairs of skis. The open skiing sessions, which ran from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. on Saturday, also offer up a chance for anyone that might be interested in purchasing their own skiing equipment if they decide they really enjoy the sport.

Eugene Goos have been named in a pair of civil lawsuits - one filed by an employee at the Mills County Attorney’s Office and another by a former deputy sheriff. In a petition filed in Mills County District Court in March, Lisa York, an administrative assistant at the county attorney’s office, alleges she’s been “subjected to sexual harassment” and a “sexually hostile work environment by Goos” while Mills County officials have failed to take action to address her concerns. York began working at the county attorney’s office in 2014 after spending 17 years as a dispatcher in the Mills County Communications Center. York’s job requires her to have interaction with law enforcement officers, including Goos, on a regular basis. The petition lists multiple instances when Goos allegedly made lewd, sexually-suggestive or humiliating comments towards York in the presence of other individuals, even after she had a filed a written complaint in 2017 about the sheriff and the way he talks to female employees. York alleges that Goos became angry after learning of the complaint and continued to make “inappropriate comments” and exhibit “aggressive behavior” hat created a “culture of pervasive sexual harassment in the workplace.” The petition in the second lawsuit was filed earlier this month by former deputy Denise Jens. Defendants named in the lawsuit are Goos, Chief Deputy Kim Clark, the Mills County Sheriff’s Office and Mills County. Jens was employed as a Mills County deputy for over 20 years before resigning in November. Jens alleges in the petition that she was a victim of harassment, retaliation, disability discrimination and sexual discrimination, dating as far back as 2003 when she said Goos made inappropriate and sexually-suggestive comments to her and about her to other employees while both were working as deputies. More recently, Jens alleges Goos began retaliating against her after she reported to Sgt. Evan York, a fellow deputy, in September 2018 that she believed Goos smelled like alcohol while on duty. The petition states that Jens had a “good-faith reasonable belief that Goos was intoxicated at work” and her report to Sgt. York was an action protected by Iowa’s whistleblower law. An investigation by a Des Moines-based legal firm later determined Jens was mistaken and Goos had not consumed alcohol before or during work, the petition acknowledges. Jens alleges that after her report was made to Sgt. York, she became the subject of retaliation by Goos and Clark and suspended without pay for five days. Jens said a letter she received from Clark claimed Jens had violated department policy for failing to show up for work one day and by sending a text notification to let the office know she was sick and unable to work on another occasion. In the petition, Jens said she appealed her suspension to the Mills County Civil Service Commission and had her penalty reduced to three days because the commission determined the sheriff’s office absence policy was “ambiguous and confusing” and text message absence notification had been an accepted practice at the office. Jens’ petition also claims that three male officers failed to report for work without notification, but were not disciplined by Goos or Clark. Jens contends the retaliation and harassment continued into 2019 when she was accused of violating department policies and standard operating procedures on multiple occasions. In June 2019, Jens said she notified the Mills County Board of Supervisors of the “continued harassment.” The petition states that Jens suffers from migraine headaches and anxiety and her conditions were “exacerbated by the harassing behavior of the defendants and greatly impacted her ability to perform her duties at work.” In 2018, the petition states, Jens injured her Achilles tendon during firearms qualification. She alleges when she returned to work, Clark instructed her to change out of the shorts she was wearing to accomodate her cast. In order to comply with the request, Jens said she had to remove the cast against her doctor’s orders. She also alleges receiving emails threatening her insubordination while she was on sick leave and that Goos and Clark disclosed her medical information to other county employees. The petition states that in September 2019, Jens “exhausted her administrative remedies by filing a discrimination complaint with the Iowa Civil Rights Commission (ICRC). In February, Jens received a “Right To Sue” letter from the ICRC, the petition states. The plaintiffs in both cases have requested jury trials and are asking for a declaration from the court that the actions of the defendants are in violation of the Iowa Civil Rights Act and to permanently prohibit the defendants from engaging in the alleged harassing and discriminatory behavior. They are also seeking monetary damages and legal fees. Goos declined to discuss the allegations made in the lawsuits when contacted by The Opinion-Tribune, deferring to Council Bluffs attorney Kristopher Madsen, who is representing all defendants in the two cases, including Mills County. Madsen said he is unable to discuss specific claims made in the petitions, but said he’s confident Goos, Clark, the sheriff’s office and Mills County will be cleared. “We vehemently deny the allegations contained in each of the petitions that were filed and look forward to successfully defending them in court,” Madsen said. Madsen said it’s possible the two cases could go to trial at a venue outside of Mills County and because of COVID-19-related delays and cancellations in the courts system, the cases could linger into 2021. Madsen acknowledged it isn’t an ideal scenario for Goos, who is up for re-election in 2020. “Unfortunately, we’re in challenging times now. We’ve had orders suspending trials through most of the summer. Then, even if that hadn’t occurred, these cases were all just filed within the last few weeks,” Madsen said. “Even in a best scenario, we’re probably not going to get a trial date until late 2020 or even early 2021, which is unfortunate from Sheriff Goos’ standpoint and the county because we look forward to defending these claims.” 116 S Walnut St Glenwood, IA 51534-1665P.O.

A report released this month by the American Council of Renewable Energy revealed that 446,000 renewable energy workers nationwide will be unemployed heading into the holidays, a figure that represents 13% of the sector’s workforce. This metric underscores the struggles that have faced the solar and wind industries over the past year. Eagle Point Solar President and CEO Jim Pullen acknowledged that 2020 has not gone as expected, but he emphasized that the outlook for the Dubuque-based company — and the industry as a whole — remains strong. “The downsides were not as drastic here as we saw in other areas,” he said. “We still grew from a sales side, but we grew slower than we really wanted to. We didn’t get where we thought we could get.” Pullen said Eagle Point Solar’s 2020 sales likely will finish between 5% and 10% below budget, even though the company outpaced the previous year’s results. He explained that the pandemic didn’t slow construction of solar projects that Eagle Point had already landed. But it disrupted the interactions that typically generate new sales. Eagle Point operates in Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin. At certain points this year, depending on the specific restrictions within each state, sales representatives were not able to visit potential new clients. “We are a face-to-face business,” Pullen explained. “Our model is to sit down with homeowners or business owners and talk to them in person.” Despite such hurdles, renewable energy still saw its presence grow. According to a Dec. 8 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, renewable energy sources will generate roughly 20% of electricity in 2020, up from 18% in 2019. That figure is projected to rise to 21% next year. EIA projects that 23 gigawatts of wind energy were added in 2020 and another 9.5 gigawatts will be brought on in 2021. Solar capacity rose by 12.8 gigawatts in 2020 and will increase by around 14 gigawatts next year, EIA predicted. The growing commitment to renewable energy was reflected in Alliant Energy’s recently released Clean Energy Blueprint for Iowa. According to the document, the utility plans to discontinue coal generation in Lansing, Iowa, by the end of 2022 and transition its Burlington Generating Station to natural gas in 2021. Meanwhile, Alliant will increase its use of renewable resources, add more battery storage and build out a connected energy network. Alliant intends to add 400 megawatts of solar by 2023. Combined with the utility’s 1,300 megawatts of wind energy and other resources, nearly 50% of Alliant’s generation portfolio will come from renewables. Ben Lipari, Alliant’s Director of Resource Development, believes these developments speak to a broader transition. “It is really about the transformation of our generation portfolio,” he said. “As we look to retire some of our traditional assets, there is also an opportunity to bring forward renewable assets.” The growth of such assets is not particularly surprising, given their advantages. “They are truly beneficial for customers, because they are marrying the benefits of environmental stewardship with the economic benefits,” Lipari said. For those in the renewable energy industry, the election of a new president signals a new opportunity. Just one week after the election, the Solar Energy Industries Association formally released a suite of policies that it is asking President-elect Joe Biden to act on during his first 100 days in office. The association’s wishlist includes a tax policy that expands the use of solar energy; trade policies that offer clarity and predictability; and permitting approvals that cut red tape and allow for quicker and cheaper installation of solar energy. Governmental policy can shape how the solar industry is viewed by consumers and workers alike. For instance, a longstanding investment tax credit for solar installation has compelled customers to embrace the renewable energy source and, in turn, led to the creation of more jobs. But the value of this credit is shrinking and, according to Pullen, is eventually slated to be phased out altogether for residential customers. He is among many in the industry that would like to see that credit restored to its original level. As he looks forward, Pullen sees plenty of reason to be optimistic. He expects 15% to 20% sales growth in 2021, a trend that should have a ripple effect on the employment base at Eagle Point Solar. “Sales growth means adding employees,” he said.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 2:17 pm From left to right: Jax, Max and Ashley Hinson enjoy the corn palace at Bloomsbury Farm in Atkins on Saturday. Ashley Hinson’s Saturday looked typical of a mother of two young children during an Iowa fall day. She and her husband Matt took their two sons, Max and Jax, to Bloomsbury Farm in Atkins during Sunflower Days to enjoy the giant slide, the corn palace, but maybe not the haunted house this time. “Jax wanted to go do the haunted house, but was too chicken to go in,” Hinson chuckled. “I did it and it was fun. Both my children love the corn palace. It’s like the ball pits we used to have at McDonalds growing up. Jax loved the zip line and Max enjoyed going down the big slide on his rug. We try to come here every year.” Hinson, a former news reporter and current Iowa legislator, was taking a Saturday to enjoy time with her family, but even then was open to talking with the media about topics such as the August 10 derecho, which ripped through Benton County and her hometown of Marion. “It’s staggering how many buildings, not just trees, have been damaged,” Hinson said. “Taking that next step for farmers is hard as harvest begins. One of current legislative constituents has a brother who farms here in Benton County. What he told me was their biggest concern is they’ve lost so much crop anyway, they’re gonna do so much damage to their machinery. Some have to harvest their damaged crops just to get their relief checks.” Bloomsbury Farm was hit by the severe storm and forced to close their doors for a time to get repairs started. Even as they were open to the public on Saturday, Hinson noted damage to a nearby roof and throughout the grounds. Coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, area businesses have struggled and that has not gone unnoticed to her and is among several reasons she is running for Congress against Democratic incumbent Abby Finkenauer this November. “Businesses right now are looking for long term certainty because if they’re going to make big investments to grow their business and expand, they need that certainty,” Hinson said. “In the Iowa legislature, we passed a liability bill that helps businesses who are operating the right way and doing everything they could to help prevent the spread of the pandemic, so that they could open their doors in a safe manner. I want to go into Washington D.C. to go to bat for small businesses like Bloomsbury Farm, to advocate for policies that give them certainty to grow, expand and create jobs to keep our economy moving forward.” With a month until the election, Hinson stated she is focused on hearing what people have to say and getting her message out on social media when it’s not possible to be out campaigning. Hinson and Finkenauer have debated once and the former hopes another chance for debate comes ahead of the November 3 election for Iowa’s District 1, which includes Benton and her home Linn County. According to Hinson, she has visited 18 counties in three weeks. But for Saturday, it was about enjoying some family time and supporting a local business, as many families were doing on Saturday on the family-owned farm. “If you look at Iowa values, they are about families,” Hinson said. “Everybody wants to be able to let their kids have fun. For Bloomsbury Farm to be open is a visible sign Iowa is ready to move forward, restore our way of life, rebuild our economy and spend time with our families.” To learn more about Ashley Hinson and her campaign for Iowa District 1, check out her website at www.ashleyhinson.com.

DAKOTA DUNES — Tyson Foods Inc. on Monday reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $692 million. Tyson, the largest employer in metro Sioux City, said it had profit of $1.90 per share. Earnings, adjusted for non-recurring gains, were $1.81 per share. The results topped Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of four analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.15 per share. The Springdale, Ark.-based meat producer posted revenue of $11.46 billion in the period, also topping Street forecasts. Three analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $11.11 billion. Tyson incurred $200 million in COVID-19-related expenses for the quarter, and $540 million in expenses for the fiscal year. The costs included production facility downtime and personal protection equipment. “Our team members, agricultural partners, and customers have shown resilience. This has enabled us to maintain and accelerate our efforts to provide global consumers with a safe and accessible food supply,” Tyson President and CEO Dean Banks said. “While we will continue to face pandemic-related challenges in fiscal 2021, we’re settling the business down to be focused on executing our long-term strategy while generating strong returns for shareholders."" For the year, the company reported profit of $2.14 billion, or $5.86 per share. Revenue was reported as $43.19 billion. Tyson shares have fallen 32% since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor\'s 500 index has risen 11%. The stock has fallen 31% in the last 12 months. In the metro area, Tyson employs over 4,500 at its flagship beef plant in Dakota City, its fresh meats headquarters in Dakota Dunes and its cold storage operations in Sioux City.

A suit filed by the family of a worker who died of COVID-19 claims that a manager organized a pool to guess how many workers would be infected. Tyson said it will be “strongly encouraging” its employees to get the vaccination and will work to ensure anyone who wants the vaccine can get one.

In a ceremony last Wednesday, Dr. Carol and Ed Moreno received this year's Community Service Award for their efforts through the program they founded, the West Liberty Youth Dream Catchers. MUSCATINE — Last Wednesday, the Community Foundation of Greater Muscatine awarded West Liberty’s Dr. Carol and Ed Moreno with this year’s Tom Hendricks Community Service Award. “It was quite humbling,” said Ed as he looked back on the day he and Carol received the award, “We were aware of the prize, and I guess we were pleasantly surprised that we were able to receive it. It’s quite an honor.” Ed added that what made the ceremony all the nicer was that they were able to share it with the families and mentors who were returning to the Dream House after the pandemic temporarily shut it down. “We were kind of introducing the facility to everybody, and then to have one of the founders of the foundation and Charla and everyone show up, it was just great.” Created in 2004, Ed and Carol use West Liberty Youth Dream Catchers to help empower children ages 8-18 through mentoring and financial aid, as well as “create a better world through providing educational and experiential opportunities.” “Dr. Carol has been a dentist in West Liberty for over 30 years, and she wanted to give back to the community,” Ed said as he looked back at their program’s beginnings, “We were looking at what was possible, and we wanted to make a difference in the youth and the education.” Both Carol and Ed are first generation college graduates. Understanding how much a college education can impact a person’s life, they wanted to give other students a chance to find academic success and opportunity. “We’re very lucky in what we’ve been able to accomplish in our careers, and also in our lives. We wanted to pass that on, and we felt this was a good way to do it,” Ed said. Each year, five new Dream Catcher students from the West Liberty Community School District are chosen to begin a mentorship with a volunteer from the community. Specifically, the program is open to any student on the free lunch program. With this help and support, these children are then able to complete secondary education. “We’re fortunate to be able to coordinate with the West Liberty Community School District, and a whole bunch of other organizations here in West Liberty,” Ed said, “We’ve gotten great support from the Lion’s Club, the Rotary Club, LULAC, University of Iowa, MCC – just a whole lot of great organizations have supported us in our efforts through fundraisers.” Dream Catcher students also get the opportunity to enroll in post-secondary education institutions they might not be able to apply to without the program. Each student who completes the program receives a four-year, $8,000 scholarship. Outside of the Dream Catchers program, Carol and Ed use their organization to help throughout the community and provide support for students who aren’t in the program. This has included sponsoring Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics summer camps, co-sponsoring a Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics program for West Liberty’s fourth graders, and paying transportation costs for fifth graders, allowing them to attend the annual Iowa Children’s Water Festival. “We’ve seen some real incredible growth,” Ed said. From students just starting this year to seeing the first Dream Catchers graduating from college and beginning careers, to even seeing how the program impacts the siblings of the Dream Catchers, he says that the experience has been incredibly fulfilling. “It’s made a really good impact on a lot of families in our community, and it’s really cool,” he said, “It’s kind of what we envisioned when we first started. When you graduate from college, there’s the expectation that your kids are going to go to college too. It creates something that is generational forever.” For Ed and Carol, they not only see it as an opportunity to give back to their community, but to meet a lot of people through their board. “It’s been nice to partner with everyone, and what we get out of it is that it’s creating this opportunity that is more than a conversation of just us, it’s a community conversation, and that’s very powerful.” Get local news delivered to your inbox!

McAreavy, Harold Hayes, Robert Hayes and Donald Hoffmann. A paved parking area for 104 cars is served by the spacious two-lane drive that leads from Highway 64 at the west edge of Maquoketa. Now that the snows of winter have left and the weather has turned warmer, bikes and their youthful riders are out in force. There were more than 200 bicycles in the bike parking area at the Maquoketa elementary school this week. Mr. and Mrs. Harold J. Millwright have sold Millwright Implement Store at 207 S. Main. 70 YEARS AGO – 1950 Sales and receipts for 1948 in Maquoketa topped $10 million, according to a preliminary report from the 1948 census of business. Retail trade receipts were $9.394 million and selected service trade receipts reach the $223,000 mark. Receipts for business in the rest of the county totaled $6.417 million, with $6.238 million for retail trade. Construction of a new drive-in theater near Maquoketa will get under way soon, announced co-owners Richard Franklin and Walter Allen Jr. Andrew: Miss Barbara Flint and Miss Doris Till have been named valedictorian and salutatorian, respectively, of the senior class at Andrew public school. Carl J. Rotman and Ervin E. Handel, both formerly of Dubuque, have taken over the direct factory dealership of Studebaker for Maquoketa and surrounding area. Rotman was connected with the Studebaker garage in Dubuque for 10 years as parts manager and salesman. Handel was also connected with that garage as head mechanic. Both served in the Army during World War II and were together all through training and during combat duty in Germany with the 1st Army Engineers. 80 YEARS AGO – 1940 Cpt. Robert M. Losey, former Andrew resident, was killed in a German bombing raid at Dombas, Norway, the State Department announced. The raid occurred Sunday. Captain Losey, 31, graduated from West Point in 1929 at Mather Field, Calif. He was assigned as assistant military attache for air in Scandinavia in February. Losey was the first American killed on land since the war began. Lost Nation: Pioneer in brood sow production testing is Orban Schaff, breeder of purebred Hampshires at Lost Nation. Schaff is testing the producing ability of his entire herd in the Registry of Merit program — a system which enables a breeder to coordinate, without guess work, outstanding individuality with equally outstanding production ability. Already, Schaff has located a strain of Hampshire in his herd especially prepotent in the characteristic of heavy birth weight. In observance of Arbor Day, the American Legion Auxiliary members will replant trees on Highway 61 south of Maquoketa to replace those that perished. A tree was planted for each Jackson County boy who made the supreme sacrifice. 90 YEARS AGO – 1930 G.L. Stockham and his crew of workmen are entirely remodeling the building known as the Lyon Block, recently vacated by the McAllister store, removing the double-front preparatory to install a new, modern one. The big room will be divided, the south one-third having been leased by the Gamble Co., a chain radio, auto accessory and light hardware store. Elwood: A force of some 200 men came to lay new steel on the Milwaukee road here. They lay about 5 miles a day and their stay will be brief. The men, some of whom are married, are accompanied by their wives. They are comfortably housed in passenger coaches and enjoy their radios, etc., as much as the men in his own home. Nehimiah Griffen passed away at his home in Morning Sun, Iowa, April 25, after an illness. He was the second son of Ashley and Naomi Griffen and was born January 15, 1849, at Andrew, Iowa, where he resided until 6 years of age, when the family moved to LaMotte. While residing there he answered the call to war and served with Co. H-147 Ill. Volunteer Inf., during the last year of the Civil War. 100 YEARS AGO – 1920 The silliest fad that we have seen suggested for a long time is that of wearing overalls in order to reduce the price of other clothes. Get over the overall fad, boys, before you catch it or buy them to work in. You’ll simply look foolish in them otherwise. The house bill increasing pensions of Civil War veterans to $50 monthly and those of widows of veterans to $30 monthly was passed by the Senate and now goes to conference. The present average pension of veterans is $37.50 and that of widows $25. The work of tearing out the blocks formerly owned by A.A. Hurst and the Dobson estate is now going on rapidly and the site will ere many moons be graced by a fine, new, modern bank building, the home of First National and Farmers Trust and Savings banks.

Over the past few months, a subcommittee of Bellevue Hometown Pride has been meeting to discuss long-range plans for the future of Felderman Park. The subcommittee members included Lyn Medinger, Abbey Skrivseth, Anne Felderman, Carrie Weaver, Gary Penniston, Tom Meyer, Nic Hockenberry, Kyle Guenther, and Dave Heiar. This committee identified about twenty ideas they would like to see happen in the city park. They include: • Removal of compost site • Extension of utilities (water, sanitary sewer, and electric) • Restrooms • Splash pad • Playground equipment • Potentially equipment for smaller children • Outdoor workout/exercise equipment course • Trampoline Pillow • Concession/storage building with restrooms • Sprinkler systems for soccer field • Dog park • Sensory park equipment • Rental bikes and/or Segways • Better access to creek or fish platform on shore • Trail lighting • Soccer field lighting • Paved parking • Flagpole • Skate Park • Community Garden • Prairie Planting Area • Acquire land for expansion Kyle Guenther then took these ideas and put together conceptual plans for how these recommendations would look at Felderman Park. The subcommittee then put together a survey to gather public input. Please visit the City’s website to see a visual for the conceptual plans and to take the survey: City News The city council reviewed the recommendations and gave their approval to sharing these ideas with the public to get community input and feedback. It should be stressed that this is a planning process. Not every idea that has been offered, or that might be added to the list, would necessarily be included in this park project. This plan is also envisioned to be a multi-year plan based on funding. It is, however, easier to apply for grants or solicit donations once a plan is in place. Dave Heiar, Bellevue Hometown Pride Coach commented, “Successful projects start with a plan. Bellevue is known for its beauty and recreational opportunities. Felderman Park has the potential to add to the sense of place that makes Bellevue shine above others.” Anyone interested in providing feedback on the Felderman Park concepts or wishing to offer additional ideas can submit them to Bellevue City Administrator Abbey Skrivseth at Abbey.Skrivseth@bellevueia.gov or drop off at Bellevue City Hall, 106 N.

election anxieties as hundreds of people have called into her office worried about mailing in votes for November\'s election. This election cycle has been marked by concerns over mailed-in ballots. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized mail-in voting. Democrats have called recent changes to the United States Postal Service ""sabotage"" of the agency ahead of November. Absentee ballot lawsuits in Iowa only added to these fears votes won\'t be counted. In Story County, Martin said the auditor\'s office has mail-in voting under control. ""There\'s a lot of floating anxiety and fear out there, between COVID-19 and people worried about the Post Office, and it being a general election cycle,"" Martin said. ""That\'s just a real stew of anxieties."" Normally, Story County mails out about 4,000 ballots the first day they are able to. This year, their office already processed 14,000 requests as of Sept. 16, Martin said. Voters can expect their ballots after Oct. 5, the first day the office can send them out. The idea of voter fraud via mail-in voting holds no validity, Martin said. ""It\'s a very safe process,"" she said. ""We\'ve always had a really robust system of absentee voting in Iowa for decades now. There are just so many horrible lies and bad information and disinformation being propagated out there."" Many concerns come from people receiving multiple ballot request forms. Martin said each year the Center for Voter Information, the Republican Party of Iowa and the Iowa Democratic Party all send out ballot request forms which leads to voters getting multiple forms. Due to COVID-19, Secretary of State Paul Pate\'s office is sending out request forms. The only time the Story County Auditor\'s Office sends out request forms is after a voter calls and requests one or the office receives an incomplete form. Receiving multiple forms is common, Martin said, and sending back multiple forms still results in receiving one ballot. Voter concerns also spiked after lawsuits and temporary injunctions targeted Linn, Johnson and Woodbury Counties\' pre-populated forms. The only concern in those cases are the prepopulated voter identification number which are not on Story County forms. As far as the ballot getting back in time, Martin said they have been receiving mail at the usual rate via the Post Office, but people can go to the Story County Auditor\'s Office to drop it off by hand. Like every year, Martin recommended returning the ballot as soon as possible, especially when mailing. Voters should also remember to sign the affidavit, which is on the envelope, Martin said, and not to sign their spouse\'s. Danielle Gehr is a politics and government reporter for the Ames Tribune.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 2:03 pm ATLANTIC – During the coronavirus outbreak, Amanda Graham, owner and operator of Picker’s Parlor and Franklin Market, had some time on her hands. So she decided to make a few changes. Picker’s Parlor, located at 302 West Second Street in Atlantic, offers vintage antiques, and includes about a dozen regular vendors who display and sell their items there as well. The Franklin Market, located at 402 Chestnut Street, was set up to hold consignment items as well as items for online auctions. She decided to switch the locations, so now the antiques and vendors are at the Chestnut Street location, and the consignment and auction items are at the Second Street location. “We had vendors down at Picker’s, and decided to move them up here,” she said during a visit with the Atlantic Chamber Ambassadors on Thursday. “The building that was Pickers is now used for our online auction. That’s really grown in the last couple of months.” She said auction items can be picked up or dropped off at Second Street location, and she also shipped items that are sold at auction. More information about the business can be found at their web site at www.pickersparlor.com or their Facebook Page - just search for The Picker’s Parlor. Beside the antiques and vendor items, the coffee shop - Coffee Girl - is located in the Franklin Market. It offers coffee and more, and is open Mondays through Fridays 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. and Saturdays 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. More information can be found out about the coffee shop on their Facebook Page- just search for Coffeegirl. About a month ago, Linda Kimball opened “The Old School Clipper,” a barber shop in the Franklin Market. Kimball said she grew up on a farm in Brayton, and graduated from Exira, but has lived around the United States, including in Colorado and Alaska. She worked as a barber in Alaska for the last 20 years, and moved back recently to be closer to a sister who lives in Griswold. “I just love cutting men’s hair,” she said. “I was retired for a year. I decided it was time to come out of retirement and make a little ‘mad’ money. (And I) was offered the opportunity with Amanda to come in and open up the shop.” Kimball is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, and 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturday. People can either make an appointment by call her at 907-250-9628 or just walk in for a haircut. The Atlantic News Telegraph mobile app brings you the latest local breaking news, updates, and more.

DFJ photo/Angela Hewitt JEWELL — Don’t look know, but the youthful South Hamilton softball team is generating confidence each and every time it steps onto the diamond. The Hawks capped a strong week on Friday by winning their third straight game and taking down arguably their biggest rival, Roland-Story, in the process at the Mike Penning Athletic Complex. South Hamilton rallied from an early 3-1 deficit to score five unanswered runs and knock off the Norsemen, 6-3. It avenged a 9-4 loss to Roland-Story back on June 16. Kaylee Oskvig walloped a double and Kate Barkema found the gap for a triple in the win. Mackenzy Grady, Jessi Harms, Anna Lammers, Brenna Barquist and Emmaly Fields all singled. After getting tagged for six hits and three runs in the first and second innings, South Hamilton senior pitcher Jessi Harms took over and held Roland-Story (8-7, 5-5 HOIC) hitless over the final five frames. She walked four and struck out seven on the night. South Hamilton (5-5, 5-5 HOIC) evened the contest at 3 in the third inning and then took the lead for good in the fourth on Barkema’s RBI triple to right-center. It plated Oskvig, who doubled to the same part of the park two batters earlier. Grady opened the fifth with a base hit back up the middle, and she eventually scored on an Oskvig grounder to increase the Hawks’ lead to 5-3. An infield single by Fields brought Harms to the dish with an insurance run moments later. Madison Geise and Olivia Heithoff doubled for Roland-Story. Geise took the loss in the circle after throwing just 31⁄3 innings. She was touched for five hits. South Hamilton was at Nevada for a conference doubleheader last night. South Hamilton 6, Roland-Story 3 Friday at Jewell R-S 210 000 0 — 3 6 3 SH 102 120 x — 6 7 1 Madison Geise, Dana Vinson (4) and Macy Friest. Jessi Harms and Mackenzy Grady. WP — Harms.

Local small businesses are hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Jo Ann Bargenquast checks the inventory of eggs at FarmTable. HARLAN – Among the hardest hit during this coronavirus pandemic are small businesses. Many have had to close per statewide mandates. Others, such as bars and restaurants, can have no inside seating, and are only allowed to offer carry-out, drive-through or delivery options. Look no further than Harlan’s upstart duo of businesses operated by Daniel and Ellen Walsh-Rosmann to see the unprecedented hardships placed on rural Iowa. The pair own and operate Milk & Honey Restaurant in downtown Harlan and FarmTable Procurement and Delivery located in southwest Harlan. Milk & Honey is a breakfast and lunch farm to table restaurant, with its ingredients mostly from local producers, and menu items made from scratch. FarmTable works with small and mid-sized farms to bring their fresh, organic produce, local dairy and more to chefs, grocery stores and buying clubs. The pair was forced to close the restaurant on March 16, and in the past few weeks has seen an 80 percent drop in sales at FarmTable. The pair has taken the humbling action of accepting donations to help employees who they have been forced to furlough. “We asked for donations for our employees,” Walsh-Rosmann said. “We still have a fund set up at our website, milkandhoneyiowa.com. All of our Milk & Honey employees have filed for unemployment because of the reduction in hours, but that won’t cover their tips and their living expenses. “Like a lot of employees in the service industry, they are already living paycheck to paycheck. We are still accepting donations to help our employees and hopefully retain them during this downturn.” As for FarmTable, the pair saw it coming. Eighty percent of FarmTable sales are to customers in the food service industry such as restaurants and caterers, who have basically been shut down until further notice. “Three weeks ago those sales stopped altogether,” Walsh-Rosmann said. “We have been able to quickly pivot our business model and open up sales to pantry customers, and at home folks. It’s just a lot more work to sell to our pantry customers – a lot more high touch happens.” Weathering the storm Walsh-Rosmann said they are thinking outside the box during this time. Milk & Honey re-opened last Wednesday offering cinnamon rolls, and then on Friday opened to online orders being provided curbside. “A large percentage of our customers are in the at-risk group and we didn’t want to give them an excuse to have coffee,” Walsh-Rosmann said of initially closing. “We also wanted any transactions to be contactless and we were not completely set up for that right away. Now we are. “Folks can order over the phone or online and pay. We will run out the order to the curb. We really don’t want anyone to come into the restaurant. We were following our peers in other bigger metros about how to make it a safe experience for everyone.” Besides selling to pantry customers and at-home residents, FarmTable is now offering free home delivery to orders more than $100 in the Omaha metro and in Harlan. “This is a unique service,” Walsh-Rosmann said. Walsh-Rosmann said many small businesses may not make it through these tough times. She sees Shelby County as a place where community is important, and residents here believe in local, small business enough to help them survive. “Keep supporting (local small businesses),” she said. “Buy gift certificates if they aren’t open right now; adjust your life to fit into their new business model. Everything is so fluid right now, so we need to all be flexible on how services are being provided.” State and federal bailouts also will help. The Iowa Economic Development Authority is helping small businesses under 25 employees by offering a $25,000 grant. “That helps, but who knows where we all will be in 90 days,” she said. “Will our business model look completely different?
