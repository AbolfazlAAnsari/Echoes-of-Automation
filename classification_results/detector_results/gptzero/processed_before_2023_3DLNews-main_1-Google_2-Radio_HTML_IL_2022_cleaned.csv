All eyes will be on the Senate as both parties look to tip the balance of power in the upper chamber from its current 50-50 split. Fifteen Republicans and 13 Democrats are on the ballot this year, while six other seats remain open after senators announced they are not seeking reelection. Here is a list of which senators are facing reelection in November, as well as which Senate seats are open. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) Murkowski, 64, is running for a fourth full term after first being appointed to the Senate in 2002 to finish her father Frank Murkowski’s term as he went on to become governor. A Murkowski has represented the Last Frontier in the Senate since 1981. Former Alaska Commissioner of Administration Kelly Tshibaka is waging a primary bid against Murkowski. Former President Trump endorsed Tshibaka in June, following through on his vow to unseat Murkowski after she criticized him following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and voted to convict him at his second impeachment trial. This will not be the first time Murkowski faces a primary challenge. She lost the GOP nomination for reelection in 2010 but went on to win the general election as a write-in candidate. Tshibaka raised $1.2 million and had more than $294,000 cash in hand at the end of September, while Murkowski’s campaign reported $3.2 million cash on hand. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly (D) Kelly, 57, will face the ballot less than two years after Arizonans first sent him to represent the Grand Canyon State in the Senate. The election was scheduled following the death of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). Kelly ousted former Rep. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), who was appointed to the seat following McCain’s death. Roughly half a dozen Republicans are vying for the GOP nomination to take on Kelly. Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich appears to be leading the pack, but Trump has muddied the waters by criticizing the official for not doing more to flip Biden’s win in Arizona in the 2020 presidential election. Additionally, the former president attended a fundraiser with venture capitalist Blake Masters in November, who is also running for the GOP nomination. The victor of the GOP primary will take on Kelly, one of the Senate’s most prolific fundraisers, in what is expected to be a closely watched election this cycle. The Cook Political Report says the race is currently a toss-up. Arkansas Sen. John Boozman (R) Boozman, 71, is running for a third term. Former NFL player Jake Bequette announced a primary bid against Boozman in July, suggesting that Arkansas’s representation in the upper chamber was in need of a change after years of Boozman’s service in Washington. The former Patriots player and Army veteran dubbed himself “a true conservative who will advance the Trump conservative agenda.” In March, however, before Bequette announced his candidacy, Trump threw his support behind Boozman, despite the fact that the Arkansas Republican did not object to the Electoral College vote for the 2020 presidential election in January 2021. California Sen. Alex Padilla (D) Padilla, 48, is vying for his first full term. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) appointed him to the upper chamber after then-Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) became vice president-elect, making him California’s first Hispanic senator. Since arriving in Washington, Padilla has taken a top role in issues involving immigration, receiving the chairmanship post of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship and Border Safety. The former California secretary of state is expected to win a full six-year term in November. Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet (D) Bennet, 57, is running for his third term. A handful of Republicans are currently vying for the GOP nomination to take on the senator in November. Olympian and former El Paso County Republican official Eli Bremer had the most total reported funds raised and cash on hand out of all the primary candidates, according to Colorado Politics. Bennet, however, will likely secure a third term in November, as Cook Political Report rates the seat solid Democrat. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D) Blumenthal, 75, is vying for a third term. Some Republicans have launched bids to take on Blumenthal, though no candidate has raised substantial funds to run a formidable campaign against the two-term senator, as noted by the Hartford Courant. Businessman Peter Lumaj, landscaper Robert Hyde and former portfolio manager John Flynn are all running for the GOP nomination. The Cook Political Report, however, rates the seat as solid Democrat. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (R) Rubio, 50, is running for a third term in what is already shaping up to be a fierce race between two big-name lawmakers. Rep. Val Demings (D) rolled out her Senate campaign in June and has already proven to be a formidable candidate, outraising Rubio in the third quarter with an $8.4 million haul. Demings, however, first has to best a field of Democrats vying for the nomination, though she has quickly emerged as an early favorite. A November St. Pete Polls survey found that Rubio has a 7-point lead ahead of Demings. The Cook Political Report rates the seat lean Republican, likely a credit to Rubio’s strong connections in South Florida and ties to the Cuban American community, which typically tilts toward the GOP. Trump also threw his support behind Rubio, quelling speculation that his daughter Ivanka Trump may run for the Sunshine State seat. Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock (D) Warnock, 52, will appear on Georgia’s ballot after previously winning a close special election runoff race in January 2021, when he ousted incumbent Rep. Kelly Loeffler (R) to become the first Black senator to represent the Peach State. Loeffler was appointed to the post following the resignation of the late Sen. Johnny Isakson (R). A number of Republicans are running for their party’s nomination to take on Warnock in November, including state Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black and former football star Herschel Walker. Trump endorsed Walker in September, calling him “a great friend, a Patriot, and an outstanding American who is going to be a GREAT United States Senator.” Warnock has made a name for himself during his short time on Capitol Hill, sponsoring more than 25 bills and becoming a vocal advocate for voting rights legislation. A November poll from Redfield & Wilton Strategies found that Warnock has a 6-point lead on Walker among both registered and likely voters. A December survey conducted by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, however, had Walker up by 1 point among likely voters. The Cook Political Report currently says the race is a toss-up. Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz (D) Schatz, 49, is running for his second full term. He appears to be the only candidate running to represent the Aloha State in the upper chamber this November. Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo (R) Crapo, 70, is seeking a fifth term after first being elected to the post in 1998. The longtime senator is facing challenges from within his party — former police officer and veteran Mike Little, businessman Scott Trotter and veteran Jeremy Gilbert have all announced bids — though none of the campaigns appear to be formidable enough to knock Crapo from his post in Washington. Crapo had more than $5.3 million cash on hand at the end of September, according to OpenSecrets, while the organization said it did not have data for the three GOP challengers. Entrepreneur Scott Cleveland is also vying to represent the Gem State in the Senate as an Independent who would caucus with Republicans. Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D) Duckworth, 53, is running for her second term. A number of Republicans are vying for the GOP nomination to take on Duckworth in November, including financial adviser Bobby Piton, who has reportedly promoted false claims of election fraud in Arizona in connection to the 2020 presidential election. Piton appears to be leading the pack in terms of fundraising. He had roughly $84,000 cash on hand as of Sept. 30, which was more than other GOP candidates — most of whom did not have fundraising information available at the end of the third quarter — but still far less than Duckworth’s roughly $5.77 million cash on hand. The Cook Political Report rates the seat solid Democrat. Indiana Sen. Todd Young (R) Young, 49, is running for a second term. He is facing two challenges within the party, from fund accountant Danny Niederberger and business owner John Piper. The primary winner will then face off against one of four Democrats vying to become""}]"
