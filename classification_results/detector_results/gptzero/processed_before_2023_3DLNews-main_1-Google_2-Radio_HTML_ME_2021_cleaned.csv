Female anchors and meteorologists seem to unjustly always be characterized by their looks and/or fashion choices, regardless of how good they are at their jobs. Allison and every other staffer at WMTW are not only great at their jobs, but incredible humans. Yet here\'s Allison having both her journalistic integrity and physical appearance being torn to shreds for no reason (which, side note to the author of the note, clearly you\'re overdue for an eye doctor and neurologist appointment -- you couldn\'t be more off the mark with the hate you spewed.) It goes back to the age-old adages we (hopefully) were instilled with as children: ""If you don\'t have anything nice to say, then don\'t say anything at all"" and ""Think before you speak."" Especially in these times where emotional and mental health just seems to be so fragile all-around. You just never know exactly how impactful your words can be, so choose them wisely.'}]"
