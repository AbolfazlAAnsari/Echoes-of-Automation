Two democratic incumbent state representatives lost their party’s nominations after redistricting earlier this year shuffled things around. In Cheshire District 7, which covers Keene’s Ward 2, Rep. John Bordenet lost to Shaun Filiault, and in District 15, which covers Chesterfield, Hinsdale, Keene Wards 1,3, 4, 5, Surry, Walpole, and Westmoreland, Paul Berch was ousted by Amanda Elizabeth Toll and Renee Monteil, who campaigned together. Most of the races in other House districts were uncontested, with the exception of Districts 4, 9, 11, and 13. In District 4, which represents Keene’s ward 4, Republican Thomas Savastano defeated Matthew Roach. Savastano will face Democrat Jodi Newell who ran unopposed. In District 9, representing Alstead, Gilsum, Marlow, and Stoddard, Republican Rich Nalevanko won his party’s nomination, defeating Robert D’Arcy. Nalevanko will face 16-term incumbent democrat Daniel Adams Easton in November. In District 11, which covers Winchester, Republican Zachary Nutting beat Max Santonastaso. Nutting is up against Democrat Natalie Quevedo. Finally in District 13, the Republican race to represent Dublin and Jaffrey ended with Rita Mattson winning the party’s nomination. Five-term incumbent Richard Ames ran unopposed on the democratic ballot. One thing that will remain the same in Cheshire County is the Mayor of Keene, as George Hansel conceded to New Hampshire District 2 US House of Representatives nominee Bob Burns early this morning. Hansel broke the news on WKBK this morning and said it was a close race. That discussion is available here. Burns now moves ahead to the general ballot where he’ll look to unseat Democrat Annie Kuster.
