initial appearance in Natrona County Circuit Court earlier this year. At that time, Judge Nichole Collier read that he had been charged with 26 counts, but did not go into detail, nor was his name revealed at that time per Wyoming Statute § 6-2-319. He appeared for his preliminary hearing this morning at the Townsend Justice Center and the case was bound over to District Court. Earlier this month the original charges were amended from 26 to 20 counts including two counts of sexual assault in the first degree. Each first degree charge are punishable by up to 50 years in prison. Since the case has now been bound over to District Court , media may now release the details from the heavily redacted affadavit supporting the charges. Marler is presumed innocent unless proven guilty. He is currently out of jail on a $225,000 corporate surety bond. In the affadavit, investigators ask one of the alleged female victims which part of a reported sexual assault stuck out to her the most. Court records show she said that when she was 13 or 14 years old she and her sister were sleeping in a shared room when Marler entered and began ""touching"" her. She alleges that he asked if she liked it and she told him to leave. She said Marler left, but he was ""mean"" to her afterwards. She added that when Marler\'s wife Kristen would leave he would call her and her sister into his bedroom to sleep with him. ""If they did not sleep with him, they got into trouble,"" she told investigators and that he would kiss them on the lips as well as ""rub up"" on them. The affadavit says that one alleged victim told investigators he did not want to speak with law enforcement until he turned 18 because he was concerend that there was a possibility that he would be returned to the Marler family if he did so. When that time came, he was ready to say more: he alleged that his last beating happened just before he moved out of the Marler house. According to the court records and a statement from the alleged victim\'s mother, Kristen had shoved him against a wall. He said he told her at that time not to touch him. A few days later Marler reportedly told him he needed to be punished for his actions. That\'s when the 18-year-old said he grabbed a pistol off of Marler\'s dresser and pointed it at him. He said, ""I was done with him touching me."" He also spoke of a time when he was about 15 or 16 years old and Marler kicked him off the roof of the house. He shared that it was common practice to shovel snow off of the roof and that Marler kicked him off because he wasn\'t going fast enough. He stated that he has scars from the incident and that two other children also have scars from being hit and hurt at different times. The same alleged victim says that he witnessed Marler go into the previously mentioned victims\' rooms whenever Kristen was gone. If Kristen was gone for even a few hours, Marler would call them into his room, he said. A different alleged victim also claims Marler punched her in the face when she was about 10 years old for going into one of the boys\' bedrooms. This was corroborated with another alleged victim statement. Another made a report to a Kelly Walsh school administrator that Marler beat the children and slept with the girls. He added that Marler had pointed guns at four of them. When asked why he did not disclose the abuse during previous law enforcement contacts, he said that he was scared. He said that Kristen and Steven Marler said, ""What happened on the mountain stayed on the mountain."" He told investigators his main worry at the Marler house was getting food. One alleged victim told a forensic investigator that whenever the children told any adults about the physical and sexual abuse in the Marler home, Kristen and Steven always found out, and the kids were punished. In today\'s proceedings Natrona County circuit court judge Nichole Collier found probable cause on all 20 charges and bound the case over to District Court. Steven Marler will next appear for an arraignment where he will make a plea.

ROCK SPRINGS — A family from Caracas, Venezuela, risked their lives for tranquility and freedom in the United States. No matter how many obstacles were in their path, giving up was not an option. Violence, conflict and persecution, as well as shortages in food, medicine and essential services have forced millions of Venezuelans to seek refuge in neighboring countries and beyond, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency. More than 7.3 million Venezuelans have left their country since 2014. As of February 2023, this is the largest exodus in Latin America’s recent history and one of the largest displacement crises in the world. About 2,000 people are still leaving Venezuela daily. After about 1,040 miles, the most frightening obstacle migrants face on the way to the U.S. border is the Darien Gap. The Darien Gap is a 70-mile stretch of thick jungle that connects Panama and Columbia. There are no roads, the water is dirty and migrants must tackle brutal terrains. As they walk on trails, they risk getting robbed, raped, kidnapped and getting attacked by wildlife, even deadly insects. Among the growing number of people fleeing from Venezuela were Yenderson Garcia Fragoza, 23, and Nazareth Fraiberlys Gonzalez, 26. Not only were they on high alert for themselves, but they had to protect their children, Yenderson Jr., 4, and Melany, 2, from harm, too. “People ask ‘Why would you put your children through that?’ ‘We wouldn’t put our kids through that.’ We had no choice,” said Nazareth. “They don’t understand that by coming here, we are saving their lives. We decided to take our chances and try to enter the United States.” Since fleeing was already difficult, they had to leave their 6-year-old daughter, Marlen, with a grandparent. They are looking forward to the day when all of them could be reunited, but if they returned to Venezuela now, they could risk imprisonment. “A police officer crossed the border. He got deported, and now he’s serving 40 years in prison,” Nazareth revealed. According to the couple, when they were living in Venezuela, there was just “no way to get ahead.” “There is no security, and the government isn’t helping,” Nazareth said, mentioning that people get a career in law enforcement to take advantage of citizens. “They will go into your home, take anything they want, and they will make fake accusations about you.” They said that “having milk in the house is a luxury.” They don’t have much food because they made 144.39 a month in Venezuelan Bolivar Soberano, which is only $4 a month in U.S. dollars. The prices of everything keep going up, too, they mentioned. “We’re not going back until that government is gone,” Nazareth expressed. “It is very corrupt; the government sent a bunch of goons to rob a bank and tried to pin it on innocent citizens. We have no trust in the system.” In terms of education, the couple explained that the government charges people $100 for their kids to attend school; typically, families in Caracas only make $8 a month in U.S. dollars. The one-week arduous journey on foot through the Darien Gap is something the family does not wish to go through again. “It may have even been 10 or 11 days,” Nazareth recalled. “We thought it was never going to end.” According to a Dec. 22, 2023, Time Magazine news article, from January to June of 2023, more than 200,000 people crossed the Darien Gap due to the escalating humanitarian crisis; more than 60 migrants died in the attempt. The couple pointed out that they were surprised to see migrants from other countries besides Venezuela: Haiti, Ecuador, the Middle East and Asia. The challenges continued after stumbling out of the Darien Gap; the asylum-seekers had stayed at an indigenous outpost until it was time to keep heading North. They explained that there were so many migrants at the camp that several groups were escorted out of the camp at different times, even at 3 a.m. They said that just as they had started to feel safe, something was putting them at risk. At one point, Yenderson mentioned, the family had no food and water for 30 hours and their lives were constantly threatened by the cartel. The couple was getting closer to the U.S. border, but their physical endurance was tested for one last time. They found themselves swimming in the neck-high waters of the Rio Grande River. A woman in their group drowned on the way because of the unexpectedly fierce currents. Nazareth was nearly swept away, as well. “If it wasn’t for the people around me, I would have died; the women up front and the men behind me in the water saved me and my baby,” Nazareth expressed. “The women grabbed my baby while the men grabbed me and helped me get my balance back.” She said the woman who drowned had a child. Strangers took responsibility for the child who was about 3 years old. They arrived at the Piedras Negras border crossing, which is often used by Mexicans heading North to towns like Uvalde and San Antonio. Once on U.S. soil, the family of four waited to turn themselves in to U.S. Immigration and Customs Department for processing. Border Patrol held them for a few days. During that time, they didn’t know if they were going to be allowed to move Northward or if they had to go back. The couple described the refugee camp as “very crowded;” at least 25 individuals were packed in large rooms with cold, hard floors. They were given an emergency silver mylar thermal compact waterproof blanket. To eat, they were given an apple, a hash brown patty, juice, milk, water and a burrito. It had taken them three months to arrive at the Mexican border. They began fleeing on Aug. 27, 2023. Yenderson, Nazareth and their children are residing with a local family in Rock Springs, where “there isn’t a lot of noise.” “The biggest difference between here and Venezuela is how quiet it is here,” Yenderson said as his wife chuckled and nodded in agreement. “We did not expect it to be so quiet here. We love it. We feel safe here. There is no one using and selling drugs behind the house, and no one is smashing through the house without your permission.” Rosslyn Read is the founder and Legal Director of Wyoming Immigration Advocacy Project.
