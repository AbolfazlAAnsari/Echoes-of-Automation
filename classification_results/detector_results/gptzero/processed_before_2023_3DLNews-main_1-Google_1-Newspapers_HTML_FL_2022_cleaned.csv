Then, they keep the money and do nothing to help your mortgage. There are steps you can take to protect yourself from mortgage scammers. This article is based on a real-life case and client. I went to court to fight for a client who is a U.S. combat veteran who served in Iraq. He is 90 percent service-connected disabled due to anxiety and insomnia connected to his combat duty. He is married with children in the home. This veteran was defrauded by foreclosure rescue scammers, who wrote him a letter saying they would represent him as legal counsel. He paid the company $3,600. Then he found out the company had no attorneys working with them. They filed no documents in court, and the bank foreclosed on his home. We went to court and filed a motion to set aside the final judgment of foreclosure and to set aside the foreclosure sale. We asked the Court to give him a fair shot to save his home with a lawyer. With a fair judge, the courtroom can be a great leveler. The judge set aside the final judgment and sale, finding that my client should be given a fair shot to save his home. The answer is simple. Contact competent foreclosure defense counsel if you find yourself facing default on your home mortgage. You can do an attorney search on the Florida Bar website, where you can make sure that the attorney is properly listed as a member in good standing of the Florida Bar. Do not trust any company where you cannot confirm that competent legal counsel will be representing you. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Disclaimer: The information provided in this article is not intended to constitute legal advice.

Two Columbia County sheriff’s deputies have been sidelined. Sheriff Mark Hunter announced Tuesday evening that Deputy Jayme Gohde and Sgt. Randy Harrison were both suspended following an administrative investigation into the Oct. 31 arrest of a legally blind man. In Hunter’s statement, he said the investigation — which began Thursday when James Hodges, the man arrested, requested the body camera footage of the incident — concluded Monday afternoon. The investigation revealed that both Gohde and Harrison had violated department policy. Gohde was suspended two days without pay, while Harrison was demoted immediately, suspended seven days without pay and is not eligible for favorable action for two years. Both Gohde and Harrison must undergo remedial training on civil rights. “As sheriff, I take full responsibility for this event,” Hunter said. “I want to extend my sincere apologies to Mr. Hodges for the actions of my deputies. I do not feel these deputies’ actions were guided by ill intent, but rather by frustration and a failure to rely on their training. “Nevertheless, this conduct is unacceptable.” Charges against Hodges were also dropped Monday, according to Columbia County court records. John Durrett, the Third Judicial Circuit state attorney, declined to file information in the case, stating it did not warrant prosecution. Hodges was stopped around 8 a.m. on Oct. 31 in downtown Lake City when Gohde believed he had a firearm in his back pocket. The weapon she believed she saw turned out to be a collapsible walking stick. In the footage of the incident, Hodges asked the deputy if she was a tyrant. “Yeah I am, actually,” Gohde responds before asking for his identification. When Hodges refused to comply, the deputy told the man that “you don’t have to be a dick to me.” “Well, you’re being one to me,” Hodges responds. Hodges, in refusing to comply with the request for identification, said it was only necessary if he was committing a crime, about to commit a crime or had already committed a crime. Once Harrison, Gohde’s supervisor, arrived, Hodges was handcuffed and officers found his ID in his front pocket. Harrison, the video shows, instructed Gohde to arrest him for resisting. Hunter, in his statement, thanked Hodges for requesting the video and bringing the violations to light as it allows the sheriff’s office to improve and get better. “That’s how we learn,” Hunter said. “I can promise you that we’re going to work hard to get to 100%, but we’ll never be 100%, no one is.” Read Lake City Reporter Lake City Reporter Mailing Address: P.O.

During a July 27 hearing, Sniffen denied the FDEP’s motion for summary judgment because an amended complaint had already been filed that nullified the one that was the subject of the case that day. Tran and Hazen’s attorney, Bruce Minnick, requested that the case go to trial rather than get entangled in more motions in circuit court. Sniffen advised both parties to determine how they wanted to move forward and prepare to choose a trial date for the case. The structure has long been a contested issue between the property owners and representatives from both the city and the state. Tran and Hazen contend that before building the structure, they went to the city’s building department and asked if a tree house would require a permit and were told it would not. They proceeded to build the structure on the beach in front of their home and rental property, supporting it with an Australian pine tree and telephone poles disguised as tree trunks. Later, they learned that not only did they need a building permit, but that the tree house also was built partially on the erosion control line, requiring a permit from FDEP.

Attorneys for the department argue that Tran and Hazen had a chance to appeal the denial and did not pursue that route despite asking for the deadline to appeal to be extended twice, which was granted. In 2013, the tree house was the subject of a city code enforcement board hearing where it was determined that after-the-fact permits would be required or the structure would need to be removed. The couple took the results of the board hearing before Manatee County Circuit Court and the Florida Second District Court of Appeal. Both courts upheld the board’s ruling on the tree house. A 2016 code enforcement special magistrate hearing in the city led to a $50 fine which has been accumulating since July 22, 2015, the date of the Second District Court ruling. That fine is over $125,000 with additional fines and legal fees adding up daily for Tran and Hazen. When the couple applied for after-the-fact permits with the city, the requests were denied. Former Holmes Beach Building Official Jim McGuinness examined the tree house during his tenure with the city and determined that the structure could not be brought up to current building codes. City leaders began pursuing the option of legally ordering the tree house to be torn down in 2018, a case which is still pending in Manatee County Circuit Court. A temporary stay was ordered in that case in March 2021 which expires on Aug. 31 to allow the parties time to try and work together on a way forward.

locations across the Tampa campus Tuesday and Wednesday, social media campus preacher Cindy Smock, known as “Sister Cindy,” drew a large crowd of students filled with laughs, but also concern for the possible harm her speeches could cause. Smock, who has accumulated over 350,000 followers on TikTok, was first seen preaching on campus at the Marshall Student Center amphitheater Tuesday followed by a similar presentation outside Cooper Hall on Wednesday. Her husband, Jed, said they will be returning to campus Thursday. Wednesday’s three-hour presentation, which lasted from 1-4 p.m., touched on topics such as the dangers of pre-marital sex, the LGBTQ community and the power of Jesus and religion, mostly told through anecdotes. Some students found the presentation to be satirical and intentionally funny, as junior Holly Bates said Smock is an entertaining figure to listen to. “I just love her presence. She’s truly an icon,” Bates said. “I saw her very first viral video on TikTok, and I’ve been following her since then because I just think she’s absolutely great.” Junior Allie Charland said Smock’s speeches felt more on the lines of a comedy performance than a religious preaching ceremony. “It’s more like making fun of her in a way. What she’s doing and what she’s saying isn’t OK, but I think the way she’s performing it makes it feel like it’s a comedy show.” Smock’s stories regarding the LGBTQ community drew the largest reactions from the crowd. Charland said her favorite part of the performance was when Smock considered herself an ally. “Brother Jed and I love the gays, but not in a gay way,” Smock said. “The reason I wasn’t a lesbian in the 70s was because it wasn’t ‘it’ to be a lesbian back then. Yes, I’m a gay icon.” Crowd interactions occurred frequently, something global business major Ashley Griffith said provided her with the most memorable moment in the speech when Smock spoke to her directly. “My favorite part was when she called me a wicked woman and said I would be the next ‘Sister Cindy,’” she said. “[It was] because I have crystals and tarot cards, so she said I was her best congregational member.” Staying on-brand to her infamous speaking style, Smock told the story of a date she went on with her husband in 1976. She spoke about how he prayed with her in their parked car, and although she wanted to kiss him that night, he refused to do it due to his religious beliefs. “He got out of the car, opened my door, escorted me to my door and said goodnight. All I got was a side hug,” she said. “Let me be honest, I did get a little more than a side hug. I got to meet a man with integrity. I got to meet a man who would honor and respect me. And I got to meet a man who truly loves Jesus.” Her speeches typically reflect her own personal experiences, as she spoke about how when she studied at UF, she hadn’t yet truly formed into the religious icon she proclaims herself to be today. The morals of most of her anecdotes include abstaining from sexual encounters and learning from what she calls her ‘past mistakes’ of indulging in desires she considers go against the Bible. Sophomore Lev Funkhousr said they think those morals can be dangerous to spread around, even if some students don’t take Smock seriously. “You’re giving a platform to hate groups to spread their ideologies, even if it’s a joke,” Funkhousr said. “There are those few select people who are going to listen to what she says and they could take it to heart.” Funkhousr said they believe Smock’s messaging can be harmful for people to hear, and her stances on certain issues are mocked due to how misguided they are. “I think the most harmful thing is the messages she keeps spreading, especially about homosexuality,” Funkhousr said. “I’m positive that a good portion of the people in this crowd are LGBTQ and they come out here and make fun of her because of the fact that Sister Cindy spreads such misinformation about homosexuality. “You’re allowing them to spread misinformation that can cause harm, especially to the youth of LGBTQ on campus, because we already have plenty of hate groups on campus.

It’s kind of powerful,” she said. “It’s even more ironic that she said she’s a gay icon.” The speech had a different tone compared to other religious speakers at the university, according to Griffith.

Cajun Navy, currently camping at Our Lady of Miraculous Medal Catholic Church in Pine Island with more than 30 volunteers. Founder, Rob Gaudet has a background in enterprise level business system development. Put simply, he said, he’s an engineer who builds business systems, and finds himself grateful for the opportunity to use his personal skills in a way that helps other people. The organization’s unowned name, the Cajun Navy, originally came from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Gaudet said, but it wasn’t until tragedy struck many years later that he found himself involved. “In 2016, in Loåuisiana, we had flooding, that not too many people heard about. It wasn’t from a hurricane, it was from a massive rainstorm, where over 100,000 homes flooded and were completely unlivable. Because of the scale of that many homes flooding, citizens got in boats and started rescuing each other and that’s where the term Cajun Navy was applied again,” Gaudet said. In this particular type of grand extent disaster, the need for citizen help with rescue and cleanup became very evident, he said. Gaudet counted on the brand as well as the Cajun Navy name to get people to continue to help. His technological background enabled him a new approach (social media) to drive the number of volunteers necessary for this kind of cleanup. “Utilizing Facebook, I drove thousands of volunteers to assist with the cleanup efforts in Baton Rouge and the areas around Lafayette and south Louisiana. I realized what we were doing was really unique — getting people to continue to help after a disaster, so I’ve continued to do it and get better at it and build a brand, so people who want to help can come and help,” Gaudet said. John Bohanek, standing inside his damaged home, was assisted by the Cajun Navy. PHOTO PROVIDED Cajun Navy Ground Force is really a technology movement, he said, driven by roughly 160,000 followers on social media. This number, he added, grows with each disaster. In five years, there may be as many as a million followers, he said, projecting that the response will be tremendous. “I believe we are in a new era of disaster response,” Gaudet said. The organization has set its sights on making it incredibly easy for those who’d like to help to do just that. Having gotten its start and being based in Louisiana, Gaudet said, those involved in the organization are very familiar with the nature of hurricanes. “We know what to do. We’re able to come in and just be really precise, efficient and effective in how we respond,” Gaudet said. After waiting out Hurricane Ian in Tampa, Gaudet said the team came down to Fort Myers for more than two weeks after the storm. The Cajun Navy then utilized a program they have called Safe Camp for communities without power, water, food or fuel. They are able to provide all of those services from a parking lot, he said. They ran this camp in North Fort Myers and another one was set up on Fort Myers Beach in the parking lot of Walmart for 12 days, funded by donations then distributed in a car line, where the Cajun Navy was able to distribute supplies to over 18,000 vehicles. Walmart, which partners with the Cajun Navy, also gave them a $50,000 grant to run Safe Camp. Walmart Foundation Director Books Nelson came to Pine Island to look over the camp they have set up here, said Gaudet. One of the Bayou Peeps, marking another home where the Cajun Navy helped.

There is a fundamental shift, he said, in the way disasters are being approached and getting the word out is a major priority. They have room for 100 volunteers on Pine Island and only have 30, he said, likening it to a racehorse plowing fields. Currently, Gaudet said the Cajun Navy is spending approximately $40,000 weekly for its operations on Pine Island. Changing the way the world uses its technologically driven connectedness to handle disasters in communities is an inescapable change. “When a guy like me, who really has no disaster experience beyond 2016, can start an organization like this and have such tremendous impact, it’s inevitable, because it’s much bigger than me. It’s about the internet and how awareness of people in need drives good people to action. We try to bring hope. We’re an organism more than an organization. All around the island you’re going to see little cartoon cut-out characters we call Bayou Peeps. We put them in front of homes that we work on. They are meant to give people hope,” Gaudet said.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 8:02 pm Maachaiah Brown, a student at Palm Terrace Elementary School, was diagnosed with COVID 19 in September. She still wears her mask at school. Editor’s note: Through a series of stories, the Daytona Times is exploring how the pandemic has impacted the K-12 public school system in Volusia County and specifically Black children in the 32114 zip code. Despite schools, businesses and government services beinfsopen and operational, the coronavirus pandemic continues as cases, hospitalizations and deaths advance. The Daytona Times looks at COVID-19\'s impact on schools in the 32114 zip code and beyond. The Volusia County School District’s COVID dashboard had 539 positive cases; 392 of those cases are students and 147 employees in November 2022. The dashboard is updated twice a week. Additionally, 579 quarantines took place. Those impacted included 429 students and 150 employees as of the Daytona Times’ Wednesday deadline. For the 2021-22 academic year, there have been 6,412 COVID cases with 1,765 employees and 4,647 students impacted. There were 7,373 quarantines, which included 1,825 employees and 5,448 students. The report also shows 2021-22 numbers at the schools in the 32114 zip code: Palm Terrace Elementary (16 cases, 17 quarantines), Turie T. Small Elementary (27 cases, 31 quarantines), Campbell Middle (41 cases, 65 quarantines) and Mainland High (102 cases, 103 quarantines). Times, “My baby girl had it first, then I caught it. It was right around the time of Hurricane Ian. I couldn’t even prepare for the storm.” The virus hit Brown very hard but, fortunately, didn’t hit her daughter as hard. “There hasn’t been changes to her education, but she is very cautious. She is one of the few kids wearing a mask,"" Brown explained. ""She probably feels peer pressure not to wear one. Most kids don’t wear them. “As for me, the mental aspect almost took me out. I thought I was leaving here. I am still dealing with the effects. I already had breathing problems. The hurricane knocked out the power for five days and we had no air conditioning, which made it worse for me. My daughter wasn’t as sick.” A teacher at Palm Terrace dons her mask as she instructs her students. The beginning of the pandemic did have an impact on her children’s education. Brown’s daughter, Maachaiah was in kindergarten at Palm Terrace when the pandemic started. Her oldest daughter, Anastashea, 17, now attends Mainland High and her son, Malik, 15, attends Atlantic High in Port Orange. The two oldest were at Campbell Middle when COVID first struck. “They went to online learning at first. It was ineffective. They were more concerned about going to school and how dangerous that was. I think it put them at a disparity. I don’t feel they are as far along as they should be and are playing catch-up,” Brown said. “The youngest was hurt the most. She didn’t get the socialization and learning how to deal with others. She did well academically, but with virtual learning there was no environmental control.” Her middle son, Kristian Joseph, now attends Spruce Creek High in Port Orange but was at Campbell Middle when coronavirus broke out. Also, her youngest son, Leneryk McGregor, is now in the fourth grade at Turie T. Small but was in the second grade in 2020. Her eldest son also fell behind but was able to graduate from Spruce Creek in 2021. “My kids fell behind in class. Leneryk got used to staying up late; he did the paper packets first, then went online. It was like a big holiday break for him. Kris got really lazy. he also lost contact with a lot of his friends,"" Gardener said. ""It was also tough when they returned as many kids were getting COVID and they had to adjust to social distancing in schools.” A health official wears her mask while assisting students at Palm Terrace Elementary. Even educators can’t deny the impact COVID had on education. Arthur Westbrook, an Exceptional Student Education (ESE) teacher, is also an assistant coach for the boys’ basketball and football teams. “It was a big effect. It took away the norm. It was more mental. It first took away face-to-face education and kids being in a classroom with a teacher. Teachers couldn’t get in front of them,” commented Westbrook. “Then when classes resumed, we often had to instruct from behind a shield and keep distancing. Kids couldn’t raise their hands and have a teacher come over and help. We had to sanitize and wipe everything down between classes.” Teachers also noticed the slip in academic performance. Westbrook admitted, “Yes, there was definitely a slip in academic performance across the board with most kids. COVID once again took away the norm. Also, most kids aren’t good with change.” The school system took measures to help kids get back on track. “When classes resumed, we offered help by providing extra time after school and during lunch. We did have some kids who wouldn’t stay after school because they ride the bus.” Stacy Beckton Sr., a paraprofessional at Mainland, also reflected on COVID’s impact on learning. “I think there was a decline in academics at first. I don’t think the kids took it seriously. It did get a little better when kids got back into the classroom. Those that stayed home also had a teacher that kept up with them more,’’ Beckton noted. Parents also worked extremely hard to get their children’s education back up to speed. The Florida Department of Education also found a way for every child to graduate high school with a vigorous way to make up grades and courses. “It’s the feeling that you are still dealing with it. You hear people say it’s over but people are still catching it. It’s still out there. You still must be cautious and mindful almost two years later,” said Brown. Gardener added, “I am still concerned. I am hearing about it. I still send my kids to school with hand sanitizer and wipes in my kids backpacks. Also, we are dealing with hurricane recovery. I had to relocate because the storm flooded our place.” Reporting for this story is possible through a Black Press grant from the National Association of Black Journalists. Log In Keep it Clean.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:35 pm Voters exit the Laurel Manor Recreation Complex during early voting in 2018. Early voting for the upcoming Aug. 23 primary election starts on Aug. 11 in Lake County, and on Aug. 13 in Sumter and Marion counties. With political candidates now locked into their respective races, campaigning and voting during the Aug. 23 primary election may seem like the next steps. However, there is more being done behind-the-scenes. Local election supervisors are diligently at work to design, proofread and produce ballots, as well as continue to reinforce that Florida’s election process is secure. “There’s a lot of moving parts in the election process that the voters don’t get to see,” said Bill Keen, Sumter elections supervisor. “It’s just a lot of steps that take place to get that ballot finished and completed and prepared for their election.” Once qualifying for office closed June 17, the scramble was on. Each county has to produce an array of different ballots, because people will vote on different races depending on who resides in each race’s respective boundaries. Election supervisors also had to wait for an official qualifying document from the state on races such as the gubernatorial, senatorial and congressional races. Military and overseas ballots must go out around the beginning of July, so supervisors only have about two weeks. During that period, staff must put all candidate information on the ballots. They must also consider factors like font size and ballot layout requirements. “You can’t just go in there and make the ballot any way you want,” Keen said. “It has to meet all the statutory requirements as well.” Then there’s the proofreading process. While elections offices’ have slightly different methods, they all have two things in common: They are very thorough, and they take it very seriously. “We can’t be wrong with anything we produce,” said Wesley Wilcox, Marion County elections supervisor and Florida Supervisors of Elections association president. Ballots go through hours and hours of painstaking review before they ever go out to be printed, Keen said. There’s also a security element to it. “As security applies to the ballot itself, it’s a matter of going over it multiple times to make sure we don’t have any mistakes on it,” said Alan Hays, Lake County elections supervisor. Security is wrapped around the ballot creation process, although there are some aspects officials can’t talk about. “The more of our security information is out there, that’s just more items criminals can dissect and figure out ways around our protocols,” Keen said. “At the end of the day you want as little of that information out as you can.” However, Keen’s office meets weekly to discuss security measures, and his office tracks every ballot. Overall, election supervisors continue to tout election integrity. Wilcox has said tools developed over the past few years continue to make elections in Florida more secure, and each supervisor is proud of security measures in place. Tri-county election officials say they aren’t overly concerned about a paper shortage, because they’ve already have their paper for ballots or have assurances from their respective suppliers. Once the Lake County ballots are printed, Hays said his office inventories every ballot. They know how many they have, how many of each style they have, and how many are assigned to each precinct. “It’s a very detailed accounting process similar to that a bank would go through in checking out a bank teller at the end of the day,” Hays said. Once the overseas ballots are printed and mailed, supervisors switch to domestic vote-by-mail ballots, which will go out later in July. Thus far, about 160,000 tri-county voters have requested vote-by-mail ballots. Only voters who have requested vote-by-mail primary ballots by Aug. 13 will receive them. “Furthermore, the entire vote-by-mail build process for Marion County is handled in house,” Wilcox said. When the ballots are returned, they are immediately taken to a secure storage area. They will be under 24/7 surveillance and won’t leave the room until the canvassing board arrives and it’s time for them to be opened.

are not dead, far from it. We’re consolidating, collaborating, working smarter, for sure. Embracing the digital revolution and all its advantages, absolutely. But not dead; in fact, the public's thirst for news is unprecedented and we are meeting the demand in new and innovative ways. To paraphrase Bob Hope, the comedian and tireless morale-booster for our military, “Well, we’re still here. … We’re just happy this has a happy outcome.” Remember the iconic blunder? The much-surprised Hope’s quip was in response to his death being prematurely announced by Rep. Bob Stump, R-Ariz., on the U.S. House floor in 1998 after The Associated Press mistakenly posted a partial obituary on its website. Hope’s daughter, Linda, had to get on the phone to dispel the reports. From 2021: FWB Chamber, White-Wilson Medical Clinic and NWF Daily News celebrate 75th anniversaries Previously: Northwest Florida Daily News making Saturday edition digital starting in March I’m standing in Linda Hope’s spot today, saying the reports of our industry’s demise are greatly exaggerated. We’re not dead, but we are changing for the better. The change from a print edition on Saturday to an e-edition might have left you feeling like you’re losing an old friend. I know how you feel, I’m old school, too. I like having a printed edition in my hands. I started reading newspapers when I was 6 or 7 years old. Sports stories at first, then eventually on to the global news stories I could comprehend. When my dad was serving in Vietnam, I read every story on the war that was printed in the paper. A newspaper in my hands just feels natural. Well then, why is our industry changing? Because a free press is vital to our nation’s success and the industry’s previous business model was a death wish in a digital world. As Antonio Guterres, the United Nations chief said, unfettered journalism is “the cornerstone for building fair and impartial institutions, holding leaders accountable and speaking truth to power.” Our mission is important. To keep you informed, change was a must. Let’s make it easy to understand. Do you have a newspaper in your hands or sitting next to you now? How about a laptop, tablet, or a smartphone? If you answered “no” to the first question and “yes” — possibly “yes, yes, yes” — to the second, you know where this is going. It’s a matter of demand, and the digital revolution long ago left the station as a bullet train. The choice was for newspapers to work together and jump aboard, or die. Some waited too long and missed the speeding train. Others desperately grasped onto the railing of the caboose. Those newspapers with visionary leaders climbed aboard with the engineer. I’m thankful Gannett — the parent company of USA TODAY and the four Florida Panhandle dailies, the Pensacola News Journal, the Northwest Florida Daily News, the Panama City News Herald and the Tallahassee Democrat — helped the engineer lead the train down the tracks. Gannett’s Florida dailies also have trimmed press operations in mid-January, closing printing plants in Panama City and South Florida and moving printing operations elsewhere. Another change coming March 1 is the shift to an e-edition only on Saturday. The e-editions, which have long been an option on our websites, are a growing part of our readership. Electronic editions are exact reproductions of the actual paper, with the same features. They have clear advantages, including: So while it’s easy to lament change, history shows us there is no need.

the aim of adding a variety of personal reminiscences to the Chapel’s archive. Rosslyn Chapel, which was founded in 1446, has featured in a number of stories, most notably Dan Brown’s novel, The Da Vinci Code, which led to a large increase in visit to the Midlothian site. The Chapel has, though, attracted visitors for generations, with early visitors recording their stories in travel journals. In one of the earliest, Thomas Kirk describes the story of the Apprentice Pillar in his Tours in Scotland, dated 12 August 1677. Now, Rosslyn Chapel Trust is looking to add stories and memories of more recent visits to its archives. Pass it on to future generations Ian Gardner, Director of Rosslyn Chapel Trust, said: ‘We often hear stories and memories about Rosslyn Chapel and now we want to record these for the future as part of our archive. This year, designated Scotland’s Year of Stories 2022, provides the perfect opportunity for us to do that. Whether you have visited in the past, or attended an event, a church service, wedding or concert, please share your story with us so that we can pass it on to future generations’. Stories can be emailed to [email protected] or shared through Rosslyn Chapel Trust’s Facebook page. A selection of stories will be published on the Chapel’s website. Rosslyn Chapel was built for Sir William St Clair and was incomplete when he died in 1484. The beauty of its setting and the mysterious symbolism of its ornate stonework have inspired, attracted and intrigued visitors ever since. The Chapel came to worldwide prominence when it featured in the novel The Da Vinci Code and the subsequent film. The Chapel is open to visitors daily and tickets can be booked on the Chapel’s website www.rosslynchapel.com Led by VisitScotland, the Year of Stories 2022 sustains and builds upon the momentum of preceding Themed Years, showcasing a nationwide programme of major events and community celebrations. Scotland’s Year of Stories 2022 spotlights, celebrates and promotes the wealth of stories inspired by, written, or created in Scotland.

there something perplexing or terribly difficult about just telling the truth in government and politics? Most of us deal with personal or business matters, big or small, without a lot of delay or lawyers or hedging. But if you ask a government agency or a politician for the time, they’ll say, “You mean, right now?” Then they’ll check with lawyers and promise to get back to you, but don’t. Or they’ll give an oblique answer addressing what time they want it to be, not what you asked. This happens so routinely that we hardly notice, although every candidate effusively promises to run the most open and accessible operation we’ve ever seen, if elected. The latest silly example in Florida politics popped up in last week’s debate, when Democrat Charlie Crist asked Gov. Ron DeSantis to promise he will, if re-elected, serve four years. If that was meant to put him on the spot, it backfired. DeSantis paused a bit, then got off the most memorable line of the evening, “The only worn out old donkey I’m looking to put out to pasture is Charlie Crist.” Being branded an opportunist by Charlie Crist is like being called ugly by a toad, but DeSantis didn’t answer the question. Some political analysts seemed to find that fascinating, but refusing to dignify Crist’s jab with a serious reply was hardly surprising. More from Bill Cotterell: More: Loss of endorsements is a sad sign of the times More: Can abortion save Democrats in midterms? More: Cruz case revives the capital punishment debate More: Florida probably won’t issue pardons for pot possession. Here’s why Do any major politicians discuss tomorrow’s plans today? When I worked in Atlanta in 1974, Gov. Jimmy Carter’s national ambition was more obvious than DeSantis’ plans are now, but we couldn’t even get him to hint at it. They’re all that way. I forget the topic, but I once asked Gov. Reubin Askew, “…and that’s all you know about that?” He smiled and said, “No, that’s all I want to tell you about that.” Gov. Lawton Chiles also played pretty good cat-and-mouse, when necessary. OK, they can be cagey about their personal politics. It gets troublesome when they do it on the job. A Leon County judge recently gave DeSantis 20 days to produce records about how he inaugurated midnight migrant air service from San Antonio to Martha’s Vineyard. Two questions: Why did anyone need to sue to get public documents? And why does it take even 20 minutes to pull the information up on a screen, click “forward,” fill in email addresses, and hit “send?” DeSantis has answered questions about why the flights were any of Florida’s business. What great harm would befall the state if taxpayers see the paperwork? In another court case, DeSantis and key legislators recently sought to avoid having to ‘fess up about how legislators drew new reapportioned district boundaries. Why? This was legal business, done by government employees, using official resources, on state time, in the Capitol, at public expense. Oh, and those “sunshine” laws that elected officials brag about require free access to government information, with reasonable limits for legally secret stuff. It’s not like people were asking for names and addresses of police informants in drug investigations. We can be sure that, if this was something they wanted out there, it wouldn’t take 20 day or a court order. By contrast, Gov. Bob Martinez spent his first full day in office in federal court in 1987 over some matter dating back to his time as mayor of Tampa. He probably could have had lawyers run interference, but he had nothing to hide. No matter what they say in campaigns, no matter what the law says, if public officials want to operate openly, they will. If they don’t, they won’t. Regarding some of his more debatable policies, DeSantis insists that if schools aren’t teaching critical race theory, they shouldn’t object to his law banning it. If they’re not indoctrinating kids with “woke” concepts of gender identity, what’s the harm in outlawing such teachings? Well, if the governor and Republican legislators didn’t violate the Florida Constitution’s prohibition of partisan gerrymandering, why not say so under oath? If those Air Ron flights to Massachusetts were legal, let’s see the paperwork. And if he might leave midway through a second term, that’s between him and his family. Or maybe him and Donald Trump.

Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker issued a 23-page order that largely denied a request for a preliminary injunction against the law, which is slated to take effect Friday. Walker, however, did not rule on an injunction request by a University of Central Florida professor, after ordering attorneys to file additional briefs. Lawmakers passed the measure (HB 7) — dubbed by Gov. Ron DeSantis as the “Stop WOKE Act” — during this year’s legislative session after fierce debate. A group of plaintiffs filed the lawsuit April 22 after DeSantis signed the bill, arguing, in part, that it violated First Amendment rights. They also challenged rules approved last year by the State Board of Education that included banning the use of critical race theory, which is based on the premise that racism is embedded in American society and institutions. Walker, who held a hearing last week, said in the order Monday that four of the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to obtain a preliminary injunction. Those plaintiffs were Donald Falls, who teaches high-school government and economics in Manatee County; Jill Harper, a Leon County substitute teacher; a child identified as RMJ who is an incoming kindergarten student in Nassau County; and Tammy Hodo, president of All Things Diverse, a consulting firm that provides training on issues such as diversity and inclusion. ‘Stop WOKE’: DeSantis signs legislation to restrict instruction of Critical Race Theory in Florida Free speech: DeSantis’ ‘Stop WOKE Act’ faces court test as universities become targets. At issue: free speech Lawsuit filed: Minutes after bill is signed, lawsuit filed against DeSantis for 'Stop WOKE Act' While writing that he was not “determining whether the challenged regulations are constitutional, morally correct or good policy,” Walker said the teachers, student and consultant had not shown injury-related proof needed to establish standing. For example, he wrote that the State Board of Education, which is a defendant in the case, can withhold funding from school districts that do not comply with the regulations. But Walker said the teachers did not show how that would directly injure them. “Plaintiffs’ logic goes like this: pursuant to its statutory authority, the Board of Education will withhold funding from the teachers’ school districts if they violate the challenged provisions,” he wrote. “In turn, members of the school board will withhold money from the teachers’ individual schools — or, perhaps, put pressure on officials at those schools to discipline the teachers. In other words, the teachers’ theory of traceability and redressability flows from the Board (of Education) to the school district, from the school district to the teachers’ school, and — only then — to the teachers. Thus, plaintiffs’ argument requires the court to stack multiple layers of inferences.” As another example, he said Hodo did not establish that she has been injured by the law. “Dr. Hodo does not claim that she has lost clients, that clients have told her they will no longer hire her, or that clients have even expressed trepidation about hiring her,” Walker wrote. Walker, however, left unresolved the preliminary injunction request by Robert Cassanello, an associate history professor at the University of Central Florida. That came after the plaintiffs’ attorneys last week filed a document pointing to a proposed rule that is scheduled to go before the state university system’s Board of Governors on Thursday. The proposed rule would direct how the law should be carried out by universities. The plaintiffs’ attorneys cited part of the proposal that, for example, raises the possibility faculty members could be disciplined for not complying with university regulations on the issue. Walker ordered attorneys for both sides to file briefs by noon Tuesday on whether the proposed rule could affect Cassanello’s legal standing in the case. The law lists a series of race-related concepts that would constitute discrimination if taught in classrooms or in required workplace-training programs. As an example, part of the law labels instruction discriminatory if it leads people to believe that they bear “responsibility for, or should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment because of, actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, national origin or sex.” As another example, the law seeks to prohibit instruction that would cause students to “feel guilt, anguish or other forms of psychological distress because of actions, in which the person played no part, committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, national origin or sex.” Two businesses and a consultant who conducts workplace training filed a separate challenge to the law last week in federal court in Tallahassee.

I’ve offered to buy him an MRGA cap (Make Russia Great Again) instead, but he’s not interested.

However, when someone thanks him for his service he puffs like a peacock and says, “You’re welcome!” whereas I respond with, “I was drafted.” • We’re divorced.

Wildlife Inc., a Bradenton Beach-based animal rescue and rehab facility, received a call Jan. 13 about a raccoon at the BridgeWalk Resort, 100 Bridge St. A volunteer was dispatched and, on arrival observed the 25-pound raccoon exhibiting a limp and began rescue efforts. During attempts to capture the animal, the raccoon made a dash from the third floor of the BridgeWalk to the parking lot. Staff attempted to corral the animal but the raccoon made its way to a getaway car, where it curled up under the hood. The car, a 2013 Nissan Sentra, belonged to BridgeWalk guest Raquel Rangel of Riverview. “We were leaving the Bridgewalk Resort, were told by Krista Carpenter from Wildlife Inc. that there was a raccoon stuck in my engine and asked if I can open the hood of the car. I proceeded to throw the keys to her since I understand how raccoons can be aggressive when cornered,” Rangel told The Islander by email Jan. 15. Opening the hood revealed how horribly the escape plan had gone for the raccoon. It was stuck. Attempts by Rangel, resort staff and Wildlife Inc. to remove the animal from the engine failed. The raccoon was stuck for six hours before veterinarian Bill Bystrom of Island Animal Clinic in Holmes Beach came to the scene. Dr. Bystrom administered a sedative and removed the raccoon. The animal was taken to Wildlife Inc. to be monitored and then released Jan. 18, according to Wildlife Inc. curator and founder Gail Straight. She said the animal was not injured and after some rest was ready to be reintroduced to the wild. “It was just scared more or less. We kept him for a few days and he was fine so we released him and two other raccoons we were caring for around the same time,” she said Jan. 19. “We let them go way out east away from people. They seemed very happy.” Wildlife Inc. is a nonprofit that depends on donations for day-to-day operations.

fortunately, there were still many positives to report locally. Like what, you ask? Marco Island Academy completed their campus, a dream made into reality. The city completed an impressive makeover of Veterans Community Park, and as we speak, the finishing touches are going on a new state of the art emergency center at the city campus. There were also challenges, maybe none greater than Hurricane Ian. Wednesday, Sept. 28, Hurricane Ian made landfall near Cayo Costa, an island off the coast of Fort Myers, as a Category 4 storm. And while Fort Myers Beach, Sanibel and areas to the north got the worst of the storm, Marco Island, Goodland and Isles of Capri weren’t spared. Water did the most damage. On the north end of Marco Island, a portion of the parking lot of Snook Inn was overtaken by wet T-shirts, with employees laying them out on the pavement to dry. The almost 5-foot storm surge had spoiled the offerings from the gift shop and caused “extensive damage” to the beloved restaurant, senior manager Megan Criser said. The hut and the bar underneath it was gone, torn to shreds. “We have a standing building, so we’re all grateful for that,” Criser said. “We have more water damage than wind damage.” Down the block on Palm Street, Martina Smith was inspecting the damage at Boardroom Tavern and her Smith House restaurant and bakery. “We lost everything in our kitchen, all of our refrigeration,” Smith said. “But in saying all of that, we are blessed.” In Goodland, the storm surge was unexpected for Angela Loduca. “It didn’t seem like it was going to be that way,” she said, having remained at her home with her 17-month-old child, where the surge covered the floor. “If I knew it was going to be like that, I definitely would have split.” On the other side of Marco, Osteria Capri's chef-owner AJ Black was lending a helping hand to neighbors and cleaning up from the storm. Water levels in Capri's canals crept atop many residents' docks by 11 a.m. Collier County saw $2.2 billion in damage to property, according to officials. Meeting for the first time since Ian swept through Southwest Florida on Sept. 28, the Collier County Commission received a detailed report about building damage, debris clean up, power restoration and why the curfew is necessary.

The remaining four Cape Romano dome homes collapsed into the Gulf of Mexico following a final lashing by Hurricane Ian, photos and videos from a local sheller confirm. Alex Demooy of Breakwater Adventures and Athena Custodio, both of Naples, were out shelling on Friday following the storm when they came across what remained of the iconic and popular structures. At one point in time, they were fully on land, built in 1982, but erosion had in a sense pushed the homes into the water. After Hurricane Irma in 2017, two of the homes sunk. It was back to business in October after as City Council. Once preliminary matters were concluded, the council got into dealing with the measure, which was passed by Marco Island’s voters with 56.9 percent of the vote in August but does not take effect until after a first and second reading to the council, and with the chance for councilors to tweak or amend it. In citizen comments, Ed Issler said 80 municipalities in Florida have similar ordinances, “many stricter than Marco Island,” and the proposed STR is “very very very workable.” Jay Benedetti said the vote has been taken, it’s a done deal. Martin Winter warned of huge legal costs to the city for the “biggest piece of garbage ordinance ever.” A motion passed 4-3, with Grifoni, Irwin and Councilor Claire Babrowski opposed. Implementation of the ordinance was handled with more dispatch, with Brechnitz pointing out “the implementation plan is really a staff function,” not the purview of the City Council.

In a win for hundreds of opponents, Collier County planning commissioners sided against a controversial high-rise development on Isles of Capri in October. The board voted 6-1 to recommend denial. Only commissioner Joe Schmitt dissented, saying if the current commercial zoning remains in place it would “just be a disaster” for the island. After the vote, Schmitt reminded opponents the project could still move forward. “The fight isn’t over,” he said. The project would require a rezoning and a growth plan amendment. County commissioners will make the final decision. While the battle isn’t over, Isles of Capri resident and business owner Jeri Neuhaus said: “Right now there is a little bit of celebrating going on. We have to celebrate our little wins as well.” With 100 percent of the precincts reporting in the November election, incumbents Erik Brechnitz and Greg Folley have won re-election to the Marco Island City Council. Joining them will be Darrin Palumbo. Folley was the top vote getter with 27.9 percent of the vote (7,014 votes). Brechnitz received 27.6 percent or 6,945 votes. Palumbo was third with 16 percent of the vote (4,021). Christine Dowell received 3,598 votes (14.3 percent). Nanette Arlene Rivera received 3,563 votes (14.2 percent). Who won seats on the Collier County School Board? Not the incumbents The votes are in, and challengers Jerry Rutherford, Kelly Lichter and Tim Moshier have been elected to the Collier County School Board. They were decided victories, with Rutherford winning 65.4% of the vote, while Lichter took home 58% and Moshier 60.5%, according to early returns. The Collier County School Board is made up of five seats covering five districts. Although in Collier, school board members are elected countywide, they must live in their districts. They serve staggered four-year terms, overseeing 48,000 students in public schools, including charter schools. The Tigertail/Sand Dollar habitat was already in trouble – and then Hurricane Ian blew through. Now a roughly $4 million project is underway to restore the health of the system and water flow – but the work is under the gun to be completed before the beginning of nesting season for sea turtles and birds on May 1. At the northwest tip of Marco Island, the area that includes Hideaway Beach, Tigertail Beach, Sand Dollar Island and Sand Dollar Lagoon is a place in continual flux, where ocean currents, storms, and man-made events have brought massive reconfiguration over the past several decades. Since 2017’s Hurricane Irma, the natural berm that protects the lagoon has been eroded, with subsequent storms causing sand to overwash Sand Dollar Island and contribute to filling in the lagoon. “We’ve lost 15 to 20 acres of wetlands since Irma,” said Mohamed Dabees, vice president of Humiston & Moore Engineers, and project engineer for the Hideaway effort. “We are moving roughly over 400,000 cubic yards of sand to restore Sand Dollar Island and recreate the sand spit and barrier system.” “Total wetland area will be increased by relocating the sand spit seaward of its present location to where it was located in approximately 2017,” Dabees said in a paper on the Hideaway project published in “Frontiers in Built Environment.” “The reconstructed beach berm will provide enhanced resiliency to high frequency weather events. Sediment will be sourced from the existing sand spit and an innovative sand trap that will maintain the lagoon entrance open while providing beneficial re-use for excess sediment that continues to accumulate at the end of the spit.” The project will not cost Marco Island taxpayers a dime, said Erik Brechnitz – except those who own property at Hideaway Beach Club. Through the Hideaway This year’s Marco Island Christmas tree-lighting ceremony was two celebrations in one. To kick the evening off, the city’s government leaders celebrated the reopening of Veterans’ Community Park after a year-long remake, with thank yous, speeches and a ribbon cutting at the new Unity bandshell under balmy skies. Then, the bandshell stage was turned over to the younger generation for what many attendees – and they numbered well into the thousands – felt was the main attraction, the gyrations of wave after wave of “tiny dancers” dressed in colorful holiday costumes. The climax was reached around 7 p.m., when the skies darkened sufficiently to show off the festive Christmas Island Style tree, which was illuminated after a benediction and a NASA-style countdown. To complete the evening, Southwest Florida country artist Joel Fry and his band entertained with a concert of original and cover songs. How much electricity does it take to power a shiny new high-tech high school? One Watt.""}]",
