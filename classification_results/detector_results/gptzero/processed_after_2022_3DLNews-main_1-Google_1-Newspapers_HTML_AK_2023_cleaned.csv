Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 8:14 am We’ve heard a lot about inflation during past couple of years — and, like everyone else, have felt the effects of rising costs for many goods and services. Gas prices can be a factor in the overall price mix, influencing the costs of production and transportation. The Daily News has been tracking local, state and national gas price trends since 2008, and we were reminded of an interesting circumstance when an email arrived on Monday from GasBuddy.com Every week, GasBuddy surveys prices at nearly 150,000 gas stations nationwide, including nearly 400 stations in Alaska. Its weekly summaries provide average gas prices in Alaska and nationwide for a current given date, and the average gas prices for that given day going back every year for 10 years. For example, on this past Monday — Dec. 11, 2023 — the average gas price in Alaska was $3.78, according to this week’s GasBuddy Alaska Weekly Price Update. Ten years ago — on Dec. 11, 2013, the average price of gas in Alaska was $3.59. The similarity of gas prices between Dec. 11 in 2013 and in 2023 catches the attention. Alaska’s average gas price now is just 19 cents — about 5.3% — above what it was a full decade ago. That’s well below the pace of inflation. As Gov. Mike Dunleavy noted on Thursday when announcing his proposed state budget for 2024, “inflation has increased more than 20 percent” since he took office in December 2018. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis’ inflation calculator, that $3.59 gallon of gas in 2013 would now cost $4.67 if gas prices had kept pace with inflation. But they haven’t — and the recent trend has seen prices dropping steadily. “For the 12th straight week, or three straight months, the national average has continued to decline, now at its lowest level of 2023 heading into the prime of the holiday season as oil prices continue to struggle amidst cooling demand,"" Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said in this week’s Alaska price update. “... The trend is likely to continue in most states this week, while the national average could soon fall below $3.05 per gallon, the lowest since 2021.” It should be noted that gas prices dropped in the mid 2010s, with the Alaska average posting lows of $2.35 on Dec. 11, 2015, and $2.45 on Dec. 11 during the pandemic year of 2020. This past year, the Alaska average was $3.86 on Dec. 11 — 8 cents more than it was one year later. Looking at the graphs of gas prices over time, it’s clear that gas prices can rise and fall quickly. It would be beyond our expertise to knowledgeably describe why current prices are so similar to what they were a decade ago, but we find it fascinating that they are so close, especially with the clear and much larger increases observed (felt — ouch!) in the costs of many other items. It’s a circumstance that certainly provides fuel for thought. Your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers:'}]"

'version': '2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'By Megan Gannon Though much of the Seward Peninsula remains untouched by development, one group of architects has been engineering steady changes: Beavers. They are expanding further into the Arctic as climate change creates warmer, more favorable conditions for these critters. They build impressive lodges out of logs and mud. They dam rivers. They flood roads. They turn winding streams into systems of ponds that thaw permafrost. As residents of the Bering Strait region learn to live with these relatively new neighbors, scientists seek to understand the impact of beaver colonization. Ken Tape, an ecologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, was in Nome last month with a team of field researchers examining beaver ponds, but he never set out to become a beaver specialist. In his earlier work, he tracked the expansion of shrubby vegetation in the Arctic—and the boreal species that followed. Moose populations are shifting into new tundra territory as more shrubs are available for foraging in the winter. Migratory birds arrive earlier, too, in response to earlier spring conditions. Such wildlife changes are notoriously hard to measure, Tape said. But beavers leave an obvious footprint on the landscape. “What really was exciting about them is being able to detect the formation of ponds from space,” Tape said. People in western Alaska had been aware of the presence of beavers for decades. “I’m 47, I spent most of my life here in Nome, and as far as I can remember, there’s always been beavers,” said Brandon Ahmasuk, Kawerak’s Vice President of Natural Resources. “Now somebody who’s older, like say my father, he just turned 90 this last April, he may have a very different take on it.” As far as the science community was concerned, beavers were not considered an Arctic species. Their colonization had not yet been documented. Tape’s expertise in remote sensing helped capture the scale and speed of the phenomenon. He and a group of colleagues started looking at Landsat satellite images of the region. They announced their first results in 2017, showing that beavers had dammed more than 50 Arctic streams between 1999 and 2014. The researchers published their latest study in the journal Scientific Reports in May of this year, with even more dramatic findings. By looking at 70 years of satellite images and aerial photography, they mapped more than 11,000 beaver ponds in the Alaska Arctic (beyond the treeline), largely in the Seward Peninsula and the Northwest Arctic Borough. Between 2003 and 2017, the number of beaver ponds in the region had doubled. Tape and his colleagues found no evidence of beavers in their earliest aerial images from 1952, but signs of beaver engineering started showing up in the 1970s, which tracks with the observations of residents. That it took so long for scientists to pay more attention beaver colonization here perhaps speaks to Nome’s not-always prominent place in Arctic research. Scientists are more likely to use a base like Toolik Field Station, operated UAF’s Institute of Arctic Biology in the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, Tape said. Toolik’s infrastructure and funding—the station, which is accessible by road from Fairbanks, just received almost $20 million for its next five years of operations—make it an obvious choice for researchers to execute their fieldwork. But the Arctic is not changing uniformly. There are no beavers yet in the North Slope. “So much research is focused there, we miss important questions that are emerging or are relevant in western Alaska,” Tape said. “The Seward Peninsula is really a harbinger of what is in store for the rest of the Arctic.” Now that Tape has documented beaver colonization from above, he is getting closer to the ground to grasp the ecological changes these mammals bring. Beavers are not just responding to a changing climate; their engineering projects could be making warming worse by thawing carbon-storing Arctic permafrost. “Our hypothesis is that because these beaver ponds absorb more heat than the pre-existing kind of vegetation—and they thaw permafrost—they’re creating oases,” Tape said. “When you make deeper water, you make more unfrozen water in winter. We think these are places of greater biodiversity, and they’re essentially accelerating, or exacerbating, the effects of climate change in these locations.” Tape and his colleagues launched a five-year fieldwork program in 2021. When they returned to Nome last month, they visited several ponds—some close to the roads, others only accessible by helicopter—and took measurements of basic physical features like the water’s depth, temperature and quality. They’ll be back in March to study the conditions during winter, with added investigations of factors like snow depth and the amount of unfrozen water. “In the winter, it’s mostly a quest to see how much of the landscape is unfrozen in these beaver-affected areas versus the unaffected areas,” Tape said. Tape said he hopes his research could influence challenging decisions around beaver management. Expensive but effective devices like the “beaver deceiver” installed at Pilgrim Hot Springs last year can prevent serious flooding. Hunters can harvest beavers to reduce their numbers, too. But these established mitigation techniques are largely restricted to targeted areas near roads. The vast, inaccessible stretches of permafrost are changing just as rapidly. “Fly around in a helicopter, or fly around in Google Earth, and you will see that these guys are taking over lowland ecosystems in the Arctic,” Tape said. “I just cannot imagine how we’re going to prevent that.” Beaver management not only presents daunting logistical questions, but more philosophical ones, too. Should humans intervene at all? That depends on who you talk to. Tape said he’s often asked whether the beaver takeover is a good or bad thing. “If you like the Arctic the way it was, then it’s a bad thing,” he said. “If you like carbon stored in permafrost, it’s probably a bad thing.” On the upside, the new ecosystem engineered by beavers will likely increase fish biodiversity where fish thrive. “Although, I don’t think it’s a foregone conclusion that beavers have a positive or a negative effect on fish,” Tape said. “I think it’s complicated.” Caroline Brown, the statewide research director for the Division of Subsistence at the Alaska Department of Fish & Game, said she’s heard residents express worry about beavers’ effect on water quality and how their engineered changes could prevent subsistence users from navigating waterways or fish from getting to their habitats. “People have a lot of concerns about beaver disturbances doing things like blocking fish movement,” Brown said. Ahmasuk has also been fielding concerns about beavers and the mixed bag of their effects on the landscape. He gets another type of question from subsistence users: “Can we eat beavers?” “Because they’re newer to the Seward Peninsula, it’s not something that people traditionally harvested,” Ahmasuk said. He’s harvested beavers before, and described the meat as fatty and tender, tasting faintly of willows. His message to prospective hunters and trappers: “Don’t be afraid to try them.” Subsistence users have a wealth of knowledge about changes on the tundra that Tape and his colleagues hope to incorporate in their work. The researchers plan to interview residents in Kotzebue, Noatak and Shungnak about their experiences and observations. Beavers have been established in large numbers in Shungnak for at least 20 years, Brown said. Kotzebue, however, only witnessed a huge increase in beaver engineering in the last 20 years, while Noatak is right on the expanding edge of animals’ range. “We chose those three communities specifically because they are in three different stages of beaver impact,” said Brown, who is one of Tape’s collaborators in the fieldwork program.

been built in the Northwest, across the U.S. and around the world to boost fish populations where wild numbers have gone down. But an analysis of more than 200 studies on hatcheries programs meant to boost salmonid numbers across the globe – including salmon, trout and whitefish – shows that nearly all have had negative impacts on the wild populations of those fish. Most commonly, hatchery fish reduced the genetic diversity of wild fish, leading to poor health and reproductive outcomes. The findings weigh into a sensitive topic with a big price tag. In the Northwest, hatcheries are supposed to be a solution to declining wild salmonid numbers, caused in large part by hydroelectric dams, overfishing, irrigation and climate change. In the Columbia River Basin alone, officials have spent billions of dollars on nearly 200 hatcheries as well as habitat restoration projects during the past 50 years to improve wild numbers, but research shows those programs are having an opposite effect. The global studies, all undertaken between 1971 and 2021, were analyzed by scientists at the nonprofits Trout Unlimited, based in Virginia, and The Conservation Angler, out of Washington, along with the University of Washington, the University of Montana and the Université Laval, in Quebec, Canada. Their analysis was published in July in the journal Fisheries Management and Ecology. Of the 206 studies the team analyzed, more than 80% revealed hatcheries programs had adverse effects on wild salmonids. Of the 3% of hatcheries globally that were found to benefit wild populations, the majority were stocked with wild fish who were bred and released in small numbers to boost severely depleted wild populations. John McMillan, science director at The Conservation Angler who worked on the analysis, said the team wanted scientists all over the world who are studying the same fish species to see the impact of hatcheries programs beyond their regions of study. He said despite an overwhelming body of research showing most hatcheries programs hurt wild fish populations, it’s often controversial to criticize such programs. “It’s frustrating from a scientific point of view, because you can see what the science suggests, but it’s understandable why we’ve been reluctant to move our position on hatcheries, because of the social implications,” he said. “This is one of those things, like climate change, where we have to sit back and think about our relationship with the animal, what it means to us and how much we want to give up so these animals can truly, potentially rebuild themselves.” This year the Oregon Legislature passed Senate Bill 5509, which includes $1 million for a third-party assessment of hatchery programs in the state, including analysis of their costs and benefits. Hatcheries programs in the Northwest and globally that release hundreds of thousands of fish each year had the worst effect on wild salmonid populations, according to the analysis. “When you see really large releases of fish, they tend to swamp out the wild population,” McMillan said. An example is pink salmon released from hatcheries in Alaska. Unlike most salmon species, pink salmon spend two years rather than one in the ocean feeding before returning to their spawning grounds in rivers. They enter the ocean almost immediately after being released, and feed on vast amounts of microscopic plankton, which are the food for larger plankton that other fish species such as Chinook, coho, steelhead and sockeye eat. When hundreds of thousands of pink salmon are released from hatcheries each year, they upset the balance of food available in the ocean for all those other species. “It’s not leaving enough food for other salmon in the ocean,” McMillan said. It’s even negatively impacting orca populations, who feed on those other salmon species. You consume so much at the bottom of the food chain that it cascades to lower production at the top.” The best hatcheries, McMillan said, rear fish from wild stocks and release small but effective numbers to provide a short-term boost to the population. McMillan said the analysis shows a need for more study of fish epigenetics – the study of how the environment a fish develops in can change and affect the way its genes work, the way it behaves and its ability to survive. “There has been research coming out in the last four to five years indicating that even though hatchery fish are representative of the population at large from which they’re from, they’re undergoing epigenetic changes due to the hatchery rearing process,” he said. Some of those changes are passed along to offspring. Scientists are trying to study that process and discover whether those traits are passed to wild species and whether that affects the ability of wild fish to survive, he said. Recent studies found that some hatchery fish struggle in waters heavily affected by climate change. Wild fish have had millions of years to evolve through conditions that, at times, have resembled the present. Though they may have similar DNA, the influence of hatchery conditions on fish could make them less prepared to survive in volatile ocean conditions than wild fish. “Many of these wild fish have the genes to deal with these changing environments. But it’s unclear whether the hatchery fish do,” McMillan said.–––––––––https://alaskabeacon.comThis story was original published in the Oregon Capital Chronicle, which is, like the Alaska Beacon, part of the States Newsroom network.

The discovery of the virus in the animal’s body tissue, a process that required sampling and study by the North Slope Borough Department of Wildlife Management and other agencies, confirmed earlier in December that highly pathogenic avian influenza was the cause of death, said Dr. Bob Gerlach, Alaska’s state veterinarian. “This is the first polar bear case reported, for anywhere,” Gerlach said. As such, it was reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health and has gotten attention in other Arctic nations that have polar bears, he said. This was also the first Endangered Species Act-listed animal in Alaska known to fall victim to the disease. Polar bears, dependent on sea ice that is diminishing because of climate change, were listed as threatened in 2008. While polar bears normally eat seals they hunt from the sea ice, it appears likely that this bear was scavenging on dead birds and ingested the influenza virus that way, Gerlach said. Numerous birds on the North Slope of various species have died from this avian influenza, according to the Department of Environmental Conservation. However, the bear need not have directly eaten an infected bird to have become sick, Gerlach said. “If a bird dies of this, especially if it’s kept in a cold environment, the virus can be maintained for a while in the environment,” he said.

And so there’s no manual,” said Andy Ramey, a U.S. Geological Survey wildlife geneticist and avian influenza expert. Highly pathogenic avian influenza is called that because it spreads rapidly in flocks of domestic poultry, often requiring massive culls to control the contagions. Such outbreaks have been of concern in the past because of their economic consequences for global agriculture. Until recently, wild birds were afterthoughts. Though they were known to carry the viruses, ferrying them between domestic poultry populations, they were largely unaffected. That has changed dramatically. The prior U.S. outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, in 2014-15, resulted in some wild bird infections, and some influenza-caused bird die-offs occurred in Europe shortly thereafter. But the current version is considered unprecedented in its effect on wild birds and other wildlife. “Across North America, and really around the world, lots of wild birds these days — I mean, thousands of wild birds these days, tens of thousands in some cases — are dying because of these highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses,” Ramey said. The deaths are of particular concern when they occur in populations that are already vulnerable, he said. An extreme example he cited is the highly endangered California condors, with a population of just a few hundred. After 21 influenza deaths were documented, federal wildlife officials launched what promises to be a challenging vaccination program in that population. [Previous coverage: Alaska’s bird flu outbreak is taking an especially heavy toll on eagles and other wild birds] The disease has also killed a variety of mammals around the world. In Alaska, three foxes, a black bear and a brown bear have died from this avian influenza. Elsewhere, more bears have been found dead after being infected by the virus, along with skunks, raccoons, mountain lions and large numbers of seals in eastern Canada and off the coasts of Maine and Washington state, as well as outside of North America. The nation’s first detection of the disease in a squirrel was confirmed earlier this month in an animal found in Arizona. To Gerlach, the polar bear case was not surprising, considering that black and brown bears have died. It is possible that more polar bears succumbed to the disease, but in remote places out of the view of people to record the events, he said. “You’re really dependent on the public that’s out there, or the wildlife biologists that are doing surveillance,” he said. Documenting cases in any wild mammal population can be difficult, he added: “How long is a carcass going to be in the wild before it gets scavenged or eaten by something else?” Aside from the large and wide-ranging death toll in the wild, the current outbreak has some other differences, particularly its durability, as seen in its persistence away from domestic flocks. The virus that caused the 2014-15 outbreak spread in the wild bird populations for a while, but it “sort of fizzled out,” Ramey said, probably because it was eventually stamped out in poultry operations. But this one continues to be maintained in the wild, as evidenced by monitoring in Western Alaska, a place far from any big farms raising chickens or turkeys, he said. Gerlach gave the same assessment. “After the second year, that all of sudden disappeared,” he said of the 2014-15 version. “It didn’t stick around, where this virus seems like it’s sticking around.” Rather than winding down, it is continuing to spread across the world, he noted, even into bird populations in Antarctica, as has been recently documented. There are signs that it is now endemic in the wild, a fixed feature into the foreseeable future, he said. If so, “it’s not going to go away. It’s going to be here, and we have to have some way to deal with it,” he said. For Alaska, “a mixing area” for global bird migrations, spread of avian diseases is always an issue, Gerlach said. “Alaska is a catchall area for birds from North America or the Americas, as well as from Asia,” he said. The highly pathogenic avian influenza of 2014 and 2015 was introduced from Asia to North America by wild birds migrating through Alaska. The current influenza is also crossing continents through Alaska, though from multiple directions, Ramey’s research has found. Pacific black brant fly above Izembek Lagoon at Izembek National Wildlife Refuge on Dec. 27, 2013. The refuge is used as a migratory stop for nearly the entire global population of Pacific black brant. Black brant are among the wild birds in Alaska found to have been infected with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, according to state records. (Photo by Kristine Sowl/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) In a newly published study, Ramey and his research partners found what is likely to have been three separate and independent introductions of highly pathogenic avian influenza into Alaska last year. His research, with colleagues from the USGS and other agencies, used genetic analysis to trace one form of influenza to North America and two to Asia. “To have three introductions in Western Alaska, two from East Asia and one from the Lower 48, I mean, we haven’t seen anything like that before,” he said. “It really, I think, exemplifies how these viruses now are clearly able to be maintained.” [From May: As migrating birds return to Alaska, state veterinarian warns of continued avian influenza threat] That study examined birds harvested in the fall of 2022 by hunters in the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge area at the southern tip of the Alaska Peninsula. Ramey and his colleagues found only a tiny number of hunted birds that were infected with the currently active highly pathogenic influenza virus: out of 811 swab samples taken directly from birds and another 199 samples from feces, the only harvested birds identified as infected were eight pintails, one cackling goose and one widgeon. It can take months to get test results from samples, so what happened to those harvested birds is unknown, he said. But their meat was safe to eat as long as it was properly cooked to the recommended 165 degrees, he said. “Heat is remarkably good at deactivating viruses,” he said. Along with the cooking advice, there are other longstanding recommendations about safely handling hunted birds, such as regular handwashing and avoidance of obviously sick animals. There is little evidence that the current avian influenza wave poses an infection risk to humans. Only a few cases have been documented in""}]"

A stack of the Seward Journal is pictured. The town’s only daily newspaper published its last edition Nov. 27. (Photo via Seward Journal Facebook page) Seward Journal calls it quits after struggle to keep newspaper afloat The final issue of Seward’s community newspaper hit stands on Wednesday, snuffing out one of the Kenai Peninsula’s last remaining news sources and the eastern peninsula’s only weekly newspaper. “After lengthy deliberation, the decision has been made to discontinue publishing the Seward Journal at the end of the month,” Seward Journal Publisher Michael Paschall wrote in the paper’s Nov. 22 edition. The end of the Journal comes as the number of local newspapers in the United States continues to decline. A study published in early November by the Northwestern University-based Medill School of Journalism found that, on average, more than two newspapers closed each week during 2023. A lack of local advertising, which Paschall called the “funding source for newspapers,” an increase in production costs and the difficulty keeping staff in Seward all contributed to the decision to shutter the paper. His company, TriDelta, Inc., took over publishing the Journal in January 2017 and operates out of Delta Junction, where he also serves as fire chief. The paper in December 2017 announced that it would be combining with the Seward Phoenix Log. That paper opened in 1966 under Willard and Beverly Dunham and Joan Hoogland and is one of many that have served the Seward community since the early 1990s. That’s according to Evangeline Atwood and Lew Williams Jr.’s 2006 “Bent Pins to Chains: Alaska and Its Newspapers.” Per “Bent Pins to Chains,” at various intervals, the “Seward Gateway,” “Seward Polaris,” “Seward Seaport Record,” “Seward Advertising Bulletin,” “Petticoat Gazette,” “Seward Phoenix Log,” and eventually the “Seward Journal” all chronicled happenings in town; each have their own colorful history. The “Seward Gateway” was founded by John Ballaine at the same time he founded the City of Seward. The “Petticoat Gazette,” was run by the town’s Business and Professional Women’s Club and was printed at the Seward Sanitorium as part of a patient rehabilitation program. The “Phoenix Log” is so named for a Russian ship built in Resurrection Bay in the late 1800s. The Seward Journal additionally purchased in 2018 the Seward City News, an online media outlet that had previously been owned by Steve Fink. The primary challenge of keeping the Seward Journal afloat, Paschall said Thursday, is and always has been revenue constraints. After taking over the publication, he said he tried to follow the model of Alaska Newspapers, Inc., which “Bent Pins to Chains” called an Alaska Native-owned company behind the state’s first successful newspaper chain out of Seward in the 1990s. Paschall said he played with different sales models over the years, even at one point mailing it directly to all postal addresses with a 99664 postal address. The rise of social media also meant people had alternative ways to advertise their businesses than the paper. One blow to sales, he said, came after the paper moved from being sold over the counter at Safeway to being sold to a display alongside the Anchorage Daily News near the front of the store. That meant shoppers didn’t see the publication until they’d already checked out. He then decided to make the Seward Journal free of charge, positing that it might reach more people — especially during tourist season — and thereby increase the product’s value to potential advertisers. Paschall said advertising revenue, though, was still a struggle, noting that the operation “never really got profitable.” “Where all of it continued to fall apart was just not (having) the financial support of advertising,” he said Thursday. Paschall in March 2022 published an article titled “Is the newspaper important to the community?” in which he warned that the publication could become “a thing of the past” without the financial stability required to cover local news in-depth. “Quite frankly, if the support is not there from the business community, local news coverage in Seward will discontinue,” he wrote. The income generated by advertising sales, he continued, is directly tied to how much the Seward Journal can pay staff. Those individuals often struggled with Seward’s high cost of living and lack of affordable housing. Sam McDavid has been the Seward Journal’s only full-time reporter since August 2020, when he took the advice of a friend doing seasonal work over the summer. “Without any plan I hopped on a plane and headed up,” he said. McDavid is based in Alabama now, but said he lived off and on in Seward for multiple summers, sometimes providing labor in exchange for a place to stay. His “audition story” — the article he wrote in order to land a job at the Seward Journal — was covering the 2020 Seward Silver Salmon Derby. Since then he said there have been a lot of stories that stick out, such as then-Seward High School junior Lydia Jacoby bringing home gold in the 2020 Olympics or a Seward man’s battle against a grizzly bear near a tributary of the Yukon River. McDavid said he particularly valued tracking Jacoby’s progress through her coach, Solomon D’ Amico, who he said always “had every faith” she would become an Olympic champion. Seeing that prophecy come to fruition, he said, was “remarkable.” “I feel like I got to be a part of one of the town’s biggest milestones in history,” McDavid said. He, of course, also wrote about issues that were more polarizing. As Seward residents have considered and then reconsidered the sale of the city’s electric utility, McDavid said his biggest goal was always to make sure his work reflected the diversity of voices and options being considered. He said he always kept the impacts to residential ratepayers at the forefront of his reporting on the issue, and said his work didn’t always sit right with readers. “There’s an immediacy to the consequences to anything that you write,” he said of reporting in a small place. “You feel the reverberations. Everyone shares in all of the events that take place in the town.” Paschall had similar thoughts on the Journal’s coverage of the sale, saying that he and McDavid spent a lot of time and resources trying to present all of the information as fairly as possible. “There wasn’t an agenda,” Paschall said. Even though he’s no longer going to be writing for the Seward Journal, there are a couple of issues he said he plans to keep an eye on. They include the Seward Heat Loop Project — a plan to heat a handful of city buildings with geothermal energy — and what happens next with Seward’s electric utility. “I’m going to miss being a part of Seward,” he said. Paschall said he expects the Seward Journal website to stay live until the end of December. After that, Seward Journal content will not be available online. More than a reliable source of community news, Paschall said an end to the Seward Journal means also an end to an unbiased view of community issues. “I think what you lose is an independent voice that is willing to dig in and look into information, whether it’s popular or not popular,” he said. The final edition of the Seward Journal was published Nov. 29 and, until next month, can be viewed at sewardjournal.com.

The levels of ground and ladder fuel we have could in the right circumstances result in catastrophic fires as we have never seen before,” Etheridge wrote in the Facebook post. “Warm dry weather with humidity below 30% and some wind are what we are looking for when deciding on a local open-burning suspension.” CCFR Fire Marshal Daniel Jager agreed. “A lot of people think because we’re in a rainforest we don’t have any issue with wildfire and there is no need to worry or concern about it, but there have been times in the past where we have really dry conditions,” Jager said to the Empire. “Hopefully it doesn’t happen this year but we ask people to be extra careful just so we don’t have any potential for it.” According to the report, the temperature in Southeast Alaska is expected to increase around 6 degrees Fahrenheit by the turn of the century, and there will likely be more evaporation in summer, which could increase the chance of drought even with the increase in precipitation. “This is going to happen again, and if it gets warmer and not wetter things can go south,” Thoman said. “We don’t know where or when, but we can be sure it’s going to be warmer and it’s getting warmer because the climate is changing.” Andrew Hoell, a research meteorologist for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association who worked on the report, said there are so many variables that go into annual precipitation amounts and drought that it’s difficult to pinpoint what the future dry spells in Southeast Alaska might look like and what issue or changes might occur in response to them. “The future is interesting just because the precipitation in the region is going up and at the same time the temperature is also going up as well and I think it will be interesting to see how those contributions manifest in drought,” he said. Thoman agreed and said looking to the future, communities in Southeast Alaska should be thinking about ways to prepare for extreme drought which, though on the decline, will likely be more impactful due in part to the rising temperatures. “It’s been dry before, it’s going to be dry again,” he said. “People should be thinking about how we will deal with the next dry time and I think the fact that it’s getting warmer is going to exacerbate those dry times.” • Contact reporter Clarise Larson at clarise.larson@juneauempire.com or (651)-528-1807.

[Juneau breaks rainfall record] The report, created jointly by a handful of local climate institutions, retroactively explored the continued impacts of a recent long-term and extreme drought that occurred across Southeast Alaska between 2016-2019. The researchers examined why the drought was different from previous droughts in the region and what future dry spells could mean for the region moving forward as the climate continues to warm across the globe. “No, this was not the first drought, but this was perhaps the first warm and dry period drought,” said Rick Thoman, Alaska climate specialist for the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. “Up until now, we didn’t have to think about the heat component of drought — it’s clear that is no longer the case.” Thoman said though to many people it may seem backward that a place as notoriously wet as Southeast Alaska could experience a drought, he said it’s important to remember dry spells are determined by the lack of precipitation relative to a location. In the case of the 2016-2019 drought, many other regions in the Lower 48 would have likely seen the amount of precipitation during time as abundant. However, in many places in Southeast Alaska, the prolonged dry spell meant both short and long term negative impacts to the region’s communities and natural resources. Some of the impacts outlined in the report included water restrictions in communities, including Haines and Wrangell, due to low water levels in lakes and reservoirs, the defoliation of 530,000 acres of forest due to an outbreak in hemlock sawfly in 2018 which was exacerbated by the warm and dry conditions and the region also saw an increase in the risk of wildfire. According to the report, in 2018 the Tongass National Forest crew responded to 32 wildfires, which is around 10-15 more wildfires than what normally occurs each year. The 2016-2019 drought was both warm and dry, Thoman explained, making it somewhat of an outlier compared to the previous droughts throughout the past decades that have impacted the region which saw below-normal temperatures. He said the change in temperature will be an important factor to follow moving forward as global temperatures continue to rise and make conditions for wildfires increasingly frequent. “It’s been dry before, it’s going to be dry again,” Thoman said. “People should be thinking about how we will deal with the next dry time and I think the fact that it’s getting warmer is going to exacerbate those dry times.” In early January Capital City Fire/Rescue’s Facebook account reposted a story that examined the record-breaking wildfire season in Bristol Bay which experienced its largest wildfire season on record last year and nearly 416000 acres burned, according to the story.

He remained a member of the union until his death, but he soon found himself needing another boat. He nearly lost the boat in a harrowing adventure in early September 1957. Ball, along with two other Kenai men (Carl Ahlstrom, a Territorial police officer, and Walter Myrick, a civilian employee at the Wildwood military base) planned a goat-hunting trip in Johnstone Bay, about 35 miles east of Seward. When they arrived, they found their landing site being pounded by a heavy surf. While Bill Baker piloted the Donna J. and kept the boat in position offshore, the others loaded and deployed a skiff and attempted to make landfall. Churning waves swamped the smaller craft, and all of their gear was lost. They managed to reach the shore and retrieve the skiff, but the harsh conditions prevented them from launching and returning to the waiting Donna J. Unable to rescue the trio on shore, Baker turned away and headed back to Seward for help. The hunters, meanwhile, pulled the skiff up onto the beach and overturned it against a shale cliff to use for shelter from the wind and pouring rain. There, they waited three days, unaware that the Donna J. had capsized in heavy seas in Day Harbor and that Baker had had to be rescued. On the third day, stormy seas forced the hunters to climb the cliff. Myrick and Ball received cuts from falling rock during the ascent. Then a passing plane spotted the stranded men, dropped sleeping bags and other supplies, and notified Air-Sea Rescue. Later, an Army tug from Whittier rescued the men while the Coast Guard cutter Sedge stood by. Despite the capsizing in Day Harbor, the Donna J. also survived this ordeal — but not the next one. In July of the following year, a Mr. and Mrs. George Black discovered Jackson Ball alone and adrift in a skiff off Nubble Point (the northeast tip of MacDonald Spit between Jakolof Bay and Seldovia). The skiff was all that remained of his fishing vessel, the Donna J., which had exploded, burned and sunk earlier that day. A two-paragraph newspaper article about the incident offered no explanation for the explosion. The Blacks brought Ball aboard their boat and towed his skiff to Seldovia. They also provided him with warm clothing and food. At some point after this, Ball purchased another fishing vessel that he dubbed the Iron Mule. Before things improved for Ball, however, he encountered more misfortune. First, there was this one-paragraph notice in the Anchorage Daily Times on Oct. 21, 1958: “A Kenai fellow who calls himself Lead Poison Jackson Ball is offering $25 for the conviction of what must be Alaska’s most unusual vandal. Ball claims the strong-armed culprit ‘cut’ his ton-and-a-half truck in two at a Kenai gravel pit.” Second, there was another family tragedy. By 1958, Jackson was one of four Ball family members who had moved from Connecticut to the Kenai Peninsula. His older sister, Lillie, was married to William Mongeau. In 1952 they had purchased the Soldotna-area homestead of John William “Jack” Keeler and moved into the two-story Keeler home with their five children. Only four months later it burned to the ground. Although they lost many of their possessions, no one was hurt, and the Mongeaus moved to Kenai and, a few years later, to Spenard. By the mid-1950s, Jackson was also joined in Kenai by his youngest sibling, John David “Johnny” Ball, whom Jackson called “Buddy,” and by their mother, Margaret Ball, who by this time was in her mid-60s. Buddy, who was 27 and single in 1958, was working as an auto body repairman. In early November, he was killed in a one-car accident near Soldotna. His survivors, in addition to family members in Alaska, included his sister Esther, who was living in California and had been in trouble in her youth and early adulthood; older brother Robert (in North Carolina), and sisters Amy and Gerda (both of Connecticut). On Feb. 17, 1959, about three months after his brother’s death, 36-year-old Jackson Ball married for the second time. His bride in the Connecticut civil ceremony was a two-time divorcee, 29-year-old Mary D. Sullivan. This would be the final marriage for each of them, and they would produce four daughters together. The Ball family split time over the next nine years between Jackson’s North Kenai homestead and a home on DeArmoun Road, south of Anchorage. Jackson made no headlines during this time, but one of his daughters, many years later, said that her father — called “Bud” by his wife — primarily made a living by taking hunters and fishermen out in his boat to various islands in Southcentral Alaska. That daughter — Margaret, the eldest — remembered her father fondly and once recalled his thoughtfulness in walking miles through the snow to buy her a radio that she really wanted for Christmas. When Jackson was gunned down in Kenai in 1968, Margaret was only 9 years old. Photographs and mementos of her father were few. Memories were about all she had left. TO BE CONTINUED…. Photo from Ball Family memorial slideshow, 2022 This is an early photo of U.S. Army soldier Arlon Elwood “Jackson” Ball in uniform. The patches, ribbons and medals on this uniform demonstrate that he had not yet served overseas or been involved in any combat. North to Alaska When Arlon Elwood “Jackson” Ball died in North Kenai in 1968, state newspapers reported that he had been an 18-year resident of Alaska, implying that he first began living in Alaska in about 1950. What he did between his honorable discharge from the U.S. Army in 1945 and his move north is unclear, except for the fact that his first marriage came to an end. Perhaps it was this termination — including a separation from any children who may have resulted from the union — that drove him northward. Perhaps going to Alaska was the fresh start he needed at this time in his life, just as his military service had provided him new opportunities a decade earlier. Although the questions surrounding this earlier marriage complicate the end of Jackson Ball’s story, members of his family were reluctant to address those questions publicly a decade ago and have since offered no change in that stance. It is clear, however, that Ball was busy in Alaska. On Aug. 1, 1952, he traveled to the Land Office in Anchorage to file a on a 160-acre homestead he had staked southeast of Lower Salamatof Lake, which lies north of Kenai. On Aug. 3, 1954, he gained patent to his homestead. Around this same time, Ball bought a fishing boat called the Donna J. and became a member of the union called Pile Drivers Local 2502. He remained a member of the union until his death, but he soon found himself needing another boat. He nearly lost the boat in a harrowing adventure in early September 1957. Ball, along with two other Kenai men (Carl Ahlstrom, a Territorial police officer, and Walter Myrick, a civilian employee at the Wildwood military base) planned'}]"

Please give us a call at 907-600-1691 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy It looks like Palmer will have a brand new public library operating in 2026. The city council voted to approve construction of a new library building at its Tuesday, Dec. 12 meeting. Having a new building with new technologies may cost more but it will be more efficient trying to rebuild the original library damaged by a roof collapse in late 2022, the council decided. Architect Gary Wolf and his staff met six times with the city’s special library committee to work through extensive public comments, a process that developed three options for the council, two involving variations of a rebuild of the damaged structure and the third a new building. By a unanimous vote the council favored the new building. The cost will be higher but a new 20,000-square-foot building will give the community about 60 percent more usable space than a rebuilt old structure, Wolf told the council. City officials have set a “not-to-exceed” budget target of $15 million for the building. After the council vote on Tuesday Wolf is to proceed with a final design and bid specifications for contractors. The design will come back to the city council for final approval. Assuming that is given the final preparation work should allow bid documents to go to contactors in mid-2024, Wolf said. That could allow a contract to be let in the fall, possibly allowing some work to get started next winter. A decision to use wood or steel panels on the exterior will affect the timing because delays in getting steel panels could delay getting started six weeks or more. Communities and companies across Alaska are still dealing with supply-chain and workforce shortages that appeared during the pandemic, Wolf said. Electric components of buildings are still seeing delivery eight to 10 months from the time or ordering. Mechanical units for buildings, like boilers, are on a similar delayed schedule for delivery, Wolf said. Skilled labor is a problem for every industry in the state including construction, although bigger projects have an easier time attracting workers. Wolf said he hopes Palmer’s project will be in that category. Although the not-to-exceed budget limit is $15 million, the city has that amount available. State Rep. DeLena Johnson was able to get a $5 million legislative appropriation for the library earlier this year. An unknown amount is still expected from an insurance settlement on the damaged building. City manager John Moosey said he believes the settlement could be in the $2 million to $3 million range. Palmer voters also approved up to $10 million in new general obligation bonds for the library in recent city elections, although it is hope that not all of that will be needed. That would avoid new debt being assumed by the city that taxpayers will have to fund. Wolf said a good rule-of-thumb for construction of buildings like the library, or schools, is now about $650 per square foot. That’s about twice the square-foot cost for buildings seen in 2018 and 2019. The increase results from four to five years of inflation since the pandemic set in, he said. Councilman Joshua Tudor said he would like try and lower the cost so that a smaller amount of bond, or debt, money used. Wolf said there could always been some money shaved off the budget but the committee has already squeezed the budget. “There would be consequences,” of taking more out. Councilman Richard Best said, “I think you’ve presented rhe pitfalls os trying to use the existing structure,” which is one way to save money. “But that could create maintenance headaches. It’s time for us to walk away from the old building. It has served its purpose,” he said. There had been some talk early on to incorporate new city offices in the building because the present city office and council chamber is in an old building with crowded space. Mayor Steve Carrington said the decision was made against the idea but a large conference room big enough to support city council and community meetings was incorporated. One uncertainty is if contamination or other pollutants are found in an environmental survey the city will conduct on the property. The old, damaged library building was built in 1984, and while that was after the use of asbestos and other hazardous materials were prohibited for usw in buildings there was always the chance that some of it may have wound up in the former library, Wolf said. There will also be some modifications needed at the site of the old library, which will also be the location for the new building. The old library was built on a small, artificial hill that raised it a bit above the surrounding properties. That will likely be lowered when the new building is built so that there will be for flat, level terrain for parking. A new idea advance by councilman Richard Best to help in funding any shortfall in construction as well as ongoing operations costs would to form “library districts” in the borough that would function something like road service areas. The Palmer library has always served people in the area around the city, so a service area concept would allow the borough to chip in on some of the costs. Councilman John Tudor said he feels Mat-Su Borough officials might be open to the idea. Log In Keep it Clean. Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexually-oriented language.
