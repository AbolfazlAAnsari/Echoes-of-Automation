The Monday filing is the first indication of how Smith plans to use a massive tranche of information gathered from Trump’s account on Twitter, the social media network now known as X, following a secret court battle to secure access to the account. Prosecutors in the election interference case also extracted data from Trump’s White House cell phone, and that of an aide, described in the filing only as “Individual 1.” The expert, who is unnamed in the court filing, reviewed how Trump and the aide used their phone throughout the post-election period, and has “specifically identified the periods of time during which the defendant’s phone was unlocked and the Twitter application was open on Jan. 6.” It’s unclear the extent of the information prosecutors have from Trump’s phone, though the filing says the expert analyzed “images found on the phones and websites visited.” But it’s possible the expert could provide greater insight into Trump’s posting of a tweet attacking then-Vice President Mike Pence. Another expert prosecutors plan to bring in for testimony will analyze how a crowd of Trump’s supporters moved in response to his call to march toward the Capitol. The expert “plotted the location history data for Google accounts and devices associated with individuals who moved, on January 6, 2021, from an area at or near the Ellipse to an area encompassing the United States Capitol building.” Their review “will aid the jury in understanding the movements of individuals toward the Capitol area during and after the defendant’s speech at the Ellipse.” Trump is set to face trial March 4 on four counts related to his efforts to subvert the transfer of power.

And it’s always been my dream to come to Chincoteague because I love Chincoteague,” Callahan said. “So, we donated her back and every year we would come and we would see her.” According to urban legend, the ponies arrived on the island after a Spanish ship carrying wild horses sank in the 1600s. Now, the annual pony swim and auction is done every year to control the herd and raise money for the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Department. “We’ve never lost a pony in 98 years of doing the pony swim. It’s just something we do. We always look out for the ponies. They’re number one,” said Chincoteague Mayor Arthur Leonard. Leonard said a member of his family has been in the round-up since the very first swim in 1925. “Watching my boys ride the horses and hopefully my grandson will do it one of these days,” Leonard said. The pony swim is followed by a parade through the island. After the swim, veterinarians examine the ponies which are then sold at auction. Copyright 2023 WTKR via CNN Newsource.

variant is now causing almost half of infections nationwide The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. As of Friday, CDC data estimates indicate that the quickly spreading variant is now causing almost half of infections nationwide The omicron coronavirus subvariant JN.1 now makes up 44.2% of COVID-19 cases in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of Friday, CDC data estimates indicate that the quickly spreading variant is now causing almost half of infections nationwide, when just days ago it was estimated that JN.1 caused only about 20% of infections. JN.1 makes up nearly 57% of new COVID-19 cases in the Northeast, according to the data. Earlier this week, the variant was already dominant in the region, causing about a third of new infections at the time. Globally, JN.1 continues to be reported in multiple countries, and its prevalence has been rapidly increasing. The World Health Organization named it a variant of interest on Tuesday because of its “rapidly increasing spread” but noted that the additional public health risk remains low. The CDC estimates that the prevalence of JN.1 more than doubled in the U.S. between late November and mid-December. It seems to be getting an assist from holiday travel and waning immunity. Variant trackers say they expect JN.1 to become the leading coronavirus variant around the world in a matter of weeks. Vaccine immunity is expected to remain “cross-reactive” to JN.1 — a descendant of the variant BA.2.86 — itself a subvariant that came to the world’s attention over the summer because of the large number of changes to its spike proteins. COVID-19 caused seven hospitalizations for every 100,000 people in the week ending on Dec. 9, accounting for a 3% increase, CDC data shows. More than three-quarters of U.S. hospital beds are currently in use, which is largely in line with trends over the past three years since the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the CDC warns that rising respiratory virus hospitalizations could strain health care resources in the coming weeks. Overall, COVID-19 data shows weekly hospitalizations have been trending down in recent weeks. Meanwhile, flu hospitalizations are rising but remain steady compared with recent weeks, according to CDC data. Flu-like activity is very high in five states and high in 15 states.

Reporter Published: December 26, 2023, 6:45 AM Updated: December 26, 2023, 6:14 PM Thomas Mates, Digital Storyteller James Sparvero, Reporter MELBOURNE, Fla. – A Pennsylvania man was killed in Melbourne on Christmas after he was hit while crossing a road and the driver took off, according to police. Investigators said they were called to the area of South Harbor City Boulevard and Strawbridge Avenue around 12:18 a.m. Officers said they found Drew Sofranko, 23, had been hit. The man was rushed to the hospital where he ultimately died. On Tuesday, News 6 learned that Sofranko, 23, was the best man at his father’s wedding during what was supposed to be the perfect Christmas vacation for his family. “He gave a great best man speech, probably one of the best I’ve ever heard,” father Doug Sofranko said. “I may be a little bias, but it was tremendous.” [EXCLUSIVE: Become a News 6 Insider (it’s FREE) | PINIT! Share your photos] In video of his son’s speech, Sofranko called his father his hero. Doug Sofranko said his son was pursuing a career in the military, like his father. “Dad, you’ve been my hero and guide, and now, seeing you take this step with such grace and happiness fills my heart with immense joy,” Sofranko said. Sofranko married Drew’s stepmother, Danell Sofranko, at the beachside Hilton. The next night on Christmas Eve, the couple said Drew went out downtown but never made it back to their vacation rental as he walked across US-1 and highway 192. “He was just a great kid,” Danell said. “I’m really going to miss him.” Sofranko’s father said police told the family the unknown driver was behind the wheel of a white four-door Chevrolet car. “The assumption is that the person was driving at a high-rate of speed because the physician said that the traumatic injuries would have caused death immediately,” he said. Two years ago near the same location, police said there was another fatal hit-and-run crash that killed a manager of a Melbourne restaurant. It took police more than a year to make an arrest after an extensive review of evidence including DNA, fingerprints and hours of surveillance. Benjamin Moore is charged with the death of Nate Real, who was a manager at the Mansion restaurant. The Sofranko family is now hoping for justice as well. “He had a bigger heart than anybody that I’ve ever known,” Sofranko’s stepmother said. The victim’s father asked for the person responsible to come forward. “It’s never too late to do the right thing so I would urge them to turn themselves in, give our family some sort of resolution to this horrible tragedy,” Doug Sofranko said. Anyone with information on the crash is asked to call Melbourne police at 321-616-5033. The family is also raising money to pay for Sofranko’s funeral through a GoFundMe that can be found here and T-shirt sales that can be located here.

(WALB) - WALB News 10 has learned new details about a wild crash on Highway 84 in Lowndes County that many have seen all over social media. The video has been shared on just about every social media platform in the last week. It’s body cam footage from a Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office deputy who was on the opposite side of the highway investigating another crash. While on the scene, the video shows a car driving up the back of a tow truck full speed, and then flying over the truck and flipping in the air. The deputy then rushes to the aid of the driver, reportedly a woman who survived. WCTV, WALB’s sister station, confirmed that the driver of that vehicle is a 21-year-old woman from Tallahassee and suffered serious injuries and was taken to South Georgia Medical Center. The incident is raising awareness of Georgia’s Move Over Law. Which requires drivers to slow down, and/or move over a lane when approaching emergency vehicles on the side of the road, which includes tow trucks. “People not moving over actually has hit my family as well. In 1966 when my father was 12, he lost his father, my grandfather. He was hooking up to a vehicle and a drunk driver rear-ended the tow truck that he was right behind causing him to pass away at the scene,” Louis Kenda, part owner of Kenda Truck Center, said. To protect roadside workers and drivers with disabled vehicles, AAA is offering some precautionary tips: “I can control the load that I am towing, I can control where it’s at once I arrive on the scene, and I can control how it gets off my truck. The only thing I cannot control is the people driving by. That is the worst nightmare,” Kenda said. WALB is still working to confirm the condition of the driver who flew over the truck, and if she is facing charges. Penalties for not abiding by Georgia’s Move Over Law include a fine of $500 and three points on your license. Copyright 2023 WALB. All rights reserved.'}]"

Major weather events devastated parts of the world in 2023, as the Earth continues to see warming trends, reports from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show. Video above: Fires wreak havoc on historic town of Lahaina NOAA says as of Dec. 8 there were 25 ""confirmed weather/climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each to affect United States."" Here are the weather stories that defined 2023: Thousands of people were displaced from the hundreds of wildfires that began to erupt in Canada in the spring of 2023. The record-breaking fire season in Canada burned land roughly the size of North Dakota, according to NASA\'s Earth Observatory, ""While the total number of reported fires has not been unusual—6,595 by October—a subset of the fires reached extraordinary sizes."" The smoke also led to poor air quality for millions across the midwest and eastern U.S. It is the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. Flames overtook the scenic island of Maui on Aug. 8, fueled by dry weather and winds from a nearby hurricane. The community of Lahaina suffered the most with many buildings destroyed in the fire. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden visited nearly two weeks after the fire tore through the western part of the island. The death toll has varied but currently stands at 100 people. According to the Associated Press, 12,000 people were displaced in the fire, half of whom were still living in hotels due to housing shortage as of mid-December.

It was a Category 1 storm with 75 mph winds and grew to a monstrous Category 4 storm with 130 mph sustained winds within a day before decreasing to 125 mph winds and Cat 3 by the time it made landfall. The historic storm had record-breaking storm surge from Tampa to the Big Bend.

And it’s arguably here to stay. For the last two years, sales of vinyl records easily outpaced those of CDs. And purchases weren’t confined to ultra-hip indie music shops. Big-box retailers like Target and Walmart are now big-time players, selling re-pressings of classic albums, as well as new drops from some of the world’s most successful pop-stars. Meanwhile, Record Store Day, the traditionally once-a-year infusion of vinyl rarities and reissues into independently owned record stores across the country, has been to independently owned vinyl music stores what Black Friday is to big-box retailers. Record Store Day is held on Saturday, April 22 at music retailers across Northeast Florida. The announcement of this year’s RSD carried news of exclusive vinyl from a diverse range of artists, from Taylor Swift to Beach House, Jason Isbell & the 400 Unit, T Rex, the Magnetic Fields and many, many more. This year’s RSD also coincides with the much-celebrated 50th anniversary of hip hop. As such, there’ll be a range of exclusive releases from hip-hop artists, including Ol’ Dirty Bastard and Rza, Nas, Slum Village, Prince Rakeem, Chief Keef and more. With hundreds of reissues, previously unreleased live recordings, unique box sets and eclectic compilations on offer for each RSD drop, even the most fervent vinyl fiends are likely to be overwhelmed. So we reached out to a handful of local record store owners to find out what they’re rolling out and what they’re excited about. 875 Stockton St | Riverside | MAP Specialty: Punk, metal, new and used rarities, pop, indie Instagram: Tigerrecs Picks by James Siboni, owner/operator Agnostic Front – Victim In Pain AF was one of the first punk bands I ever heard. These guys started my a 20-plus-year obsession with the genre. This is a reissue of their classic, debut LP. Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers – At The Jazz Workshop 1970 Art is one of the greatest jazz drummers to ever live and his records are some of my favorites. This is a live session that is previously unreleased, made during a great time in his career. Death – Fate: The Best Of Death Death were the greatest death-metal band (so much so, the entire genre is named after them). Their first four LPs were their best work. This record is a greatest hits from those first four. So, it’s literally the best or the best in my opinion. It’s also worth mentioning that Death was from Florida, which makes them even cooler. (London) Suede – Suede Demos Of all the great British rock bands in history, Suede is pretty close to the top of my list of favorites. This release is demo versions of their first record. I’ve never heard it before and I can’t wait to put this record on and catch of glimpse of what these songs sounded like before they reached their final form. 1026 Edgewood Ave | Murray Hill | MAP Specialty: Eclectic, indie, rarities, books Instagram: Eraserrecordsjax Unfortunately, this will be Eraser Records last ever RSD. Multi-talented owners Matthew Anderson and Lauren Hamilton will not be renewing their lease when it expires later this year.

Though the store boasts 5,000 sq. ft. of records, CDs, cassettes, books and miscellaneous music ephemera (posters, flyers, tees, buttons, etc.), a few seemingly arbitrary RSD rules have kept Wolfson from (officially) participating in the event (something about not having windows). No bother, owner Ron Johnston says his store still draws an RSD crowd, simply by sticking to the store’s modus operandi; putting out hundreds, if not thousands of new arrivals each week. Of particular note, Johnston says his recent acquisitions include some eclectic collections––‘80s mopecore like the Smiths and The Cult on vinyl, a vast assortment of classic and rare soul albums on CD. A good bet on any given day, Wolfson is a must-see on RSD. 1522 Hendricks Ave | San Marco | Map Formerly a weekend pop-up at the Beach Blvd. Flea Market, Yesterday and Today has a good selection of used rock, pop, soul and jazz records. They get new inventory pretty consistently and they have been the region’s longest-running participant of Record Store Day. 2999 Edison Ave | Westside | Map Operating out of the same space, at the corner of Edison and McDuff, since the late 1960s, DJ’s is easily the oldest active record shop in Northeast Florida, if not the whole state. Most of their stock is older than most of our readers, and some of it could be considered downright obsolete.
