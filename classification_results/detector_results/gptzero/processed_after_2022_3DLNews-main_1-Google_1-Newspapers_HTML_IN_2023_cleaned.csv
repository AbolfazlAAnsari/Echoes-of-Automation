Chance of rain 90%. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:50 pm Reporter Elkhart County Courthouse GOSHEN — A man accused in the shooting deaths at Galley Sports Pub, 3147 Northview Dr., Elkhart, had an initial hearing Thursday. According to a probable cause affidavit, officers responded to numerous calls Dec. 14 for a shooting at the bar, where they found Michael Pike dead for injuries, and Jalen Young gravely injured, both from gunshot wounds. Young was later pronounced dead at the hospital. Officers were told that Christian Z. Wall, 22, was the shooter. He was located sitting in a gray Ford Fusion in the parking lot a few feet from where the two men had been lying. A man who arrived at the bar with Young told police that when the bar closed, he and Young were in the parking lot when an argument and then fist fight ensued between Young and Wall. The fist fight was broken up by bystanders and immediately following, the witness, Young, and a woman attempted to leave in a vehicle but another argument began and Young exited the vehicle and was shot in the head. He and the woman fled the scene and he heard a second flash of a handgun. A bartender told police that he was advised of a fight breaking out in the parking lot where a gun had been displayed and recognized the shooter as Wall. From the window, the bartender told police that Pike appeared to have been trying to break up a fight between Young and Wall and was “executed” by Wall. Police also reviewed security footage, and found a Glock 9mm handgun under the front passenger seat and two 9mm casings spent in the parking lot. Wall denied having shot anyone, but recalled “chaos,” and having his Glock 99mm handgun in the center console of the vehicle where he said it remained all night. He said he did not remember fighting or shooting anyone. Wall indicated that he had plans to hire his own attorney. His jury trial is scheduled for Sept. 23. An Elkhart woman was sentenced to a total of 12 years for her role in a Nov. 18, 2022 death during Thursday’s court proceedings. “There’s no amount of apologies I could give to show how terrible of a situation this is and how this should not have happened, but I take full responsibility for this,” Koral L. Jordan said. Jordan was arrested following a crash that resulted in the death of Robert Spann. The charge spawns from a crash that occurred where a blue Chevrolet, driven by Jordan, crossed the center line while heading east on U.S. 20 and struck a red Nissan head, driven by Spann, according to police reports. Spann was pronounced dead at the scene. According to a probable cause affidavit, Jordan’s Chevrolet contained several liquor containers, marijuana, and a marijuana grinder. Jordan was taken to the hospital for treatment and a blood sample was taken resulting in a blood alcohol content of 0.259.’’ “She’s a good kid, she really is,” Jordan’s father Larry Jordan. “She messed up and she knew she messed up.” “I understand people make mistakes but to be so selfish, knowing you were intoxicated and get behind the wheel instead of calling someone is something that I cannot fathom,” Spann’s daughter Tamarra Spann. “Koral, I want you to know that your selfish decision of drinking and driving caused my family a lifetime of pain and hurt. Her aunt, Tinesha Spann, also spoke about the death of her brother as did Chief Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Joel Williams. “These cases are always very difficult and it is not the State’s position and I don’t see this as defendants in these cases being monsters, but the actions that they take have enormous consequences,” Williams said. Williams said, however, that being three times over the legal limit, and driving for seven miles the wrong direction on the bypass before hitting Spann’s vehicle head-on, at minimum, Jordan’s license should be suspended for the maximum. Elkhart County Judge Michael Christofeno said that based on Jordan’s presentence investigation report, the incident was “out of character” for her. “I agree with you, some acts that we commit are so bad that there’s nothing we can say to make them right,” he said. Jordan’s sentence will be 8 years at the Indiana Department of Corrections, three years on reporting probation, and one year at Elkhart County Community Correction with a recommendation of Home Detention with alcohol monitoring. Her driving privileges were also suspended for 8 years. Matthew Thompson, 36, met in Elkhart County Circuit court on Thursday for an appointment of doctors for competency evaluations for his upcoming murder trial for the death of his wife 27-year-old Ciarra Thompson Aug. 18. Police were called to 1426 Cone St., Elkhart, at 7:16 p.m. Aug. 19, for a report that Thompson’s wife was unconscious, not breathing, and bloodied. According to court documents, Thompson reported that he’d found Ciarra on the kitchen floor and she would not wake up. Ciarra was already deceased when officers arrived on scene, and Elkhart County Homicide Unit was called in. In the charging affidavit, officers stated they found blood throughout the living room and kitchen of the home, with a large amount saturating the living room couch, and noted that some of it had been cleaned up. Detectives also noted that Ciarra had open wounds on her head and neck. Speaking to detectives, Thompson admitted that he’d cleaned up some of the blood, but initially denied causing harm to Ciarra, the affidavit reads. He did eventually admit, according to investigators, that on Friday, Aug. 18, he’d punched Ciarra numerous times on her head and shook her. After his last punch, the affidavit reads, Ciarra struck her head on the kitchen counter before falling down on the kitchen floor. Thompson told police that Ciarra had been in the same place she’d fallen when he called police. Thompson was arrested by Elkhart City Police and booked into the Elkhart County Jail Aug. 20. The trial is currently set for May 6, 2024. A woman pleaded guilty Thursday for a crash that resulted in the death of her son. Krista F. Partlow, 35, Millersburg, pleaded guilty to causing death while operating a motor vehicle, with a schedule one or two drug in her system, in connection with a crash occurred at C.R. 42 and Ind. 19 Dec. 20, 2021 between a white Subaru Forester and a semi. The Subaru had gotten caught under the trailer of the truck. The driver of the white Subaru, identified as Krista F. Partlow, 35, Millersburg, and her son Noah A. Murray, 10, were taken to the hospital for treatment, but her passenger was later pronounced dead. Semi driver Will Conning, 21, told police that he’d been traveling north on Ind. 19 approaching C.R. 42 when he saw the Subaru out of the corner of his eye on C.R. 42, which witnesses say did not stop at the intersection, crashing into the semi. Partlow’s chemical test found Delta-9 THC in her blood. She was charged with causing death when operating a motor vehicle. During her plea hearing, Partlow disclosed that she was a delivery driver and performing job-related tasks when the crash occurred. Sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 15. A man accused of cashing fake checks was sentenced to 18 months on probation in Elkhart County Superior Court 3 Thursday. Jerome M. Fortune, 48, is charged with Counterfeiting after it’s alleged that he attempted to cash a fake check at Interra Credit Union Sept. 16, 2022. According to a probable cause affidavit, the check, with payee S&H Leasing, was $3,338.16 and dated for Sept. 9. Fortune also attempted to cash another check from the same payee for $2,807.20 and was successful cashing that one. He took $50 of the funds and placed the rest in an envelope, he said for his wife. It was later discovered that S&H Leasing was one of several area businesses that had outgoing mail stolen from mailboxes in September, and that people were being recruited homeless or semi-homeless individuals to cash checks in return for $50 of the cashed money, the probable cause affidavit said. A man accused in a string of thefts in Goshen was sentenced by plea bargain in Superior Court 3 on Thursday. Michael A. Hubbard, 23, is charged with two counts of theft, one a Level 6 Felony; and one count of auto theft, also a Level 6 Felony. A probable cause affidavit indicates that one victim, located in the 500 block of S. 14th Street, reported to police Aug. 8, the theft of an iPad, iPhone, and GPS phone, and that the iPad had been used to purchase a Playstation and TV'}]"

During this term, the Court will rule on many key issues, including cases regarding gun restrictions, gerrymandering and public officials’ social media usage. United States v. Rahimi In the case of United States v. Rahimi, the Court will rule on whether a federal law prohibiting the possession of firearms by persons subject to domestic violence restraining orders violates the Second Amendment. IU O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs Professor Paul Helmke, who is also the former CEO of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said this case comes after the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen decision in 2022, which established a new test that looks at whether gun restrictions have a historical analog. Historical analog in this context means the courts must look at the historical record, referring to the Bill of Rights to see if there have ever been any regulations like the one in question. CJ Heugel, J.D. Candidate at IU Mauer School of Law, said there is not going to be historical analog in this case, as domestic violence was not mentioned in the Bill of Rights. In this case, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals deemed the law unconstitutional, as it failed to show an established and representative analog, according to SCOTUSblog. “The Supreme Court needs to clarify what they meant by historical analog,” Helmke said. A clarification on this test is important for future legislation regarding gun restrictions. Huegel said the decision will be particularly important because obtaining a restraining order is often the faster and less traumatizing way for domestic violence survivors to deal with their abusers. Those who obtain a domestic violence restraining order often do so to protect themselves without having to pursue criminal charges. “Pursuing a conviction is extremely difficult, and the people who have experienced this violence do not want to go up on the stand and relive it,” Heugel said. This case will not only impact survivors of domestic abuse and those with domestic violence restraining orders, as this case has the potential to open up a large number of questions about current gun statutes due to the precedents it could set. Alexander v. South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP Alexander v. South Carolina State Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, another case to be decided in the new term, deals with gerrymandering and elections. In 2021, the South Carolina legislature adopted a new map for the state’s seven seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. In this new map, it moved nearly two-thirds of the Black voters in Charleston County out of District 1, which is currently represented by Republican Nancy Mace, into District 6, represented by Democrat Jim Clyburn. In 2018, District 1’s seat was won by Democrat Joe Cunningham. Partisan gerrymandering is the practice of dividing a geographic area into electoral districts that gives one political party an unfair advantage, according to the Legal Information Institute. According to the annotated version of the Constitution, the Court has determined successful claims of racial gerrymandering require plaintiffs to prove racial considerations were the dominant and controlling factor in creating the districts. Gerrymandering based on racial makeup violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, according to the LII.. Section 2 of the VRA prohibits drawing legislative districts in ways that improperly dilute minorities’ voting power. In the case, the Court will decide if the South Carolina Congressional District One’s redrawing was unconstitutional. In Rucho v. Common Cause, a 5-4 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that federal courts have no authority to decide cases claiming political gerrymandering of legislative districts in states violate the Constitution, according to AP News. In Jan. 2023, a three-judge federal district court ruled that District 1 violated the Constitution in its redrawing because it was the product of racial gerrymandering. Helmke said he hopes this case will address what happens when gerrymandering is both partisan and racial. “It could have a major impact on the future elections,” said Helmke. Depending on the ruling, South Carolina might have to redraw their legislative districts for the 2024 election. The ruling also has the potential to affect how other states divide their legislative districts. Lindke v. Freed A third case to be decided this term is Lindke v. Freed, which deals with public official’s social media activity constituting state action. In Lindke v. Freed, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit ruled that Freed, the city manager, did not act on behalf of the government when he blocked a city resident who criticized him, according to SCOTUSblog. Helmke said social media is a whole new area for the law, so it makes it tricky to figure out what the Court is going to do. This case asks the Supreme Court to determine when and if a politician may block someone from engaging with their social media, according to LII. This case is one of two cases this term that will decide on public officials’ social media usage, the other being O’Connor-Ratcliff v. Garnier. The Court’s decision could define the scope of politicians’ responsibilities on social media, as the use of personal social media for political activity has risen in popularity, according to LLI.

The insight they engendered was one of American decay as Nazified students, supposedly among our best and brightest, getting away with forming mobs while screaming about all Jews and expressing morally abhorrent, mindless hatred toward Israel for the crime of defending itself against Hamas, the terrorist ruler of Gaza. The dreaded sickness of antisemitism, which has been plaguing an innocent, wondrously exceptional minority throughout much of known history, is suddenly in our face in full force in America, where it seemed some time back to have begun dwindling to something less and less frightening. Its endurance in the Middle East, however, couldn’t have been more certain given a dramatic outburst by Hamas fanatics. They invaded Israel and killed babies. They tortured parents to death as children watched. Merrily laughing, they stripped clothes from women before subjecting them to repeated rape. These particular Israeli victims were then left painless through murder. The death toll in the bloody performance was something like 1,200 Israelis as dozens more and some Americans were taken away as hostages. With guidance from the big-daddy nation of Iran, and despite Israel affording so many Gaza residents chances of work in Israel while donating money to the country, Hamas was starting a war no doubt foreseen as Israel’s demise as other Iranian proxies cheerfully aided the effort. Iran could direct the show thanks to President Barack Obama and then-President Joe Biden relieving the profiting, dictatorial regime of sanctions meant to prevent nuclear capabilities. Israel, in its thoroughly justified military response to the massacre, has been accused of mercilessly killing Palestinian civilians when in fact Hamas is killing them through often keeping them around when Israel affords cease-fire moments for their escape. Hamas leaders are Hitler reinvented with the readily voiced objective of killing all Israeli Jews no matter what it takes. This is a repeat of unending persecution through 2,000 and more years, including the past century. Jews also faced military resistance as they aimed for safety in reestablishing the Israel of ancient times and getting international approval after the German Holocaust. Although most Americans object, tormenting Jews is not limited to Israel but has become disgustingly alive throughout too much of our country and is hardly scarce in certain universities and colleges less than elite. Not a few of these schools dismiss America as founded by the greedy rich as they themselves burden students with tuition beyond imagination. They worship identity politics, believe virtually all white people are inescapably oppressors, insist diversity is more important than merit and have converted education into indoctrination. The schools teach students not to tread on leftist ideology and they shut up challenges, as in a Harvard biology lecturer being harassed into departure for saying there are just two sexes, men and women. Harvard’s governing board didn’t like what Gay said and she apologized, keeping her job while praised for her excellence. The president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was likewise praised along with some criticism. The president of Penn resigned in the midst of verbal putdowns. Some donors have said so long to Harvard even as it remains super-rich. Not a few have commented on its limiting the number of highly capable Asian students and the practice of handing out A’s to virtually all students in all classes, likely causing some to apply themselves less. Fewer and fewer are likely to give Harvard an A. Jay Ambrose is an op-ed columnist for Tribune News Service. Readers may email him at [email protected]. Send comments to [email protected].

Hundreds of swimmers gathered at the shore of Hamilton Lake Tuesday, New Year’s Eve, in front of a large rectangular hole in the ice to showcase their bravery, gusto or lack of sense at the Jack D. Gibson Memorial Polar Bear Dip. It wasn’t just a cold winter afternoon. The frigid air howled, then bit — hard. The water, officials said, was a balmy 36 degrees. Still, when 2 o’clock rolled around, and Troy Gibson and his family moseyed into the ice bath, waves of crazed people followed, dressed in get-ups ranging from a Santa Claus outfit to Vikings. Some lingered in the water. One fellow floated on a chair with an umbrella. Most sped out more quickly than they entered, fleeing for the warmth of awaiting towels and dry clothing. The Pinkley family has made the plunge a New Year’s Eve tradition. Scott, his 15-year-old daughter, Sarah, and 12-year-old son, Kevin, have cast away consequences and lunged into the frosty lake for seven years as a family. It hasn’t gotten easier with time. “It was warmer than out here,” Sarah Pinkley said about the water. “My legs just went numb when I came out.” Scott Pinkley said Tuesday was one of the coldest plunges he can remember, though he admitted the temperature really doesn’t change the outcome. Cold is cold. “It doesn’t really make a difference, whether it’s 15 degrees or 35 degrees. It feels the same,” said Scott Pinkley. Judy Bireley, a veteran polar dipper of 19 years, said this year was especially cold. The bone-chilling air “felt like pins and needles, my hands are freezing,” she said, her frozen shorts cracking as she moved around to keep warm. Bireley’s companion, though, wasn’t fazed. Sandy, Bireley’s yellow Labrador retriever, clothed in – appropriately – a polar bear cover-up, only tapped her paws in the water and decided enough was enough. “She just won’t get in that water,” said Bireley. Who can blame her? Hamilton’s annual polar plunge began in the 1980s, but today is named in honor of 18-year veteran Jack Gibson, a former Garrett and Hamilton educator and administrator who passed in 2011. Jack and his son, Troy, participated annually and now Troy and his two children lead the wave of people into the lake. Even Troy Gibson was impressed by the cold this year. “It was quite a bit colder,” Troy Gibson said. “They said the water was 36, but it’s the wind. It’s cold. But it was a great turnout. I’m excited about the turnout with the weather.” The event supports the Hamilton Lions Club scholarship fund that benefits Garrett and Hamilton schools in Jack Gibson’s name. Participants pay a nominal fee to leap into the chilly waters, and observers can donate for a button.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:50 pm BATESVILLE – An Ohio man lost his life Tuesday following a crash on I-74 just west of Batesville. According to a news release from the Indiana State Police-Versailles Post, at approximately 4 a.m. Oct. 31 the Franklin County Sheriff’s Department and Batesville Police Department responded to the crash near the 147-mile marker in rural Franklin County. Initial first-responders located a tractor-trailer that had collided with a bridge support. The driver of the semi was entrapped in the vehicle and was later pronounced deceased by the Franklin County Coroner’s Office. Indiana State Police Crash Reconstructionists were called to the scene to investigate the crash. The initial investigation indicated a 2017 Peterbilt tractor pulling a trailer, driven by Osei K. Boateng, 55, Grove City, Ohio, was westbound on I-74. For an unknown reason, Boateng’s vehicle left the left side of the road, entering the median. The vehicle then collided with the yellow barricades protecting the Huntersville Road overpass. Boateng’s vehicle then smashed through the yellow barrels and collided with the concrete bridge support. The trailer’s load spilled into the median and onto the westbound lanes of I-74. The westbound lanes were closed for nearly seven hours for crash investigation and cleanup. The investigation is ongoing. The Indiana State Police was assisted by the Franklin County Sheriff’s Department, Batesville Police Department, Batesville Fire Department and Franklin County Coroners Office.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 6:04 pm During a visit to Miracle on 7th Street Sunday, one of the first stops for 6-year-old Elizabeth Arbuckle had to be a visit with Santa. Santa and Mrs. Claus (alias Don and Brenda Toney) greeted children and families from the warmth of the Terre Haute Convention Center, which hosted the vendor’s market for the first time this year. Bristol and Lennox Jones pose Sunday with Santa Claus at Miracle on 7th Street. “She’s been talking about Santa the whole time here,” said Kathy Deem, Elizabeth’s grandmother. Deem and her husband recently moved to Terre Haute for her husband’s job and it was their first time to Miracle. “I love that it’s indoors. Had it been outside, I would have been more reluctant to come,” Deem said. “It’s a nice set up and easy to browse.” Miracle had some significant changes this year, but by all accounts, it was a success, from huge crowds Saturday night at the Light Your Way Parade to the well-attended vendors event at the convention center. In prior years, Miracle’s vendor event was in outdoor tents on Friday night and Saturday, concluding with the parade Saturday night. This year, Miracle started with the parade Saturday night and the vendor event was Sunday. “It is going incredibly well,” Laken Richardson, a Miracle steering committee member, said early Sunday afternoon. The vendor event went from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. “We’ve had such incredible feedback from the vendors and shoppers. They’re really loving the indoor experience,” she said. People liked the convenience and being inside and out of the elements, especially on a cloudy, cold, windy day such as it was Sunday. The convention center also offered food and drinks and it had a kids’ activity room — and Santa. Outdoor activities included heated igloos, fire pits, music and food trucks. “I think for a Sunday, we had a lot more people than we ever anticipated,” Richardson said. People started coming right at 10 and it was steady all day. “It’s been a wonderful success.” In the children’s activity room, Miracle volunteer Gretchen Kraut helped oversee holiday crafts in which kids could make ornaments, picture holders and other items. Members of Indiana State University’s Spirit Squad and St. Patrick’s School cheer team assisted. At one of the tables, Clint Freet sat with 4-year-old son, Wyatt, who was busy making a colorful Christmas tree ornament. “I’m drawing … a rainbow Christmas decoration,” Wyatt explained. Freet said he’s been to other Miracle events the past few years. “Love the weather inside” this year, he said. “No wind chill. Love the drink options. It’s really a blessing to have the convention center in our community to be able to do something like this.” He purchased a hand-made pen and customized case from vendor Erick Schatz. Also in the kids’ room was Amanda Higginbotham, who came with several family members. “We do like it indoors. It’s warmer,” she said. Whether indoor or outdoor, she enjoys the annual Miracle celebration. “But it is nice to be warm,” said her mom, Jackie Thornton,who liked the setup in the convention center. Higginbotham’s daughter, Reagan, age 10, who was making an ornament, said of Miracle, “I like how there’s activities and fun stuff to do.” Vendor Jessica Fields, owner of Campbell Creek, said, “Traffic has been really good. I think we’re doing just as well if not better than what we would do outside.” She liked the setup inside the convention center. In outdoor tents, “The crowds were so big, you couldn’t really enjoy anything because you had to keep the traffic flowing,” she said. “Here you have plenty of room. You can stop and look. You don’t feel that pressure to keep moving.” Fields was doubtful about the change at first, but she’s been won over. “I’m definitely in favor of this,” she said. Outside, Bree Morton sat on a bale of straw beside a toasty fire pit and waited for companions who shopped inside. Morton was nostalgic for past Miracles on 7th Street, “but it’s also nice to be warm … I guess I’m torn.” Meanwhile, Frederik Schroder was among a group that occupied one of the outdoor, heated, igloos. A native of Germany, he also had purchased some items in the vendor’s market for family back home. He is a manufacturing engineering manager for Thyssenkrupp Presta. Other activities also took place in conjunction with Miracle. Admission to the Terre Haute Children’s Museum was just $3, and Swope Art Museum offered holiday card making.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:12 pm CHICAGO — Sophee Langerman was on her way to a bicycle safety rally in Chicago’s Lakeview neighborhood in June when a car turning right rolled through a red light and slammed into her bike, which she was walking off the curb and into the crosswalk. The car was moving slowly enough that Langerman escaped serious injury, but the bicycle required extensive repairs. To Langerman, it’s another argument for ending a practice that almost all U.S. cities have embraced for decades: the legal prerogative for a driver to turn right after stopping at a red light. A dramatic rise in accidents killing or injuring pedestrians and bicyclists has led to a myriad of policy and infrastructure changes, but moves to ban right on red have drawn some of the most intense sentiments on both sides. Washington, D.C.’s City Council last year approved a right-on-red ban that takes effect in 2025. New Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson’s transition plan called for “restricting right turns on red,” but his administration hasn’t provided specifics. The college town of Ann Arbor, Michigan, now prohibits right turns at red lights in the downtown area. San Francisco leaders recently voted to urge their transportation agency to ban right on red across the city, and other major cities such as Los Angeles, Seattle and Denver have looked into bans as well. “Drivers should not have the option to decide for themselves when they think it’s safe,” said Langerman, 26. “People are busy. People are distracted.” But Jay Beeber, executive director for policy at the National Motorists Association, an advocacy organization for drivers, called it a “fallacy” to assume such blanket bans would make streets safer. He cited an upcoming study by his association that analyzed California crash data from 2011-2019 and found that drivers turning right on red accounted for only about one pedestrian death and less than one bicyclist death statewide every two years. “What’s really behind this movement is part of the agenda to make driving as miserable and as difficult as possible so people don’t drive so much,” Beeber said. Safety advocates counter that official crash reports are often mislabeled, undercounting the dangers. The United States is one of few major countries that generally allow right turns on red. Concerned that cars idling at stop lights could compound an energy crisis, the U.S. government warned states in the 1970s that they could risk some federal funding should cities prohibit right on red, except in specific, clearly marked areas. Although another energy-conscious provision capping speed limits at 55 mph has long been abandoned, right on red has endured. “It’s an example of bad policy,” said Bill Schultheiss, director of engineering at Toole Design Group, which consults with public transportation agencies. “It made sense in the context of the gas crisis, but it was way oversold on what it would achieve. It’s a mandate that doesn’t consider the full consequences.” Right on red has never been allowed across most of New York City, where large signs alert Manhattan’s visitors that the practice is prohibited there. But it was the default policy practically everywhere else in the U.S. until last year’s vote in the nation’s capital. Safety advocates who pushed for the change in Washington, D.C., are bracing for blowback from drivers, particularly if the city also allows the so-called Idaho Stop in which cyclists are permitted to go through a red light after stopping to make sure the coast is clear. “There are just some battles, in terms of public opinion, where you have to be content to sacrifice that for the safety of the people,” said Jonathan Kincade, communications coordinator at the Washington Area Bicyclists Association. “It doesn’t make sense to treat cars and bikes the same. They’re not the same vehicle, and we’ve seen the outcomes of that.” Critics argue that banning right on red will not only inconvenience motorists but also slow down commuter buses and deliveries. The United Parcel Service hasn’t taken an official position on right on red but has long directed its drivers to avoid left turns whenever possible, viewing them as inefficient. Priya Sarathy Jones, deputy executive director at the Fines and Fees Justice Center, is concerned penalties from right-on-red bans will fall disproportionately on lower-income drivers who have to drive to work because they can’t afford housing near public transit. If there’s more enforcement at red lights, more cameras are certain to follow, she said. And in the Chicago area, any discussion of red light policy often conjures up memories of the region’s vilified red-light camera program, which spurred bribery charges against public officials accused of trying to influence the high-profit contracts. “It generates a lot of money for the city, instead of our decisions being driven by safety strategies backed by evidence,” she said, suggesting that road infrastructure improvements would be a much more effective way to reduce accidents. There are no recent, nationwide studies of how many people are hurt or killed by right-turning drivers. According to a national report by the Governors Highway Safety Association, more than 7,500 people walking were struck and killed by automobiles in 2022, the highest number since 1981. The spike, which included all accidents — not just those involving right turns on red, was attributed in part to an increase in larger vehicles such as SUVs and pickup trucks on the road. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that the odds a pedestrian would be killed when struck by an automobile turning right were 89% higher when the vehicle was a pickup and 63% higher when it was an SUV, due to larger blind spots and the deadlier force associated with heavier models. “These big, blunt front hoods, they knock people down and run over them, as opposed to before when people would crumple onto the hood,” said Mike McGinn, a former Seattle mayor who is the executive director of America Walks, a national nonprofit that advocates for pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods. Much of the research looking directly at the impact of right-on-red policies is years if not decades old, but both sides argue it’s still relevant. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in a 1994 report to Congress looked at four years of crash data from Indiana, Maryland and Missouri and three years of data from Illinois, counting a combined 558 injury crashes and four fatalities stemming from right turns on red. Advocates of a ban point out that study came before the nation’s vehicle fleet grew much larger and more lethal. But Beeber said the National Motorists Association study of California found that even when there was an accident associated with right turns on red, at least 96% of the injuries sustained by pedestrians or cyclists were minor. “One injury or death is too many,” said Washington state Sen. John Lovick, the primary sponsor of a bill this year that would have prohibited right on red statewide near schools, parks and certain other locations. “If it were me at that intersection crossing, I would want something done.” Lovick’s bill didn’t make it out of committee, but Seattle this year made it the default policy to prohibit right on red when new traffic signals are added. Melinda Kasraie testified on behalf of Lovick’s bill at a legislative hearing, sharing her experience being struck by a car turning right on red in Seattle. She needed a total knee replacement, had to give up her 20-year job and moved to a small town in part due to her newfound fears of crossing the street. “He just needed to wait 20 more seconds and he would have had a green light, and that 20 seconds made a big impact on me,” Kasraie said.

Adams’ Expedition struck Perez’s Camry on the passenger side, causing both vehicles to enter the southwest ditch where Perez’s vehicle then struck a utility pole, and rolled over coming to a rest in the plowed field. Adams’ Expedition came to a rest in the ditch embankment on the southwest side of Co. Rd. 2900E near Perez’s vehicle. Adams and her two passengers were transported to Riverside Hospital by Riverside EMS for their injuries. At the time of the press release, Adams and her passengers were in stable condition and being treated for moderate injuries. Perez, who was the only occupant in his vehicle, was pronounced deceased on scene by the Iroquois County Coroner.

Similar to his contemporary Joseph Pulitzer, Hearst was a progenitor of the “yellow journalism” movement, which replaced traditional reporting with a heavily partisan form that had no real commitment to the truth.

Along with being publisher and CEO of The Washington Post, Ryan also currently serves as chairman of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Board of Trustees. [Related: OPINION: We have a gross misunderstanding of the degree of wealth inequality in the U.S.]\ufeff On the surface, wealthy individuals like Musk, Bezos or Murdoch buying struggling news outlets seems like a good thing. But it’s important to remember just who the ultra-wealthy ultimately want to benefit: themselves. Every decision a billionaire makes is in the interest of their own pockets — by definition, they cannot make a decision in the benefit of the broader public because their existence as a billionaire is already in detriment to it. So when the Bezos-owned Washington Post prints an opinion praising his and Musk’s ventures into outer space as a win for society-at-large, they’re ultimately only flattering the ruling class’ vanity while ignoring the real issues this sort of astronomical wealth presents. What’s important to note about “Citizen Kane” is that it’s a tragedy, not a comedy. The moral of the fable is that money cannot and will not buy happiness. In the end Kane, a man with everything but fulfillment dies alone, a single speck in his immense palace. Maybe the multibillionaire media moguls of today would be wise to heed Welles’ message.

newsletter. HOBART -- The daughter of the woman who allegedly killed her husband by repeatedly injecting him with insulin has also been charged in connection with the crime. Tammy Garcia, 42, who lived with her parents in the 300 block of North Cavendar Street in Hobart, was charged Monday with helping her mother move her father\'s body from the scene of a crime. The Class D felony is punishable by up to three years in prison and a maximum fine of $10,000, if she is found guilty of the crime. Hobart police arrested Tammy Garcia on a warrant Monday night and she was transported to the Lake County Jail. The amount of her bond was not immediately available. While Garcia said she wasn\'t aware her mother had killed her father, police said she didn\'t report the death and chose to instead help hide the body after her mother told her she couldn\'t survive without his pension checks. Garcia\'s mother, Barbara Garcia, was charged Nov. 10 with killing her husband of 43 years, Cipriano Garcia, by allegedly repeatedly injecting his body with insulin until he was dead. She remains in the Lake County Jail without bond and is expected back in court Friday for a formal appearance with her attorney Larry Rogers. After Barbara Garcia was arrested and charged, family members grew angry that Tammy Garcia remained free. Tammy Garcia was Barbara Garcia\'s biological daughter and Cipriano Garcia\'s adopted daughter. But family members said Cipriano Garcia adopted her soon after she was born. When news of the arrest hit, Tammy Garcia\'s uncle, John Miranda, said he was more at ease now. Since the incident, he said he has been moping around and unable to eat or sleep just knowing that she remained free. He said the arrest serves as justice for his brother. ""I want everything to come out fair,"" Miranda said. ""They\'re both wrong and guilty and they should pay the penalty."" In a probable cause affidavit, Tammy Garcia told police that when she arrived home on Oct. 30 her mother greeted her at the back door and said her father had died. Her mother then told her she was going to pay her bills. Soon after, Barbara Garcia told Tammy Garcia that no one could know her father died because she could not afford to live without his Social Security and pension checks. Later, Tammy Garcia told police she entered the house and saw her father\'s body in what she believed was a rug. Both she and her mother then moved the body from the living room into an outdoor garage. Tammy Garcia told police they continued to try and move the body onto a pickup truck for the next couple of days. At this point, she told police she ""was afraid of losing her mother and her mother losing the house and losing everything."" On Nov. 2, the two managed to move her father\'s body onto the pickup truck by attaching extension cords to his feet and using a car to pull the body onto the bed of the truck. Tammy Garcia was operating a separate car that pulled the body onto the truck. After the body was placed on the truck, Tammy Garcia told police that she told her mother she ""didn\'t want to know anymore and she didn\'t want to know anything."" Her mother allegedly drove the truck to Illinois and dumped the body in a wooded area in Bloom Township, Ill., where it was discovered the next day. Barbara Garcia told police she ""decided that she would have to kill her husband"" because he was about to discover she had withdrawn $4,000 from savings to cover gambling losses, according to the probable cause affidavit. In addition to the Indiana charges, the two could possibly face Illinois charges, such as concealing a homicide. Gina Czark can be reached at gczark@nwitimes.com or (219) 662-5325.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:10 pm There’s a neurotic need in the right-leaning media to declare that California is going down. The future belongs to Texas and Florida, where “woke” is a discouraging word — and climate change is somebody else’s problem, if it is a problem. California has lost population in each of the last three years, while Texas and Florida are growing fast. The “story” is that high taxes are driving the rich out of California. And it’s true that some high-profile California magnates have left for Texas and Florida, neither of which tax income. But that’s only a piece of the truth. The number of millionaires in California is actually surging as global wealth continues to flood into the Golden State, according to Bloomberg News. From 2019 through 2021, California’s population of millionaire taxpayers has grown by 116,000. The number of residents pulling in more than $50 million surged 158% to 3,182! Nonetheless, every time a company moves from California to Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott crows that his state’s lower taxes and laxer environmental laws are draining California’s economic might. Texas does regulate businesses with a light touch. Different story if you have a woman’s body. Same goes for Florida, which, like Texas, has virtually banned abortion. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has made a specialty of attacking local businesses for oddball reasons. He pushed through a law forbidding employers to require proof of vaccinations from their workers. And he reserves special punishments for Disney, his state’s largest private employer, for daring to disagree with him on gay rights. Losing population is not always a bad thing. The raps against California include the high cost of housing and brutal traffic. Fewer people means less competition for real estate and fewer cars on the road. Meanwhile, the cost of housing in Austin and Miami has shot skyward. With 39 million people, California still has 10 million more residents than does Texas, the second most populous state — not that this should matter on the individual level. What does the population race have to do with the quality of life? That’s not to say all is nifty in California. The Californians going elsewhere tend to be middle-class or poor. Many end up in next-door Arizona or Nevada. The result has been a growing and concerning disparity in wealth. California still has nice weather and, for those who care about show business, Hollywood. But its great draw is brain power supported by top universities and the tech magnet of Silicon Valley. Right-wing politics can turn off rich people more than low taxes turn them on. Dave Nixon of the Patriotic Millionaires, a group of well-to-do business leaders who advocate for “fair” taxation, moved back to California in 2022 after selling his St. Pete Beach home in Florida. San Francisco Mayor London Breed said she knows “several” people who recently returned from Austin for similar reasons. This is clearly anecdotal evidence, but one can believe that a sharp right turn in local politics could get some former Californians down.

comedy, romance, action, drama — which one do you choose to watch? Perhaps you might spend a night inhaling as many Rachel McAdams chick flicks as possible or maybe block out a weekend to revisit a nearly 20-hour long Harry Potter marathon. Many Christians like to tear apart the horror category. The genre has been on a steady incline to becoming more and more disturbing, but so have most other genres. Many of us may have just been too desensitized to realize it. Even the ideas in romance films and seemingly innocent PG-13 action movies may have more effect than we realize. Like a frog adapting to boiling water, audience members have slowly become oblivious to the themes that have infiltrated American films and modern value systems. As Christians, we need to maintain spiritual sensitivity when it comes to these films, taking care to exercise discernment but also being aware of where there can be value in watching them. 1 Corinthians 10:23 says that while all things can be “lawful,” that doesn’t make it all beneficial. Katie Kelley, assistant professor of psychology, said that watching something over and over again strengthens neurological patterns in people’s brains. As a result, repeated activities make certain thoughts more accessible in one’s brain. Whatever we are consuming regularly fills our thoughts. Spiritual discernment requires us to continuously dress our mind and, as Colossians 3:2 says, to set it on the Kingdom above and not on earthly things. Through those continued patterns, themes like divorce, infidelity, sexual immorality, violence or pride are normalized. While sin is a common part of life, blatant acceptance without convicted repentance can diminish how we perceive the weight of our sins in light of the Cross. “I struggle to understand how you can imagine the Christian life without spiritual sensitivity,” Nicholas Kerton-Johnson, lead pastor at Kingdom Life Church and associate professor of international relations, said. “It seems to me that the spirit is absolutely essential to the Christian life.” Kerton-Johnson acknowledged that beauty and creativity can flow from film. However, sometimes creative expressions can harness and glorify evil. That doesn’t mean Christians should just stop watching movies. May Young, associate professor of biblical studies and program director for biblical studies, said that God gives us the freedom to make those decisions ourselves and to discern, through Scripture, our own values. “I think it’s important that we’re in the world but not of it,” Young said. “We don’t want to cloister ourselves off (such) that we don’t even know what's happening in the world either (or to the point) that we’re so disengaged.” Many movies can still be used to provoke thought and start conversations about our faith and values. They can be a bridge and tool made redeemable for the Kingdom. What it boils down to is how Christians prioritize God, Young said. If someone is using more of his or her time to consume movies than to spend time with the Lord, maybe it’s time to re-evaluate. Constantly putting God first means a consistent renewal of the mind and, in turn, a more in-tuned discernment of the Spirit. Not every Christian is on the same page in that discernment. It is important to remember that we can make choices within the freedom of Christ. We shouldn’t impose our walk onto everybody else’s. In our own walks, we should make ourselves more sensitive to the films we consume, whatever that may look like for each of us. And yet, that sensitivity doesn’t necessarily mean fully closing ourselves off to a tool that can still be redeemable.""}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:50 pm Mayor Gina Leichty, left, shakes hands with outgoing Mayor Jeremy Stutsman during the Oath of Office Ceremony at the Goshen City Courts Building Friday June 16. The new year is upon us. It is time to take a moment and remember the top issues of 2023 for the Goshen area. It was a busy year! Mayor Gina Leichty, left, is sworn into office by outgoing Mayor Jeremy Stutsman during the oath of office ceremony June 16. On June 16, Gina Leichty was sworn in as Goshen’s first female mayor following a Democratic caucus, which is where precinct committee members of one party are the sole voters. She replaced Mayor Jeremy Stutsman, who resigned March 22 to take the role of CEO of Lacasa Inc. Leichty, a Democrat, then went on to win the General Election Nov. 7, beating Republican contender Ben Rogers. Rogers himself was a replacement for the Republican candidate Bill Malone, who resigned due to work conflicts. Goshen Community Schools Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction Tracey Noe talks about Critical Race Theory and Social-Emotional Learning with Accuracy in Media representatives who posed as a couple looking to enroll their children at Goshen Schools. Goshen, Fairfield and Elkhart administrators were the targets of an undercover video operation by Accuracy in Media to get them to openly talk about CRT, Critical Race Theory, and if it is taught in their schools. Goshen Schools’s then-superintendent Steve Hope issued an apology in June about the misrepresentation of comments made by Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction Tracey Noe in the video. Former mayor and school board member Allan Kauffman swears in under oath during the Elkhart County Election Board meeting at the Elkhart County Administration Building in Goshen Tuesday, Jan. 17, 2023. At the beginning of 2023, the Elkhart County Election Board named several people who they said had violated election laws, including Goshen school board member Allan Kauffman, who was campaign manager for one of the people running for school board, Jose Elizalde. Most of the violations stemmed from a mailer that went to residents connecting certain candidates to the conservative group Purple for Parents. Penalties to nearly 40 people were issued. The charges stemmed from the presumed cost of the mail, which was sent Oct. 29, at a cost of $11,770. Kauffman faced the brunt of the charges with the Election Board turning his case over to the Elkhart County Prosecutor. Nothing has been announced by the prosecutor concerning any formal charges against Kauffman. Karen Mackowiac, Goshen, places her recycling into the new recycling center on Indiana Avenue near the Oakridge Cemetery in Goshen Tuesday, April 4. Goshen opened a recycling center on Indiana Avenue between the railroad tracks and Wilden Avenue after the county shut down its sites countywide. Nappanee is beginning curbside recycling in January and will no longer have a public site. Goshen’s new site continues to have issues with people leaving trash at the site, one of the reasons the county opted to close its centers. Fairfield head coach Brodie Garber, from left, senior Brea Garber, assistant coach Amy Garber and a representative from the IHSAA take a picture after Brea was named the Mental Attitude Award winner after the Class 3A state championship game Feb. 25 at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.

The Bethany girls basketball team also placed runner up in state. For more information on this and the top 10 sports articles of 2023, go to B1. Elkhart Community Schools bus helper applicant Janet Tidwell, Elkhart, fills out her application during the Elkhart Community Schools Career Fair for teachers and support staff at the Elkhart Area Career in Elkhart Jan. 31. In February, Elkhart Schools hosted a job fair for teachers. The problem of not having enough educators and other support staff chronically plagued local schools. Goshen teachers received a pay bump in November. Goshen’s teachers union agreed to a starting salary of $45,100, an increase of 4.5% from last year or about $2,000 more than last year. Assistant Superintendent Alan Metcalfe said he hopes a few other additions will be a recruiting tool, including maternity, paternity, surrogate, and adoption paid five days leave, something Metcalfe said only a few other districts in the area offer. The new court complex being added near Reliance Road in Goshen is pictured in this Jan. 18 file photo. Construction of the new Elkhart County Courthouse at Elkhart and Reliance roads and the C.R. 17 overpass has been a sight to behold in 2023. The 173,000-square-foot building will house all of Elkhart County’s courts and will cost about $94 million. The building is expected to be completed in June 2024. Laurel Jean Mitchell This cold case out of North Webster had Fred Bandy Jr., 67, Goshen, and John Wayne Lehman, 67, Auburn, charged with the 1975 murder of 17-year-old Laurel Mitchell on Feb. 6. Mitchell’s parents, Richard and Wilma, reported her missing Aug. 7, 1975. Mitchell’s body was found later that day in the Elkhart River at Mallard Roost, a public access site on C.R. 600 North. DNA and witnesses to their reported confessions linked the men to the murder, according to Indiana State Police. A plot of land for the proposed Cherry Creek Development is shown near the intersection of Waterford Mills Parkway and Regent Street in Goshen Tuesday, June 27. Cherry Creek in Goshen and Wellfield Subdivision in Nappanee got the necessary approvals they needed to begin construction of homes and more. Cherry Creek is a two-phase mixed-use development project on the south side of Goshen, near Waterford Mills Parkway, encompassing about 170 acres. It will consist of condominiums, single-family housing, duplexes, businesses, greenspaces, trails and water features, plus other amenities. Construction is expected to begin this spring. Wellfield Subdivision, in the first phase, will consist of 55 homes including villas, single-family and estate home options, and upon completion there will be 125 homes. A sign reading “Trail Closed” is posted at the front of the new addition to the Pumpkinvine Nature Trail in Middlebury June 23. After working on the Pumpkinvine Nature Trail for more than 34 years, construction on the final part began in June. The trail, which follows the path of an abandoned railroad corridor with the same name, starts in Goshen and ends in Shipshewana. The final part of the Pumpkinvine is 2,900 feet long, about a half a mile. This brings the trail, a place for people to walk, bike and be in nature, to about 17 miles long.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:52 pm John Krull Mike Pence pulled the plug on his presidential campaign.The former vice president to Donald Trump and one-time Indiana governor had little choice but to leave the race for the White House. His fundraising had dried up. His standing in the polls, even in those states where he campaigned hard, remained small, even diminutive. There was a decent chance that Pence wouldn’t even have qualified for the next Republican presidential debate, a fresh humiliation to be visited on a man who had known so many of them in his political career. So, he quit. That must have been hard. He has wanted to be and worked to be president for so long — some sources say since high school, some say even before — that giving up after coming so close must have been painful. I feel for him. Even though Mike Pence and I disagree on many, many things, I always have liked the guy. I know there are people reading this who think this isn’t — or shouldn’t be — possible. They believe that disagreements about politics or public policy make it impossible for people to like or respect each other. That’s not the way it works for me. Never has been and, I hope, never will. What I have liked about Mike Pence is his courtesy. He knows that I don’t agree with him on a lot of issues — many of them big ones, several of great importance to him — but he’s never been anything other than polite and respectful in our interactions. When he raised a point of contention between us, he always did so in a way that made discussion possible. He could listen as well as talk. He also had the capacity to admire those with whom he did not agree. I remember once moderating an event in which he talked following a speech by the late former U.S. Rep. Andy Jacobs, D-Indiana. Pence devoted the opening of his own address to paying tribute to Jacobs’ character and the contributions he had made to Indiana and the United States. Pence didn’t do that because he thought he could persuade some of Jacobs’ supporters to vote for him. Pence was savvy enough to know that wouldn’t happen. He did it because he liked and admired Andy Jacobs — and wanted to say so publicly. There were times as he climbed the political ladder that Pence seemed to lose touch with that side of himself. He seemed to forget that his inherent likability was his greatest asset. Maybe that’s because the time in which he rose to power became more and more partisan. More and more bitter. More and more angry. This was particularly true on the right, which craved standard-bearers who find it easier to snarl than smile. Conservatives’ hunger for — and devotion to — happy warriors seemed to die with Ronald Reagan. That left Pence in a quandary. He is not by nature an angry man. When he tried to be, he never could sell the idea that he was seething with barely contained resentments. He never could make either friends or foes believe his rage was something to fear. Worse, his attempts to move in the conservative cauldron of constant grievance made him seem disingenuous and inauthentic in an age that attracted to screaming incompetence, so long as it was genuinely practiced. Enter Donald Trump. I doubt Pence ever realized that signing on as Trump’s running mate doomed whatever chance he had of making it to the Oval Office himself. Pence cleansed and blessed Trump’s bid with the religious right, which gave Trump the narrow margin needed to secure the presidency. In doing so, Pence traded away his own base — evangelicals now prefer the philandering former president to the devout former vice president — without gaining any footing with Trump’s followers. Worse, Pence spent four years abasing himself doing it, supplicating before a man he had to have known was neither a good president nor a good man. A guy who could recognize and appreciate, as Pence did, the integrity of Andy Jacobs also would know when that integrity wasn’t present. Now, after all the sacrifices, self-denial and self-discipline, Mike Pence’s dream has come crashing down. There are those who take glee in his failure. I’m not among them. I didn’t want him to be president, but I can’t take satisfaction from a decent guy’s disappointment. And he is a decent guy.

Specializing in the production of complex, large-scale components for various industries — including heavy equipment, power generation, and industrial machinery — the company has earned a reputation for exceptional craftsmanship and its commitment to technological innovation. The planned investments total more than $10 million. The first piece of equipment is a 12.5-ton capacity spinner/hanger blast, built by Blast Cleaning Technologies, that replaces a 47-year-old piece of equipment. In all, the company has invested a total of $4.5 million dollars in the new blast endeavor, a key piece of equipment in the processing of steel castings. “In addition to the general benefits of new equipment,” said Geoff Curtis, vice president and general manager, “the new blast has also been upsized to keep up with Harrison Steel’s ever-changing product profile.” Over the decades, Harrison Steel has continuously evolved its processes, incorporating cutting-edge technologies to ensure the highest standards of product integrity, reliability and performance. A second investment of $4 million is for a state-of-the-art Mazak 5-axis machining center installed in Harrison Steel’s 29,000 square foot machining building, which was built in 2012. This will be the sixth machine added to this area. This machine provides capabilities comparable to existing equipment, but will provide a much needed increase in capacity as Harrison Steel continues to expand their Finish Machining capabilities and offerings to customers. The final investment of $1.7 million is for a new Andromat Manipulator. This cab-driven manipulator assists in metal removal, a necessary step in the metal casting process. The three projects help Harrison Steel continue to compete and excel in a competitive global marketplace. “The global economy demands a new class of companies that has the people, systems, strategies and flexibility to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions,” Curtis said. “Harrison Steel is one of those companies, and these investments confirm our commitment to our customers.” Located in Attica since its founding in 1906, Harrison Steel Castings has built a reputation for premium precision steel castings. The company stands as a paragon of community stewardship, employee enrichment, and the determined quest for manufacturing perfection.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:49 pm A recent dispute among the four members of the government of Union Township arose at the November 14 session of the Adams County commissioners. The details of the dispute were not mentioned, but county attorney Mark Burry said that township governments operate completely independently from the county government, so the commissioners have no oversight responsibility over townships. Burry said the only agency that does have oversight of townships is Indiana's State Board of Accounts, which performs audits every year of every governmental entity in the state: cities, towns, counties, townships, school boards, etc. As he put it, county commissioners “have virtually no oversight,” since a township is “a separate political body.” Pick up Wednesday's paper for more details.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:14 pm Former Clark County Sheriff Jamey Noel, center, consults with his attorneys while looking at a document on a screen inside the Clark Circuit Court No. 1 on Nov. 9, 2023. SOUTHERN INDIANA — For good, sad and troubling reasons, Southern Indiana made state and national headlines in 2023. Here’s a look at some of the top stories for our area over the past year. On Aug. 16, Indiana State Police investigators entered the home owned by former Clark County Sheriff Jamey Noel to execute search warrants related to a public corruption case. Noel served as the county’s sheriff from 2015-2022, but his influence in the area and state extends far beyond law enforcement. As of Friday, Noel remained the chair of the Clark County Republican Party and the 9th District GOP. Noel is also the founder of New Chapel Fire/EMS, which provides services to many areas of Clark and Floyd counties. Noel’s former top assistant and current Clark County Sheriff Scottie Maples quickly announced on social media after the August search that he had alerted ISP about “potentially criminal behavior” after taking over the office in 2023. The search of Noel’s home was followed by searches of New Chapel and Utica Fire properties, setting off a wave of reaction and chatter about what, if any, criminal charges the former sheriff would face. Investigators were mostly mum about the investigation for months. On Nov. 8, the day after the municipal elections, Noel was arrested and processed in the Clark County jail. He’s facing 15 felonies and is accused of selling fire department vehicles and keeping the money along with having sheriff’s department employees work on his private property while on the county clock. But the case continues to develop. Court documents released in December show that ISP believes Noel paid former Scott County Sheriff Kenneth Hughbanks, who is also the Scott County GOP chair, $265,000 in jail commissary funds for consulting work. Additional warrants were served in December related to a personal airplane that investigators said Noel purchased with fire department money. As of Friday, Noel’s next court date is scheduled for Jan. 8, with a jury trial tentatively set for May. OLD NATIONAL BANK SHOOTING Calls for stricter gun control measures were made during an April 12, 2023, vigil honoring the victims of the mass shooting at Old National Bank in Louisville. On April 10, Floyd Central High School graduate Connor Sturgeon murdered five of his former co-workers in a mass shooting at Old National Bank in Louisville. The victims included Deana Eckert, 57, who resided in New Albany. Sturgeon, who was a star athlete at Floyd Central, was shot and killed by police responding to the scene. In November, police released reports showing that Sturgeon claimed in writings that he was depressed and carried out the mass shooting to show that gun restrictions are too lax. Two murder trials involving men shooting and killing their spouses resulted in guilty verdicts in both cases. An emotional Tony Bennett looks at family members as he addresses the media after a guilty verdict from a jury Oct. 3 in the Mac Lewis trial. In August, Cherok Douglass was found guilty in a double murder trial in Floyd County. Douglass was convicted of shooting and killing his wife, Brandee Douglass, and a bystander, Lorin Yelle, at a New Albany gas station in 2022. In October, Douglass was sentenced to 240 years in prison. That same month, Mac Lewis was convicted in Clark County of shooting and killing his wife, Elizabeth “Lizzie” Bennett Lewis. The shooting occurred inside the couple’s home in 2022 in Sellersburg. Mac Lewis was sentenced to 100 years in prison in November. River Heritage Conservancy received $37.5 million from the state for the development of an outdoor adventure center for the 430-acre Origin Park. The money, appropriated in the biennial budget in May, represents one of the largest ever single grants from the state for a Southern Indiana project. The adventure center is expected to cost about $75 million to build, and will include event space, zip lines, climbing walls and walking paths. Also in 2023, River Heritage opened a paddling launch point, Croghan Landing, on Silver Creek. The launch point marks one of the first projects to be completed for Origin Park. New Albany opened Silver Creek Landing in 2023, which also offers a kayak and paddle launch spot. The City of New Albany and River Heritage are still divided over removing a dam from Silver Creek. A state judge with the Indiana Natural Resources Commission upheld a previous decision allowing River Heritage to remove the dam for recreational reasons, but the City of New Albany countered with a lawsuit in November. Southern Indiana voters elected officials for cities and towns in 2023. New Albany Mayor Jeff Gahan speaks to supporters after winning a fourth term in the Nov. 7 municipal election. In Jeffersonville, Mayor Mike Moore ran unopposed to secure his fourth term. New Albany Mayor Jeff Gahan beat challenger Ed Clere to also secure his fourth term. In Charlestown, Mayor Treva Hodges defeated Ruthie Jackson to win her second term. There were several changes to area councils, including in Jeffersonville and Clarksville. Those elected begin their four-year terms on Jan. 1. JEFFBOAT PLANS UNVEILED A rendering shows plans for the Jeffboat property, including an amphitheater, raised walkway, plaza, overlook area and observation tower. Plans to redevelop the former Jeffboat shipyard were released in October, and if the vision comes to fruition, it would have a sizable impact on Jeffersonville’s riverfront. Plans include an entertainment district to feature an amphitheater, plaza, hotel and overlook area. A private marina is also included in the design, which entails high-quality restaurants and small retail shops. Moving forward, officials are looking to select a developer for the $930 million project, which will be developed in phases. Touted as the largest single investment in the history of the River Ridge Commerce Center, Canadian Solar Inc. announced plans in October to develop a solar cell production facility at the Clark County park. The project is estimated to be worth $800 million, and would create about 1,200 high-tech jobs. Also in October, The Cheesecake Factory Inc. announced it will open a bakery at River Ridge for manufacturing and distributing its desserts. The investment will include $74 million in land, construction and machinery, with the bakery expected to open in 2025. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles. Success!

The Kremlin is comparing Ukrainian drone attacks on Moscow\'s financial district that have caused minor damage and no deaths with the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that killed thousands in the United States. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told the Soloviev Live TV channel that, like Lower Manhattan, the Moscow City district is a civilian site hosting offices and residential buildings ""that have nothing to do with the military."" Some of the buildings targeted by the drones did include defensive ministry offices. ""The 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers caused an enormous number of casualties, but the methods were the same,"" she said. ""We are seeing the same picture now, as if it is repeating itself."" Earlier Tuesday, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said a skyscraper in central Moscow was damaged by a drone attack for the second time in 48 hours.

Simonyan, chief editor of the state-funded TV channel RT, also questioned how drones that were supposedly electronically disabled could wind up hitting the same skyscraper housing government offices on back-to-back days. That rare development ""at least requires explaining the comments that the electronic warfare downed them all,” she wrote. Sen. Lindsey Graham has issued a stern warning to Russia after a top Kremlin official said Moscow could resort to nuclear weapons if Ukraine\'s counteroffensive results in Kyiv ""taking away part of our land."" Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council and former Russian president, suggested Ukraine could take territory with the support of NATO. The White House, which has said there is no evidence Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing to use nuclear weapons, called Medvedev\'s comments irresponsible. Graham went further, posting: ""To my Russian friends who talk about using nuclear weapons in Ukraine: You need to understand that would be an attack on NATO itself, given Ukraine’s proximity to NATO territory. Time to sober up, realize that your barbaric invasion of Ukraine is not working, withdraw and save many young Russians from a pointless death."" More than half of the nuclear weapons Russia plans to deploy in Belarus have been delivered and dispersed throughout the country, Lukashenko said. Belarusians, Poles and Lithuanians, who share borders, have always lived together, but ""now our Western neighbors are going crazy,"" Lukashenko said. “God forbid they will have to use this weapon. I still hope that this will not happen,” he said. “We don’t interfere in anyone’s garden, but please don’t interfere with us either."" Putin agreed in March to begin moving some short-range, land-based tactical nuclear weapons into Belarus, which shares an almost 700-mile border with Ukraine. If verified, it is the first deployment of Russian nukes outside Russian territory since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 ""No one has ever attacked a nuclear country,"" Lukashenko said.'}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:12 pm The Federal Bureau of Investigation executed a search warrant at a home at 810 W. Noble St., Lebanon, on May 9. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has not given a reason for raiding a Lebanon home last month, but a local case stemming from the raid gives clues. The FBI told Lebanon Police they were serving a search warrant for the entire home at 810 W. Noble St. when they incidentally found illicit drugs belonging to Melinda Nix, according to a probable cause affidavit. LPD Officer Tyler Winings met with FBI agents in the home and searched Nix’s room, where he found a gram of fentanyl, alprazolam and buprenorphine, Winings reported. Nix is charged in Boone Circuit Court with possession of a narcotic drug, a felony, two misdemeanor charges of possession of a controlled substance, and one misdemeanor charge of possession of paraphernalia. She is scheduled for an initial hearing June 13. Her son, who is not named in the report, was the target of the search and was already in custody when Winings arrived, according to the affidavit. FBI agents were looking for “computer and electronic equipment as small as a microchip,” and wanted local police to handle the drug case, Winings reported. Lebanon Police declined to provide further information about the FBI raid. “I can confirm that we were there for law enforcement activity, but I can’t tell you more than that,” FBI Special Agent Spencer Brooks said at the time. He declined to say if any arrests were made, to name a suspect, or to give a reason for the FBI’s presence. FBI cases are filed in federal courts, rather than local county courts.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:52 pm Mackenzie Ray A Lebanon woman avoided jail time after a neighborhood dog poop dispute. Mackenzie Ray, 38, pointed a handgun at her neighbors after they complained that her dog left feces on their porch, according to court records. Ray called police three times in one day in August 2022. She claimed she was sitting in her car in her driveway when Chasteven Crosby screamed at her. He was upset because he believed her dog pooped on his porch next door, according to court records. Ray left the car, screamed at Crosby, went into her home at 1316 Ascot Drive, and emerged with a handgun, neighbors reportedly told authorities. Crosby and Christina Bray were on their porch when Lebanon police arrived to find Ray, gun in hand, outside, according to court records. A patrolman drew his handgun on Ray and ordered her to drop hers, which she did, according to a probable cause affidavit. Crosby had trespassed onto Ray’s property and redirected her surveillance camera, which had been pointed at his property, police reported. Her own security video and video shot by another neighbor clearly showed Ray point her gun at Crosby multiple times, according to the affidavit. She was charged with pointing a firearm, a level 6 felony. But pleaded guilty recently to disorderly conduct, a B misdemeanor, instead. Boone Circuit Court Judge Lori Schein sentenced her to six months in the Boone County Jail, but suspended the sentence in favor of probation. Crosby, whom police said smelled of alcohol, pleaded guilty earlier this year to disorderly conduct and was sentenced to six months in jail, but Schein suspended the sentence without his serving jail time or probation.

Chance of rain 30%. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:05 pm ROSELAWN — The Roselawn United Methodist Church, which sits in the original town of Roselawn, will close its doors after the Christmas Eve service Sunday after 141 years in the community. An aging congregation has left the church unable to go on despite many efforts to bring new people interested in coming to the services and programs. The deed for the lot to build a new church in the beginning of the Town of Rose Lawn, was signed in April 1882, and work was begun on building the small church using lumber from timber donated from church members’ property. Contractors and volunteers labor built the building that still stands tall. The church has a bell tower with a working bell. In the beginning, pews were made of solid oak and described by Verna Pech in 1964 in a story she wrote about growing up in the church. She wrote, “…the pews were the solid oak type, completely void of any upholstering or padding…hard as rocks, but it made it a bit more difficult to doze off in case the sermon proved to b less than soul-shaking.” She described how the church was poor and many times they had to go door to door asking for donations to pay the preacher or to buy coal to keep the church warm. In the beginning, a pot belly stove kept the church warm. A history of the church written for the church’s centennial celebration states the church had a row of hitching posts on the north side. It said it wasn’t uncommon to have eight or 10 wagons and buggies hitched there on Sunday mornings. Pastor Gaylynn Dykman, senior pastor of the church since 2017, is also the pastor of the DeMotte United Methodist Church where she would conduct the service there before going to Roselawn to hold services at 11 a.m. She said the majority of the remaining church members will move to the DeMotte church. They have been averaging about 12 people every Sunday. She said, “That’s just not sustainable.” When she began at the church, there were an average of 25 people attending, but many of the members have passed away, moved or gone to live in retirement or nursing homes. A basement was added to the church in the late 1950s with a kitchen and dining area, and a place for Sunday School. In 2006, the area between the original church building and the added area were joined by an enclosed area with a staircase going down to the basement, and an elevator, ADA approved for wheelchair use. Women still active in the church have been sorting through all the items accumulated over the church’s 141 year history, with some things being donated to resale, some saved to become part of the DeMotte church and some going to the United Methodist Church archives at DePaul University. The United Methodist Conference will sell the building and land owned by the Roselawn church. It will be stripped of all but the pulpit, alter, baptismal font and pews. The church held a formal meeting of the members to vote to close the church. With most of the members over the age of 75, maintenance and upkeep became too difficult, and with so few members, offerings weren’t enough to pay the bills.It was time. Dykman said, “DeMotte opened their hearts and arms to the Roselawn church, accepting memorabilia and giving them space.” On Wednesday, Dec. 13, a “last supper” was held in the church’s dining room with 17 in attendance. There was no cooking or cleaning up afterwards and they enjoyed the fellowship as they said goodbye to the many meals served in the room. Many of the members grew up in the church, and remember a time when they had children in Sunday School and events and meals shared there. In her story, Pech said they had all kinds of “special days,” including Children’s Day, when the children would perform for their families and church members. She recalled a time when Darrel Korth, who is still a member at the age of 104, spoke before the collection plate was passed during one of the Children’s Days. She wrote, “Darrel Korth was going to ‘speak a piece’ before they took up the collection and it went like this: ‘Whenever they pass the collection plate you’d better dig real deep; cause God don’t look at what you give, He looks at what you keep!’” The Christmas Eve service begins at 11 a.m. on Sunday, Dec. 24, and will be a traditional service with Communion and candle lighting while singing “Silent Night.” Those who attend will be invited to stay and reminisce if they wish and to say goodbye.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:53 pm Managing Editor INDIANAPOLIS — Farmers who want to represent agriculture in federal and state legislative halls should consider adding their name to this year’s Indiana Corn Growers Association (ICGA) board election ballot. The ICGA board advocates for Hoosier corn farmers at the local, state and federal levels. ICGA’s governing districts match the nine Congressional districts across the state. This year, ICGA will fill seats in Districts 3, 6 and 9. “ICGA’s mission is to represent Indiana’s corn farmers to lawmakers who make decisions that affect our business,” said ICGA President Chris Cherry, who operates a corn and soybean farm in rural Hancock County. “I share the concerns of Indiana corn farmers for our industry. ICGA offers a platform necessary to address the people and agencies who can address those concerns. This is an opportunity for interested corn growers to take an active part in helping secure a better future for Hoosier farmers.” Javascript is required for you to be able to read premium content.

An alien invasion begins to take over, stealing food and other resources and supplanting native life. But it\'s real, just instead of an extraterrestrial species, imagine a spotted lantern fly, or maybe bush honeysuckle. While they may not sound nearly as shocking or spooky, these aliens are invading our environment and taking over, pushing out native species. We\'re talking about invasive species. They take all shapes and forms: plants, animals, insects, large and small, beautiful and menacing. One thing they all have in common is that they can do serious damage. Take the Emerald Ash Borer, for example. This tiny iridescent green beetle has nearly wiped out ash trees across swaths of the country, including here in Indianapolis. We know invasive species cause problems, for this week\'s Scrub Hub, we are looking at how invasive species get here. To find the answers, we spoke with experts from the Indiana Native Plant Society as well as the State of Indiana Cooperative Invasives Management. Most simply, invasive species are those that are growing outside their natural range, according to Dawn Slack, the project coordinator for the Indiana Invasives Initiative. They can cause harm to not only the environment, but also human health and the economy. Invasive species can be introduced in a variety of ways, sometimes accidently and sometimes intentionally. Either way, it all comes back to horticulture, or the practice of garden cultivation and management. Bugs & Plants: 10 invasive species to watch out for across Indiana Many invasive plants are actually introduced into areas outside their natural range by humans, according to Slack, for various reasons including landscape uses, food production, research and more. Many of these introductions happened decades ago before conservationists started to understand the importance of native plants. Many invasive insects often come over in packing materials or hitch a ride with infected plants. That means many invasives are introduced and not discovered until they become established. By then, it\'s too late. That\'s the case with Asian Jumping Worms, for example, that are being spread across Indiana in the soil of donated plants. Once an invasive species is introduced, it can be hard to get ahead of to stop the spread. That spread can happen in a variety of ways. Humans can share plants and seeds without knowing they are a problematic species. Contaminated equipment clothing or shoes can move seeds to new places. The seeds and fruit can be blown far or carried in rivers and streams. Or wildlife may eat the seeds and fruit and then drop them out elsewhere. Bradford or Callery pear trees are a perfect example. Their beautiful spring blooms made them a popular tree for landscaping and public rights of way. Now you may see them on road-sides everywhere or near highway exit and entrance ramps. Many of those weren\'t planted, they popped up on their own. These trees are so pervasive that Carmel is now on a long-term mission to remove the controversial invasive species that can choke out native ecosystems. That\'s what happens, these invasive species take over because there are no native diseases, insects or predators to help keep them in check. In a native ecosystem, everything fits in somewhere in the chain. Invasives, however, introduce a kink into the system. Many invasive species also have longer growing or active seasons, which is becoming more of an advantage for them as climate change brings warmer temperatures. This advantage also can be a disadvantage, according to Slack. Because invasives will grow while natives are dormant, there is an opportunity to more easily identify and manage invasive species. Slack said they are making some strides in treating infestations of invasive species, but added her organization has a ""backlog of infestations to deal with and we continue to introduce plants into areas outside their native range.""

INDIANAPOLIS — Three graduates of the 84th Indiana State Police Recruit Academy have been assigned to Northeast Indiana posts. A graduation ceremony was held Dec. 21 in the Indiana State Capitol Rotunda. • Assigned to District 22 in Fort Wayne: Anthony F. Gerardot of New Haven and Ryan W. Hale of Daleville • Assigned to District 21 Toll Road (Elkhart County): Jonathan D. Maurer of LaGrange After the commencement address, the oath of office for the 28 new State Police troopers was delivered by the Honorable Justice Christopher M. Goff of the Indiana Supreme Court. Each new trooper was then presented a badge and official identification by Superintendent Douglas G. Carter and his staff. The graduation marked the culmination of 24 weeks of intense training that totaled more than 1,100 hours. Some subject areas of training included criminal and traffic law, de-escalation, emergency vehicle operations, defensive tactics, firearms, impaired driving detection, scenario-based training, and a host of other academic subjects related to modern policing.

will make his way to Indianapolis for a show at the Egyptian Room in Old National Centre. Ahead of his visit, NUVO’s Seth Johnson caught up with the stand-up comedian for an interview, discussing everything from the first time he tried comedy to his forthcoming Netflix special. Read their conversation below. SETH JOHNSON: Can you share a bit with me about your comedy backstory? What was it that initially sparked your interest in comedy? NIMESH PATEL: I graduated in 2008 with a degree in finance, and that was about the funniest thing to do at the time. So here we are. But honestly, just on a lark, I took a goofy writing class. And then, a month-and-a-half later, I forget what I saw or heard, but something just sparked. Like, “Maybe I’ll go and hit the stage.” And that was August 2009. JOHNSON: What was that first experience of doing stand-up like for you in August 2009? PATEL: It was good because otherwise I don’t think I would’ve done it again. Because the second time went poorly, but I was like, “Well, the first time was pretty good.” It was fun [the first time]. All my cousins came. I had about 15 to 20 cousins in the room, so that kind of stacked the deck. It was just an open mic, so I had a home-crowd advantage. JOHNSON: Chris Rock sought you out to be a writer for the 88th Academy Awards ceremony. Do you remember the first time you ever met Chris? What was that like? PATEL: The first time I ever met him I was at Knitting Factory, where Hannibal Buress used to run a show. I was standing right next him, and was like, “Oh my god…” Then, he went up and crushed. He said hi, but we didn’t know each other. He saw me years later at a show I used to run. He came up to me afterwards and was like, “You’re really funny.” And I was like, “You’re Chris Rock…” [laughs] That was it. And then, a few months later, I got an email saying he wanted me to work on the team. JOHNSON: You were also a writer on Saturday Night Live for a season. What were some of your biggest takeaways from that experience? PATEL: Don’t be afraid to fail and also just be funny. [laughs] Because you just gotta be really funny, and it’s really hard to be really funny. JOHNSON: What was the pandemic like for you, especially since you were just starting to gain some traction as a stand-up around that time? PATEL: If I look back at those times, I was probably both stressed and optimistic. Stressed because I had nothing going on, and optimistic because I was really hopeful something would happen. Otherwise, I don’t know how sustainable existence was at the time. I just put a lot of my stuff out there during that time, from YouTube to Instagram to TikTok. Luckily, one of them caught on TikTok, and here we are doing the Egyptian Room. JOHNSON: You released your latest special, Lucky Lefty, earlier this year, which focuses on your experience with testicular cancer. Being that it was such a personal saga, I’d be curious to hear more about the evolution of that special. When did you first start working out that story on stage, and how long did it take to perfect? PATEL: I started on it immediately. Like, the morning I got back from the E.R. I started taking notes and making sure that I cataloged all that was going on — only because I was desperate for material and knew that God had given me some. [laughs] I was maybe on stage a week later post-surgery, and then it probably turned into [being] 40 minutes a month later. It just flowed out. Part of me wanted to just put it out as this raw thing, but a friend of mine who ended up directing it convinced me that it was a story worth building and figuring out the kinks. So it evolved quite a bit from February until when I shot it in March of the following year, but the core of it was there. It just took me a second to break open the fact that I don’t learn a lesson at all. JOHNSON: You’ll be featured in an upcoming series from Netflix called Verified Stand-Up that premieres later this month. What all can you share with me about that? PATEL: It’s all jokes I did that they rejected five years ago [laughs], so it’s the greatest hits. It’s just some stuff that I think fans will recognize and new fans will go, “Oh shit.” It’s a lot of jokes that put me where I’m at right now, and I hope to get to that wider Netflix audience with them. JOHNSON: In your latest special, you mention a few basketball players. Being the basketball nerd that I am, I had to ask — how big of a basketball fan are you? Are there things you’re looking forward to with this current NBA season? PATEL: I am a basketball fan. It’s the only sport I grew up playing because I’m a lanky Indian kid so all the other ones weren’t really for me. I’m really excited about Wemby, but I mean, who isn’t. I’m a Lakers fan because I was a Kobe fan. I’m also a LeBron fan, but their season is starting out as a Lakers season does. [laughs] So we’ll see how it goes.

forgotten Hoosiers of all?”So, if those altered lyrics captured your interest, listen to the game-show music in your head, and put yourself in a Final Jeopardy mode. Can you guess the forgotten soul? Johnny Appleseed for $500. Jim Davis for $1,000. Jane Pauley for the same. No, no, no. It must be Florence Henderson for the works.Sorry, Virginia, Florence Henderson from Dale was geographically so close, but you’re broke. Dale is six miles away from Santa Claus, Indiana, and an unsung Hoosier legend, Jim Yellig. Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus, and for 54 years Mr. Yellig paid homage to those red threads at his local post office and in his community.Santa performers around the world know his origin. Yellig was in the navy in 1914. The crew of his ship decided to help some underprivileged children in Brooklyn that Christmas and needed a St. Nick. Jim was selected because Santa Claus was his hometown. He definitely displayed the right stuff and was destined to have more flight-time tales than Gus Grissom.In 1946 Santa Claus Land opened, and Santa Jim who had been back home again in Indiana since the 1930’s reprised his role at the Candy Castle. Indiana boasted the nation’s first theme park and a “right jolly old elf” who would greet more children than any other Santa ever. He was photogenic, loving, and welcoming when my siblings and I posed with him. Additionally, he was a man on a mission. Spreading joy and happiness was his measure of success.Joy, happiness, and a dash of hope are great ingredients for our wake-up brew. I can almost see the steamy mist rising from my mug. That is, my imagination can conjure up the image, but the vision disappears with advent of the morning broadcast. At that point, I’m recollecting Anne Murray’s “We sure could use a little good news today.”“A Little Good News” hit the air waves in 1983 and is still on target in a bah-humbug sort of way. Fighting in Lebanon. Bad economy. “One more sad is story's one more than I can stand.” That cute blonde from Canada melodiously struck a nerve that pains me to this day. Now and then it would be wonderful to hear an anchorperson report, “Anne, I hope you’re listening. We got nice stuff coming right up.”Most of us have minimal influence on what goes on around the world, but we can have an immeasurable effect on our own little corner of our own little house and the neighborhoods around us. Finding ways to say we care is invaluable. Love is the essence of the magic that makes the world a better place. It’s a part of this festive season. In Miracle on 34th Street, Kris Kringle affirms, “Christmas isn't just a day. It's a frame of mind.” Improving our frame of mind is essential for our future.From Thanksgiving to Christmas I plan to embrace joy and happiness, to verbalize the Ho-Ho-Ho’s, and to welcome children just as Jim Yellig welcomed me. Stories of St. Nick, Kris Kringle, and Santa are revisited. Favorite toys and games and most-requested gifts are researched, and “A Visit from St. Nicholas” is memorized and pantomimed a hundred times. My red velvet suit and the accompanying faux-fur trim are packed and unpacked weekly along with the black boots and white gloves.But the enchantment of Christmas can’t just be packed and unpacked. Santas must be ever vigilant for shy glances and hands waving “I think I know you” in the stores they shop in. Everyone needs to be just as understanding of the child who wishes for two front teeth as the child who wishes for a place to live. The warmth that occurs when teens and tots selflessly mention a friend’s need above their own or ask for a mom not to have to work so hard must always feel as fresh as when we first heard similar expressions. Now that’s the magic of the season!By adding sprinkles of joy and happiness, we could make a batch of magic too. Offering hope and love in our homes and neighborhoods could change lives. Sustaining the effort beyond the Christmas season might create a frame of mind that could eventually lead to a lot more good news in the world today.For me, there are greater things than Santa Claus. There are gifts that can’t be boxed or bought with credit cards. But “a little old driver so lively and quick” who challenges us to spread good cheer has earned a spot in the Indiana Hall of Fame and a place on my nice list again this year… as have many of you.

Rainfall near a half an inch. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:08 pm Two Montpelier residents died Thursday in a car accident in rural Blackford County. Chuck Wilson, 88, died at the crash site. Ruth Wilson, 84, later succumbed to her injuries in the hospital. According to a press release from Blackford County Sheriff’s Office, Chuck and Ruth Wilson were driving a Chevrolet SUV east on county road 400 North. At the same time, a man was driving a white Chevrolet truck south on county road 500 East. The Wilsons’ vehicle went into the intersection and collided with the other vehicle. Blackford County coroner Zach Crouch pronounced Chuck Wilson dead at the scene. Ruth Wilson was taken to IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital in Muncie and later flown to Lutheran Hospital in Fort Wayne before her death. The male truck driver, who was not identified in the report, had no injuries. He was taken to IU Health Jay for a drug and alcohol blood test with results pending. Blackford County Sheriff’s Office, Montpelier Police Department, Hartford City Police Department, Montpelier Fire Department, Montpelier Emergency Medical Service, Hartford City Fire Department and Hartford City Emergency Medical Service responded to the accident. Indiana State Police assisted with the investigation and conducted a crash reconstruction. A lifelong farmer in Blackford County, Chuck Wilson and his wife of 66 years, Ruth Wilson, were on their way to watch their family harvest the fields before the crash. Services will be held at 11 a.m. Thursday at Walker and Glancy Funeral Home in Montpelier. Subscribe today! Success! An email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup. Error!

Photo by Lauren Gdowski. ANNIE FAULKNER | NEWS CO-EDITOR | aefaulkn@butler.edu As a news writer, I have rarely had the opportunity to insert my own views and experiences into my stories. After years of striving for objectivity above all else, I find myself writing my final story — and I believe I have earned the right to pen sentiments that, for once, have not been meticulously researched and fact-checked. As a rare final indulgence, I am writing an exploration of my time working on the Collegian and exactly how formative it has been to my time at Butler. For some people, the transition to campus life is easy. I was not one of those people. During my first weeks at Butler, I had a difficult time finding my place on this campus. I was anxious, depressed and simply unhappy. I enjoyed my coursework, but beyond that, I was lost. In fact, I had begun conducting research on transferring and was strongly considering leaving Butler at the end of my first semester. It was clear to my family that I was not doing well, and I could tell how concerned they all were about my well-being. My sister-in-law, who had served as an editor for The Duke Chronicle during her undergraduate days, pushed me to seek out the student newspaper as a way to become more involved on campus. Reluctantly, I gave in and applied — famously, the only Collegian staff member known to have ever applied on Handshake. Despite my initial apprehension, I immediately fell in love with this paper and with this community. I was so nervous at first, not knowing anyone else on staff, and not even knowing where to sit during my first few all-staff meetings as the entire Collegian staff crammed into our tiny Fairbanks office. However, our then-Managing Editor Meghan Stratton welcomed me to sit by her on the floor, and that is where I sat for just about every meeting afterward. Being a Collegian reporter has its trials and tribulations. I remember the frustration of having entire pages of articles cut for space. I remember the infuriating learning curve of adapting to writing in AP style for the first time — and mourning the loss of my beloved Oxford commas. But most of all, I remember how proud I was when I would receive positive feedback from my editors, and how fulfilling it felt when I would finally see my stories come to life in print and online. I am the last staff member remaining who was writing for the Collegian during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through those months, it would have been so easy to succumb to circumstance and stop publishing for those critical final issues. However, under then-Editor-in-Chief Jessica Lee’s fearless leadership, the presses did not stop. I wrote articles on the rapid changes brought on by the pandemic from my parents’ kitchen table, painstakingly transcribing interviews into the wee hours of the morning. In an era characterized by chaos and uncertainty, the Collegian provided me with stability and a sense of connection to the Butler community, even though we were isolated and scattered across the country. After being selected as an assistant news editor that May, I spent all summer waiting in the same kind of aching excitement that a child has while trying to fall asleep on Christmas Eve. At last, the first day of editorial retreat finally came — and immediately, we had a COVID-19 scare and the rest of our retreat was moved online. Nevertheless, I had never been so happy or proud to be a part of anything. Those publication nights were some of the most wonderfully stressful times of my career at Butler. Sometimes it was then-News Editor Ellie Allen and I single-handedly trying to solve geopolitical issues through our work; other times, it was me curling up in a blanket under my desk and watching “Dance Moms” to cope with the nail-biting anxiety of the 2020 presidential election.

I seriously considered staying on campus solely because of my obligation to this paper — however, I knew that I needed to leave and take the opportunities that were coming next. I spent the fall 2021 semester studying abroad in Rennes, France and the spring 2022 semester participating in the Washington D.C. learning semester. Without what I had learned from my time at this publication, I don’t think I would have been at all successful during my year off campus. But yet, during my time away, I became increasingly unsure about whether or not I would be returning to the Collegian when I came back to Butler. I was worried that I would not have the time to commit fully to this paper again, as I knew I would have so many daunting responsibilities this year — studying for the LSAT, completing the senior capstones for both of my majors and writing the dreaded honors thesis. However, my doubts went away in April when the article “A recent history of SGA and DEI” was published. After reading it from my rat-infested apartment building in Washington, it was all I could think about for days. Ellie and the rest of the team were in the office working on that story until past 7 a.m. that morning — which may be a record for the latest night in the office, at least that I can recall. It was excruciatingly painful that I could not be there to gush over those editors in person, so I did what every disconnected paper alumna does: I sent Insomnia Cookies to the newsroom the following week. I knew that I absolutely could not miss out on being a part of that for another year. I could not come back to Butler without coming back to the Collegian. And yet, that was nerve-wracking, because nearly all of the familiar faces on the editorial board had graduated. I was afraid that I had been gone for too long and missed out on too much. When I arrived at the editorial retreat in August, I found myself in a room full of strangers — I felt like I was a first-year again, out-of-place and unfamiliar. I grossly underestimated how easy it would be to find a family in this editorial board. In my last year at Butler, I have met people that I know will be lifelong friends. Every single member of this year’s board is so gifted and so passionate about their craft; we have done work this year that I am incredibly proud of, and there are some long-term passion projects started that I cannot wait to see finished down the road. After getting to know the rising juniors and seniors on this editorial board, I am certain that my class could not be leaving this publication in better hands. Now my time at the Collegian is coming to an end. I have written nearly 50 articles during my tenure, and I have contributed content for the news, opinion, culture, multimedia, photo and design sections — tragically, the sports pitch from Culture Co-Editor Owen Madrigal, Opinion Co-Editor Aidan Gregg and me on this season’s “Drag Race” finale did not come to be. I have interviewed countless figures on Butler’s campus and beyond, from a local non-profit founder to a U.S. Senate candidate. I have traveled to Cincinnati as a reporter and to New York City as an editor. It has not yet sunk in that this byline will be my last. I would be remiss not to recognize some of the past and present news editors who have been formative to my time at the Collegian. Meghan Stratton was the first person to welcome me into this community during my first year and was also the person who encouraged me to apply for the editorial board. When I had an unfortunate 20th birthday that featured my first parking ticket from BUPD, the cancellation of spring break and the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Meghan sent Papa John’s cookies to my parents’ house at a moment’s notice, which tells you everything you need to know about what a caring and supportive person she is. Sorell Grow, my first news editor, was instrumental in helping me develop my writing abilities. She and Ellie always gave me assignments that pushed me out of my comfort zone, which was crucial to my evolution as a writer. This year especially, I have often looked back on Sorell’s example of leadership within the news section, and I hope I have lived up to her legacy. Of equal importance, Sorell also taught me the value of a good pun. Ellie Allen is the best friend and mentor on this staff'}]"

new judge and to reinstate his original defense team will be vetted next month at the Indiana Supreme Court. It is one of two petitions Allen filed with the high court. Allen faces two counts of murder and is accused of killing 14-year-old Libby German and 13-year-old Abby Williams on Feb. 13, 2017. He was arrested Oct. 26, 2022, and charged Oct. 28, 2022. Allen petitioned to court in late October to review Special Judge Frances Gull\'s rulings which had kept many of the court documents in his case sealed from public inspection. Gull issued an order in November that resolved Allen\'s complaints. ""The requests that prompted this petition have largely been resolved, and thus mooted, by the trial court’s order entered on November 14, 2023,"" the justices wrote in their opinion published Monday. That opinion denied Allen\'s first petition for the court\'s intervention. ""Because Allen bore the burden to persuade this Court to issue a writ and he has not done so, the petition is denied,"" the order states. Allen filed a second petition with the Indiana Supreme Court in early November asking for his original legal team to be reinstated to his case and asking that Gull be replaced with a different special judge. It is on these issues that the Indiana Supreme Court set aside an hour on Jan. 18 for each side to argue in front of the court. This petition has its origins in a hastily scheduled hearing called for Oct. 19 in Gull\'s Allen County courtroom. The Oct. 19 hearing came a week or so after it was learned that crime-scene photos of Libby German and Abby Williams had been published without either defense attorney\'s knowledge. When the hearing started, Gull stated that Allen\'s attorneys, Andrew Baldwin and Brad Rozzi, conveyed to her in chambers that they would resign from the case. Based on subsequent court filings, Gull\'s characterization of the in-chambers meeting with attorneys was diplomatic. In filings after the Oct. 19 hearing, both Rozzi and Baldwin indicated they were presented with the option of either resigning from the case or Gull would go on the record in open court and dismiss them based on gross negligence. Between Oct. 19 and Oct. 31, the attorneys files several motions, eventually filing to withdraw from the case as public defenders, then subsequently filing a new appearance as Allen\'s private counsel. At an Oct. 31 hearing, Gull publicly accused Baldwin and Rozzi of gross negligence and removed them from the case in order to protect Allen\'s right to be represented by legal counsel. After the Oct. 19 hearing, Gull, an Allen County superior judge, appointed to Allen County public defenders to represent Allen. Allen\'s November motion requests that Baldwin and Rozzi be reinstated and that Gull be removed from the case. These are the issues, as well as a proposed motion by Allen for a 70-day speedy trial, will be argued Jan. 18 at the Indiana Supreme Court. Reach Ron Wilkins at rwilkins@jconline.com.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:14 pm FRANKLIN — In October 2021, Johnson Memorial Health went dark. A cyberattack had infiltrated the health system’s networks and claimed to possess large amounts of patients’ personal information. The ransomware group was demanding a $3 million Bitcoin payment. Rather than oblige, hospital administrators decided to go offline to determine the extent of the breach and prevent losing any more data, explained Dave Dunkle, president and CEO of the network. Soon, hosptial staff were operating in the digital dark age, using paper forms to document all their procedures. Couriers scurried between departments hand-delivering blood-draw orders. With monitoring equipment down, more nurses were called in to the critical-care unit to physically observe each patient. “It was rough,” Dunkle said. “It was very rough.” The ransomware group never got paid, but the attack still cost the health care system millions of dollars to deal with the fallout. More than two years later, the hospital still hasn’t recovered financially. “You don’t get that lost business back,” he said. “With margins being so slim for community hospitals like ours, we’re still suffering from the lost income during the attack.” Johnson Memorial Health is just one of thousands of Indiana businesses and organizations struggling to rebound after being targeted by a malware or ransomware scheme. In recent years, the amount of money lost due to internet crimes has skyrocketed across the state. In 2019, Hoosier victims reported losing over $24 million. Last year, that number more than tripled to $73.5 million, according to data from the most recent FBI Internet Crime Report. That’s despite the fact the number of reported cybercrime victims in Indiana actually declined by around 1,000 since 2020, when nearly 12,800 fell prey to an attack. During the first six months of this year, insurance claims for ransomware attacks increased nationally by 27% compared to the second half of 2022, according to Coalition, a company that sells cyber insurance. The average ransom demand was $1.62 million during the same timeframe, marking a 47% increase from the previous six months and a 74% increase over the past year, according to the report. The data indicates cybercriminals are developing more sophisticated, strategic attacks towards companies that have highly sensitive information and rely heavily on online networks to function, explained Scott Shackelford, director of Indiana University’s Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research. “They can really go after the stuff that’s going to have the highest pain point in terms of making sure that a place like a clinic pays up as quickly as possible,” he said. And more companies are paying up than ever before. In 2018, less than half of companies across the globe paid a ransom to recover their data, according to a cybersecurity report by Statista. This year, nearly 73% decided to shell out a ransom payment. It’s a dangerous trend. As more businesses pay up, cybercriminals are emboldened to attack even more companies, knowing the majority will simply give them money to quickly resolve the issue, according to Marcus Rogers, director of Purdue University’s cyberforensics lab. “It’s kind of a catch-22 and a bit of a vicious circle,” he said. The federal government has taken a controversial approach to disrupting that cycle. In 2020, the Treasure Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control issued an advisory stating companies or citizens that pay certain ransoms could face fines or even jail time for violating U.S. sanctions. Dunkle with Johnson Memorial Health said one reason they didn’t pay their ransom was because FBI agents helping them through the attack emphasized the company could face stiff penalties if they obliged. “They were sure to let us know that, which was wonderful,” he said sarcastically. The Treasury emphasized the potential sanctions toward U.S. companies were part of a larger effort to stop cyberattacks by removing the financial incentives. “As cyber criminals use increasingly sophisticated methods and technology, we are committed to using the full range of measures, to include sanctions and regulatory tools, to disrupt, deter, and prevent ransomware attacks,” said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a release. Shackelford with IU said he understands that reasoning, but believes it’s wrong to expect companies that have already been victimized and lost money to a cyberattack to then face a fine. Instead, the federal government should consider providing assistance to core service providers like hospitals and police departments to beef up cybersecurity, Shackelford said. “We’re never going to get everybody to stop paying ransom,” he said. “I think we just need to do a better job of getting resources to those critical infrastructure operators.” Dunkle agreed. He said a more productive way to address the problem would be to create a checklist of cybersecurity measures companies need to take, and then provide funding for those who need it to implement those measures. That’s especially true considering the cost of cybersecurity services has increased dramatically. Dunkle estimated his network is paying over 30% more for the same services compared to a couple of years ago. “It’s outlandish, and I don’t feel like that’s sustainable for small hospitals,” he said. “It’s all very expensive, and it keeps getting more expensive.” Cyberattacks in Indiana often illicit a ransom payment from a company by taking Hoosiers’ personal information hostage. Federal law doesn’t provide any protections for that data. That leaves states to grapple with how best to deal with privacy issues. That’s something Indiana did earlier this year when legislators passed Senate Bill 5 and became just the seventh state to adopt a comprehensive data privacy policy, according to Bloomberg Law. Three other states have approved similar bills since then. When the policy takes effect in 2026, the legislation will substantially expand what is considered private data. It also requires companies that control data to “adopt and implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical data security practices,” but doesn’t provide details on what that entails. Marcus Rogers with Purdue’s cyberforensics lab said the legislation is a step in the right direction to encourage companies to better protect data.

In Indiana, the Attorney General is the only one that can bring litigation for violating the state’s data policy. Historically, the office has been aggressive in pursuing legal action against companies that fail to meet cyberattack reporting requirements, according to the international law firm White & Case. The firm stated that “businesses should not be surprised by a similarly aggressive enforcement approach by the Indiana Attorney General” under the new data policy. That enforcement was on display last month when the office announced Indiana will receive $690,000 as part a five-state settlement with the financial services company Morgan Stanley to resolve allegations of negligent internal data security practices. More aggressive tactics to force Hoosier companies to take action against the bombardment of cyberattacks will become more necessary as ransomware becomes even more sophisticated, argued Rogers. “This is an arms race, and we’re always behind the curve,” he said.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:05 pm Editor’s note: This is the fourth in a series of editorials proposing priorities for the 2024 Indiana General Assembly. From the newly born to the elderly, health among Hoosiers is a major concern for everyone. Top concerns include the state’s high maternal and infant mortality rates, the alarming rates of drug and tobacco use among teens and young adults, cancer rates, mental health and issues inside institutions caring for the elderly. The state’s various health rankings are concerning: mental health is 35th in the nation; infant mortality, 42nd; early adult mortality, 40th; obesity ranks 39th, smoking ranks 42nd and suicide is 28th, according to US News and World Report’s 2022 “Best States” rankings. In all, the media company ranks the Hoosier state 43rd in overall health. Financially speaking, Hoosiers’ poor health is costing the state and its businesses and residents more than $87 billion, according to Gov. Eric Holcomb’s Public Health Commission. Recommendations from the commission all point to this: More public money needs to be spent on health care in Indiana. Early into the Indiana Senate’s 2023 legislative session, the governor’s commission met with legislators with proposed changes to the way Indiana tackles public health. When the Indiana General Assembly passed its primary budget bill April 28, state health funding had increased. Specifically focused on decreasing overdoses, $5 million from an opioid settlement fund was allocated to the Substance Abuse Prevention, Treatment and Enforcement Program to combat addiction. From the state’s opioid settlement fund, $18.7 million was approved for substance abuse treatment and overdose intervention. The funds will be split between fiscal years 2024 and 2025. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with millions of new cases diagnosed each year. Tobacco products are the primary risk factor for lung cancer. Lawmakers should look at neighboring states and their increased tobacco product taxes as a way to help deter use among Hoosiers. While the state’s infant mortality as a whole has declined in recent years, the eastern and central southwestern portions of Indiana saw an increase over the past five years. Holcomb launched the “My Health Baby” program in 2022, which was part of his goal to make Indiana’s infant mortality rate the lowest in the Midwest by 2024. More outreach is needed to help Black Hoosier women whose numbers of deaths are staggering: According to the 2022 Indiana Maternal Mortality Annual Report, Indiana’s pregnancy-associated mortality ratio was 117 per 100,000 live births in 2020, representing a 58% increase from 2019. For Black women, it’s twice the average rate and three times higher than the rate for white women. By the year 2035, the number of adults over the age of 65 is expected to outnumber the number of children under 18, according to a report this year by the Indiana Capital Chronicle. And it’s well-documented that Indiana is facing an assisted living and nursing home crisis. Add in the fact that chronic worker shortages and funding issues at those facilities are making it harder for elders to find a quality place to spend their golden years. More must be done to better monitor the state’s nursing homes to protect older Hoosiers. The Kokomo Tribune Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.
