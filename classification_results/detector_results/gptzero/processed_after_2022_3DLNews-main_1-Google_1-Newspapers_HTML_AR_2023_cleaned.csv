State Advisory Council set a bold agenda for transforming four state parks, hoping Petit Jean State Park becomes a “national climbing destination,” Delta Heritage Trail State Park becomes a “trail town” with a “significant gravel event,” Pinnacle Mountain State Park becomes a destination for a “running, hiking and biking trail along the shoreline” and Queen Wilhelmina State Park becomes a home to a gateway trail concept. Danny Collins, owner of Bentonville tour company 37 North Expeditions and a member of the council, sees Withrow Springs State Park as a base camp for tourism growth in Northwest Arkansas. Working with Arkansas Game and Fish, the council foresees “water trail creation projects at War Eagle Creek [and] Kings’ River.” The early-stage plans are in response to First Gentleman Bryan Sanders’ desire for Arkansas to become a premier outdoor tourism destination and he sees tourism overtaking agriculture as the state’s dominant industry. In January, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders tasked the 18-member advisory council, which also refers to itself as the Natural State Initiative (NSI), with growing the state’s tourism industry and increasing outdoor recreation. Sanders appointed her husband, Bryan, as chair. NSI meetings, which have been ongoing both in person and via Zoom and email, are not open to the public and the group does not maintain minutes with the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism. State Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest, who represents Madison County, said, “How are they already deciding this without talking to local people first? These decisions made at 30,000 feet to me are not conducive to getting the best policy out there. “And, once again, the lack of transparency to already be deciding things without having open meetings is against what open government is about.” Since its’ inception, the entire group has met roughly five times, according to member Suzanne Grobmyer, who is also chief of staff at the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism. NSI’s two subcommittees, Economic Development and Outdoor Experiences, meet more often. “The advisory committee, ultimately, is advising the governor on ideas,” Grobmyer said. Last week, the NSI released its first official report outlining “the work ahead while acknowledging work that is well underway.” Though Bryan Sanders chairs the NSI, according to an email obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, many suggestions have come from another member of the group, Tom Walton, grandson of Walmart Inc., founders Helen and Sam Walton and co-founder of The Runway Group. Walton and Bryan Sanders are outdoor enthusiasts who share an affinity for biking. Walton has also been engaged with the idea of re-designating land around the Buffalo National River as a national park or preserve. After a public backlash against the idea, The Runway Group backed off. The NSI was not involved with the re-designation idea, Grobmyer said, and emails obtained by The Record through a FOIA request do not mention re-designating land. In an email exchange in May, members of the NSI Outdoor Experiences subcommittee outlined four areas it wanted to see developed — “Petit Jean,” “Delta Corridor,” “Pinnacle Mountain,” “Mena.” In August, the four state parks closest to those areas, were adopted by the Administrative Rules Subcommittee of the Arkansas Legislative Council as Natural State Initiative Opportunity Zones, a state pilot project. As part of NSI plans, the 2023 General Assembly amended the Arkansas Tourism Development Act by creating four opportunity zones to promote and grow outdoor recreation, allow the creation of a tourism attraction in the area, and receive tax incentives. According to the new law, the zones must be within or no more than one-eighth of a mile outside the boundaries of a state park, a cultural or historic site, or a cultural or educational center. The Arkansas Economic Development Commission Director is charged with developing, implementing and administering the project in consultation with the Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism. Before the law took effect, four NSI members — Bryan Sanders, Walton, Grobmyer, and Mindy West, chief financial officer of Murphy USA, spoke to the Little Rock Rotary Club where Sanders announced the four parks were being considered for improvements in infrastructure. “I think we can crush our neighboring states as a destination for outdoor recreation,” Bryan Sanders told the group. When the NSI began, Grobmyer said the group and the parks department had identified 10 major projects, which included the four determined to be opportunity zones. “And so when Tom shared those [in an email], it didn’t really necessary come from Tom,” Grobmyer said. “We had lots of conversations about these are the major priorities state parks has and he’s like, ‘These sound really great.’ That is something we all agreed on.” On May 10, Walton began an email exchange stating his thoughts on “how we can catalyze progress” and wrote he was throwing some ideas “out to get a reaction.” According to Grobymer, Walton had spoken to each member individually before sending the email. He suggested designating Petit Jean Mountain, the Delta Corridor, Pinnacle Mountain and Mena as opportunity zones. Less than a month later, Bryan Sanders followed up with that idea in a letter to AEDC Chair Clint O’Neal with the recommendation to officially designate the parks as opportunity zones. A public hearing was held on July 7 and the public comment period expired on July 15. No public comments were received. On Aug. 24, the rules subcommittee adopted the four parks. The act allows for qualified tourism attraction projects that locate in a designated opportunity zone to receive tax incentives. For a company’s project to be eligible, it must have a $500,000 minimum investment or a $250,000 minimum investment if it is in a designated high unemployment county. Currently, only four areas can be opportunity zones, though the number could expand in the future depending on the success of the pilot project, Grobmyer said. NSI Vision The emails stated that the NSI Vision is to establish the natural state as the designation for year-round adventure. That same goal is a part of the report released last week. NSI’s mission statement was also included in the emails and states, “In Arkansas, the outdoor economy grew by almost 23% in the last year; Arkansas must seize this momentum and further establish the Natural State as a leader in outdoor economy and a destination for outdoor enthusiasts from around the world. Double the number of entrepreneurs, workers, and the overall size of the outdoor economy and revenue from the 2% tourism tax in the next decade.” The NSI defined its “Core Values and Beliefs” by stating, “Arkansas is the Natural State, offering limitless opportunities for year-round outdoor adventure. to [sic] win, we believe in elevating the best outdoor experiences in Arkansas; we value getting more kids off screens and outdoors to improve health and quality of life; [sic].” Grobmyer said the goal of the advisory group is to have “as many big conversations as we can.” She said not all the ideas discussed will become reality and likened the goals to her role in building the Monument Trails. Before joining Sanders’ administration, Grobmyer was executive director of Arkansas Parks and Recreation Foundation, a non-profit significantly financed by the Walton Family Foundation. In that role, Grobmyer was instrumental in working with the state parks department to build the Monument Trails, which are bike trails in four state parks, Devil’s Den, Hobbs, Mount Nebo and Pinnacle Mountain. In the NSI report issued last week, one recommendation was to grow those trails, “including the development of a world-class downhill mountain bike park.” She said not all the plans for the Monument Trails came to fruition, much like the plans from the advisory group. “The reality of what we thought we’re gonna do and what we ended up doing can really be wildy different,” she said. The report recommends “develop and promote major events, like the 2024 Arkansas Graveler, to showcase Arkansas as a leading destination for outdoor recreation.” The Arkansas Graveler is a six-day bike ride on gravel roads over the state’s rural roads. In July, officials planning the race met with Madison County officials about the possibility of an overnight stop on the Kingston Square. The NSI works with the state parks department, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, the University of Arkansas’ Greenhouse Outdoor Recreation Program and the AEDC.

Magnolia State this weekend for its third-straight road game in desperate search of a victory, looking to turn the tide on its season and end a three-game skid at Ole Miss. The Razorbacks (2-3, 0-2) will face the No. 16 Rebels (4-1, 1-1) Saturday night (6:30 p.m. CT, SECN). This rivalry has consistently featured offensive fireworks, with both teams averaging more than 30 points across the past eight meetings between the schools. However, the Hogs and Rebels are headed in different directions this season. Arkansas is in the midst of a three-game losing streak and can't find consistency on either side of the football. Meanwhile, Ole Miss is coming off one of its signature victories under Lane Kiffin, beating LSU 55-49 last week to stay in the hunt for an SEC West title. Here is a look at four things to watch from the Ole Miss matchup and a score prediction. Ole Miss is the only team in the country with both a 500-yard passing (524, vs. Mercer) and a 300-yard rushing game (317, vs. LSU) this season. The Razorbacks won't be able to key in on any player, with the Rebels diversified and deep in how to attack an opposing defense. The headliner is quarterback Jaxson Dart, who averages 350.8 yards of offense a game, which ranks fourth nationally. Dart is the Rebels' second leading rusher and has two interceptions on the season. If Arkansas wants any chance of slowing down this Ole Miss offense, it will need a big game from the defensive line. Arkansas needs to limit Quinshon Judkins on the ground and get after an offensive line that gives up 2.5 sacks a game, which is tied for 93rd in the country. For all of Ole Miss' strengths offensively, the defense has some holes. Yes, the Rebels did upset LSU last weekend, but they also gave up 49 points in the process. Offenses are averaging 263.8 passing yards and 145 rushing yards a game. Both of those numbers rank in the bottom-half nationally. The Arkansas offense hasn't been consistent this season, but Saturday presents an opportunity to right the ship and build confidence. More: Can Mississippi homecoming spark Arkansas football's KJ Jefferson? More: Arkansas football provides injury updates, including positive news on John Morgan III However, the one strength of this Ole Miss defense is its pass rush, which ranks 11th in the country with 3.4 sacks a game. Arkansas looks set to play a new offensive line this week, and keeping KJ Jefferson clean could be the difference between a close game and a blowout. This has been an important question each of the past three weeks. Against LSU, the Razorbacks folded against Jayden Daniels and Malik Nabors, but the secondary bounced back last week with a solid performance against Texas A&M. The Ole Miss wide receivers are probably a better unit than Texas A&M, and not as talented as LSU, which provides a big test for the Razorbacks' defensive backs. This challenge could be increasingly more difficult if star cornerback Dwight McGlothern can't play after suffering a concussion against the Aggies. With or without McGlothern, Jaylon Braxton and Jaheim Singletary need big games to help limit the Ole Miss offense. The Rebels have three wide receivers with more than 340 receiving yards. Jordan Watkins has been the most consistent wideout (29 catches, 450 yards), but Tre Harris is the big-play threat averaging 21.3 yards a catch with six touchdowns. This rivalry has been filled with close finishes and unpredictable outcomes in recent memory. Five of the last eight games between Ole Miss and Arkansas have been decided by four or less points. There's the infamous backwards heave from Hunter Henry in 2015, and the 2021 game finished 52-51 in overtime. Fireworks are guaranteed, but can Arkansas close out a tight game? The Razorbacks have lost both of their one-possession games this season. Perhaps they're due for a close result to flip their way. This actually feels like a decent matchup for Arkansas. The Razorbacks' defensive line should be able to create some havoc and the offense might finally find some momentum, but I just don't trust the Razorbacks' offensive line. It's hard to believe a last-minute shuffling will completely change things. I think Arkansas makes some big plays, but Ole Miss is just too good, and home-field advantage plays a role.""}]"

retire from his career in the defense industry, he left the bright lights of the Hollywood Hills behind for the much slower paced lifestyle of Camden. What he didn\'t leave behind was his passion as a professional Santa Claus. Long first played the jolly old elf during a Christmas party at Aerojet Rocketdyne in the 90\'s. ""The employees at Aerojet were having a Christmas party and wanted to know if anyone knew a Santa. No one did. I worked with a guy, he said \'I have a Santa Suit\', "" Long said,"" Well, I said \'I\'m chubby and I have a beard\'. He was, I dunno, 5 foot. He bought it for his kids and decided \'No, that won\'t work.\' So, I did the Christmas party."" But that was just the beginning of Long\'s foray into the merry. ""And then another group at work asked me to do their party, and then another group. Then I got a request to do someone\'s wedding and it just kind of kept going from there."" Eventually Long joined the Fraternal Order of Real Bearded Santas, a group which the organizations website states, ""It all began in 1994, with a group of 10 professional actors who were being featured in an Otto Versandt commercial to promote the German mail-order giant\'s Fall catalog-- the one with Cindy Crawford on the cover! ""During the shooting-- which lasted nearly 12 hours at Paramount Studios\' famed Brownstone Street-- the actors did what actors always do: they swapped \'war stories""-- tales about their most & least favorite acting roles. ""Turned out, even limiting their conversation to SANTA-related gigs, the combined experience of these 10 was too extensive to share during the shoot-- so they decided they would get together for lunch sometime to continue the camaraderie; before long, one of them suggested that the group needed a name-- and since each had received a casting call for a ""Santa with REAL Beard"", they soon settled upon a rather whimsical title for their merry band: ""Amalgamated Order of Real Bearded Santas (AORBS)"". The AORBS have regular conventions, workshops and even insurance for professional Santas, who can network and join with their bearded brothers who delight in bringing joy to children. Long said, ""In California, they go watch Medieval Times, where you eat with your hands and such and they had a whole section of a hundred or so of us chubby guys with beards. And we all cheer for the Red Knight."" Long was referring to the image of Santa in a bright red suit, but historically Santa Claus has been portrayed in a myriad of ways. Regardless of its origins, the suit has become the prevailing iconography in regards to the elf. Long states the suit and accessories are an industry in and of themselves, often featured at the Santa conventions he attends. ""A lot of people sold things, you know Santa belts with Santa on them and gloves that glow,"" he noted ""They even had a fashion show one year and my agent talked me into doing one. I used that Santa suit that I had borrowed so many times. And then the next year. Just couldn\'t go buy another one and give it to the guy. He didn\'t want one, but I was gonna go buy another one and I went to a costume shop and the first one was kind of humble $99. It had plastic spats and such and I was \'I\'m gonna a little bit better suit\' They showed me, back then, the $300 plus Deluxe suit,"" Long said. ""There\'s a place in California where you buy them, "" Long said,""and the person who does the Macy\'s Thanksgiving Parade and he also does the Christmas parade in Los Angeles, I saw the one that he bought one year. It was beautiful. It had rhinestones on it."" Through his agent Long continued to do Christmas parties and school events, eventually meeting celebrities like Soleil Moon Frye of \'Punky Brewster\' fame. Eventually Paul left California to retire in Camden in 2020, but he didn\'t retire his love for the suit or the love of seeing the twinkle in children\'s eyes. He recently appeared as Santa in the Camden Christmas Parade. ""Marxy Lindseey, she is a photographer, and she needed a Santa,"" Long said of his first Camden gig as Santa. He added, ""I\'ve done Ken\'s Discounts several times. I\'ve done the Arkansas Museum several times. I\'ve done Marxy\'s house several times. The parade was a blast."" Long said interacting with children is his favorite part of the job. He said, ""A lot of kids are surprised that the beard is real. They\'ll ask you if it\'s real. They often ask \'Where are the reindeer?\' Well, I point out that there isn\'t any snow. So I\'m driving in my little red Prius."" ""Particularly, I like the little babies and the two, three and four-year-olds, because they are just so cute because they\'re 100% in."" Long said he\'s confident the importance and image of santa will last for some time to come. ""People like the idea of someone who is good and who wants to do good for them."" The origins of Santa Claus Santa\'s origins are closely tied Father Christmas, a pre-Christian midwinter figure garbed in a wreath of holly, ivy or mistletoe. In fact, in England Father Christmas still wears a hooded green cloak and carries a staff. In the Netherlands, Sinterklaas most closely resembles the real life inspiration for Santa, St. Nicholas, a fourth century Greek Christian Bishop in what is now known as Turkey. Modern interpretations of Santa owe much to a January 3, 1863 issue of Harper\'s Weekly, in which cartoonist Thomas Nast portrayed a rotund bearded figure complete with ruddy cheeks and a sleigh pulled by reindeer. This image was further solidified by the Coca-Cola company when they featured him in a series of advertisements drawn by illustrator Haddon Sundblom, although Snopes notes the image of Santa was not created by the company, but had been around for a few decades before the popular advertisements.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 1:15 pm A woman was killed Saturday evening in a vehicle/pedestrian crash on Highway 358 in Greene County, according to authorities. Ashley Harris, 28, of Greene County died in the accident, which happened around 11:15 p.m. on Highway 358 near the intersection of County Road 715. Greene County Sheriff Brad Snyder said in a social media post that Paragould Emergency Services got a 911 call from a motorist, saying they believed they had struck a person walking on the highway. “Upon deputies’ arrival on scene, they located the deceased in the ditch on the southside of the highway. While the Arkansas State Police is Investigating the crash, preliminary details indicate that the motorist was traveling eastbound on Highway 358 and the pedestrian was walking the same eastbound direction in the eastbound lane at the time of the crash,” Snyder said in the post. “The pedestrian was wearing dark, camouflaged colored clothing when struck.” Authorities said the driver of the vehicle was a minor and will not be identified due to their age. The Arkansas State Police are investigating the crash, Snyder said. According to the ASP fatal crash website, the weather was clear and the road was dry at the time of the accident. The crash was the 495th fatal accident on Arkansas highways this year. Log In Keep it Clean. Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexually-oriented language. PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR CAPS LOCK.

None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the fact: ___ CLAIM: The federal government gives people who enter the U.S. illegally a cellphone, a domestic plane ticket to a location of their choice and a $5,000 Visa gift card. THE FACTS: People who enter the U.S. illegally do not receive such assistance from the federal government, immigration experts told The Associated Press. Immigration and Customs Enforcement gives some immigrants phones, but they can only access a monitoring app called SmartLink. Those who cross the border illegally do not receive gift cards. And although limited federal aid can help get migrants where they intend to go, they typically must choose from a set list of destinations and are usually transported by bus, not planes. A U.S. Senate candidate from Arizona in recent days spread the false information in a video circulating on social media. The erroneous claims are similar to information that has been previouslymisrepresented online. ""When these folks come across and they\'re processed, they\'re being given a cellphone, a plane ticket to wherever they want to go in this country, so probably to a community near you, and a $5,000 Visa card,"" Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, a Republican, says in the video posted to his profile on X, formerly Twitter.

Lamb did not respond to a request for comment from the AP. Immigrants who participate in ICE\'s Alternatives to Detention program may receive phones instead of remaining in custody or wearing a tracking device such as an ankle monitor. But these devices have extremely limited abilities, the AP has previously reported. They can only access an app called SmartLink, which is used to monitor immigrants after they cross the border. The phones are not connected to a cellular network and cannot be used to browse the internet or make unauthorized calls or texts. Instead, they use Wi-Fi, which allows program participants to complete scheduled check-ins, receive reminders about court hearings and access a database of community services, among other functions related to program compliance. People who enter the U.S. illegally do not receive $5,000 gift cards from the federal government. Both ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed to the AP that the agencies do not hand out such cards. The AP has previously reported that those in the U.S. illegally are not eligible for federal cash assistance, with exceptions for certain Cubans and Haitians. However, none of these benefits include a one-time payment of $5,000. As for transportation, the federal government does not buy plane tickets to wherever people who enter the country illegally want to go. ""The overwhelming majority of migrants who cross the border have to pay for their own transport,"" Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director at the American Immigration Council, told the AP. ""There is no massive pool of money that is getting every migrant who crosses the border a plane ticket or anything like that.""

The conspiracy theory led a North Carolina man to travel to Washington and fire a rifle in a local pizza parlor where he believed children were being enslaved. Among the supposed evidence cited by proponents was that the eatery, Comet Ping Pong, was mentioned in some emails from Hillary Clinton\'s campaign that were obtained by hackers. Conspiracy theorists tied this to the notion that ""pizza"" had been used online as a codeword for child sexual abuse material. No credible proof has been produced to support the ""pizzagate"" narrative. The false claims now spreading about Etsy are reminiscent of a baseless conspiracy theory from 2020, which alleged that retail giant Wayfair was using pricey storage cabinets to traffic children. ___ CLAIM: A video shows the crowd at this year\'s Army-Navy football game chanting ""F--- Joe Biden."" THE FACTS: The video was edited to add the chant, which occurred at a concert in 2021. Unedited footage of the game shows the crowd, including a large contingent of Army cadets, singing and bouncing to an EDM song often played at Army football games and other sportingevents. The altered video began spreading on social media following Saturday\'s annual Army-Navy game. In the clip, Army cadets and others in the spirited crowd jump in unison while appearing to chant the disparaging phrase about U.S. President Joe Biden at Gillette Stadium, home of the New England Patriots. ""Entire Crowd at Army VS Navy Game Chants \'F(asterisk)ck Joe Biden,\'"" reads one tweet that shared the edited footage. It had received approximately 37,000 likes and 11,000 shares as of Monday. But the footage was edited to add the chant. An unedited video of the same scene shows the cadets and other fans singing along to ""Tsunami,"" an EDM song released in 2013 by Canadian electronic music duo DVBBS and Borgeous, an American DJ. The track is oftenplayed at Army football games, as well as other athleticevents. ""It\'s inaccurate, it is false -- it is blatantly false,"" Army spokesperson Cynthia Smith told The Associated Press in reference to the erroneous claims.'}]"

Beebe-Capps Expressway, Searcy, Arkansas 72143, phone 501-268-0700 or 1-800-400-3142. The Daily Citizen started as the Des Arc Citizen in September 1854, by John J. Morrill. Publication was suspended 1862-1866 by destruction of the newspaper office during the Civil War. The newspaper was reopened by J.H. Balding and sold to A.C. Matthews in 1867 and then later sold to J.S. Thomas in 1872. The Citizen consolidated with the Des Arc Argus on May 1, 1880, under the ownership of J.J. Baugh and with the Prairie County Appeal in 1889. The newspaper moved to Searcy in 1889 and the name was changed to White County Citizen. It consolidated with the Searcy Morning Call in 1890 and became a daily newspaper at that time. It further consolidated with the Arkansas Beacon in 1905 and in 1928 it bought out the Searcy Times. J.J. Baugh published the newspaper until his death in 1940. The new publisher M.T. Jones then published the newspaper until his death in August 1957. In 1964 Jamie Jones Young, mother of M.T. Jones, sold the newspaper to Perrin Jones and Jim Baugh Jones. The Citizen was purchased by Harte-Hanks in 1977. It was sold again in 1986 to Worrell Enterprises and then finally purchased by the Paxton family. Paxton Media Group traces it roots to 1896, when a group of investors headed by William F. Paxton launched The Evening Sun by buying the assets of the failing Paducah Standard at 214 Broadway. The cost was $8,900, and the men started with $10,000 capital. The newspaper did not make a profit until 1918. In 1929, Paxton's son, Edwin J. Paxton, who had taken over as editor, bought out the rival News-Democrat. After the merger, the newspaper became The Sun-Democrat, and operations were moved to the current location at 408 Kentucky Ave. in 1934. The name changed to The Paducah Sun in 1978 at the request of Jack Paxton, editor at the time and grandson of Edwin J. Paxton. At 4:20 p.m. May 28, 1957, WPSD television, (the PSD stands for Paducah Sun-Democrat) went on the air as the company-owned television station based in Paducah. It is an NBC affiliate. The company operated only The Paducah Sun and WPSD-TV until 1989, when it began acquiring other newspapers. The company owns 32 daily newspapers and numerous weekly newspapers, mostly in the southern United States. Daily circulation totals 350,000. Holdings include The Paducah Sun, The Herald-Sun in Durham, North Carolina, The High Point Enterprise in High Point, North Carolina, the Jonesboro Sun in Jonesboro, Arkansas, and the Daily Star in Hammond, Louisiana. In 1998, the company purchased Nixon Newspapers Inc which included the Wabash Plain Dealer, located in Wabash, Indiana. In 2007, Paxton Media Group purchased three Indiana newspapers: the Marion Chronicle-Tribune (in July) from the Gannett Foundation; the Huntington Herald-Press (in May) from the Quayle family; and the LaPorte County Herald-Argus from Small Newspaper Group (in September). The Paxton's have owned and operated the Searcy Daily Citizen since 1991. In May 2014 the Citizen moved from its long time location on Race Street to its current location of 723 W.

These include the Basin Park Hotel and the Palace Bath House, both of which are built around the natural springs for which the city is named. Visitors can also stay at the Crescent Hotel, built all the way back in 1886. Said to be America’s ‘most haunted hotel,’ the Crescent, which offers regular ghost tours, has been featured on the popular television programs Ghost Hunters and Paranormal Witness. Eureka Springs’ many attractions aren’t confined to the downtown area alone. For example, visitors can see the Thorncrown Chapel in the hill country just outside the city, which was designed and built in 1980 by a disciple of celebrated architect Frank Lloyd Wright. They can also visit the nearby 459-acre Turpentine Creek wildlife refuge, which is home to several lions, tigers, leopards, and bears, including a feisty grizzly. And seven miles east of the city, intrepid sightseers can take a tour of Onyx Cave, famous for its cavernous tunnels and extraordinary rock formations.'}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 1:02 pm The White County Sheriff’s Office is pursuing a case of animal cruelty after a dead dog was found nailed to a plywood sign Sunday morning that read “This What Happens To Dogs Drop off Here.” Deputies have talked to a suspect in connection to the dog found at the junction of Panther Creek and Fairview roads, Sheriff Phillip Miller said Monday afternoon. He said the name of the suspect is not being released “until there is actual charges. We will submit a case file to the prosecutor for review. We’ve been in contact with them for a possible charge of aggravated animal cruelty, which is a felony case.” The cadaver is being held in the Searcy Animal Shelter’s freezer. Chuck Niementowski, who has been working with animals more than 25 years, told The Daily Citizen, “Our only part of this is we accepted the dead animal at the shelter. I think it was late Sunday morning when the sheriff’s department brought it in. At that time, I didn’t know anything about this until I got this horrific picture. This guy needs to be exposed. This is horrendous and I hope they’re going to follow through and do something about it.” Photos of the dog hanging limply by its paws on a V-shaped plywood stand were posted on social media. In larger letters on the second piece of plywood, “STOP DROP DOG” is written in black paint. “Putting that up on a street, now how would that affect little kids going to church?” Niementowski said. “Think about the stress that could cause.” He called the photos “so horrendous and gruesome. That second picture is even more horrific. I’m just thinking the more people that know about this guy, the more punishment it would be for him. ... I think anybody I hear, I’ve talked to, that has seen that picture, they are inflamed about it.” “... I just hope this guy pays for it. ... When they brought the dog to the shelter, the dog was still on that board. They had trouble removing the spikes and a shelter worker that received the dog was saying there was blood all over the place so that meant that had to happen Sunday morning or it wouldn’t be bleeding like that. It’s sort of like the crucification, the crucified-type thing where he nailed it to the board. I sure hope it was already dead.” Niementowski said that the dog looks like it was a shepherd mix, “but it’s hard to say because of the condition it’s in.” Miller said the Humane Society of Searcy will follow its normal protocols for disposal of an animal. Niementowski said the dog will be disposed of “later as long as we know the sheriff’s department doesn’t need it for some reason.” Miller said the sheriff’s office gets many instances of misdemeanor animal cruelty but not too many felony cases. “Back in 2022, we made an arrest on an aggravated animal cruelty case.

Low 73F. Winds SE at 5 to 10 mph.. Partly cloudy skies. Low 73F. Winds SE at 5 to 10 mph. Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 4:08 pm There is a right way and a wrong way to do things. This week, we’ve seen the wrong way. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders called lawmakers to the Capitol Monday to cut taxes and end COVID-19 vaccine mandates. It was no secret she was going to do this. What wasn’t really talked about – until a few days before the session – was that she wanted to make major changes to Arkansas’ Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Passed in 1967 under Republican Gov. Winthrop Rockefeller, it’s one of the nation’s strongest government transparency laws. It requires governing bodies like school boards to meet openly, and it requires government agencies to make documents available to Arkansans when they request them. Sanders announced she was adding the bill to the call Friday while the state was involved in a court case regarding her travel records. Matt Campbell, a lawyer who operates the liberal-leaning Blue Hog Report blog, had made requests about her Arkansas State Police-associated activities. The State Police delayed providing it. The governor said she was concerned about hers and her family’s safety. But the changes in the proposed bill, which was sponsored by many Republican lawmakers, went far beyond protecting her family. They would have shielded her State Police-provided travel retroactively since the time she entered office. They would have kept secret many documents created by state agencies that now are available. And they would have reduced the ability of citizens to be reimbursed by the state when they win a FOIA case in court. In other words, if an average citizen requested a document and the government refused to provide it even though it was supposed to, the citizen might have to pay for his or her lawyer, while the government would have a team of lawyers paid for by taxpayers. Sanders defended the bill by saying it was similar to sunshine laws that exist for the federal government and states like California and New York. (Those are places Arkansas Republicans don’t typically hold up as examples to follow.) She said people can weaponize the FOIA to make government less efficient and slow her agenda. Special sessions usually are rubber stamp affairs. The governor lines up support, calls lawmakers to the Capitol, and they pass the bill. Not this time. Between Friday and Monday, an informal and diverse opposition developed. It included not only Sanders opponents like Campbell and the Democratic Party, but, more importantly, lots of Republicans. Party committees in Saline and Pulaski counties strongly condemned the bill. The most vocal opponents included two of Arkansas’ most powerful conservative groups, Conduit for Action and the state chapter of Americans for Prosperity. They rightly understand that secretive governments tend to grow more corrupt and bigger. One of AFP’s mantras is “Privacy is for citizens, and transparency is for government.” Republican incumbents fear these groups because they can rile up the base in their home districts and recruit opponents to run against them in their party’s primaries. They don’t want a Republican challenger to accuse them of supporting government secrecy next spring. Faced with mounting opposition, lawmakers were scrambling to pass amended legislation as this column is being written on Tuesday morning. Alas, the situation evolves while my deadline remains unchanged. Here’s what remains. This is the second time in recent months that a major change has been sprung on Arkansans with the outcome already settled, or at least presumed to be. The LEARNS Act passed by lawmakers this spring transformed education in this state. Regardless of what one might think about LEARNS – and there’s much to like – the details were not shared with the public until the votes were largely secured. The public process from the formal introduction of the 145-page law to the governor’s signature took a little more than two weeks. The same thing was happening with this, until people revolted. Of course the Freedom of Information Act occasionally needs updated. It’s been updated many times. But in a democracy, business, marriage or anything else, how things are done is often more important than what is done. Changing Arkansas institutions like schools or the Freedom of Information Act should be done deliberately, thoughtfully and, usually, conservatively.

rebates for Arkansas customers. While that may sound like a good deal, the agency negotiating on Arkansas’s behalf, the Arkansas Public Service Commission, rejected exactly the same dollar offer from Entergy in August 2022. At the time, the Public Service commission dismissed the offer as “a low-ball amount.” The state of Mississippi, which was a part of the same lawsuit against Entergy, extracted more than twice what Arkansas got in its settlement, despite the two states having similar claims. So what changed at the Arkansas Public Service Commission in the last 15 months? For one thing, turnover at the top. Two out of three commissioners have left since last August, including former chair Ted Thomas, who had served on the commission since 2015. In January, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders appointed Doyle Webb, the former head of the Republican Party of Arkansas, as the commission’s new chair. There are rumors of another factor: former Gov. Mike Huckabee, Sanders’ father. According to at least one Louisiana official, Huckabee helped make the settlement happen on behalf of Entergy, though the company denies it has ever hired the former governor in any capacity. Doyle Webb (left) and Mike Huckabee The settlement at issue came in the long-running Grand Gulf lawsuit. In a complaint originally filed in 2017, utility regulators in Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana, as well as the City of New Orleans, alleged that Entergy and its subsidiaries mismanaged the Grand Gulf Nuclear Station in Mississippi, resulting in customers in all three states being overcharged by hundreds of millions of dollars. Mississippi settled its part of the lawsuit in June 2022 for $300 million, but Entergy offered Arkansas only $142 million. The Arkansas Public Service Commission, headed by then-chairman Thomas, rejected the offer. In a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in August 2022, the Public Service Commission said Entergy’s settlement offer was “a low-ball amount” and noted that “nothing is said [in the settlement offer] about an actual return of a cash refund to Arkansas retail ratepayers.” At the same time Arkansas rejected Entergy’s offer, it also asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to hold a hearing on Entergy’s “continued imprudent mismanagement” of the Grand Gulf facility. In September 2022, citing an expiring term and growing frustration with changes to solar energy regulations in the state, Thomas tendered his resignation as chair to then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson. Hutchinson appointed Katie Anderson to replace Thomas as chair in October 2022. Then, after taking office in January, Sanders appointed Webb — the former state GOP chair and husband to Arkansas Supreme Court Justice Barbara Webb — to be the new chair of the commission. Katie Anderson remained on the commission after Webb became chairman, replacing outgoing commissioner Kimberly O’Guinn. According to documents on file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the federal entity that oversees utility rate disputes, Arkansas and Entergy had a settlement conference in January 2023. In July, Entergy reported to FERC that settlement talks with Arkansas had reached an impasse. In mid-September, though, Webb had a meeting with representatives of Entergy Arkansas, according to emails obtained by the Arkansas Times through the Freedom of Information Act. The emails further show that “settlement talks” with Entergy occurred in late October. In November, Arkansas and Entergy announced that the Public Service Commission had accepted a $142 million offer nearly identical to the one they had rejected in August 2022, leaving Louisiana and New Orleans as the remaining parties in the lawsuit. This settlement took the other parties by surprise. “We were shocked, to be honest,” Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis said by phone recently. “We didn’t see it coming. Settlements hadn’t been part of the extensive discussions [about the lawsuit] between Arkansas, Louisiana and New Orleans, because no new offer had been made.” Not long after the settlement was announced, a rumor began to circulate about what had transpired. “I was told that Mike Huckabee had been hired by Entergy to be a lobbyist or consultant for them with the Arkansas Public Service Commission,” Lewis said. “That is how the settlement got done.” Lewis said Entergy employees have privately confirmed Huckabee’s involvement to him. Entergy denies that Huckabee played any role in the settlement talks or anything else related to its business. “Entergy Arkansas has not employed Mr. Huckabee in any capacity,” said Kacee Kirschvink, communications manager for Entergy Arkansas. “No Entergy affiliate nor operating company, including Entergy Arkansas, has directly or indirectly engaged Mr. Huckabee in any capacity.” Entergy does not have a flawless track record of knowing what their subsidiaries and contractors are doing on Entergy’s behalf, however. In 2018, for instance, reporters discovered “supporters” of a new power plant in New Orleans were actually actors, paid by one of Entergy’s contractors to demonstrate on behalf of a proposed new power plant, contrary to Entergy’s denials. Two attorneys for other parties in the Grand Gulf suit, speaking separately to the Arkansas Times on the condition of anonymity, echoed Lewis’ claims. “I was explicitly told that Entergy hired the governor’s father” to make the settlement happen, one said. “I’m confident that Mike Huckabee was involved,” said the other. In any case, Arkansas likely could have secured a better deal, experts say. As the Public Service Commission noted when initially rejecting the offer last year, the amount that Arkansas settled for represented a fraction of what the state stood to gain if it was successful at trial. Lewis called the $142 million “woefully shy” of what Arkansas taxpayers deserved. Daniel Tait, a spokesperson for the Energy and Policy Institute, calculates that Arkansas stood to receive roughly $418 million if the state had continued the litigation. Collectively, the three states and the city of New Orleans asserted $1.16 billion in claims against Entergy, Tait explained – a $361 million claim for “imprudent operation” of the Grand Gulf nuclear plant between 2016 and 2020, primarily for what is known as “replacement energy,” and an $800 million claim related to an overall decrease in energy output from the plant from 2012 to 2020. Arkansas would have received 36% of any recovery in that suit, a higher percentage than either Mississippi or Louisiana. That amounts to about $276 million that Arkansas may have left on the table, according to Tait. Despite a settlement that amounts to roughly a third of what the state would have received at trial, Arkansas and Entergy have touted it as a good thing for Arkansans, as it “avoids ongoing costly litigation.” According to Entergy, the utility’s roughly 730,000 Arkansas customers will receive $100 million in billing rebates thanks to the settlement, starting as soon as Feb. 1.

DROUGHT Severe, extreme and exceptional drought afflicted many areas along the Mississippi River, with more than 65 percent of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas having some form of drought in September. Drought was a double-edged sword for Arkansas growers. On the plus side, drought helped suppress crop diseases and speed harvest. On the downside, the water-starved Mississippi River dropped to its lowest level ever at Memphis on Oct. 17, to minus-12.04 feet. Recent rains along its length in early December prompted a forecast rise to more than 3 feet by Dec. 18, followed by another drop into the negative numbers. ""We began to see the river levels fall about a week earlier than last year,"" said Hunter Biram, extension economist for the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture. ""On Aug. 29, we saw barge freight rates start to tick up. Last year, the rates began to move Sept. 6.

'2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': ""An anonymous former state employee came forward Friday claiming to have evidence that the Arkansas governor’s office doctored documents and unlawfully withheld financial records that should have been made public under the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA. Attorney Tom Mars, who is representing the whistleblower, sent a letter today to Sen. Jimmy Hickey (R-Texarkana) offering to have his client speak to auditors. Hickey yesterday requested that Legislative Audit, a nonpartisan agency independent from the executive branch, look into what’s come to be known as “podiumgate.” The controversy concerns the $19,000 purchase of a lectern (or podium) by the governor’s office from an out-of-state events company earlier this year, as well as Gov. Sarah Sanders’ successful efforts to newly block access to certain governmental records. Sanders recently pushed the state legislature to write a new exemption into the Arkansas FOIA in an attempt to prevent Matt Campbell, the Little Rock lawyer behind the Blue Hog Report blog, from accessing those records. Campbell’s FOIA requests uncovered the lectern purchase to begin with. In the letter, Mars said his client can prove that someone in Sanders’ office altered documents that Campbell had requested through the Arkansas FOIA and that Sanders’ office pressured another government agency to withhold from the public documents that should have been made available. His client is willing to give a statement to legislative auditors under oath, Mars said, and can provide documents for them to review. These documents will substantiate my client’s firsthand knowledge of how certain persons in the Governor’s Office, including the Governor’s Communications Director, interfered with the production of non-exempt FOIA documents TSS intended to produce to attorney Matt Campbell, to wit: a) by altering a non-exempt document to give it a different meaning and directing TSS not to produce the unaltered original document to Mr. Campbell; b) by withholding other non-exempt documents, including documents reflecting some of the Governor’s Amazon purchases; c) by removing portions of non-exempt e-mail threads; and d) by directing the TSS lawyer who was responsible for responding to the FOIA requests to deliver a “flash drive” to the Governor’s Office with TSS’s proposed responses and thereafter returning the sanitized version to TSS on a “flash drive” – all for the purpose of concealing that the Governor’s Office had altered an invoice from Beckett Events LLC and deliberately omitted from the production of responsive documents a number of documents that were not even arguably exempt from the FOIA or subject to any legal privilege. You can read Mars’ full letter here. Mars, a former Arkansas State Police director under Sanders’ father, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, has become a loud critic of the Sanders administration. A bombastic social media presence, he’s also a high-profile attorney for college sports figures. He’s previously represented Arkansas parents who sued over the state’s prohibition on mask requirements in public schools. Cortney Kennedy, chief counsel for the governor’s office, was sent a copy of Mars’ letter. Sanders spokeswoman Alexa Henning has not yet responded to an email seeking comment. Henning is the “Governor’s Communications Director” referenced in Mars’ letter. Upon reading Mars’ letter about the anonymous whistleblower, Campbell said it “matches exactly what I have seen and what I’ve expected was happening from the start.” Campbell’s quest to uncover documents about government spending, and his subsequent lawsuit when Arkansas State Police attorneys denied him access to those documents, drove the governor and her supporters to seek a rollback of Arkansas’s longstanding government transparency law earlier this month. Meanwhile, Campbell said he plans to refile a lawsuit today against the state police. Campbell dropped his suit the night before a Sept. 14 court hearing after testing positive for covid. These potential bombshells are just the latest in the ongoing saga over the outlandishly expensive lectern that Sanders bought under questionable circumstances. On Thursday, Hickey requested an audit into the purchase of that $19,000 lectern, bought from Virginia Beckett, one of Sanders’ longstanding consultants and owner of D.C.-based Beckett Events LLC, which identifies itself as “a full service events management company.” Hickey also wants an audit on records and information newly removed from public purview thanks to a change in the FOIA. Earlier this month, lawmakers voted to shield the governor’s travel- and security-related receipts and records in perpetuity. The new exemption to the FOIA is retroactive to June 2022, six months before Sanders took office. The governor’s retroactive power to withhold what’s always been public information, combined with the controversial lectern purchase, bear looking into, Hickey said yesterday. The lectern invoice from Beckett Events LLC blew up into a scandal on social media after Campbell uncovered a series of emails showing much internal confusion among state government employees tasked with processing the purchase. A government credit card limit had to be raised in order to cover the exorbitant price tag. While the invoice was paid in June, the lectern didn’t arrive for months. Fanning the flames was news that Beckett and her business partner, Hannah Stone, helped organize the Jan. 6 rally at the Ellipse in Washington, D.C., which was basically the pep rally for a rebellious rightwing horde to mob the U.S. Capitol. Beckett’s and Stone’s presence in Paris in June, at the same time Sanders was there, ostensibly on state business, sparked speculation that the $19,000 paid not for a lectern, but for a European trip. (With the governor’s travel records now retroactively off the table for journalists and the public to review, it’s hard to know.) Earlier this week, Sanders’ office allowed the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette to take pictures of the mysterious lectern, which turned out to be pretty basic. You can get the same thing online for a few thousand dollars, so the huge price tag Beckett Events LLC charged the state of Arkansas remains a mystery.
