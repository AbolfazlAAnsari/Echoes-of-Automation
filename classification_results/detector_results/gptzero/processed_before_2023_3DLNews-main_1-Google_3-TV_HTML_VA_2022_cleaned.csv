(WDBJ) - As WDBJ7′s Robin Reed announces his retirement at the end of 2022, we wanted to take a look back at his impeccable career as a meteorologist, news anchor and public servant to those in the WDBJ7 viewing area. In the spring of 1982, a young mustached man from Harrisonburg would be tasked at presenting the weather on your Hometown Station. Little did anyone know, WDBJ7 would become his permanent home for the next four decades. Robin hit the airwaves in the early ‘80s and was almost immediately thrown into forecasting some of the worst weather in our region’s history. While some relish the idea of the winter dusting, it was his calm, confident delivery during the historic flood of ‘85 that made Robin a household name, and a hero to budding meteorologists enamored by the atmosphere. Click here for other stories about Robin Reed’s retirement. One of those budding meteorologists was Michael Brennan, now Acting Deputy Director at the National Hurricane Center. Brennan interned with Robin Reed in the mid ‘90s as a student at Cave Spring High School. “Robin was always very encouraging of anything I wanted to try,” says Brennan. “I think about what I do now is so much about communication, and I think that seed was planted very early on in those experiences with Robin.” Countless interns went into the field of meteorology. However, Robin was also a master at molding and motivating those around him in his department. Countless weather team members have gone on to have successful, life-long careers in the industry. Frank Billingsly started with Robin at WDBJ in the early 1980s and is now a meteorologist in Houston. Billingsly has also gone on to have a 40-plus-year career as a meteorologist. “I want to thank you for your friendship and your mentorship when I was getting into the business and of course your leadership. I know the people of Roanoke Valley are going to miss you.” Cecily Tynan graduated Washington and Lee University and became the weekend forecaster at WDBJ7 in the early 1990s, training under Robin’s leadership. Tynan has had a long-lasting career as meteorologist at WPVI in Philadelphia since 1995. “Thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you’ve done for me and for other colleagues, and for him viewers over, you’re the best,” says Tynan. You may also remember Patrick Evans. The witty feature reporter and forecast started working at WDBJ in 1990, working alongside Robin Reed for a full decade. In 2002, Patrick moved to the Palm Springs area to work at KESQ, where has been ever since. “He [Robin] was a great mentor and teacher; that is obvious by the fact that he’s been working at Virginia Tech for many years,” says Evans. Some decided to stay closer to home, including NBC12′s Andrew Freiden, who worked with Robin in the late ‘90s. “I convinced Robin to give me the weekend weather job in 1997 and I’ve been doing it ever since. You really are amazing and you had a huge impact on a lot of people in the commonwealth and you had a huge impact on my life,” says Freiden, who has been the morning meteorologist in Richmond since departing from WDBJ in the early 2000s. “I also learned from you how to be gracious and kind, which was amazing to see in you. You were the big star, treated everybody equally and with kindness and I’ll never forget that,” says Freiden. Working on this story and hearing from how Robin inspired so many meteorologists has solidified that fact working alongside Robin was a one-of-kind experience, says chief meteorologist Brent Watts. Robin has inspired countless meteorologists over the years, many who remain in the business across the country. Stay with WDBJ7 each week in November as we look back at Robin Reed’s incredible career here at Your Hometown Station as he approaches his final days before retirement. Copyright 2022 WDBJ.

Casper, a 2-year-old Great Pyrenees, was standing guard over his flock of sheep one night in early November at his home in Decatur, just east of Atlanta. That’s when a pack of nearly a dozen coyotes got too close for comfort. Casper killed a whopping eight coyotes and managed to save all the sheep in his care. But Casper himself was badly hurt in the process. The dog had gaping wounds to his neck and side. He also lost his tail. Veterinary staff at Lifeline Animal Project – where Casper is still being cared for more than a month later – worried recovery wouldn’t be an option for the dog. “How bad are these wounds, and is it something that can be fixed? Or is it something that is beyond fixing? You know, that is what makes the quality of life an issue,” said Katrina Coleman, a vet tech at Lifeline Animal Project. But incredibly, Casper has healed better than they could have expected. Casper’s owner, John Weirville, is also amazed by his dog’s recovery. “I can’t even explain how good it is to see him right now, because I felt like there was no way he was going to live when I saw him (after the attack),” Weirville said. Weirville is the owner of Ewe Can Do It Naturally, a landscaping business that leases out flocks of sheep to clear away brush from properties, utilizing the natural instincts of sheep to munch on that debris. Weirville is also part of the Urban Shepherds, a nonprofit organization that promotes the grazing of sheep as a sustainable solution for managing landscaping. With his line of work, it’s not hard to see how valuable a dog like Casper is to Weirville. According to the Atlanta Coyote Project, it’s relatively common to spot coyotes wandering around the metro-Atlanta area, but it’s rare to see so many running together. “This is extremely unusual behavior for coyotes, and we suspect that there might be extenuating circumstances,” said Chris Mowry, a professor of biology at Berry College. Mowry, who works with the Atlanta Coyote Project to study the behavior of coyotes in the metro, said coyotes live in small family groups and they are rarely aggressive. “In this particular situation, the only thing that makes sense is if there was a large litter this year and the pups hadn’t yet dispersed,” Mowry said. “This could potentially make sense if there are lots of resources available, which sounds like it might be the case in this area of Decatur.” Casper isn’t out of the woods yet. The healing process will likely take several more months. Lifeline Animal Project is generously donating their care to Casper, which would have cost Weirville more than $15,000.

The 75-year-old Vietnam veteran was in big trouble after he fell out of his boat while fishing in the Appomattox River last week. ""When I reached back for the anchor rope, I just went right over,"" Goodwin said. For 30 minutes he clung to the side of the boat, trapped in freezing water. ""I got ready to turn loose a few times, just couldn\'t do it,"" he said. Just down the river, Chief Warrant Officer Chris Miserlian was setting up to go fishing after he finished class at nearby Fort Lee. Miserlian had his rod and reel but did not have something he uses every day — his hearing aids. ""I noticed a boat,"" Miserlian recalled about his time at the river bank. ""[Then] I thought I heard a cry for help."" Miserlian moved closer. ""I definitely heard somebody holler for help,"" he said. It was Goodwin. He was in the water where he\'d clung to his boat for more than 30 minutes. ""It was a miracle seeing him standing there, already waist-deep in the water and heading in my direction, it was a miracle,"" Goodwin said. But the rescue was not easy. ""The first thing that happens is I sink past my knees in some real sticking mud,"" Miserlian said. ""[Then] I noticed he was on oxygen, so I asked if he was breathing fine."" Unable to get Goodwin back in the fishing boat, Miserlian climbed aboard and started the trolling motor. ""I told the gentleman to hang on, we\'re going to pull the anchor and try to get to the boat ramp,"" Miserlian said. It worked and eventually both the soldier and the veteran were on dry land. ""It was a miracle, there\'s no getting around it,"" Goodwin said. The duo reunited at the river this week to meet each other under calmer circumstances. ""Thank you so much,"" the veteran said. ""You\'re welcome, anytime,"" the soldier replied. Entertainment'}]"
