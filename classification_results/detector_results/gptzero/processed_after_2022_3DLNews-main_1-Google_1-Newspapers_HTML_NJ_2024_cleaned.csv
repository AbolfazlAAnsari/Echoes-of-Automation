Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:34 am MADISON – St. Vincent Martyr School celebrated National Catholic Schools Week with a community service day and other opportunities to demonstrate school spirit from Sunday, Jan. 28 to Saturday, Feb. 3. The events were part of the nationwide celebration of Catholic education during the week. The week’s theme “United in Faith and Community” highlighted the schools’ focus on faith development, academic excellence, and dedication to community service. Students spent Tuesday, Jan. 30 working on service projects throughout the community. Eighth grade students visited Covenant House in Newark, alongside their peers from St. Gerard Majella School in Paterson. Two young residents whose families had abandoned them spoke to the students about the love and support they had found at Covenant House, which houses and educates kids experiencing homelessness. The students assembled and donated toiletry bags to be distributed to new arrivals at Covenant House. Seventh graders took a trip to the Community Food Bank of New Jersey (CFBNJ) in Hillside. They learned how the Food Bank distributes donations to soup kitchens, food pantries, shelters and feeding programs around the state. The students assisted in organizing and stocking the shelves in CFBNJ’s warehouse. Sixth grade students visited the students at ECLC of New Jersey in Chatham, an accredited nonprofit, educating students ages five to 21 with severe learning and/or language disabilities, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Down syndrome or multiple disabilities. Students read a kindness book to the ECLC students and then led kindness bingo. Some classes also made friendship bracelets together. In fifth grade, the students watched a video about the services offered by Catholic Charities and the Father English Food Pantry in Paterson. The children then made heartfelt cards to accompany the Grab ‘n Go Snack Bags they assembled. These bags, filled with snacks and love for people living on the streets of New Jersey or temporarily misplaced in shelters, will be distributed on Valentine’s Day. Canine visitors from the Seeing Eye in Morris Township came to SVMS on Tuesday. The third graders took a walk to the Madison Volunteer Ambulance Corps. The trip included a tour of the building and a demonstration of the ambulances and equipment. Formed in 1954, the Corps has responded to over 50,000 calls in the last 60 years. The students were asked to spread awareness about the need for new volunteers over the age of 18. Second graders, who will be celebrating their First Holy Communion this year, reached out to their counterparts at St. Gerard Majella School (SGMS) in Paterson. They assembled gift bags with prayer cards, bracelets and rosary beads to send to the SGMS students, accompanied by handmade congratulatory cards. First graders created cards with good wishes to be distributed to retired priests and nuns. Kindergarteners learned more about hunger in New Jersey through a presentation provided by Nourish NJ, which has spent more than three decades working to create lasting solutions to the problems of hunger, homelessness and poverty. The children packed “Rise & Shine Breakfast Bags” to provide vital nutrition for local families. Preschoolers brightened the day of faculty and school staff members by assembling and hand-delivering goody bags filled with Hershey’s Kisses. “We appreciate the support we receive from the community, and we encourage our students to give back through service projects all year,” said Principal Sister Noreen Holly. “It’s part of our effort to provide a well-rounded education.” The kids participated in Mass and a Living Rosary prayer service. They were also treated to a BMS bike assembly about bicycle safety on Monday and ice cream sundaes on Friday. School families gathered on Sunday for the Opening Liturgy and a breakfast to kick off Catholic Schools Week, and got together on Thursday evening for a Family Pasta Night. Log In BE YOURSELF.

Pro-Palestinian student activists reiterated demands for a ceasefire in Gaza and for the University to divest its endowment from companies associated with Israel‘s military activity in Gaza at a walk-out rally outside Nassau Hall on Friday. At around 100 people, attendance was lower than at previous protests. Interspersed among urges for action on campus were wide-ranging calls that connected the Palestinian cause to larger issues of colonialism and oppression, with most opposing a two-state solution. “A two-state solution is just another way to say settler colonialism,” Patrick Jaojoco GS, the secretary of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), said in a speech during the rally. Jaojoco also represented the Princeton American Indian & Indigenous Studies Working Group. Other speakers included students from Students for Prison Education, Abolition, and Reform (SPEAR) and the Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA). Sireen Sawalha, a Palestinian-American activist and local high school teacher, also spoke about her experiences living in Jenin in the occupied West Bank. “The viable solution for both nations is to be one state,” Sawalha said in an interview with the ‘Prince,’ noting that people of multiple ethnicities and racial backgrounds are now able to live together in the United States despite its history of slavery and racial segregation. “This talk about Israel giving back an inch of land, it’s a dream for the Palestinians. And I don’t believe that the Netanyahu government will give any inch back.” Sawalha previously generated controversy on campus in 2022 for holding a sign at a vigil memorializing her brother Iyad Sawalha, who was a leader in the Islamic Jihad accused of killing 31 people in attacks on Israeli buses in 2002. Sireen Sawalha has since co-authored a book about her family and her brother’s involvement in armed resistance. Her speech on Friday did not prominently feature him. Speakers from the Princeton Israeli Apartheid Divest coalition (PIAD) also reiterated the demands of a petition released in December for the University to disassociate its endowment from companies “that profit from or engage in the State of Israel’s ongoing military campaign, occupation, and apartheid policies.” The petition also calls on the University to refrain from associating with Israeli academic institutions and businesses, and to cultivate affiliations with Palestinian academic and cultural institutions. At the rally, protestors chanted, “Israel bombs, Princeton pays. How many kids did you kill today?” Organizers have drawn comparisons with Princeton’s selective divestment from companies affiliated with apartheid South Africa in 1978 — the culmination of organizing efforts beginning in 1969. Other speeches connected the issue of Palestine to wider issues of colonialism and empire. “We all live under the illegal occupying force of America, a structure of empire that has continued to colonize lands globally,” Jaojoco said. “A call for an immediate ceasefire in Palestine is just the first step to justice.” During the rally, Ari Powell, a parent of a Princeton student, stood in the middle of the crowd and shouted intermittently at protestors while recording on his phone. “What about the hostages?” he called, prompting boos and chants of “shame” from some protestors. In an interview with the ‘Prince,’ Powell said that he was trying to initiate dialogue during the rally. “I was absolutely astonished that [the protest] was happening on the campus at Princeton,” he said. “I did interject politely, in my opinion.” Powell also said that he did not attempt to engage with any of the rally’s speakers, some of whom remained after the protest outside Nassau Hall to speak with attendees. A second, longer rally at Palmer Square on Saturday also called for a ceasefire and sought to bring attention to the impacts of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. Ellen Li ’24, an SJP organizer who spoke at the rally, does not see the broader issue of Israel and Palestine as “complicated.” “But I understand that people need to arm themselves with the knowledge to be able to come to that conclusion,” she said.

At Tuesday’s Commencement, around 1,300 undergraduate degrees and 600 graduate degrees were awarded. Though there were no significant disruptions, during President Eisgruber’s Commencement speech over 70 students stood up and faced away from him, and around 15 students walked out.

have you covered. The last-ever paper SAT was administered in December. Whether you’re planning to take the SAT in a test center on a weekend or in school on a school day, a new, completely digital version of the exam will be administered across the U.S. beginning on March 9 after the College Board, the company that develops and administers the SAT, piloted the digital test in 2021. NorthJersey.com talked to two tutoring companies, Ridgewood-based Aspen Tutoring and Manhattan-based Bespoke Education, to learn what’s new and answer key questions. No — the more streamlined test is about two hours long now. And there will be shorter reading passages rather than a few long texts, the College Board said. The digital test questions cover the same concepts as the paper version, but there are formatting differences on the digital test and two substantive changes in the English section, said Sarah Burton of Aspen Tutoring. The first is that vocabulary features more prominently on the digital test than on the paper version. “On the SAT test that we have been tutoring since it was last revamped in 2016, vocabulary was almost absent,” Burton said. “There was so little of it, but now they are bringing it back, not in a major way, but it is more prominent.” The other substantive difference is what Burton calls “synthesis questions.” These read like bullet points or notes on a topic. The test taker is asked to synthesize the information contained in those bullet points in response to a question. The test is now adaptive, meaning it occurs in two stages, or modules. The second stage changes depending on your performance in the first stage. For both the English and math sections, the difficulty of Module 2 changes based on student performance in Module 1, with targeted questions that are harder if you meet certain benchmarks in Module 1 and easier questions if you don’t. “Everyone has the same first section, and then that will feed you into either an easier or harder second module,” said Tim Levin, CEO of Bespoke Education. Unlike on the paper test, the digital test questions are worth more in the second module. To get those top scores in the 750 to 800 range, you really need to feed your way into the harder second module, Levin said. Students should be especially careful about making calculation errors or other mistakes in Module 1 of math, Burton said. Due to the test’s adaptive nature, the highest scores depend on how difficult the second module is, so students should play it safe by checking their work in the first module. If that second module feels too easy, students should not fixate on it out of a fear that they’re botching the test, said Meaghan Ozaydin of Aspen Tutoring. “Focus on what you know. Don’t get in your head about something being too hard or too easy. That’s a huge problem for kids. They get stressed out and it becomes paralyzing,” she said. Test takers can now move back and forth between questions within a module. They can preview later questions and review earlier questions, if time permits. Calculators are permitted throughout the test, but not required. The digital SAT has a built-in calculator for the math section. English has just two sections, called Reading and Writing. Students have 64 minutes to answer 54 questions. The questions and time are split evenly between the two modules. The math section has a total of 44 questions that need to be answered in 70 minutes. Here, too, questions and time are split evenly between modules. Yes, but it doesn’t have to be a No. 2 for filling in answer bubbles. A pen or pencil can be used for scratch work. Also, bring snacks and drinks to be kept under your desk during testing, and a Wi-Fi-enabled device that has enough charge to last three hours on which to take the test. Schools usually supply devices if students don\'t have their own. Students who need to borrow a device from the College Board will need to register and request their device earlier than the registration deadline — at least 30 days before test day. Yes, because the digital test has tools and widgets, including a calculator that students must familiarize themselves with, said Levin, of Bespoke Education. Download the Bluebook app from bluebook.app.collegeboard.org and use the SAT Test Preview. The preview familiarizes students with digital testing tools needed during the test to cross out answers, display or hide a countdown timer and do other tasks. “It’s important to get used to the various tools that they have available on the Bluebook app,"" Ozaydin said. ""That\'s really helpful if you want to learn how to cross out options and flag questions and learn how to most efficiently navigate the test.” The app also has four sample tests students can use to practice. That’s “a decent amount of material,” Burton said, but less than what tutors are used to. “We normally have so much material to work with, and now we have four tests,” she said. Yes, registration is open for the spring 2024 digital SAT. You can check dates and deadlines satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/dates-deadlines and find a test center close to you at satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/test-center-search. The deadline to register for the March 9, 2024, sitting of the digital SAT is Feb. 23. The deadline for the May 4 session is April 19, and the deadline for the June 1 exam is May 16. With teen mental health and stress related to college admissions a growing problem in schools and among youth, it isn\'t clear whether the digital SAT will be any less stressful overall, despite its shorter length and digital format. Burton said Aspen Tutoring tries to mitigate student stress by “taking the temperature of the room” during classes and putting the SAT’s importance in perspective — as one piece of a larger puzzle, be it college or life. “I do think it’s a less intimidating test than the old one, and I think for kids this will be a benefit,” Burton said. ""In general, what the College Board has said is that scaling is not going to change, so 1400 on the paper test is the same as 1400 on the digital,"" Levin said. Students who took the test last year in Europe, where Bespoke has an office, are “doing at least as well on the digital SAT if not better,” Levin said. It\'s “intuitive,” and kids are finding it easier to take once they’ve practiced, he said. The pandemic saw many colleges and universities switch their admissions policy to go test-optional, but the consensus among experts is that highly competitive schools still consider the SAT and the ACT. And the SAT is still a top predictor of eventual college success. So SAT scores could be returning as an admissions requirement. “This is the wave of the future. SAT scores are an important data point,” Levin said. Dartmouth College, an Ivy League institution, has reinstated SAT scores as an admissions requirement beginning with undergraduate applicants for the Class of 2029, after doing away with it for four years. Dartmouth found that low-income students who did not submit scores that they thought were too low were likely passed over for admission to the school in the test-optional system. A “misperception” about high and low scores can harm students, the university said. “A score that falls below our class mean [or average] but several hundred points above the mean at the student\'s school is \'high\' ... it has value as one factor among many in our holistic assessment,” it said in a statement.'}]",

World Heritage International Student Exchange Program (WH), a non-profit, public benefit organization, is seeking local families to host foreign exchange students this coming school year. World Heritage students come from a variety of countries worldwide: Italy, Denmark, Spain, France, Germany, Ukraine, Japan, Australia, to name just a few. They are between the ages of 15 and 18 years, and they are enthusiastic and excited to experience American culture, family life, school, sports. etc., according to WH. The exchange students have pocket money for personal expenses and full health, accident and liability insurance. World Heritage students are carefully selected based upon academics and personality, and host families choose their student from different backgrounds, countries and personal interests. World Heritage also offers qualified American students the opportunity to learn another language and culture by spending a school year, semester or a summer with a host family in another country. If interested in hosting an exchange student or becoming an exchange student abroad, please call Debra Garbon at 1-800-888-9040, visit www.world-heritage.org or send an email to info@world-heritage.org to request more information or start the application process.

But the club went dormant and only made a comeback in Fall 2022. “Last year was all about trying to restart the club, and we’re here and thriving more than ever,’’ said fourth-year biomedical engineering major and former club president Anjeli Santillan. Among the club’s remarkable achievements is the tale of Wico the Toucan. Because of a shattered beak, Wico struggled to eat and drink.

Another success story is that of Luna, a shelter dog with severe paralysis in her back legs that caused her to move by scooting, which was horribly uncomfortable for her.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:34 am Long Valley’s Kenzie Caro, center, has started a tutoring program using other West Morris Central High School students in helping kids from Pre-Kindergarten to eighth grade with their studies as part of her Girl Scout Gold Award Project. She is flanked by friends Kailyn Davan, left, and Ryan Taylor who are also student tutors. WASHINGTON TWP. — Kenzie Caro can’t understand why every student can’t have a free tutor if they need one. The West Morris Central High School junior is of the firm belief that everyone should help each other. That’s why she picked tutoring as the subject for her Girl Scout Gold Award. Now at the Washington Township Public Library, nearly every afternoon students ranging from pre-school to eighth grade are coming in and being matched up with high school tutors to help them in a variety of subjects. “Tutoring is a lot of money,’’ Caro said. “I wanted it to be free for everyone from Kindergarten to eighth graders because they deserve to have education without paying for it. I also am planning to become a teacher in the future. I wanted to get an extra push in that direction.’’ Caro is one of six girls in her Long Valley Troop 95640 who are still active in Scouting. She wanted to get her gold award like her mother, Danielle, received before her. She tried several different ideas before falling into tutoring. She may have gravitated to it because she has had tutors herself over the years and benefitted from their work with her while dealing with Attention Deficit Disorder. So she arranged to have students from Pre-K to eighth grade get matched up with high school tutors, many of the tutors are her friends on the West Morris Central Marching Band. “The high schoolers can earn volunteer hours,’’ Caro said. “Once I say they have to tutor kids, they are not so into it but once I say you get volunteer hours for college if you do it then they are into it.’’ Caro has had as many as 10 high school students volunteer at one time or another and she chips in to do the tutoring herself when she is a tutor short. Caro’s friend Ryan Taylor, a senior at West Morris Central, has found becoming a tutor to be rewarding. “Kenzie is a good friend of mine,’’ Taylor said. “I heard about her Gold Award project. I wanted to contribute in any way I could. When I found out that she was doing a tutor program, I figured I would be a good help.’’ Taylor has learned on the fly how to tutor different types of students with the program. “Today (Feb. 6) I worked with a second grader with autism,’’ Taylor said. “It was a little bit of a challenge. Once I figured out how to capture his attention, it proved to be a little bit easier for me. Last week I worked with a sixth grader.’’ The program started on Jan. 11. Caro needs 80 hours of tutoring to achieve her goal and she has already received 36 hours, so she is well on her way. It may be the intangibles of organization, discipline and confidence that she may have gained the most in launching the venture. To get the program going, she received advice from librarians at Washington Township as well as the Chester Library’s Mary Butden which currently runs a similar tutoring program. “It was Amanda (Ort) that referred her to the (Chester) Library,’’ her mother Danielle Caro said. “They had a program and she gave her a lot of tips on how they used the Mendham High School for tutors.’’ Her mother can see how much her daughter is benefitting from her project apart from just attaining an honor. “Absolutely,’’ Danielle Caro said. “She has to talk to adults. She has ADD and sometimes she has trouble finding her words. ADD is a focus issue. This is all helpful.’’ Her daughter agreed. She said she is also benefitting from the leadership skills she is learning. “I learned a lot about leadership, organization and stepping up when things go wrong,’’ Caro said. “I get stressed very often. This has helped me combat the stress. I have to think of what is happening and not what is going to happen.’’ Caro and her friends intend to run the program well into the spring. Like some Gold Award projects, it may continue long after Caro is finished with it if an individual or organization decides to pick it up. Students who could benefit from having a free tutoring session can contact her at tutor4today24@gmail.com.

by a rookie in National Football League (NFL) history. The second overall pick in the 2023 NFL draft, Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud already looks like a future superstar in the league. On Sunday, he threw for 470 passing yards and five touchdowns, completing over 70% of his passes in a 39-37 victory for the Texans over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Stroud, as just a rookie, broke both former Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck’s passing yards record and Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Marcus Mariota’s passing touchdowns record of four touchdowns. Texans wide receiver Noah Brown really stepped up this week, with six catches for 153 yards and a single touchdown. On the other hand, wide receiver Tank Dell keeps proving why he was a steal in the draft as a third-round pick, with another game of six catches for 114 yards and two touchdowns. Wide receiver Nico Collins also took a step up, catching 36 passes for 631 yards and four touchdowns, including 51 yards and a touchdown last week. Wide receivers John Metchie III and Robert Woods, who were supposed to be the top pass catchers on the offense coming into the season, have fallen to places five and six respectively, as tight end Dalton Schultz continues to look like one of the best tight ends in the game. Stroud helped Schultz catch 10 passes for 130 yards and score a touchdown that week, which supported this offense. If Stroud keeps up this performance, the Texans could potentially make the playoffs this season and contend for Super Bowls in the following years. The Greatest Performances in the 2023 ICC World Cup The 2023 International Cricket Council World Cup has had many great moments, but here are the best players as of Nov. 8. Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell had a performance for the ages, scoring 201 runs while hitting 21 fours and 12 sixes. These were the most important innings so far for any team playing in the World Cup, as the Australian team was originally going to lose to Afghanistan by over 150 runs. Being down seven wickets with only 98 runs to show, Australia only had three wickets to work with as they required 170 runs in 120 balls to win. The chance of winning was less than 1%, but as Maxwell stepped up to strike, he scored 158 runs and finished the match with a World Cup record for 14 fours and 201 runs scored. This was massive, as he not only almost locked in Australia’s chances at a spot in the semi-final, but also kept a six-game winning streak going, which helped the team move Afghanistan back into sixth place. This World Cup has also featured a great performance by Indian bowlers, including the stars Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, and Kuldeep Yadav. They helped hold Sri Lanka to 55 runs while getting all the batsmen out and the South African team to 83 runs. Shami had 16 wickets in four matches, taking five wickets twice and completely dominating opposing batsmen with a bowling economy of 4.30. If they continue this, India has a chance at winning the World Cup for the third time. Vol. C | Fall | Issue VIII Victor Wembanyama Dominates the NBA The San Antonio Spurs’ rookie prodigy, number one overall pick, and power forward Victor Wembanyama is taking the National Basketball Association (NBA) by storm. The seven-foot-three star has shown his ability to check off all the boxes by shooting three-pointers, playing great defense, running down the court for dunks, and making successful passes. A performance like this is very uncommon; the taller an NBA player, the less they can maneuver on the court, aside from a few exceptions such as Los Angeles Lakers’ Lebron James. Throughout the first five games of this season, Wembanyama has averaged 20.6 points per game, 8.6 rebounds, two blocks, a steal, and two assists each night. The Spurs, which had 22 wins last season, already has three wins in their first five games, and it looks like Wembanyama is a huge contributing factor to their success. Other team players have also picked up a lot of the slack. Notably, point guard Keldon Johnson has averaged 15.2 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 4.4 assists a night. By far, however, their second-best player has been shooting guard Devin Vassell, who has averaged 19.4 points per game. Center Zach Collins has also taken a huge step up, having averaged 13 points and six rebounds every game. Collins has also become a significant enough threat to the opposition to save Wembanyama more than a few trips down the floor. As this team continues to develop, it will be interesting to see how they grow and whether head coach Gregg Popovich can bring the Spurs back to the playoffs. NFL Leaders During Week 8 Here were the leaders at each specific category during their games in the eighth week: Best Quarterback: Washington Commanders’ Sam Howell Stats: 397 passing yards, four touchdowns, one interception Result: 38-31 loss to Philadelphia Eagles Best Running Back: Detroit Lions’ Jahmyr Gibbs Stats: 26 carries, 152 rushing yards, one touchdown, five receptions for 37 receiving yards Result: 26-14 win over Las Vegas Raiders Best Wide Receiver: Dallas Cowboys’ CeeDee Lamb Stats: 12 receptions, 158 receiving yards, two touchdowns Result: 43-20 win over Los Angeles Rams Best Tight End: San Francisco 49ers’ George Kittle Stats: nine receptions, 149 receiving yards Result: 31-17 loss to Cincinnati Bengals Best Defensive Player: New York Giants’ Kayvon Thibodeaux Stats: six tackles, three sacks, a forced fumble Result: 13-10 Loss to New York Jets Vol. C | Fall | Issue VII The Eagles Are Still the Best Team in the NFL: After last week’s embarrassing performance against the New York Jets, everyone had given up on the Philadelphia Eagles and its quarterback Jalen Hurts, but the team is back after taking down the extremely hyped Miami Dolphins, who has had a win-loss rate of 5-2. The defense of the Eagles was able to contain the high-flying Dolphins offense that was averaging almost 39 points per game coming into the week. Eagles linebacker Haason Reddick had four tackles for loss, cornerback Darius Slay had four tackles and one big interception, pass rusher Josh Sweat had two sacks, linebacker Nolan Smith had a sack, and both defensive linemen Jalen Carter and Jordan Davis created eight quarterback hits throughout the game. The primary goal in this game was to have the Eagles eliminate all the Dolphins’ big plays, which is exactly what happened as Miami’s running back Raheem Mostert had nine carries for 45 yards. A back who averages about 100 yards per game completely fell short of the mark, which caused more passing plays for the Dolphins but was held to about six yards per catch. Wide receiver Tyreek Hill, also a Most Valuable Player Award candidate, only had eight yards per catch and had his second-lowest total of the season. Quarterback Tua Tagoviloa couldn’t find his second-best receiver Jaylen Waddle much either as Waddle finished with a season-low in receiving yards for a game this season. Meanwhile, as mentioned before, Hurts continued cooking up defenses as he limited the turnover this week by only throwing one interception while having two passing touchdowns and 279 passing yards. Wide receiver A.J. Brown finished with more than 120 receiving yards for the fifth straight game after catching 10 balls for 137 yards and a touchdown. Tight end Dallas Goedert finally looked like himself again after catching five passes for 77 yards and a touchdown. Finally, out of the backfield running back D’Andre Swift had 75 all-purpose yards while helping a lot with the blitz-blocking schemes. The Eagles really is that team that can win the Super Bowl, and with the amazing addition of former Tennessee Titans safety Kevin Byard, they will keep dominating as they have been for the previous decade and so on.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:34 am DOVER- A 37-year old former Dover man has been found guilty of several counts of kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault. The man, Jessie Meneses, was found guilty by a jury on Friday, Feb. 2. Morris County Prosecutor Robert J. Carroll, Chief of Detectives Robert M. McNally, Dover Chief of Police Jonathan Delaney, and Randolph Chief of Police Will Harzula detailed the guilty verdict in a release issued Tuesday, Feb. 6. According to authorities, the jury returned a guilty verdict on Feb. 2, following a six-day trial. The defendant was found guilty of two counts of first-degree kidnapping, three counts of first-degree aggravated sexual assault, three counts of second-degree sexual assault, three counts of third-degree aggravated criminal sexual contact, three counts of fourth-degree criminal sexual contact, one count of third-degree terroristic threats, one count of third-degree conspiracy to commit witness tampering and third-degree witness tampering. A sentencing date has been scheduled for March 8, before Superior Court Judge Stephen J. Taylor. The defendant will remain in custody until that time. At sentencing, the kidnapping, aggravated sexual assault and sexual assault convictions are subject to the No Early Release Act (NERA), which make the defendant ineligible for parole until he has served 85 percent of the sentence imposed. The charges arose from an incident that occurred on Sept. 5, 2021, in Randolph, when the defendant sexually assaulted his ex-girlfriend in his vehicle, officials said. Additionally, he transported and confined her from Randolph, through Victory Gardens, and ultimately to Dover, where she was able to escape and report Meneses to the police. Members of the Dover and Randolph Police Departments and the Morris County Prosecutor’s Office Sex Crimes & Child Endangerment Unit investigated the incident after being notified of the victim’s disclosure. On or between April 1, 2022, through Oct. 5, 2022, Meneses communicated with family members about contacting the victim to have her change her version of events or withdraw the criminal action, police said.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:34 am WEST CALDWELL TWP. – The Township Council hired a new water foreman and acting superintendent of public works and presented the Kiwanis Club of Caldwell-West Essex for its 100th anniversary during the Tuesday, Feb. 6 meeting. The public works job is going to Michael Tempesta, brother of Mayor Joseph Tempesta. Michael Tempesta will make $105,000 a year. The water job is going to Dominic Rehbein who will make $70,000 a year. “It feels great, yeah,” said Michael Tempesta, who is originally from West Caldwell and now lives in Rockaway Township. “I’m very excited to start working with the public and trying to just help them as best I can.” Tempesta has been working for the township for 21 years and replaces the recently retired John Pressler. Tempesta started as a laborer and worked his way up to foreman and finally to acting superintendent. He said his job involves a lot of paperwork and budgeting details. Tempesta also said he hopes to redo the baseball field at Francisco Park and to improve the township’s storm waterways because flooding has been an issue. “I love working with the public,” Tempesta said. “I mean, it’s a great town to live in, and I’m hoping just to keep it that way.” Rehbein has been working for the township for almost four years and is replacing the previous foreman Pete May. He and the three workers he’s in charge of take care of residents for water meters and main breaks, along with doing mark-outs, field phone calls and taking samples. He said the township is very good at putting money towards utilities, and he hopes to continue that and keep the water safe, as it’s been for as long as he knows. “We have a great group of guys all around, just to work with,” Rehbein said. “So I don’t mind working with the public, but I do like the fact that the guys that are underneath us are all good guys. And they’re all hard workers, so I think that makes it a lot easier to do your own job when you have the support behind you.” Kiwanis Honored Upon giving a resolution honoring the Kiwanis Club for its centennial, Council President Michael Crudele noted that Mayor Tempesta always says that volunteers are the backbone of the community. “So on behalf of Mayor Tempesta and the rest of the governing body, I would like to thank all of our Kiwanians for this amazing accomplishment and all of their service to the community,” Crudele said. Kiwanian and West Caldwell resident Jessica Almeida, the club’s immediate past president, said the club is always accepting new members, and anyone who is interested should attend a meeting at 12:10 p.m. every Thursdays at the Cloverleaf Tavern. “We are just so fortunate that we’ve been able to be a part of this organization which has been a part of our community for 100 years,” Almeida said. “And in researching the history of what we’ve done, it’s amazing how many programs we’ve started, how many things we’ve funded, how many scholarships we’ve given including to college and high school students. So it’s an amazing organization. We’re always accepting new members, so if you ever wanted to check us out, please do.” Pool rates increase In other business, the council approved a resolution to increase the pool rates for 2024. For West Caldwell residents, membership will cost $540 for families if paid before Wednesday, April 24. The family rate will cost $585 if paid after April 24. These rates in 2023 were $515 if paid before April 28 and $585 if paid after April 28. The family rate includes two parents and all unmarried children 25 and younger. For individual West Caldwell residents 12 years and older, the cost this year is $315 if paid before April 26 and $345 if paid after April 26. Last year, these costs were $300 and $330, respectively. For individual West Caldwell residents 62 and older, this cost is $135 if paid before April 26 and $145 if paid after April 26. Last year, these costs were $130 and $140, respectively.

in Texas revolves around a disagreement over razor wire, but it has escalated into a standoff over who controls a section of the Texas-Mexico border. The situation has become a broader political and cultural issue, with other states sending National Guard members and a convoy of trucks heading for the tiny town of Eagle Pass, Texas. At issue: Texas is continuing to erect razor wire across a 29-mile stretch of the riverbank in Eagle Pass, despite opposition from the Biden administration and a January U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing federal officials to cut down the wire. The White House said after the ruling that the razor wire makes it dangerous for federal border agents to do their jobs, including to give aid to migrants. Even after the high court ruling, Texas has barred U.S. Border Patrol from entering Shelby Park, a city-owned park near the Rio Grande where migrants had been entering by the thousands in recent years. The state continues to put up additional razor wire. Meanwhile, migrants have continued making the treacherous crossings, but the park itself has seen a drop in crossings since December. Last summer, USA TODAY reported that razor wire was causing serious injuries – sometimes to children – including bruises, broken ankles and deep gashes that needed medical staples to close. Here\'s what to know about the contentious fight over how to patrol the border, and the often tragic consequences. The Texas National Guard is installing razor wire along the southern border despite the ruling, as part of Gov. Greg Abbott\'s efforts to prevent migrants from entering the U.S. ""This is not over. Texas\' razor wire is an effective deterrent to the illegal crossings Biden encourages,"" Abbott said on social media on the day of the Supreme Court\'s ruling Jan. 22.

DeSantis said the state will soon send up to 1,000 members of its National Guard.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:34 am MORRIS PLAINS – Elimination of the 3-year-old age group in Morris County’s Integrated Preschool Program was proposed during a meeting of the Morris Plains Board of Education on Tuesday, Jan. 23. They “haven’t had the response,” to this age group that they expected, said Catherine Jenisch, the school business administrator and board secretary, while explaining the decision. In light of this change and due to rising demand, the board plans to offer full days of class for the 4-year-old age group during the 2024-25 school year. “Most people want more of a full day,” for the program, said Jenisch, before saying that they will begin offering class for full days at double the cost during the next school year. This change would include class from 8:40 a.m. to 2:10 p.m. for $1,200 a month for each child enrolled. She noted that the board would have a motion of approval for these changes during the next meeting, scheduled for Tuesday, Feb. 6. Mountain Way School announced the change to offer all day class for the 4-year-old group on its website and is reopening requests for available spots in the program. The announcement noted that parents who have already applied for the half day program do not need to reapply and that students for the program are chosen through a lottery system. Applications for the program must be submitted in person to the Mountain Way School by Friday, Feb. 2. The board also discussed the merits of the program, saying that it is run by teachers and is an educational program, rather than a daycare. A mother with twins asked if there was any discount for having two children in the program at the same time, according to Jenisch. The board agreed that there should not be a discount, no matter how minimal, after a brief discussion. The board expressed unanimous agreement with Vice President Adam Higgins when he said the preschool “isn’t like daycare,” and instead the children, “are actually going through a program.” ‘Not A Babysitter’ “It is not a babysitter. There are certified teachers in that room. They have been trained; they are professionals. For that reason, I agree with Adam,” said board member Maria Manley, while explaining her decision. Some board members also brought up that, historically, their program has not offered discounts. One board member noted that when her children were in the program at the same time, she did not “remember doing anything like that.” Other board members spoke about how other preschools that do offer discounts for siblings, usually only offer symbolic discounts. They said that, generally, the discount is around 10 percent, which Higgins said “is so nominal.” Before closing the discussion, the board noted that even at full price the program still costs less than almost everywhere else. School Calendar Finalizing the school district calendar for the 2024-25 school year was also a major discussion topic of the meeting. Board members emphasized that they thought the school year should start in September rather than August. Board President Christina Perry said Superintendent Mark Maire sent the board drafts of the proposed calendars for their review and discussion. The proposed calendars are not available to the public. The major issue in the discussion regarded the start date for school. Most board members said they did not believe it is necessary to open school to students as early as August. The board agreed that the school year should start after Labor Day at the earliest. Despite a lot of districts moving toward starting in August, board members acknowledged that even if the district started at the same time, the calendar would not be completely aligned with other districts’ calendars because of other reasons, like election days. “As long as we have the big vacation weeks aligned,” with nearby districts, he agreed with the different start dates, said Higgins. Perry noted that the calendar would be voted on during the next meeting. Log In BE YOURSELF. We do not accept and will not approve anonymous comments.

wondering what to expect of the new all-digital SAT, we have you covered. The last-ever paper SAT was administered in December. Whether you’re planning to take the SAT in a test center on a weekend or in school on a school day, a new, completely digital version of the exam will be administered across the U.S. beginning on March 9 after the College Board, the company that develops and administers the SAT, piloted the digital test in 2021. NorthJersey.com talked to two tutoring companies, Ridgewood-based Aspen Tutoring and Manhattan-based Bespoke Education, to learn what’s new and answer key questions. No — the more streamlined test is about two hours long now. And there will be shorter reading passages rather than a few long texts, the College Board said. The digital test questions cover the same concepts as the paper version, but there are formatting differences on the digital test and two substantive changes in the English section, said Sarah Burton of Aspen Tutoring. The first is that vocabulary features more prominently on the digital test than on the paper version. “On the SAT test that we have been tutoring since it was last revamped in 2016, vocabulary was almost absent,” Burton said. “There was so little of it, but now they are bringing it back, not in a major way, but it is more prominent.” The other substantive difference is what Burton calls “synthesis questions.” These read like bullet points or notes on a topic. The test taker is asked to synthesize the information contained in those bullet points in response to a question. The test is now adaptive, meaning it occurs in two stages, or modules. The second stage changes depending on your performance in the first stage. For both the English and math sections, the difficulty of Module 2 changes based on student performance in Module 1, with targeted questions that are harder if you meet certain benchmarks in Module 1 and easier questions if you don’t. “Everyone has the same first section, and then that will feed you into either an easier or harder second module,” said Tim Levin, CEO of Bespoke Education. Unlike on the paper test, the digital test questions are worth more in the second module. To get those top scores in the 750 to 800 range, you really need to feed your way into the harder second module, Levin said. Students should be especially careful about making calculation errors or other mistakes in Module 1 of math, Burton said. Due to the test’s adaptive nature, the highest scores depend on how difficult the second module is, so students should play it safe by checking their work in the first module. If that second module feels too easy, students should not fixate on it out of a fear that they’re botching the test, said Meaghan Ozaydin of Aspen Tutoring. “Focus on what you know. Don’t get in your head about something being too hard or too easy. That’s a huge problem for kids. They get stressed out and it becomes paralyzing,” she said. Test takers can now move back and forth between questions within a module. They can preview later questions and review earlier questions, if time permits. Calculators are permitted throughout the test, but not required. The digital SAT has a built-in calculator for the math section. English has just two sections, called Reading and Writing. Students have 64 minutes to answer 54 questions. The questions and time are split evenly between the two modules. The math section has a total of 44 questions that need to be answered in 70 minutes. Here, too, questions and time are split evenly between modules. Yes, but it doesn’t have to be a No. 2 for filling in answer bubbles. A pen or pencil can be used for scratch work. Also, bring snacks and drinks to be kept under your desk during testing, and a Wi-Fi-enabled device that has enough charge to last three hours on which to take the test. Schools usually supply devices if students don\'t have their own. Students who need to borrow a device from the College Board will need to register and request their device earlier than the registration deadline — at least 30 days before test day. Yes, because the digital test has tools and widgets, including a calculator that students must familiarize themselves with, said Levin, of Bespoke Education. Download the Bluebook app from bluebook.app.collegeboard.org and use the SAT Test Preview. The preview familiarizes students with digital testing tools needed during the test to cross out answers, display or hide a countdown timer and do other tasks. “It’s important to get used to the various tools that they have available on the Bluebook app,"" Ozaydin said. ""That\'s really helpful if you want to learn how to cross out options and flag questions and learn how to most efficiently navigate the test.” The app also has four sample tests students can use to practice. That’s “a decent amount of material,” Burton said, but less than what tutors are used to. “We normally have so much material to work with, and now we have four tests,” she said. Yes, registration is open for the spring 2024 digital SAT. You can check dates and deadlines satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/dates-deadlines and find a test center close to you at satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/test-center-search. The deadline to register for the March 9, 2024, sitting of the digital SAT is Feb. 23. The deadline for the May 4 session is April 19, and the deadline for the June 1 exam is May 16. With teen mental health and stress related to college admissions a growing problem in schools and among youth, it isn\'t clear whether the digital SAT will be any less stressful overall, despite its shorter length and digital format. Burton said Aspen Tutoring tries to mitigate student stress by “taking the temperature of the room” during classes and putting the SAT’s importance in perspective — as one piece of a larger puzzle, be it college or life. “I do think it’s a less intimidating test than the old one, and I think for kids this will be a benefit,” Burton said. ""In general, what the College Board has said is that scaling is not going to change, so 1400 on the paper test is the same as 1400 on the digital,"" Levin said. Students who took the test last year in Europe, where Bespoke has an office, are “doing at least as well on the digital SAT if not better,” Levin said. It\'s “intuitive,” and kids are finding it easier to take once they’ve practiced, he said. The pandemic saw many colleges and universities switch their admissions policy to go test-optional, but the consensus among experts is that highly competitive schools still consider the SAT and the ACT. And the SAT is still a top predictor of eventual college success. So SAT scores could be returning as an admissions requirement. “This is the wave of the future. SAT scores are an important data point,” Levin said. Dartmouth College, an Ivy League institution, has reinstated SAT scores as an admissions requirement beginning with undergraduate applicants for the Class of 2029, after doing away with it for four years. Dartmouth found that low-income students who did not submit scores that they thought were too low were likely passed over for admission to the school in the test-optional system. A “misperception” about high and low scores can harm students, the university said. “A score that falls below our class mean [or average] but several hundred points above the mean at the student\'s school is \'high\' ... it has value as one factor among many in our holistic assessment,” it said in a statement.'}]",

Retaining residents Coughlin “We have a moral obligation to make sure everyone can find affordable housing in our state,” said Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, D-19th District and a sponsor of A4. According to Coughlin, the measure addresses one of the biggest affordability problems in our state. “This bill will help our residents stay in the Garden State.” “We want people to stay and thrive in New Jersey and having access to affordable housing is key to that goal,” said Assemblywoman Yvonne Lopez, D-19th District, also a bill sponsor. “A4 offers a pathway for our municipal partners to deliver on their constitutional obligations with a consistent and uniform process that empowers them to build the housing required of them in a manner they see fit.” “Today’s vote is good news for New Jersey families who are struggling to keep up with skyrocketing housing costs,” said Adam Gordon, executive director of Fair Share Housing Center. “This legislation puts New Jersey on a path toward historic gains in affordable housing production over the next decade. “By setting forth clear rules now, municipalities and everyone else involved will understand what’s needed to address New Jersey’s dire housing shortages,” Gordon continued. “We look forward to working to get a final version of the bill on the governor’s desk soon, and ensuring that bill on the governor’s desk soon, and ensuring that bill is the strongest version of the bill possible, especially around making sure that new affordable over time.” The legislative package still needs to clear the Senate. After that, it heads to Gov. Phil Murphy’s desk to be signed into law.

Justice (ICJ), South Africa has hurled accusations in its case that Israel has carried out genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The world has watched South Africa distort the truth, their legal team telling the court that Israel intends to cause “the destruction of the population” of Gaza. They also called for an immediate ceasefire in Israel’s campaign to destroy Hamas, a terrorist organization bent on the destruction of Israel and all Jewish people. There are many glaring falsehoods in South Africa’s accusations. For one, Israel’s war is against Hamas, not the civilians of Gaza. South Africa’s accusations ignore the actions of Hamas. They frame this war as though Israel was responsible for the genesis of it. As a reminder: Hamas attacked Israel on October 7. They raped, pillaged, and murdered 1,200 civilians, kidnapped 240 Israelis, including one South African, leaving 200,000 Israelis displaced. They decimated entire neighborhoods and kibbutzim. Over 120 hostages are still being held by Hamas in Gaza. Israel has a right to defend itself, and no country would tolerate the wanton slaughter of its innocent population. Israel has done its best to avoid civilian casualties among the Palestinians in Gaza, but Israel’s hands have been tied because of the way Hamas uses the civilian population of Gaza. Hamas uses the civilians of Gaza as shields behind which to hide its terrorists and their weapons. They fire their rockets from schools, hospitals, mosques, and civilian neighborhoods. Israeli hostages who have been released as part of the exchanges have said that they were held in hospitals. They have also said that Israel has been right all along when it said that the hospitals in Gaza were Hamas strongholds, filled with armed terrorists and weaponry. The suffering of Palestinian civilians has been tragic, as is the suffering of all civilians during wars. This suffering, however, is a direct result of the actions of Hamas— and that suffering began long before October 7. Billions of dollars in international aid that was intended to help the population of Gaza was instead used by Hamas, both to enrich its leadership and build a vast network of tunnels and weapons factories. Israel respects International Law, so much so that it goes through unprecedented lengths to protect Palestinian people. Israel repeatedly warns Gazans to leave areas where there is heavy fighting. It is Hamas that abuses its power and keeps their civilians in harm’s way. As Tal Becker, Israel’s Foreign Ministry’s legal advisor, put it: “If the term ‘genocide’ can be so diminished in the way that [South Africa] advocates, if provisional measures can be triggered in the way that it suggests, the convention becomes an aggressor’s charter. It will reward, indeed encourage, the terrorists who hide behind civilians, at the expense of the states seeking to defend against them.” This case by South Africa is a disgrace. It’s a subversion of the credibility of the Genocide Convention, which was first established in 1948 in the wake of the Holocaust. Given South Africa offered no credible evidence, any fair-minded court should dismiss this case. It is a shame that such a biased and negligent case could be brought against Israel, particularly in light of the true genocide Jewish people have suffered in our history. There are many glaring falsehoods in South Africa’s accusations. For one, Israel’s war is against Hamas, not the civilians of Gaza. South Africa’s accusations ignore the actions of Hamas. They frame this war as though Israel was responsible for the genesis of it. As a reminder: Hamas attacked Israel on October 7. They raped, pillaged, and murdered 1,200 civilians, kidnapped 240 Israelis, including one South African, leaving 200,000 Israelis displaced. They decimated entire neighborhoods and kibbutzim. Over 120 hostages are still being held by Hamas in Gaza. Israel has a right to defend itself, and no country would tolerate the wanton slaughter of its innocent population. Israel has done its best to avoid civilian casualties among the Palestinians in Gaza, but Israel’s hands have been tied because of the way Hamas uses the civilian population of Gaza. Hamas uses the civilians of Gaza as shields behind which to hide its terrorists and their weapons. They fire their rockets from schools, hospitals, mosques, and civilian neighborhoods. Israeli hostages who have been released as part of the exchanges have said that they were held in hospitals. They have also said that Israel has been right all along when it said that the hospitals in Gaza were Hamas strongholds, filled with armed terrorists and weaponry. The suffering of Palestinian civilians has been tragic, as is the suffering of all civilians during wars. This suffering, however, is a direct result of the actions of Hamas— and that suffering began long before October 7. Billions of dollars in international aid that was intended to help the population of Gaza was instead used by Hamas, both to enrich its leadership and build a vast network of tunnels and weapons factories.

Veto it Parsippany PAL Flag Football Championship: Celebrating Athletic Excellence and Community 4,000 Attend Parsippany Memorial Day Parade to Remember and Celebrate Heroes Local Parsippany Teen Wins Miss Teen USA 2023 Title PARSIPPANY — “..And Miss Teen USA 2023 is….” Those words seemed to hang in the air forever among the bright lights of the Grand Sierra Resort’s grand ballroom and auditorium in Reno, Nevada, that September evening in 2023 as Barbara and I held hands and closed our eyes… “Miss Teen New Jersey, UmaSofia Srivastava”! Time seemed to stop, and then there was sheer pandemonium. The music, cheers, and chaos in the auditorium ensued around us as we instinctively stood up and looked up at the jumbotron, part in disbelief, joy part… there she was, our daughter, with tears flowing down her beautiful face, the Hope crown being placed on her head with a gaggle of young women obscuring her from our view. Here she came, so close but yet so far, larger than life on the big screen among the din, the Miss Teen USA sash around her, walking down centerstage. Everything else is a blur of TV cameras, bright lights, and confetti. “The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step” – Lao Tzu. Our journey from an ordinary immigrant family culminating into this unusual happenstance began in the Fall of 2021 when our daughter, 14, saw an ad for the Miss Teen USA pageant. She was charmed by the happy picture of all the smiling young women swarming to support the winner. Being an only child of mixed heritage, of Indian and Mexican parents (what are the odds?), she had had a challenging path fitting in oftentimes throughout her young life, belonging to both cultures, but not quite, her American-ness, sometimes a plus sometimes not, among the immigrant gatherings and get-togethers, not quite one or the other. She asked us if she could participate in the New Jersey contest next April 2022 to see what it was like to feel the sisterhood and support showcased, pointedly asking, “Who will she be?” What was the deciding factor for us, you may wonder? Hard to believe, but it was the fact that the contest was being held at the Parsippany Hilton, a stone’s throw from our home. Knowing nothing of pageants, alongside her wanting to try yet another new thing, sealed the deal. Seeing her with the Morris County sash among all the girls having fun was fun for us. When it all ended, she was declared the First Runner Up, one of the youngest at the contest in 2022. We were so happy to see her having fun. As it turned out, this event was among the many where UmaSofia stepped out of her comfort zone and leaned into the changes and challenges she encountered in 2022. What was amazing about this experience was not what she lost or won but how she rose to each challenge and the people she encountered, as did we, as her parents. I must admit, many stereotypes were broken in my and Barbara’s minds, having never experienced anything like this before but for an occasional story on the news or a casual viewing on TV. When 2023 came around, we talked as a family to see if she wanted to take another gander at this “pageant thing.” The chance to see her friends, some of whom had competed for many years, encouragement, urging, and support from special mentors and strong and accomplished women who came in contact with her during the 2022 event was a big factor. In addition, the venue was too good to pass up – you might have guessed it, The Parsippany Hilton! This time, the result was, shall we say, a bit different. Seeing our daughter exchange her Morris County Teen sash for the one that proclaimed “Miss Teen New Jersey” was truly surreal. New Jersey has been our home all her life, a big part of our family story. Whether it was walking The Green in Morristown, strolling in Central Park of Morris County with our dogs, teaching her to ride her bike, running behind her as she toothlessly rode, leaving me in the dust, or just driving down Ridgedale Avenue, either Barbara or I would have ever conjured up the thought that our daughter would one day represent not just Morris County but our home state of New Jersey on the national stage! The months that followed that win as Miss Teen New Jersey USA 2023 were a balancing act of academics and her duties, crisscrossing the entire state of New Jersey for charity events, parades, concerts, and fashion events, some alongside the newly crowned Miss New Jersey, some by her lonesome, always with us in tow just out of sight. It has been a true privilege for us as a family to experience everything together as she served and fulfilled her duties as Miss Teen New Jersey USA for those months. Our town, county, and the great State of New Jersey deserve to be called among the very best in America to raise a family. The majestic statehouse and the proclamation, the hospitality of the New Jersey Senate, the July 4th parades, and various charity events she participated in have made truly special memories for our family and her. Before we knew it, the months between April and September of 2023 sped by, and the national competition in Reno, Nevada, was looming. Competing against other equally accomplished young women, all winners of their states, quite a few of them in college, drove her to commit to a discipline of physical fitness, intense study sessions preparing for the grueling personal interview, all the while keeping up with her excellent academic record, extra-curricular activities and to re-double her efforts towards her charity work and charities close to her personal beliefs and passions, something she has been doing since she was very young, way before any pageant. She credits the nickname “Baby Jaguar” I call her as the inspiration for writing and illustrating her book “The White Jaguar,” but she is giving me too much credit. The truth is her drive; her capabilities are all her own, shaped by the values we try to live in our home. Between her book coming out and all the events across the great state of New Jersey and visiting other pageants, the period of her Miss Teen New Jersey USA 2023 reign seems a whirlwind. In 2023, the month of September was spent in final preparations of the state costume of New Jersey (“the Honey Bee” – inspired by “Li’l Bee,” the nickname Barbara gave her as a baby), all the details that needed to be worked out. When we say pageantry is a team sport or family sport, we speak from experience. There was so much to learn about the contest and prepare to put the best foot forward to represent New Jersey on the national stage, not to mention the travel arrangements, the logistics, and everything in between. The event in Reno was held September 26-29, 2023, at the Grand Sierra Resort in Nevada. Once the event began, we saw very little of her as the contestants were sequestered and put through an intense regimen of 4:00 a.m. wake-up time till midnight, days filled with activities that required them to be at their best. A judge is somewhere around the corner or perhaps in the crowd at every turn. The only analogy I can think of is an athletic event, where the coaches and scouts always look you over, even when you are not on the field/track/pool. It is INTENSE. For us as parents there, along with 50 other sets from each state, the worry was if she had eaten, was getting enough sleep, and was enjoying herself and having fun. Truthfully, winning/losing is not part of the equation. It never has been for us. It was a sense of pride for us that her state costume showcased New Jersey’s state insect, the Honey Bee, and won first place, so intertwined with her personal story. Her charities were centerstage and brought awareness to her signature issues: childhood education for underprivileged children through the Lotus Petal Foundation and literacy through the Bridge of Books Foundation, a charity right here in our home state of New Jersey. Her book “The White Jaguar” becoming a bestseller was honestly icing on the cake. With a win at any competition comes the statisticians. The pageant world, as we came to find out, is no different: first-ever crown for New Jersey in the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageant history, first-ever winner where both parents are immigrants from completely different cultures (Indian and Mexican), first winner, to speak multiple languages, first-ever winner of National costume and Miss Teen USA crown at the same event from the'}]",

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:34 am TO THE EDITOR: As concerned members of the League of Women Voters of Morristown Area, we wish to express both our collective disappointment and ongoing opposition to the New Jersey Legislature’s recent efforts to weaken the Open Public Records Act (OPRA). TO THE EDITOR: March 12 is Equal Pay Day. But this isn’t a celebration. Despite the Equal Pay Act being introduced more than 60 years ago, gender and racial pay gaps persist. TO THE EDITOR: The staggering amount of distortions and lies in the bizarre column ""The Real Hamas-Israel Villain"" that you ran apparently without benefit of fact-checking or any regard to truth is shocking and irresponsible. TO THE EDITOR: As I did in 2019 and 2021, I am again proud to be a strong supporter of women\'s rights and climate champion Christine Clarke for election this year to the New Jersey State Senate, even though the recent redistricting means that I am not in her new 25th legislative district. It… TO THE EDITOR: It’s the day after former President Donald Trump was indicted. It’s not a happy day for the nation, frankly, no matter “what side” you are on. We\'re always interested in hearing about news in our community. Let us know what\'s going on! TO THE EDITOR: At the start of the Dec. 13 Randolph Board of Education meeting, Board President Ronald Conti made the following statement: TO THE EDITOR: It’s been said many times before that “water is life.” TO THE EDITOR: My husband and I moved to Randolph in the hopes of starting a family in a safe town filled with programs, an enriched library, excellent schools, and supported emergency services. TO THE EDITOR: I am writing this letter in support of Joe Hathaway for Town Council member in Randolph. TO THE EDITOR: I am writing to express my strong support for Joe Hathaway and his Randolph Township Council team of Mark Forstenhausler, Marie Potter, Lou Nisivoccia and Helene Elbaum in the November 8 election. TO THE EDITOR: My family has lived in Randolph since 2007 and I have had children in our schools for 15 years continuously and will have them in our schools for another 13 years. TO THE EDITOR: I am writing to express my support for Joe Hathaway for Randolph Township Council in the November election. TO THE EDITOR: I am writing this letter to the editor because I support Joe Hathaway for Randolph Township Council. TO THE EDITOR: When I first met Todd Schleifstein outside the middle school hall waiting to get into the Board of Education meeting a couple of months ago, he seemed like a nice guy. TO THE EDITOR: Once again, we’re at a pivotal time as we decide which Board of Education candidates would best represent the best interests of our students and their families. TO THE EDITOR: It’s been said many times before that “water is life.” The world as we know it simply cannot exist without adequate supplies of fresh, clean water. But we have not always valued and protected this vital resource. EDITOR: A vote for Joe Hathaway is a vote for the next generation of Randolph Township leadership. EDITOR: As a former Randolph Township Council member, I am very familiar with the requirements of the position. TO THE EDITOR: The Upper Raritan River Watershed in Hunterdon, Somerset and Morris counties is more rural and agricultural than industrial - but that doesn’t mean we’re free from the threat of chemical contaminants in our drinking water supplies. TO THE EDITOR: The U.S. Congress is facing the opportunity of a generation to bolster the economy of New Jersey and the country while simultaneously addressing the existential threat of our lifetimes – climate change. TO THE EDITOR: In many places across New Jersey, failing and outdated water infrastructure threatens the public’s health. TO THE EDITOR: In my childhood home, there was an underlying tension beneath the silence following my father’s war service in Vietnam. TO THE EDITOR: With the final votes counted, I am very happy and greatly appreciative to have won the primary and the opportunity to once again represent the Morris Republicans as one of three candidates for County Commissioner this November. TO THE EDITOR: We see all around us the wonder of spring and the anticipation of enjoying the bounty of our New Jersey farms ready to be fulfilled. TO THE EDITOR: As we celebrate ""Teacher Appreciation Day"" today (Tuesday, May 3), it’s an opportunity for us to reflect on our teachers’ contributions which make a lasting impact in the lives of children every day. TO THE EDITOR: The Randolph High School Class of 2020 may have had its senior year cut off abruptly due to the pandemic and finished it out online, but wow, it sure has left Randolph with one final accolade – being ranked in the top eight of high schools nationally by U.S. News. TO THE EDITOR: Richard Lawton is the executive director of the New Jersey Sustainable Business Council and helps lead the council’s “Clean Water is Good for Business” campaign. TO THE EDITOR: The Alzheimer’s Association 2022 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures report illustrates the continued rise and burden of Alzheimer’s in our country, and in New Jersey. TO THE EDITOR: I am writing in response to Richard Lawton’s opinion article “A Neighborhood Solution for Combating Flood Risk,” published on March 17. TO THE EDITOR: In 1978 I was working as a reporter for The Bernardsville News, one of several weekly newspapers owned by the Recorder Publishing Company, when my employers asked me to start and edit a new paper in a fast-growing Morris County town. TO THE EDITOR: It is disappointing, but not surprising the Randolph Township school board reaffirmed its November decision to end the traditional, two-day observance of Rosh Hashanah -- in a town whose history is rooted in the Jewish-American story. TO THE EDITOR: A year ago today (Jan. 6), I stood in the House Gallery as an angry mob, sent by the president of the United States, stormed the Capitol with the intention of preventing Congress from carrying out the will of the people and certifying our election. TO THE EDITOR: Under Gov. Murphy’s leadership, New Jersey has established itself as a national leader in fighting gun violence by enacting life-saving, common sense gun safety laws. TO THE EDITOR: Recent storms have underscored with heartbreaking clarity how vulnerable our area is to the extreme weather that climate change is bringing. TO THE EDITOR: Sadly, our community lost a benevolent citizen and former President of the Historical Society of Old Randolph, TO THE EDITOR: Can we trust the press? TO THE EDITOR: Board of Education noise… It’s time to listen neighbors and friends. TO THE EDITOR: While serving on the Randolph Board of Education, I had the opportunity to work with Allison Manfred on the Board as a whole and especially on the Education Committee, of which I was chairperson. TO THE EDITOR: Over the past few years, we have seen current Board of Education members refuse to answer questions from the public and openly criticize and attack residents who disagree with or challenge them. TO THE EDITOR: Of all of the elections we take part in as Americans and New Jerseyans, I believe there are none more important than our local school board. TO THE EDITOR: The COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic has required all of us to rise above unexpected challenges. TO THE EDITOR: Of all of the elections we take part in as Americans and New Jerseyans, I believe there are none more important than our local school board. EDITOR: School board elections are not supposed to be about Republican or Democrat. TO THE EDITOR: When Savia and I built our house in 1990, we already had a home business for eight years. TO THE EDITOR: New Jersey residents continue to be extremely concerned about the invasive Spotted Lanternfly (SLF), leading the New Jersey Department of Agriculture to field many phone calls, emails, and other messages asking what residents can do when they find SLF in their communities. Editor\'s note: The following letter was sent to Randolph Board of Education President Tammy MacKay TO THE EDITOR: Randolph PEACE would like to invite you to join us for a Celebration of Freedom on Saturday, June 19 at Brundage Park on Carrell Road Randolph. To beheld from 2 to 3 p.m., the free event will be hosted to celebrate Juneteenth. Editor\'s note: The following letter was sent to the Randolph Township Board of Education. The writer is a member of the Knights of Columbus Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton Council, 6904 in Hanover Township.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:34 am BRIAN GIBBONS TOM MILLER JIM GANNON THE CHATHAMS - Police Chief Brian Gibbons made it highly clear to the public in a Zoom seminar on Thursday, Feb. 1 that police are as concerned over auto theft as the community. The seminar came amongst considerable public concern over a rash of stolen car cases in the region. Gibbons was joined by representatives of the Chatham Borough Police Department, Chatham Township Police Department Chief Tom Miller, and several law enforcement experts. Among them were Morris County Prosecutor Bob Carroll, Morris County Sheriff Jim Gannon, and FBI Special Agent Rob Henratty. Chief Gibbons said he was highly thankful for residents’ efforts in removing key fobs and keeping doors locked. According to Gibbons, the borough saw eight stolen high end vehicles in 2020, 19 in 2021, 22 in 2022, and 10 last year. So far this year, the borough has had two, both from Fairmount Avenue driveway in an early morning burglary on Sunday, Jan. 14. Sheriff Gannon encouraged residents to support legislation which would create stricter punishments for auto theft. He affirmed that criminals are indeed being tried and convicted for auto theft, and that county police’s clearance rate is higher than the national average. “We know the issue’s escalating, and we got to take it to them. I think it’d be bipartisan support in regards to this, as these are real issues affecting real people,” he said. Chief Miller said the response has been nearly identical in the township, explaining that many surrounding law enforcement agencies use similar tactics, including license plate readers, directed patrols, thermal imaging and property checks. There were five stolen cars in 2020, none in 2021, one in 2022, and one last year. Miller said he believes the thieves might be beginning to migrate southward from Route 24, however. As residents have heeded warnings to keep their vehicles secured, criminals have switched to breaking into houses in order to steal keys, Miller explained. Neither chief believes that this will evolve into carjacking – Gibbons said that the last carjacking in the borough was more than a decade ago, while the township has never had one. New Jersey State Police Sgt. Cory Rodriguez said he believes this is due to how serious a charge carjacking is, though he did recall the famous carjacking-murder at the Short Hills Mall in 2013. According to Gibbons, many thieves striking in the Chathams are juveniles coming in from other counties. These thieves, upon arrest, will be tried in Morris County, he added. Prosecutor Carroll explained that the rash of car thefts are being committed by those in networks, and are not simply “joy-riders just grabbing a car and going for a ride.” “These are network criminals who are looking for, hunting for certain cars, stealing the cars, then creating the market for those cars, so that they’re put into a system where they can be disposed of, but more often than not are used in other crimes,” he said. Gibbons separately noted that a recent stolen car case brought borough police down to the shipping port in Baltimore, where one car was recovered. All relevant information, Carroll said, is shared to municipal police by both the Morris County Auto Theft Task Force and the New Jersey Auto Theft Task Force, along with several federal partners. Auto theft cases have and will be referred to the state and even the federal government should the circumstances allow, and prosecutors often seek the maximum sentences. According to Agent Henratty, New Jersey officials are collaborating in a way stronger than ever before. One stolen car ring which struck the region led to arrests in Newark, in southern Florida and in Georgia, he recalled. Sgt. Rodriguez explained that stolen cars are not simply driven into a seaport, as seen “on Season Two on The Wire,” but are often loaded into a container in a back-alley warehouse, or perhaps on a dirt field with a mobile dock ramp, or even in the city with a forklift. Many criminals have also started falsifying shipping documents. Most containers are not searched upon departure from the United States, he added, but instead upon arrival, to prevent weapons from entering the country. The containers are placed on ships bound for far off countries such as Nigeria and Togo, where there are lucrative markets for luxury SUVs. As more than 400,000 containers leave the ports in the New York-Newark metropolitan area every month, searching a singular container is “like a needle in a haystack.” Decreasing Paranoia While the police present did not actively encourage residents to confront burglars, Gibbons acknowledged that when an intruder is in the house, it’s a homeowner’s right to defend their family. Gibbons encouraged residents to call 911 the moment they feel something is wrong, to set alarms, and to alert the police if they plan on being out of town for an extended period of time. He also asked residents to speak with an attorney for legal advice before considering arming themselves, and to secure their weapons as best they can. Most of the eight break-in attempts in the township, Miller added, were thwarted by barking dogs or by alarms. While residents should not be afraid to call the police, Gibbons said, they should not be paranoid. Police are looking for specific behaviors and actions that many subjects responsible for auto theft take, and are trained on what to look for, and there is no need to report a car to the police simply because it was parked on the road between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m., or because it was driven by two juveniles. Quite a few stolen car cases are caught by the automated license plate readers, set up at strategic points throughout both the Chathams and the region. When police do suspect a stolen car or a burglary, he said, the requisite resources and personnel are deployed, after which they will take what actions are required. Actual police pursuits are highly frowned upon in such a densely populated area, though police will do what they can to catch those responsible. When the license plate reader gets a hit, multiple law enforcement agencies become aware and will chase down and attempt to apprehend the occupants as soon and as safely as possible. Be it reassurance or calming paranoia, Gibbons noted that the rash of stolen car cases in the region “is a perfect example of why we need to be careful what we post on social media, as the idea that we’re not engaging criminals, whether they’re stealing motor vehicles or entering homes, is utter nonsense.” This sort of misrepresentation, he said, is highly damaging, creating anxiety and perhaps paranoia. He told residents who are not aware of exactly what is going on not to create falsehoods, and if they have any concerns, to phone the police instead of simply going on social media. “We will always engage suspects who come into town to commit violations as simple as stealing or committing shoplifting, or as serious as breaking into homes when people are there. We will always engage them,” said Gibbons. “What we do when we engage them depends on the particular case.” BRIAN GIBBONS TOM MILLER JIM GANNON CHATHAM - All six cars stolen from borough homes so far this year have been recovered, Police Chief Brian Gibbons said in a letter to the comm… Log In BE YOURSELF.
