My teacher encouraged me to write songs and encouraged my love for music. Eventually, I graduated from Berklee College of Music, studying guitar, production, recording, and mixing. Early songwriting was therapy for me during high school. I was quiet and reserved but had a lot of emotions. I filled so many notebooks, trying many ideas.

My anxieties hold me back in life. I wrote this song five years ago and recently self-produced it in my home studio. “Step Outside” is a song to encourage yourself to take risks and be yourself. I wrote this song realizing that I was missing out on so much because I feared many things. This song also challenged me to feel confident about releasing music myself.
