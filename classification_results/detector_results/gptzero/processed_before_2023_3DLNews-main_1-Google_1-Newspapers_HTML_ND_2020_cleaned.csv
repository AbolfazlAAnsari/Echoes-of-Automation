We have the capacity to respond to every situation with faithful grace. It is possible to smile in all circumstances and be kind. Being the winner or loser is an opportunity to demonstrate character. Let’s demonstrate the best of ourselves. Shaped in the image of God, we can choose to display the good. 1. Read your opponents. Consider the feelings of those on the other side. If your sports team wins and you have a friend who is a fan of the other team, you might have a fun tradition of humorously teasing the loser. Enjoy that. But if your colleagues at work are very politically divided, it may not be appropriate to show up the day after an election in full attire of your candidate strutting and making disparaging remarks to the other side. Read the room. Think of other people’s feelings, and the impact of your actions. Grow empathy. 2. Congratulate the winner or console the loser. With genuineness reach across the aisle. You often see professional football players from opposing teams shake hands and speak words of support to each other immediately following a game. The quarterbacks will come together and coaches to show good sportsmanship and name that experience as a good game. In life, how we speak to our opponent after a contest matters. In our workplaces, sporting events, and political arenas; our character shows. Show up well, naming the strengths and skills of your opponent whether you lose or win. Compliment, uplift and appreciate the abilities God created in the other person/team/organization. Let your humility and grace abound. 3. Know yourself. If you have a history of a bad temper, set yourself up for success by having a plan to give yourself space from other people. Maybe the best plan for you is to immediately remove yourself from a location of people to process a loss privately. Maybe you know yourself to be an active gloater, so you plan to take a walk right after a game, a promotion, or an election decision. Give yourself space to feel and express the emotions of the moment apart from other people. The aim is to avoid doing things you might later regret. We can all strive to do better, but if you know your current weaknesses with how you handle winning or losing, give yourself space to be you in a way that does not injure relationships or your reputation. 4. Emphasize the positives. What are you grateful for in that experience? What did you do well, regardless of the outcome? Perhaps examining a political result allows you to notice the positive that there was a higher voter turnout and engagement than usual. Maybe you can celebrate the peacefulness of the process, or your personal restraint from name calling or insulting supporters of the other side leading up to Election Day. Find the good. Find what you personally did well and honor it. Mindset makes a difference in our resiliency after defeat or in our ability to enjoy a win. 5. Make space for feelings. Grieve if you’re hurt. Settle into the emotion for a moment. Grab the Netflix and the ice cream and a blanket and just be sad for a moment. Don’t bottle it up. It’s okay to feel and release it. Celebrate if you were victorious. Make a toast. Call someone who will share your joy and express it together. Enjoy the moment privately. We can be considerate of other people’s feelings without negating our own. Give time to your reaction. It’s good to care enough to have an emotional response to an outcome. Honor it. 6. Pray in preparation for what’s next. Invite God into the experience of loss or victory. Offer to God your gratitude for what went well. Ask for guidance in what can be learned. Ask for self-control and humility, that selflessness and compassion might rule you. Give to God any anxiousness or grief. Request direction for what you can do next. If you win a promotion you might want to ask for guidance on how to navigate the transition to this new position, and wisdom to equip you for the new task. You might ask for gentleness and the right words as you encounter colleagues who competed for the same promotion and did not receive it. If a promotion is lost, you might ask for hope as one door closes that another one will open, and patience as you wait. Prayer is not just for before the game, the promotion, or the election. Prayer is powerful for how we handle the results and prepare for the future. It’s not just our young people who need to be taught about how to avoid being a sore loser or an obnoxious winner. As adults, we need to work on losing and winning well too. There’s a ton of victories in your future and disappointments too. Let’s invite God to equip us and lead us well in these moments. This is where our light can really shine! Elaine Sveet is the former pastor of First Lutheran Church in Rugby.

The coronavirus pandemic has shortened many Academic Year in America (AYA) members\' stays in North Dakota. AYA coordinator Cathy Scott of Spiritwood has helped to manage the stays of nine foreign exchange students since their arrival. Three of the nine students have returned to their home country since the pandemic. A decision regarding the other six has still to be made. ""If a student was to become sick here and hospitalized and not be able to fly home on her original date that could present another problem or concern,"" Scott said. ""(Parents) were also concerned about her insurance coverage. Those are the two big concerns that the virus has caused with the foreign exchange program."" Scott said potential issues with travel visas expiring have also been expressed to her, host families and the students themselves regarding dates. More qualms were raised regarding host families and the ability to support another person during the pandemic due to many businesses shutting down and workloads lightening. ""These are all reasons for the organization to encourage the kids to go home early and not wait this out,"" Scott said. ""It\'s not known if it is going to get better or if it is going to get worse or when it is going to end. It\'s hard for us here (because we are) thinking \'they are so safe here right now - why put them into something that is worse?\'"" ADVERTISEMENT One AYA host mom, Amanda Krueger, said she understood concerns but was apprehensive to send students back in the midst of the pandemic. North Dakota has seen 341 positive cases of COVID-19 since March 11 as of April 15. There have been nine deaths due to the virus in North Dakota. ""I get it but on the other hand we were more worried for them,"" Krueger said. ""They were here in North Dakota where it\'s probably safer than anywhere else."" North Dakota is one of four states in the U.S. with under 400 positive cases of COVID-19. Montana sits at 399 total cases while Wyoming sits at 282. Alaska has reported 272 positive cases since the outbreak of the virus. Krueger and her family hosted Amandine Declercq - a student from Belgium. She was enrolled at Jamestown High School as a junior though she had already finished her education in Belgium. Declercq and her parents communicated with the Belgian organization explaining the desire to stay in North Dakota until the virus was contained. ""Her parents didn\'t really want her to travel or head home either, they would have liked her to stay here but it was her Belgium organization that booked her tickets,"" Krueger said. A few weeks ago Declercq was told by the Belgian organization she would be able to stay with the Krueger family until her scheduled departure date of June 2. On April 3, Amandine received an email containing plane tickets and a flight itinerary that ordered a departure on April 5 at 7 a.m. Krueger said it was a challenging goodbye on both sides. ""She was a very likable, very sweet girl - we\'ll never have (a student) like her again,"" Krueger said. ""We were all very shocked. (The news) was tough on everybody."" Krueger said she thought Declercq had had a memorable experience as a foreign exchange student even though it was cut short. The family took trips to Minneapolis, Minnesota, and to Iowa. Before setting foot on North Dakota soil Declercq had only attended one hockey game and by the time her plane was on the way to Belgium the JHS junior had attended 63. ADVERTISEMENT The Krueger clan has communicated with her since leaving and confirmed her safe arrival back in Belgium. ""The organization feels they are just better off with their natural parents if they should become sick than they are if they are way over here,"" Scott said. ""Those are some of the concerns that have expressed."" In the midst of a challenging and concerning time for students and their biological and host families, some have deemed it safer to stay on American soil at this time. ""I would rather stay because the situation is so much better here for now,"" said Sofia Porro, an Italian student enrolled at JHS. "" I would go through a dangerous and scaring travel since all the flights may be canceled at any time. I might be stuck at one random airport for hours and I also would take 4 to 5 flights with long layovers between each one."" As of April 15, Italian health officials have confirmed 162,488 positive coronavirus cases in the country. There have been 21,067 deaths due to the virus in Italy. Worldwide the number of reported positive cases has reached 2,006,513 while the death toll has increased to 128,886. ""I feel good and happy here,"" Porro said of her situation. ""Everything became usual so it would be shocking to go back to my country and restart my ""old"" life, which would start with 14 days of quarantine in my room. Also, I go running outside almost every day here. In Italy, they are in a complete lockdown right now. That includes staying within 650 feet from their house which means they can\'t go for a run or a jog or a walk, just stay in their yard, which would keep me from running."" It is still to be determined if Porro will be one of the several foreign exchange students sent back home. Even though the possibility lingers and a wrench was thrown into Porro\'s expectations for the year abroad, she still encouraged others to consider spending time in a different sort of culture. ""Whoever has the possibility to do the year abroad, even if the idea of staying away from your family and friends for a long time could sound scary, it changes your life forever,"" Porro said. ""If you have the possibility to go for it. It’s crazy how different are things in another country.

Move over margaritas, because this simple tequila recipe can be put together in just minutes and will knock your socks off with its beautiful flavor. Paloma Cocktail Recipe SummaryThere really isn’t much to this drink. We mix up grapefruit juice, a little lime, some sweetener, optionally top it off with a bit of soda water and there you have it. This is a close cousin to a Greyhound that is just as good, if not better. I guess what I am trying to say is that I really like grapefruit and booze. If we are kindred spirits and you have the ingredients on hand, this can be yours to make. What Kind of Tequila Should I Use?Whatever you have! That being said, some tequilas are more appropriate and I would look to a young Blanco tequila to do the job for this drink. The good news is that there are some great Blanco tequilas available at great prices. We tend to keep a bottle of Espelon on hand for tequila drinks and if you are building a home bar, consider them as your staple Blanco tequila. What Kind of Grapefruit Should I Use?Generally, Pink or Ruby Red are great bets for this Paloma cocktail recipe, but really any kind of grapefruit works well. There are several varieties that can vary in tartness. Because we add sweetener to this cocktail, we will tend to neutralize any pucker from the fruit. Use what you can find, but sweet grapefruits work well in cocktails. Making Your Own Simple SyrupMaking simple syrup is really as easy as adding equal parts heated water and white sugar and mix until sugar is dissolved into the drink. Put it into a sealable container and keep it in the fridge. At your local liquor store, you would probably be able to find simple syrup on the shelves, but this is one of those things you can make at home and is really easy. Topping With Soda Water is Optional The origin of this drink is with grapefruit soda or probably more likely Squirt. A simple Squirt and tequila recipe might fall under the umbrella of Paloma cocktails and, not gonna lie, would probably taste great. We, however, are making ours with fresh grapefruit and while I don’t feel this needs soda water, nor do I use it in mine, you can top off my recipe with it. The Paloma Cocktail is a tasty treat to be enjoyed at any time of the year, but is especially tasty when Grapefruit is in season. So, now. Get out your tequila, grab a grapefruit, and bring your tastebuds along for this delicious adult beverage.
