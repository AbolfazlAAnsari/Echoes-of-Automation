state Attorney General Letitia James on Friday. A jury in Manhattan found top executives of the National Rifle Association liable after a six-week corruption lawsuit that she brought against the men. Two of the NRA\'s leaders, Wayne LaPierre and Wilson Phillips, have been ordered to repay roughly $6.4 million dollars between them. Their attorneys say they will appeal. ""This verdict is a major victory for the people of New York and our efforts to stop the corruption and greed at the NRA,"" James said in a statement. Just hours earlier a state judge in New York City finalized a ruling in another case brought by James, ordering former President Donald Trump to pay a total of $454 million in penalties linked to fraud allegations. He has 30 days to appeal. ""Donald Trump may have authored The Art of the Deal, but he perfected the art of the steal,"" James said at a news conference last Friday after the ruling against Trump was issued. She then took a shot at Trump\'s character: ""The scale and the scope of Donald Trump\'s fraud is staggering and so too is his ego and his belief that the rules do not apply to him."" James, 65, is a Democrat who made history as the first Black woman to serve as New York\'s attorney general. A Brooklyn native and a graduate of Howard University School of Law, she wasn\'t widely known outside New York City, where she served on the City Council and later in the largely ceremonial role of public advocate. But after just five years as New York state\'s attorney general, James has built a reputation as a giant-slayer, targeting — and in some cases, toppling — some of the most powerful figures and organizations in the United States. While her track record taking on and winning big cases has won James accolades, it has also drawn criticism. Trump and his allies have long claimed her choice of targets reflects bias on the part of an ambitious Democratic politician. ""We have a totally corrupt attorney general,"" Trump said during a news conference February 16th at his Mar-a-Lago property in Palm Beach, Fla., and he promised to appeal. ""She campaigned on the fact that \'I will get Trump, I will get Trump.\' Everybody\'s seen it,"" Trump added. Indeed, Trump\'s accusation that James is part of a political ""witch hunt"" is fueled in part by her own campaign rhetoric. When James ran for attorney general in 2018, Trump was still in the White House. She made it clear to voters that he was in her crosshairs. In one campaign video, James promised to ""take on President Donald Trump and anyone who tries to deny New Yorkers their most basic rights."" ""I\'m running for attorney general because I will never be afraid to challenge this illegitimate president,"" James said in another campaign video. After winning office, James gave an interview to NBC News in December 2018 where she promised to ""use every area of the law to investigate President Trump and his business transactions and that of his family as well."" She did as promised. During her first year in office, James successfully pursued her first civil lawsuit against Trump, filed initially by her predecessor, alleging he misused donations given to his charitable organization. Trump paid $2 million and his foundation was dissolved. ""These damages speak to the president\'s abuse of power,"" James said in a statement, adding that ""no one is above the law ... not even the president of the United States."" Despite agreeing to portions of the settlement, Trump fired back, denying wrongdoing and complaining he was being ""attacked by the political hacks in New York State."" In September 2022, James sued Trump again, this time on the fraud charges that led to last week\'s jaw-dropping penalties. During a news conference announcing the lawsuit,James acknowledged she would face criticism that her lawsuit is partisan. She said her investigation of Trump\'s business dealings ""only started after Michael Cohen, his former lawyer, testified before Congress about this conduct."" ""We have produced evidence about the scope, the scale, the depth, the breadth of the illegality, the fraud that personally enriched Donald Trump and his family,"" James said. Trump again blasted James, using a racially charged nickname and accusing her in a post on his Truth Social site of being a ""fraud who campaigned on a \'get Trump\' platform."" Conservative media have amplified claims by Trump, who faces dozens of criminal charges in four separate cases, that he is being attacked unfairly by Democratic prosecutors, including James, as part of an effort to cripple him politically. In Manhattan, Trump faces a criminal trial, brought by District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, linked to allegedly illegal hush money payments. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, also a Democrat, is pursuing criminal charges against Trump linked to allegations that he tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. Trump also faces federal charges linked to alleged election interference and charges that he improperly handled classified documents after leaving the White House. ""They\'re going in with a predetermined agenda and making that a campaign promise,"" said Fox News personality Sean Hannity in October on the TV channel. ""Does that sound like justice?"" Speaking on Hannity\'s program, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley echoed the concern that James, in particular, acted improperly.

Fittingly, for the Orchestra’s 125th season, there will also be programming that honors the history of the organization itself. Music and artistic director Yannick Nézet-Séguin, in his 13th season with the organization, has stamped its programming with a recognizable personality. A case in point is Opening Night, on Sept. 26, 2024, which will begin with the world premiere of Terence Blanchard’s Suite from Fire Shut Up in My Bones. Drawn from the groundbreaking opera of the same name, which Nézet-Séguin conducted at The Metropolitan Opera in 2021, the suite is a Philadelphia Orchestra co-commission, and foregrounds Blanchard’s fluency in operatic as well as jazz expression, along with a range of other Black music. The evening will also feature Bruch’s Violin Concerto No. 1, with María Dueñas as soloist, as well as Tchaikovsky’s iconic Romeo and Juliet. That unforced equilibrium between old and new has become a hallmark of the orchestra, and it manifests in a number of other programs from 2024-25. “This season,” says Nézet-Séguin in a press statement, “in addition to performing three of Gustav Mahler’s great symphonies, Ludwig van Beethoven’s iconic Ninth Symphony, and more, we will bring a work by Margaret Bonds to Philadelphia and continue to express our musical admiration for Florence Price, William Grant Still, Louise Farrenc, and Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges.” Still’s Symphony No. 2 in G Major, also known as “Song of a New Race,” had its world premiere with The Philadelphia Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski in 1937. It will finally receive another performance by the Orchestra early next year (Jan. 16-18), on a program that also includes Bonds’s The Montgomery Variations and a return performance by virtuoso pianist Yuja Wang. Riccardo Muti, who led The Philadelphia Orchestra as music director from 1980 to 1992, will return for his first concerts as conductor since 2005. He’ll lead Verdi’s Requiem in three performances, featuring four singers making their Philadelphia Orchestra debuts: soprano Juliana Grigoryan, mezzo-soprano Isabel De Paoli, tenor Giovanni Sala, and bass-baritone Maharram Huseynov. The engagement, Oct. 24 through 26, is timed in alignment with an anniversary: Muti made his own debut with the Philadelphians on Oct. 27, 1972. Among the other notable guest conductors in the 2024-25 season are Masaaki Suzuki, making his Philadelphia Orchestra debut with Bach Orchestral Suite No. 3 and Haydn’s “London” Symphony No. 104 (Feb. 7 and 8); David Robertson, who’ll lead Nicolas Hodges in Betsy Jolas’s Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (“bTunes”) alongside Leonard Bernstein’s Symphonic Dances from West Side Story and Aaron Copland’s Appalachian Spring Suite (Oct. 18-20); Roderick Cox, who returns to lead Saint-Saëns’s Organ Symphony, Bartók’s Suite from The Miraculous Mandarin, and Martinů’s Rhapsody-Concerto for viola and orchestra, featuring Principal Viola Choong-Jin Chang (Oct. 11 and 13); and former principal guest conductor Stéphane Denève, who will lead an all-French program featuring cellist Gautier Capuçon (Nov. 22 and 23). Marin Alsop, recently named the new Principal Guest Conductor, will preside over the Orchestra’s New Year’s Eve concert (Dec. 31) as well as an ambitious program (March 13-15) juxtaposing Brahms’ Variations on a Theme of Haydn; Mendelssohn’s Violin Concerto, featuring the returning young phenom Randall Goosby; and the world premiere of Gabriela Lena Frank’s Picaflor (“Hummingbird”), inspired by a Peruvian creation myth. Frank, the Orchestra’s former Composer in Residence, is one of several figures who will have new work premiered. Another is the Pulitzer Prize-winner Julia Wolfe, whose Pretty, an Orchestra co- commission, will share a Nézet-Séguin-led program with Louise Farrenc’s Symphony No. 1 and Brahms’s Piano Concerto No. 1, featuring Hélène Grimaud (Feb. 27 to March 1). Former Principal Guest Conductor Nathalie Stutzmann will lead the first Philadelphia Orchestra performances of Missy Mazzoli’s Orpheus Undone, alongside Shostakovich’s Symphony No. 5 and Schumann’s Cello Concerto, featuring Edgar Moreau (March 28 and 29). The Orchestra’s Spotlight recital series will feature three of the brightest stars in classical music, all returning after recent triumphs: pianists Daniil Trifonov (Feb. 26) and Lang Lang (March 23), and violinist Hilary Hahn (May 17). They join an array of artists whose star power resides not just onstage but also behind the scenes — like the prolific Studio Ghibli composer Joe Hisaishi, who will conduct his own works, including the Second Symphony and his Suite from Spirited Away (Jan. 3 and 4); and James Newton Howard, who will conduct some of his scores for M. Night Shyamalan’s films, with the director as emcee, and soloists Jean-Yves Thibaudet on piano and Gil Shaham on violin (Sept. 20). The season concludes with two likely highlights: a concert featuring Sheku Kanneh-Mason on Shostakovich’s Cello Concerto No. 1, alongside symphonies by Mozart, Prokofiev and Saint-Georges (June 6 and 7); and the Philadelphia Orchestra debut of a heroic Wagner opera. “It brings me great pleasure to bring my other true love, opera, to our stage with once-in-a-lifetime concert performances of Richard Wagner’s exquisite Tristan and Isolde with two of the most incredible voices in music today,” says Nézet-Séguin in a statement, referring to soprano Nina Stemme and tenor Stuart Skelton. “This remarkable artistic endeavor has been an aspiration of mine since I first joined the Orchestra, and I look forward to conducting my first Wagner opera in concert here in Philadelphia.” For a full schedule, ticketing and information, visit The Philadelphia Orchestra online.'}]"

ET A dead European Space Agency (ESA) satellite called European Remote Sensing 2 (ERS-2) came crashing to Earth on Wednesday. Thankfully, it stayed true to the one-in-a-billion odds and didn\'t land on anyone\'s head, but rather, reentered the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean at about 12:17 p.m. ET. ""No damage to property has been reported,"" the ESA said on its website. The satellite was launched in 1995, retired in 2011, and has been gradually making its way back to Earth since then. On Tuesday the ESA predictedthat the defunct satellite would reenter the Earth\'s atmosphere at 11:32 a.m. ET on Wednesday, give or take 4 1/2 hours. That uncertainty was due primarily to the influence of unpredictable solar activity, which affects the density of the Earth\'s atmosphere and therefore the drag experienced by the satellite. The space agency expected the satellite to break into pieces at about 50 miles above the Earth\'s surface with the vast majority burning up in the atmosphere. Officials also predicted that some fragments would make it to Earth and fall into the ocean. On Wednesday morning, expert astronomer Jonathan McDowell posted on Twitter that the satellite reentry was on a track from Alaska to the Pacific. Soon afterward, the ESA confirmed that it was over the North Pacific Ocean between Alaska and Hawaii and next that it re-entered the Earth\'s atmosphere over the Pacific. ""The odds of a piece of satellite falling on someone\'s head is estimated at one in a billion,"" ESA space debris system engineer Benjamin Bastida Virgili said during a press briefing last week, according to Phys.org. Henri Laur from the ESA Earth observation mission said the largest fragment that could reach the ground would weigh about 115 pounds, the website reported. The mass of the whole satellite is roughly 5,000 pounds. Over its 16-year life, the ERS-2 collected information on climate change and the Earth\'s atmosphere. Along with its older sister satellite ERS-1, it used: ""an imaging synthetic aperture radar, a radar altimeter and other powerful sensors to measure ocean-surface temperature and winds at sea,"" the ESA said. The ERS-2 also carried another sensor to measure atmospheric ozone. The space agency said the two satellites gathered information on ""diminishing polar ice, changing land surfaces, sea-level rise, warming oceans and atmospheric chemistry."" The ESA decommissioned ERS-2 in 2011 and maneuvered it from an orbit of about 490 miles down to 360 miles above the Earth. It ran out of fuel and out of batteries. The goal was to bring it down gradually and prevent it from adding to the big problem of orbital space junk. About 500,000 marble-sized objects are in orbit and there are more than 100 million objects 1mm or smaller, according to NASA. Another 25,000 objects are bigger than 10cm. Most of the debris comes from satellite explosions and collisions. And when objects hit each other, they can create even smaller pieces of debris. The average impact speed is usually 22,000 mph, meaning even tiny objects can be dangerous. The ESA says that on average, an object of similar mass to the ERS-2 reenters the Earth\'s atmosphere every one to two weeks. Copyright 2024 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.'}]"
