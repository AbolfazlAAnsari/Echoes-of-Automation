The prince said he had been vindicated, and vowed: “Our mission continues.” “We have uncovered and proved the shockingly dishonest way in which the Mirror acted for so many years, and then sought to conceal the truth,” Harry said in a statement read outside the High Court in London by his lawyer. Harry was awarded 140,000 pounds ($177,000) in damages in December, after a judge found that phone hacking was “widespread and habitual” at Mirror Group Newspapers in the late 1990s, went on for more than a decade and that executives at the papers covered it up.

That is separate from the legal costs of preparing for and presenting individuals’ specific claims. The judge said that the three other claimants must pay some of the Mirror Group’s costs in their individual cases, because they made exaggerated claims or failed to accept reasonable offers to settle.

Special counsel Robert Hur concluded in his report that the evidence investigators uncovered falls short of ""proof beyond a reasonable doubt"" that Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified materials. Despite the legal win for the president, the report was politically damaging for Biden. It details shoddy handling of classified documents and specifically points out gaps in Biden\'s memory when discussing the information during his interview with the special counsel — fueling an existing political concern about his age and mental acuity. The report comes at a sensitive time for the president: He\'s locked in a tight race with Donald Trump, his predecessor as president who is the front-runner for the Republican nomination; his job approval remains low, as does the view of his handling of the economy and, especially, immigration — in addition to persistent concerns about his age. The special counsel\'s assertion that he\'s an ""elderly man with a poor memory"" is hardly going to help. Still, Biden sought to dispute the unfavorable parts of the report in a fiery press conferenceThursday night, emphasizing his cooperation with the investigation and defending his fitness for office. Here\'s what you need to know about the report, and the fallout that began immediately after its release. The report covers what materials have been uncovered, what\'s known about how they were handled — going back to Biden\'s time as vice president — as well as the legal arguments around whether charges were appropriate. There are photos of the boxes that contained classified materials, including one damaged box with documents about Afghanistan that was found in the garage of Biden\'s home in Delaware ""near a collapsed dog crate, a dog bed, a Zappos box, an empty bucket, a broken lamp wrapped with duct tape, potting soil, and synthetic firewood."" The bulk of the report focuses on two types of classified materials — documents about military and foreign policy in Afghanistan; and notebooks that Biden used throughout his presidency for a combination of personal reflections, meeting notes and other writings. Biden relied on his notebooks in particular while writing his memoir Promise Me, Dad, which was published in 2017 and reflects on the year his older son Beau died of cancer, two years earlier. In conversations with his ghostwriter for the book, he read from those notebooks — and on at least three occasions shared classified material while doing so. In his interview for the special counsel investigation, Biden was ""emphatic, declaring that his notebooks are \'my property,\' and that \'every president before me has done the exact same thing,\' that is, kept handwritten materials after his term in office, even if they contain classified material."" He also referred to the diaries kept by former President Ronald Reagan after his time in office. While the special counsel investigation did find some evidence that Biden knew he had some materials that contained classified information, the report says ultimately the evidence doesn\'t support bringing charges. Hur said the evidence doesn\'t establish Biden\'s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and that it would be hard to prove that Biden willfully intended to break the law. For example: ""Mr. Biden\'s decision to read notes nearly verbatim to [ghostwriter Mark] Zwonitzer that Mr. Biden had just identified as potentially classified cannot be justified. But the evidence does not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended to share classified information. Mr. Biden told Zwonitzer he was \'not sure\' the notebook passage he read was classified. That is enough to create reasonable doubt about whether Mr. Biden acted willfully."" Hur outlines the ways in which a jury may side with Biden and not ultimately convict him for the missteps that the special counsel found. The report says that to a jury, Biden would likely ""present himself ... as he did during his interview with our office, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."" Biden\'s lawyers directly took issue with the characterization of — and multiple references to — his memory in a letter to the special counsel that is attached to the public report. ""The report uses highly prejudicial language to describe a commonplace occurrence among witnesses: a lack of recall of years-old events,"" said Richard Sauber, special counsel to the president, and Bob Bauer, Biden\'s personal counsel. The lawyers also note that the five hours of interviewing with Biden began the day after the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, when Biden had numerous meetings with foreign leaders and his national security team. In his press conference Thursday, Biden further defended his mental acuity, saying his memory was ""fine."" He angrily responded to Hur\'s description of a portion of an interview where Hur said Biden seemed to not remember when his son died. ""How in the hell dare he raise that?"" Biden said, adding it was ""none of their damn business,"" and choking up with emotion. ""I don\'t need anyone to remind me when he passed away."" Republicans, including Trump — who is likely to face Biden in the general election in November — immediately seized on the line as a reason that Biden should no longer be president. Trump also blasted the lack of charges as evidence of a ""two-tiered system of justice."" Trump is facing more than three dozen federal criminal charges related to his own handling of classified information after boxes of classified material were uncovered in unsecure locations at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Fla. Trump and his associates have pleaded not guilty in the federal case, which is being prosecuted by special counsel Jack Smith. Unlike in Biden\'s case, where the president consented to searches of his property and willingly spoke with investigators, Trump is accused of actively trying to obstruct officials from recovering classified material. Hur\'s investigation is closed, but the political fallout has begun. Biden will have to contend with renewed attention on his age and convince voters that he should serve another term as president. In his press conference that began with his defense against the critical parts of the report, Biden, when answering a question about current hostage negotiations with Israel and Hamas, mistakenly said that President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi of Egypt was the ""president of Mexico."" In recent days in off-camera events, Biden has thrice mixed up names of foreign leaders, calling French President Emmanuel Macron ""Mitterrand"" and former German Chancellor Angela Merkel ""Helmut Kohl."" François Mitterrand and Kohl were former leaders of France and Germany, respectively. Trump, meanwhile, is awaiting trial in multiple cases, including for the Mar-a-Lago documents case. And hours before the Hur report dropped on Thursday, the Supreme Court was hearing argumentsabout whether Trump could be disqualified from the ballot in Colorado for his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

arrested just outside of New York City on Friday, police officials said. The teenager was taken into custody at a residential house that police believe may be linked to a family member in Yonkers nearly 24 hours after the shooting that began in a sporting goods store and spilled out onto the bustling streets of Midtown Manhattan. At a press conference announcing the arrest Friday evening, New York City Police Commissioner Edward Caban said it was an “actual miracle” that no one was seriously injured in the shooting. “In the middle of the busiest, most highly trafficked part of this city, a criminal with a firearm decided to pull the trigger,” Caban said. Hours before, police identified the suspect as a resident of a migrant shelter in Manhattan who arrived in New York from Venezuela late last year. He is also considered a suspect in an armed robbery in the Bronx and a separate shooting in Times Square last month, police said. Police said the shooter, dressed in all white, and two teenage classmates were shoplifting a jacket from the store shortly after 7 p.m. when they were confronted by a security guard who asked to see a receipt. When the trio couldn’t produce one, the guard took back the merchandise. That’s when the teenager allegedly pulled out a .45 caliber handgun and fired at her. The bullet missed the worker but grazed a 38-year-old tourist in line to buy a pair of sneakers. The shooter and one of the other teens with him then ran off into the busy tourist hub. Four blocks away on 47th Street — near a triangular Times Square pedestrian plaza where visitors line up to buy Broadway tickets and snap selfies with the area’s iconic billboards — two officers quickly spotted the pair and took the second person into custody. The shooter fled toward 6th Avenue with one of the officers giving chase, at one point cutting between buildings. There, he turned and fired at the officer, police said. “Our officer draws his weapon. He cannot fire,” NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell said at a news conference Thursday evening. “Too many people around, there’s too many people ducking.” The teen fired again from under his arm and continued to flee, running into a subway station. Surveillance video showed him going to the tracks and emerging back onto the street, Chell said. It’s unclear if the teen has an attorney or someone who can speak on his behalf. Prosecutors said they’re usually not identified until the arraignment, which hasn’t happened yet. Police said they spoke to hundreds of people and obtained strong surveillance photos of the alleged shooter leading up to his arrest Friday afternoon. In an interview with NBC, the tourist, Tatiele Ribeiro Lemos, recalled the “scary moment” when she realized she had been shot. “I started checking myself then looked at my leg and saw blood dripping down, but I was able to stay calm,” she said in Portuguese. “I believe this was just an unfortunate incident, it could have happened anywhere in the world.” She received 13 stitches for the wound at a local hospital, according to the NBC report. The shooting comes on the heels of another high-profile incident in Times Square involving a brawl between migrants and police officers. Overall, crime rates have plummeted in New York City since a spike at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of people shot in the city dropped 39% from 2022 to 2023. Once one of the seediest places in New York, synonymous with pornographic theaters and sex work, Times Square experienced a revitalization in the 1990s that transformed it into one of the city’s most family-friendly destinations. On most evenings, it is packed with tourists and street performers, though it also still attracts pickpockets and hustlers who take advantage of out-of-towners. Chell said Times Square remains safe to visitors. “Take a look around you, thousands of people shopping and walking around,” he said. “We are still the safest city in the world.” ___ Associated Press writer Cedar Attanasio contributed to this report. ___ This story has been updated to correct the shooting victim’s age.

The most recent slip-ups involved Biden mixing up the names of European leaders with past officials who had died years earlier. On Wednesday, Biden twice appeared to mix up late German Chancellor Helmut Kohl with former Chancellor Angela Merkel while talking about a conversation he had in 2021. Merkel was Germany’s leader during the event he was discussing, while Kohl died in 2017. That came after another error on Sunday, when he confused French President Emmanuel Macron for Francois Mitterand, a former French president who died in 1996. They are the latest examples in what has become a growing problem for Biden, who has referred to himself as a “gaffe machine” in the past. But they come as voters are voicing concerns about the 81-year-old president. An NBC poll released Wednesday found 76% of voters had major or moderate concerns about whether Biden has “the necessary mental and physical health to be president for a second term.” Eleven percent said they had no real concerns. Biden’s age has been an issue he has confronted directly and tried to overcome by asking voters to count on his experience and what he has been able to accomplish as president. But questions continue to pop up any time he makes a mistake while speaking or appears frail. “It's a double-edged sword to put him out on the campaign trail or in high-profile events. The upside is you could show people ‘look at him out there’ being active and speaking, whether on-script or extemporaneously interacting with people. And he could pull it off very well for hours or days in a row. But just one slip-up and that's probably what will get all the attention,” said Chris Devine, an associate professor of political science at the University of Dayton. But Biden isn’t alone in giving voters concern over his advanced age, as the same poll found 48% said they have major or moderate concerns about 77-year-old former President Donald Trump. Thirty-five percent said they had no real concerns. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has tried to draw attention to Trump’s age in the Republican primary race, especially after he confused her for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during a rally. Before dropping out of the race, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ campaign had launched a “Trump accident tracker” on top of quips from the governor about Trump “losing his fastball.” Trump has also made other gaffes like saying he ran against former President Barack Obama or confusing former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who ran in the 2016 GOP primary, for his brother, former President George W. Bush. The old age of the candidates, who appear to be on a collision course for a 2020 rematch, has been one of the primary drivers behind their disdain for what’s to come at the top of the ticket in November. Voters in both parties have consistently told pollsters for months that they want someone new to be the presidential nominee. That has spurred some speculation that third-party candidates may have a bigger sway over the final results due to higher levels of disinterest in the two major political parties’ candidates, though experts say that is unlikely to materialize when it comes time for voters to cast a ballot. Challengers to the two frontrunners have also tried to harness that energy in their longshot campaigns, though they have limited success. Haley has frequently drawn attention to Trump’s age but lost primary contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. She was also handily defeated in Nevada’s primary election to “none of these candidates” without Trump on the ballot, though she did not campaign in Nevada and the election does not award any delegates. Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips has also tried to use Biden’s age against him in his longshot primary challenge. “In 2016, Joe Biden made the wrong decision by not running, and in 2024 he’s making the wrong decision by running. It gives me angst, but someone in Washington has to be honest and say what the entire country knows,” Phillips said in a post on X including videos of Biden speaking in 2016 and this year. While attacks about age are not having much of an effect in primary races, both campaigns have also tried to make it a factor in the general election. Biden’s campaign and other Democrats have tried to highlight Trump’s errors to counterbalance the frequent attacks against the president, who Trump’s campaign has tried to frame as a confused, elderly man incapable of serving another four-year term. It’s a risky strategy for Biden. While it may convince some voters that there is not a stark difference between the two elderly candidates, it could also draw more attention to a vulnerable issue for him. “We see this often in campaigns where one candidate has a weakness — whether that's a real weakness or at least the perceived one — what they do is say, ‘I know you are but what am I?’ and try to turn it back on the other candidate, and it rarely works,” Devine said. “Usually, if there's a narrative that attaches to someone, it's because people see something compelling there.”""}]"

Two officers and a corporal found Ann Francis Visscher but “as they begin to handcuff” her, they said “she began to pull away from officers and turn her body away from officers, in an effort to not be handcuffed. “And then kicked [the corporal] in his right leg, at which point [the corporal] and [other officer] redirected her to the ground.

Visscher, 57, faces three counts of assault on law enforcement officers, one count of battery on a law enforcement officer, and one count of resisting officers with violence. She is not charged with theft since the owner of the 7-Eleven said “he did not wish to prosecute and only requested” Visscher not return to the store. In June 2021, she spent three hours behind bars for trespassing, and then four days later, almost a month for battery and resisting with violence. Last April, she spent almost three days in jail for DUI and possession of a small amount of marijuana; then, the next week, more than three months for trespassing. And this was not her first arrest of the year. Visscher spent most of last month in jail for trespassing and violation of probation for DUI. Apparently, she was being kicked out of where she’d been staying, and she called the police on herself. This time, she was booked into jail at 1:55 a.m. Wednesday, her bond was set at $23,000, and she has not been released.'}]"

to your email inbox. Omaha police Chief Todd Schmaderer presented numerous angles of surveillance video and a 911 call detailing the events of a deadly shooting by off-duty officers. Capt. Jay Leavitt, who has been with the department for 25 years, and officer Robert Soldo, who has been with the department for 8 1/2 years, shot and killed 26-year-old Fernando Rodriguez-Juarez and 28-year-old Jonathan Hernandez-Rosales on Feb. 3 near 32nd and L streets. WATCH: Omaha police hold press conference on deadly shooting involving off-duty officers Schmaderer promised to keep transparency and accountability top of mind as an investigation unfolds into the officers. ""Anytime there is loss of life from our community the trauma is impactful,"" Schmaderer said. He said a team of investigators worked to compile several surveillance videos from businesses in the area to explain what happened early Saturday. The officers were working off-duty at the Extasis Night Club, according to authorities. The video provided by Omaha police showed Rodriguez-Juarez and Hernandez-Rosales in the bar, and then they got into a fight outside the nightclub with another group. There was a verbal altercation with pushing and shoving with parties dispersing, as shown on the video provided by Omaha police. Leavitt can be seen on video in a clearly marked OPD uniform, and Soldo can be partially seen breaking up the disturbance. The two men then got into a Jeep, with Rodriguez-Juarez driving, and they drive south toward the Sol\'s parking lot entrance. The group involved in the altercation at the nightclub is walking toward Sol\'s at this time, with Leavitt and Soldo behind the group, clearing the parking lot. The officers react to Rodriguez-Juarez pulling the gun, and- the video shows the Jeep almost hitting Soldo when it accelerates. The officers can be heard yelling loud commands for the occupants to stop the car. \'I heard this bam bam bam bam\': New surveillance video after 2 off-duty Omaha police officers shoot, kill 2 men. Read more. Video shows Rodriguez-Juarez firing toward the crowd, and the officers returned fire. Omaha police said Leavitt fired 12 shots, and Soldo fired nine shots. Medical personnel then pulled the two men from the vehicle, and they were taken to Nebraska Medicine, where they died. The two men were each hit three times, Omaha police said. Omaha police said the two officers were not approaching the car, or trying to detain anyone. Investigators recovered a 9mm semi-automatic pistol from the vehicle and a spent 9mm casing found in the back seat of the vehicle consistent with firing out the passenger window, Omaha police said. Omaha police said that officers provided a voluntary statement and had not seen surveillance video. The officers corroborated video evidence, according to authorities. Leavitt and Soldo told investigators that they witnessed the gunshot being fired from inside the black Jeep. Schmaderer said that Leavitt thought it was the passenger, Hernandez-Rosales, because the driver leaned past the passenger to fire the gun. Douglas County attorney: Off-duty Omaha police officers will not be charged, \'using deadly force was justified\' Omaha police said that Rodriguez-Juarez had minimal law enforcement issues before the incident but was in the country illegally. Hernandez-Rosales also entered U.S. illegally and was placed in ""ICE alternatives to detention program,"" Omaha police said. He was due in immigration court again in October 2025. ""Immigration status is by no means justification for officers\' response or pertinent to investigation,"" Schmaderer said.

""The communication was the gunshot,"" Schmaderer said. Omaha police said that Leavitt did not have a body camera; Soldo did have his, but it was not on at the beginning of the incident. He turned it on after the shooting. Schmaderer said he found the shooting to be within policy. Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert offered condolences to both families and expressed confidence in the department\'s investigation. Before the press conference, Douglas County Attorney Don Kleine issued a statement saying that officers were ""justified"" in ""using deadly force."" Leavitt is one of two officers who fired their weapons last June. Police told KETV NewsWatch 7 that the officers were leaving a community meeting when they saw Jahari Love firing a long gun.

(WOWT) - The right of citizens to get reasonable access to public records went before the Nebraska Supreme Court on Thursday.

She ultimately uncovered 16 of Pillen’s hog farms that had high nitrate levels, and published the findings in the Flatwater Free Press in October.

Swallen said his son told him was that he overheard a classmate talking about carrying out a mass shooting. As it turned out, that student, a 14-year-old, had a detailed plan, including a hit list, to carry out a mass shooting at Mariemont High School, Hamilton County Prosecutor Melissa Powers said Thursday. “He said that he wanted to protect his classmates and that he didn’t care if the kid - if the kid followed through on his threat on his life, but he wanted his classmates to be safe,” Swallen said. Now knowing what his son knew, Swallen immediately called the Mariemont Police Department. “It’s very admirable that he did that, and like I’ve said before: See something, say something, hear something, say something,” Mariemont Chief of Police Richard Hines said. “If we hadn’t gotten the tip, I think we would have had a very bad situation.” Swallen, when talking about his son’s bravery, said he could not have been more proud. “He stood up, and that’s heroic of him, and I’m so proud of him. And I’ve always taught him since he was a little guy to protect your peers, to help people to be nice people, to love people,” Swallen said. The 14-year-old student that Swallen’s son said he overheard planning the shooting was arrested Wednesday at Mariemont High School, Powers said. He is charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated murder, police said. In recognition of Boom’s actions, The Uvalde Foundation for Kids said it will present him with its National Student Hero Award. “The second someone steps in and says something that makes you a hero, that makes an impact on everyone around you and the things that could occur,” said Rebecca Engle, with the Uvalde group. “Because without that voice and if he would’ve just said, ‘Whatever,’ and not get involved in it, a tragedy could’ve gotten way worse.” The sole mission of the foundation, which was formed in response to the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Texas in May 2022, is to end school violence. Boom’s father said his son is still shaken up by this situation. Copyright 2024 WXIX via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.'}]"
