June 1, 2024 By Cecile Wehrman The North Dakota Dem-NPL party chair calls it “outrageous and baffling.” No matter what you call it, the decision not to independently investigate the erasure of the email account of North Dakota’s late attorney general is just plain wrong. That this decision comes from the agency charged with making sure other units of government adequately comply with open records laws is unseemly and gives a pass to a staff member who actually put in writing her desire to shield the attorney general’s emails from future public records requests. That’s a clear statement of motivation to circumvent North Dakota’s open records law. Liz Brocker, longtime executive assistant to Wayne Stenehjem, was concerned, according to an email to the state’s IT department, “especially as he kept EVERYTHING.” I would expect no less of Stenehjem, who was a champion of open records. It’s a shame his legacy will now be entangled with suspicion, however unwarranted. Coming from the woman who fielded media requests for opinions from the attorney general — many related to open records — it’s laughable to ascribe no ill intent to her actions, as current Attorney General Drew Wrigley did last week. Brocker, who is not an attorney, is nonetheless well-acquainted with the law, making her actions even more egregious. An investigation would also answer why the state’s IT department would comply with her request. Notwithstanding that there is apparently no specific policy or law about retention of state emails, Brocker’s motives for deleting the account were clearly aimed at an end run around laws she dealt with everyday. It should go without saying that the people charged with upholding the public’s right to know are not entitled to special treatment. Far from protecting Stenehjem’s legacy, she has opened a chasm for speculation on what that email account may have contained. Beyond that, she’s destroyed the words of a well-loved and capable public servant. Beyond any potential scandal or conspiracy fodder, Brocker has deleted Stenehjem’s wit, logic and musings on myriad topics, the breadth of which I can only imagine knowing the amount of material any of us who sit in front of a computer all day share via email with colleagues and friends. Words reach across time and bring to life who we were when we wrote them, making them all the more precious once we’re gone. In the case of a private person, those words may mean little to the public. For a public figure who served in state government for decades the value of Stenehjem’s words are potentially huge. It’s not for Liz Brocker or anyone else to decide what becomes of a public servant’s work product. It belongs to us — the people. That’s the covenant public servants make when they run for election. Their work is no longer entirely their own. Nor should their emails be.

As I watched Thursday night’s Jan. 6 committee hearing, I came away convinced that a smoking gun as to Donald Trump’s actions in the presidential SUV were less likely to be found than incredibly personal messages sent to family and friends by agents protecting Vice President Mike Pence at the Capitol.

But look at it from Biden’s perspective or, more precisely, look at the politics from Biden’s perspective. President Barack Obama ordered all of the American troops out of Iraq. He did so over the objection of practically his entire defense and national security team including the secretary of state, secretary of defense, the national security adviser, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq and the CIA director. Outgoing President George W. Bush expected the new president to leave a stay-behind force. But Obama called Iraq “a dumb war” and ordered the troops home. The pullout, as Bush predicted, created a vacuum. Enter the Islamic State group. In response, Obama gradually sent back to Iraq about the same number of troops that Bush considered necessary. Some, mostly Republicans who were maligned as warmongering “neocons,” criticized what they denounced as the Obama “bug-out.” But, politically, Obama did not suffer. How many Iraqis died because of his reckless, premature pullout? Few ask, even fewer care. In April 2003, according to Gallup, approval for the war in Iraq, which began less than two years after 9/11, reached 76%. Sens. Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden voted for the war. Even liberals like The New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman supported it. But, over time, approval declined. Clinton apologized for her vote. Some Democrats and their media comrades believed “Bush lied; people died.” Former Associated Press D.C. Bureau Chief Ron Fournier claimed that “Bush lied us into the war in Iraq.” Even presidential candidate Donald Trump said: “They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction. There were none. And they knew there were none.” Never mind that Laurence Silberman of the bipartisan Robb-Silberman Commission, formed by Bush to examine the intelligence behind the Iraq war, wrote: “No one in Washington political circles offered significant disagreement with the intelligence community before the invasion. The National Intelligence Estimate was persuasive — to the president, to Congress and to the media.” Americans forgot, or stopped caring, that Saddam Hussein, after the Gulf war of 1990-1991, promised — but failed — to declare what WMD he had. He threatened America; was stealing from the Oil-For-Food Program; was shooting at the British and American planes patrolling the no-fly zone over the Kurdish areas; had used chemical weapons on the Iranians and on his own people; had attempted to assassinate President George Herbert Walker Bush and had invaded Kuwait. Human Rights Watch estimates that more than 250,000 Iraqis were eliminated by Saddam. The war in Afghanistan began with wide support. The Taliban allowed al-Qaida to use the country to plan the deadliest terror attack on American soil in history, a tragedy that cost nearly 3,000 lives. But public support waned — even though, before President Trump withdrew more than 2,000 troops, our military commitment in Iraq dropped to 5,200 troops. Trump, and many Republicans and Democrats, complained about “endless wars,” disregarding endless enemies who never get the memo. Even the bipartisan criticism of Biden’s disastrous pullout from Afghanistan centers more on how he withdrew the troops, not that he did so. In three weeks, Russia has reportedly lost more troops in Ukraine than America did in Iraq and Afghanistan combined in 20 years. Yet Iraq and Afghanistan are routinely called mistaken misadventures in “nation building” that we were goaded into by “neocons.” A 2021 AP-NORC poll found that 62% of Americans say the war in Afghanistan was “not worth fighting,” and 63% say the same thing about the war in Iraq. American public opinion initially supports war, even the Vietnam War. But approval morphs into not only opposition, but into questioning the “true motive” for engaging in war. Given this history, Biden’s reluctance to “do more” for Ukraine becomes understandable. To find out more about Larry Elder, or become an “Elderado,” visit www.LarryElder.com.
