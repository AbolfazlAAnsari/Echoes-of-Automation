WASHINGTON — Nearly half of the world's migratory species are in decline, according to a new United Nations report released Monday. Many songbirds, sea turtles, whales, sharks and other migratory animals move to different environments with changing seasons and are imperiled by habitat loss, illegal hunting and fishing, pollution and climate change. About 44% of migratory species worldwide are declining in population, the report found. More than a fifth of the nearly 1,200 species monitored by the U.N. are threatened with extinction. An elephant head wall trophy is on display April 23, 2018, at the Nesbitt Castle in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Nearly half of the world's migratory species are in decline, a United Nations report said Monday. “These are species that move around the globe. They move to feed and breed and also need stopover sites along the way,” said Kelly Malsch, lead author of the report released at a U.N. wildlife conference in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Habitat loss or other threats at any point in their journey can lead to dwindling populations. “Migration is essential for some species. If you cut the migration, you’re going to kill the species,” said Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm, who was not involved in the report. The report relied on existing data, including information from the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List, which tracks whether a species is endangered. A volunteer carries a green sea turtle after it was caught May 24 at a feeding site on Itaipu Beach in Niteroi, Brazil. Many migratory animals move to different environments with changing seasons and are imperiled by habitat loss, illegal hunting and fishing, pollution and climate change, the U.N. says. Participants of the U.N. meeting plan to evaluate proposals for conservation measures and also whether to formally list several new species of concern. “One country alone cannot save any of these species,” said Susan Lieberman, vice president for international policy at the nonprofit Wildlife Conservation Society. At the meeting, eight governments from South America are expected to jointly propose adding two species of declining Amazon catfish to the U.N. treaty's list of migratory species of concern, she said. The Amazon River basin is world’s largest freshwater system. “If the Amazon is intact, the catfish will thrive — it's about protecting the habitat,” Lieberman said. An entangled subadult humpback whale is freed of gear March 6, 2019, off Makena Beach, Hawaii. In 2022, governments pledged to protect 30% of the planet's land and water resources for conservation at the U.N. Biodiversity Conference in Montreal, Canada. For every treasured family dog in a cozy home, there is a lonely pup in a shelter cage; about 6.3 million cats and dogs enter shelters each year, but only an estimated 4.1 million end up being adopted. In a world where most pet owners spend more on their furry friends than on themselves, the value of animal nonprofits working behind the scenes cannot be overstated. Amid all the heartwarming stories of successful adoptions and reunions remains a stark reality of millions of animals facing uncertain futures—but organizations across the nation have stepped in to help. With tireless efforts toward mitigating seemingly insurmountable problems within the animal welfare community, these organizations provide an array of vital services. To address overpopulation and reduce needless euthanasia, many offer free or low-cost spay and neuter services. Others simply provide shelter and care to homeless or otherwise neglected animals until they are able to find a home. Still, others have involved the broader community in their service or therapeutic offerings, doubling down on the net good of their efforts. To highlight the missions and remarkable strides they have made towards brightening the futures of our furry friends, eTailPet used data from Charity Navigator to highlight the 10 highest-rated domesticated animal charities in the United States. The Grey Muzzle Organization, the largest nonprofit in the nation dedicated to senior dog welfare, provides funding to support programs that enhance the quality of life for dogs during their golden years. Since its inception in 2008, the organization has provided more than $4.6 million to grantees encompassing a range of services to aid senior dogs. This includes providing crucial medical and dental care, financing for foster care and adoption initiatives, and resources to families undergoing financial hardship, preventing them from surrendering their beloved pets. Puppies Behind Bars, based in New York City, has a unique yet vital mission: providing prison inmates with a sense of purpose and people in need with trained companions. The program allows prison inmates to train and raise puppies to become service dogs for individuals with various needs spanning physical and emotional trauma. For the past quarter century, the program has promoted rehabilitation and service within the prison population, fostering a sense of responsibility and achievement in inmates. The puppies they train go on to become trained service, therapy, or explosive-detection dogs. The American Kennel Club Canine Health Foundation Inc. advocates for canine health and longevity by funding research and promoting the distribution of information to owners. Outreach initiatives include webinars, conferences, and educational programs for all interested dog-adjacent parties from owners to breeders and medical professionals; however, the organization's focus lies within research. In 2021, 87 cents of each dollar donated went directly towards research and education programs with a focus on oncology-related research initiatives. The organization has also funded a wide array of research projects since its inception in 1995, contributing to breakthroughs in immunology, diseases, surgical methods, medicine, behavior, and genetic conditions. In July 2023, the AKC CHF celebrated its 1,000th published scientific study. Servicing New Jersey, the Associated Humane Societies provides care and shelter to thousands of animals in need.

In addition to directly servicing animals, the Associated Humane Societies offers low-cost medical care and education outreach to the New Jersey pet owner community. But domesticated companion animals are not the only critters that benefit from the organization. Within one of their three shelter locations lies Popcorn Park—a federally licensed zoo that serves as a sanctuary for injured, abandoned, or elderly livestock and wildlife.

Tan solo en diciembre, la llegada de turistas internacionales se incrementó en un 7,8 % interanual hasta los 4,59 millones. Mientras que el gasto total de estos turistas se disparó un 11,3 % hasta 3.181,6 millones de dólares, y el gasto medio se elevó en 3,2 % a 693,12 dólares por turista. El turismo, antes de la crisis sanitaria de la covid-19, representaba un 8,6 % de la economía nacional en 2019, cerró 2021 en el 7,1 % y en 2022 en 8,5 %, según el Inegi. La economía relacionada con el turismo, que el Inegi llama PIB turístico, creció un 7,8 % anual en el tercer trimestre de 2023, impulsada en particular por los servicios. México fue el sexto país más visitado en el mundo en 2022, un fenómeno que se atribuye, en parte, a las medidas sanitarias flexibles en las zonas turísticas del país durante la pandemia de covid-19.

development community he’s optimistic about 2024 and ongoing projects and how the west valley master plan continues to be a destination both inside and outside the region. The president of the Howard Hughes Corp. overseeing Summerlin told the development community he’s optimistic about 2024 and ongoing projects and how the west valley master plan continues to be a destination both inside and outside the region. Frank Stephan, president of the Nevada region for Howard Hughes, the developer of Summerlin, was a featured panelist at a recent Southern Nevada NAIOP breakfast meeting looking at 2024 development. The meeting at The Orleans set a record with 300 in attendance and 100 watching live online. “At the end of 2022, there was a lot of uncertainty, and we managed our own expectations and changed some of our projections going into 2023,” Stephan said. “As we entered the first and second quarter of 2023, we treaded lightly. We found there was a momentum that picked up in 2023 as we went on into the third and fourth quarter.” Howard Hughes finished a Class A office building at 1700 Pavilion Center Drive at the end of 2023 and more than 90 percent of the 260,000-square-foot building is leased. It opened a new 300-unit multifamily building within walking distance of Downtown Summerlin and leasing is going well, he said. It will open its next Class A office building in South Summerlin in the first quarter. There’s other reasons to be optimistic. Retail sales in Downtown Summerlin exceeded all-time highs per square foot and exceeded daily attendance records in 2023, Stephan said. Summerlin home sales reached 1,090, an increase of 39 percent in 2023 over 2022. “We were conservative and sold more than 1,000 new homes in Summerlin, and we were seeing as 2023 went on that homebuilders were very aggressive in land sales,” Stephan said. There will continue to be a focus on three cores of Summerlin with announcements yet to come, Stephan said. “I would say 2024 for us is a year of pre-development and this time next year I hope to share information on more than a half-dozen projects we were breaking ground on soon,” Stephan said. Just east of Downtown Summerlin, which has 1.2 million square feet of retail, is 90 acres to be developed. “We are excited about the next phase of Downtown Summerlin,” Stephan said. Stephan said they’re still bullish on the office market with a flight to quality of Class A offices within walking distance from Downtown Summerlin. They are planning an office building next to 1700 Pavilion Center Drive, he added. As for the three cores, Downtown Summerlin is a regional destination with retail, multifamily and office. Summerlin South is more entertainment industry based with retail and dining and akin the Shops at Sportsmen’s Lounge in Los Angeles. Summerlin West is inspired by cultural arts and health and wellness, Stephan told the audience. “I think given the size and magnitude of Summerlin, we’ve started to look at opportunities to work in different parts of Summerlin at the same time,” Stephan said. “While historically, we may have focused on one or two projects at the same time, we’re defining three different urban cores in Summerlin, and each developing with their own personality and characteristics.” Stephan, who came to the Nevada position from Los Angeles, said it’s important to keep selling Summerlin to those from outside the region. The region has to fight against the notion that the Las Vegas Valley is only the Strip, and sell that Summerlin sits at the foothills of the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area with an abundance of outdoor activities, he said. He touted its parks, trails and schools. “When we don’t win the relocation of the business or attract people, they may not be open to listening to everything that Southern Nevada has to offer,” Stephan said. “We need to work a little harder as a community and as an industry to not be as humble about what’s been done here. It’s a wonderful place.” Las Vegas has a lot of momentum but still has a ways to go, Stephan said. It’s set to become the sports capital of the country and the benefits that are generated by that. Summerlin already has the Las Vegas Ballpark, the potential temporary home of the A’s and the Golden Knights’ practice facility. Allegiant Stadium has attracted fans from all over the country to watch their teams, he noted. “I think we will get the NBA and Major League Soccer and a bunch more, and that will have an impact on patrons of retail and people wanting to relocate offices and buy homes here,” Stephan said.

pop culture phenomenon. If only Taylor Swift were dating the national debt. On Sunday, the world’s attention turned to Las Vegas, as the region hosted its first Super Bowl. Despite some national naysayers, it was an unbridled success. Las Vegas accommodated and entertained fans and celebrities alike. About the only thing that disappointed was the low-scoring start to the game. Once again, Las Vegas showed it is the entertainment capital of the world. But entertainment doesn’t last forever. Football fans enjoyed the game and left to return to their normal lives. The Kansas City Chiefs celebrated their victory in style, but the off-season is already here. Las Vegas officials handed off Super Bowl hosting duties to New Orleans. This is a normal rhythm of life. Along with fun, there are responsibilities and hard decisions. One of the marks of adulthood is balancing those competing interests. The American public isn’t showing this maturity. Tens of millions of people know the latest details of Ms. Swift — prominently featured on Sunday’s TV broadcast — and her boyfriend, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. But they have little interest discussing something much more important to all Americans — the national debt. Last week, the Congressional Budget Office released its forecast of America’s fiscal future. The situation is bleak. This fiscal year, the deficit is projected to hit $1.6 trillion. For context, the total U.S. budget didn’t even reach that number until the late 1990s. The annual deficit is projected to continue increasing and reach $2.6 trillion by 2034. Debt held by the public will soon hit 100 percent of gross domestic product. At this pace, it will reach 116 percent of GDP in 2034, “the highest level ever recorded.” Even the massive financial strains of World War II didn’t put the country on such poor fiscal footing. The deficit isn’t growing because taxes are too low. Federal government revenues are currently at 17.5 percent of GDP. After a one-year dip, that’s expected to rise to around 17.9 percent. No, America is bleeding red ink because its political class is addicted to spending other people’s money. “After 2028, growth in spending on programs for elderly people and rising net interest costs drive up outlays, which reach 24.1 percent of GDP by 2034,” the report notes. That gap, which is more than 6 percent of GDP, is a major problem. It should be at the top of the public’s mind, pressuring our elected leaders to propose and vigorously debate various solutions. Instead, too many apathetic Americans ignore it, caught up in the latest pop culture phenomenon. Perhaps someone should pay Ms. Swift to wear a pin with the national debt clock on it. One of the most persistent myths in politics is that rich have lower tax rates than middle-income workers. New data shows how false that is. Who will get serious about Washington’s spending problem? A judge paddled the Clark County School Board on the backside over the panel’s petulant response to meddling from Carson City. Will elected trustees take the lesson to heart? Turnout is typically low, but even nonpartisans can make a difference. Even Artificial Intelligence doesn’t have the smarts to square the left’s green agenda with the energy needs of the future.

during my growing up years. The woman’s revolution has created quite a buzz about things that were never talked about outside of the bathroom. I am not too sure that each and every thing that happens in the bathroom needs to be discussed at such the lengths they are now. But! Yes, a coarse hairy “but.” Facial hair on a lady has come to a growth point that even those with bad eyesight can no longer ignore. For years the act of going bald was talked about. So loudly that finally somehow the act of regrowing hair was taken seriously. Now there are treatments, creams, sprays, transplants to keep men’s heads, and some women too, all covered with curls and the like. Quite remarkable actually. In recent years past movie stars like The Rock, Vin Diesel and even Bruce Willis have taken razor to head and made being bald quite a fashion statement. Even women have come clean and are turning heads with their beautiful skin all a glow up top. Kudos for them. However, for those same years as I and some of my friends became, “mature,” I have stated more than once, siting THEY whoever they are. “If THEY can spend all that money on how to grow hair back–why can’t THEY spend some R&D money on how to stop hair from growing?” There I have thrown down the hairy gauntlet. Throughout the menopausal attack on a lady’s mind and body this hairy face deluge is one thing that is so prominent as to keep women on the ultimate hunt for relief. Oh, mighty Google, what is the answer? Here is a short list of hair removal ideas. Trust me here, none of them work 100%. None of them work FOREVER! There is shaving, tweezing, plucking, waxing, threading, sugaring, lasers, over the counter creams, some prescription creams. Breathe. Mixing up sugar, corn starch and egg to make a mask, turmeric, epilation and electrolysis. Hey, I bet there may even be mystical chants women could try. Of all those wonderfully useless ways, they all have pain involved. Yes, even shaving. Why do you thing a man puts on some sort of burn extinguisher manly smelling concoction on his face after shaving? Because shaving dries out his skin as the razor rips hair off taking any moisture with each swipe. Think of what that does to a lady’s delicate flower of a face! Some tries at having what would be in essence, a bald face, are extremely costly. Like paying for someone to slap, scratch, pluck, pick at and burn your face. All to remove those little bugger hairs. Just like The Terminator though, “They Will Be Back!” Every woman has a hairy face story. Mine is this. When I was in my late teen years I was at the dentist. A nice monster of a guy who had just finished two hours of grinding drilling, picking and jack-hammering in my pie hole. He was standing chairside telling me my teeth were probably the worst he had ever seen when he reached over to whisk away a hair that he saw laying on my chin. Yes! It was attached. HAHA I’m not sure who was more mortified, Dr. Drill or I. That was the beginning of my life long hairy situation. I was in a hair salon one day when I noticed the lady in the next chair had been put in a lying position by her beautician. Not to stare, but I asked my gal what they were doing. AARRGGHH!! She was having her entire face waxed. Not just her lip, not eyebrows, not chinny chin, chin. Her entire face from hairline to neck and a bit beyond. I was told that this poor woman came in once a month and more often in summertime for some reason. Just to be laid back while hot wax was creamed over her face and then ripped off one section at a time. YEOWCH. Every woman I know has some sort of story. Every woman I know deals with this in the bathroom of her life. Every woman I know would follow me to the ends of the earth to find the magic beans that would grow a hair removal, once and done without pain, treatment. She may even consider selling her husband to grab that brass ring. If you have a regiment that works, I want to know about it. If you have a home remedy from your Great Aunt Olga from the old country, cough it up. You know, like a hair ball! Trina lives in Diamond Valley, north of Eureka, Nevada.

The Bible makes this very clear in passages like Psalm 51:5, which states, “Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.” Or Ephesians 2:1 “ Chris Wall And you were dead in the trespasses and sins.” These verses are but a small sampling of what Scripture teaches, as a whole, on the reality of our sinfulness and our deadness to it. Some have a view of salvation that they illustrate as like a person drowning, having a lifesaver thrown out to them, and grabbing hold of it, thereby being rescued (saved). However, considering the above-mentioned biblical data, I do not see this as the correct way of viewing salvation. To use the above-mentioned illustration, salvation is like you being dead at the bottom of the sea, covered in seaweed, and the Holy Spirit gloriously, miraculously bringing you to life. You were not reaching out for help; remember, you were dead. The salvation of a soul can be described only as a miracle. It is utterly unmerited on the part of the sinner (God’s grace) and yet applied to the one who believes. Believes what? You rightly ask. They believe what the Bible teaches. That you are a sinner who is incapable of saving yourself; they believe that, just as Jesus said, He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and no one comes to the Father except through Him (John 14:6). Jesus is not a savior; He is THE Savior. Jesus is not a way; He is THE Way. Salvation is so wonderful because it is the perfect work of the Triune Godhead played out in real-time in the hearts of men. Salvation is not something we can perform in and of ourselves; it is solely the gracious gift of God. I invite you to consider where you stand concerning this great salvation today. Do you know Christ as Lord and Savior? Are you trusting His life, death, and resurrection as your only hope for righteousness before God? Trust Him today and experience this wonderful gift of salvation! Chris Wall is the pastor of Mesquite Baptist Church located at 742 W. Pioneer Blvd. Suite A.

Vegas Realtors report shows 2024 began with home prices higher and the housing supply lower than the same time last year, with signs that home sales could start to bounce back from a slow year. A recent Las Vegas Realtors report shows 2024 began with home prices higher and the housing supply lower than the same time last year, with signs that home sales could start to bounce back from a slow year. LVR reported that the median price of existing single-family homes sold in Southern Nevada through its Multiple Listing Service during January was $445,000. That’s down slightly from December, but up 4.7 percent from $425,000 in January 2023. Local home prices are still below the all-time record of $482,000 set in May of 2022. Meanwhile, the median price of local condos and town homes sold in January was $275,000, up 7.8 percent from $255,000 in January 2023. That’s still down from the all-time high of $287,000 set in August 2022. Merri Perry, a longtime local Realtor who began her term as 2024 LVR president in January, said a persistently tight housing supply continues to hamper home sales while propping up home prices. Mortgage interest rates are also playing a key role. Despite increasing this week to about 7 percent for a 30-year fixed mortgage, rates had been moderating in recent months. Perry sees reasons for optimism in 2024, citing national experts who have been predicting that more homes will be available and sold this year than during 2023. “Over the past few months, we’ve seen benefits from lower interest rates and relatively stable home prices here in Southern Nevada,” Perry said. “Now, if we could just get more homes on the market, we’d really be in good shape.” By the end of January, LVR reported 3,551 single-family homes listed for sale without any sort of offer. That’s down 34.8 percent from one year earlier. Likewise, the 1,136 condos and town homes listed without offers in January represent a 7.9 percent decline from one year earlier. LVR reported a total of 1,955 existing local homes, condos and town homes sold in January. Compared to January 2023, sales were up 11.6 percent for homes and up 19.6 percent for condos and town homes. The sales pace in January equates to a local housing supply of less than 2½ months. One year earlier, Southern Nevada had nearly a four-month housing supply. According to LVR, 2023 was the slowest year for existing local home sales since 2008. During 2023, LVR reported a total of 29,069 sales of existing local homes, condos and town homes. That was down from 2022, when LVR reported 35,584 total sales. That followed a record year for existing local home sales in 2021, when LVR reported 50,010 total properties were sold. That was the first time LVR reported more than 50,000 local properties selling in a year. It topped the previous record set in 2011 by nearly 2,000 sales. During January, LVR found that 27.4 percent of all local property sales were cash transactions. That’s up slightly from 27.2 percent one year ago, but still well below the May 2013 cash buyer peak of 59.5 percent, suggesting that investors have been less active in the local housing market. The number of so-called distressed sales remains near historically low levels. LVR reported that short sales and foreclosures combined accounted for 1.5 percent of all existing local property sales in January. That compares to 0.8 percent of all sales one year ago, 0.8 percent two years ago, 1.2 percent three years ago, 2.7 percent four years ago and 2.8 percent five years ago. These LVR statistics include activity through the end of January 2024. LVR distributes statistics each month based on data collected through its MLS, which does not account for all newly constructed homes sold by local builders or homes for sale by owners. Other highlights include: ■ The total value of local real estate transactions tracked through the MLS during January was more than $842 million for homes and nearly $139 million for condos, high-rise condos and town homes. Compared to one year earlier, total sales values in January were up 19.6 percent for homes and up 17 percent for condos and town homes. ■ In January, 75.2 percent of all existing local homes and 77.7 percent of all existing local condos and town homes sold within 60 days. That compares to one year earlier, when 62.3 percent of all existing local homes and 65.6 percent of all existing local condos and town homes sold within 60 days. Las Vegas Realtors (formerly known as Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors) was founded in 1947 and provides its nearly 17,000 local members with education, training and political representation.

incidence of check fraud is way up. The United States Postal Service delivers nearly 130 billion pieces of U.S. mail every year to 160 million homes and businesses in the United States. As thieves have figured out, many of those deliveries include personal checks, business checks, tax refunds and checks related to government assistance such as Social Security payments and unemployment checks. Although fewer people and businesses write checks, the incidence of check fraud is way up. According to an alert sent out last year by the U.S. Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), there have been successive surges in mail theft yearly since the COVID pandemic. In 2022, reports of check fraud doubled from the previous year to 680,000. The report states that checks from business accounts may be considered more valuable since business accounts are often well-funded giving thieves, potentially, a bigger payday. There are safeguards available, which I’ll l mention in a moment. But first, it is important to know how thieves are using these checks. As the FinCEN alert outlines, fraudsters and organized criminal groups alter or “wash” the checks and replace the payee information you intended with the thieves’ fraudulent identity. During the check-washing process fraudsters will also increase the dollar amount on the check — sometimes by thousands of dollars. In other cases, an entirely new set of checks is created using your company’s routing and account numbers. CHECK PAYMENT SAFETY For solutions, business owners should consider services such as Check Positive Pay, which most major banks make available to business customers. This service ensures that before a check is paid from your account, the dollar amount, the check number and other details match precisely to what you intended. Anything else is flagged as potentially fraudulent, saving you from an unauthorized payment. INCREASE ONLINE PAYMENTS Are you taking advantage of opportunities to reduce the number of checks your business writes? If your company pays vendors with a paper check, see what options are available to pay the vendor electronically, through an ETF (electronic funds transfer) or even a company credit card. Paying employees through direct deposit also reduces the number of paper checks your company issues. ACCEPTING ONLINE PAYMENTS Speaking of online payments, does your business allow customers to pay you online? Online payments accelerate payments into your account and eliminate staff needing to process those checks manually. Consumers have embraced the idea of immediate payment options using a credit or debit card or Automatic Clearing House (ACH) payment. Most major banks can help business owners accept online payments through programs such as eZePay, which provides a secure system for online payment. Consumers can benefit from taking some simple precautions. Seek online payment options for reoccurring payments, such as utility bills, insurance premiums, mortgage and rent payments, homeowners association dues and credit card payments. For those situations where a check is the only way to make payment, many suggest using a pen with blue or black non-erasable gel ink, which soaks into the paper and is difficult to remove in the check-washing process. When mailing a check payment from home, avoid using the privately owned cluster box units at apartment complexes, planned neighborhoods and high-density commercial buildings and take it to the post office instead.
