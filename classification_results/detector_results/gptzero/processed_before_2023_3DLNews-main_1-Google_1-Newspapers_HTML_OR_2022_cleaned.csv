Tree thieves increase in numbers and are more brazen as we enter firewood season, and as a cord of wood is selling for $275 to $295 in Sisters Country. And that may or may not be split and/or delivered. It might just be rounds you pick up. As the price for propane rises, homeowners are turning to Mother Nature more frequently to heat their dwellings, or at least partially so. In Central Oregon a cord of firewood (128 cubic feet; typically a pile eight feet long by four feet wide by four feet high) is up about 25 percent from a year ago, which itself was up double digits from 2020. Where better to get your wood than the Deschutes National Forest, including, perhaps, a stop in Sisters for a bit of shopping. And it’s free. Up to eight cords per season per household for personal use. That’s just about what it takes to heat a three-bedroom home for a winter. The Sisters District Ranger’s office issues permits for about 3,000 cords annually. That might only be half or less of the wood taken, however, as poachers help themselves to trees. And not just any trees — legacy trees that are hundreds of years old. Trees far in excess of the size limit (24 inches in diameter) and, lately, live trees. Permits are only good for dead trees, which are abundant. You might wonder why you even need a permit for a dead tree or why there would be a size restriction for a tree lying on the ground decaying. Start with wildlife. Dead and dying trees provide food and shelter for many wild animals. As a tree dies, each stage of decomposition plays a role in the feeding, breeding, or housing of wildlife. The dead tree trunk is a good source of food for woodpeckers, particularly the pileated varieties. The root is used by flycatchers for perching, by grouse for dusting, and juncos for nesting. Limbs are used as perches, and if hollow, as nest cavities. The spaces between loose bark and the wood are used as hiding and thermal cover by invertebrates and small vertebrates such as the Pacific tree frog. Then there is the nutrient value. Dead wood breaks down into nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. These nutrients enrich the soil near decaying wood, helping new plants grow and keeping living ones healthy as the nutrients are reabsorbed. The woodcutting season ended last week, November 30, having begun May 1. The rules, once you have a valid permit, are few and easy to follow. You can cut and remove all species of standing or down, dead trees less than 24 inches in diameter or 75 inches in circumference located within 150 feet of the road edge. Speaking of the road — stay on it. Do not drive your vehicle onto the forest floor itself. And no winches. That’s it for the most part. Obviously, you won’t get a permit to cut in a designated wilderness area or sensitive riparian area. The Forest Service will give you a very clear and detailed map of where, and where not, to cut. Last week, The Nugget accompanied a forest protection officer, Jeremy Fields, as he showed us dozens of examples of illegal cutting within a few miles of the city limits. Several of the trees, or their remains, were as old as 400 years when they stopped living, and one was 50 inches in diameter, twice the legal limit. We found freshly cut live trees that exceeded the size, lying on the ground; poachers or joy-fallers were probably frightened off only hours before. The District has increased its patrol and has resorted to installing wildlife cameras in some places in hopes of catching violators in the act. Two adult males, not from Sisters Country, were recently cited by Forest Service Law Enforcement officers for violations. Their charges included cutting without a permit, driving off-road, and cutting a tree in excess of size limitations. The penalties carry hefty fines up to $500 per incident. Most violators are not apprehended, even though most of their illegal harvesting is clearly visible from Highway 20 or 242 (McKenzie Highway). District Ranger Ian Reid is hoping to create awareness of the problem and educating the public in the correct procedure for taking a tree from the forest. Reid said, “We have miles and miles of roads with plenty of permissible trees. There really is no need to take trees that don’t meet the rules. If in doubt, just ask the office and we will show you areas of easy access with plenty of trees.” Do not take any enforcement action yourself if you come into proximity with suspected illegal cutting.

(PORTLAND, Ore.) - Two members of the Gypsy Joker Motorcycle Club from Oregon have been sentenced to life in federal prison for kidnapping, torturing, and murdering a former club member. GJMC Portland clubhouse president 61-year old Mark Leroy Dencklau, of Woodburn, Oregon and Portland member 51-year old Chad Leroy Erickson, of Rainier, Oregon, each received a life sentence in prison. This legal undertaking began July 1, 2015, when the body of 56-year old Robert Huggins was found lying in a field in Clark County, Washington. Huggins’ body was badly beaten, and he appeared to have been tortured prior to his death. Robert HugginsIt was soon discovered that Huggins was an estranged member of the GJMC Portland chapter. Robert Huggins Huggins was previously stripped of his club membership for allegedly stealing from the club, then breaking into Dencklau’s Woodburn residence, tying up Dencklau’s girlfriend and stealing multiple firearms. In the days and weeks following this robbery, Dencklau directed club members to find Huggins. Several government witnesses testified at trial to Dencklau, Erickson, and their co-defendants’ roles in the revenge kidnapping, torture, and murder of Huggins. On the evening of June 30th, 2015, Dencklau and others kidnapped Huggins from a residence in Portland and transported him to a rural property in Southwest Washington. Over the course of several hours, Huggins was severely beaten and tortured. Huggins sustained numerous injuries to his head and face, including a fractured skull; lacerations to his chest and torso; and removed nipples. A local medical examiner ruled that Huggins’ death was caused by multiple blunt and sharp force injuries. On June 28th, 2018, a federal grand jury in Portland returned a four-count indictment charging Dencklau; 48-year old Earl Deverle Fisher, of Gresham, Oregon; and 40-year old Tiler Evan Pribbernow, of Portland, with murder in aid of racketeering; kidnapping in aid of racketeering, resulting in death; kidnapping resulting in death and conspiracy to commit kidnapping, resulting in death. Later, on November 29th, 2018, Dencklau; Fisher; Erickson; 64-year old Kenneth Earl Hause, of Aumsville, Oregon; 36-year old Ryan Anthony Negrinelli, of Gresham, Oregon; and 61-year old Joseph Duane Folkerts, of Battleground, Washington, were charged by superseding indictment with racketeering conspiracy. Mark Dencklau and Chad Erickson were convicted at trial in December 2021 of murder in aid of racketeering; kidnapping in aid of racketeering, resulting in death; kidnapping resulting in death; and conspiracy to commit kidnapping, resulting in death. Additionally, Dencklau was found guilty of racketeering conspiracy. The federal jury who convicted Dencklau and Erickson acquitted Erickson and Hause, the GJMC national president, of racketeering conspiracy. On April 12th, 2022, after previously pleading guilty, Pribbernow was sentenced to 140 months in federal prison. Fisher, Negrinelli, and Folkerts have also pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing. ""Mark Dencklau and Chad Erickson will rightfully serve the rest of their lives in federal prison,"" said Scott Erik Asphaug, U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon. ""These men prided themselves in using violence to intimidate others and increase their power and influence among club members and rivals. Organized violent crime has no place in Oregon and will not be tolerated,"" said Scott Erik Asphaug. ""Today’s sentences were years in the making and required a dedicated and coordinated law enforcement effort. We are grateful to all the law enforcement agencies who participated in bringing these men to justice and exposing the Gypsy Jokers as the ruthless, violent gang they are."" According to court documents and trial testimony, the GJMC is known to be a hierarchical criminal organization wherein members and associates maintain their position and status in the organization by participating in, directly or indirectly, various acts of violent racketeering activity including murder, kidnapping, robbery, extortion, narcotics trafficking, and witness tampering. Since the 1980s, the club has been active in several states including Oregon and Washington and, until recently, operated six clubhouses in the Pacific Northwest. The club also has international chapters in Germany, Australia, and Norway. From 2003 until his arrest, Mark Dencklau served as the president of the club’s Portland chapter. The Gypsy Joker Motorcycle Club also oversaw several support clubs in Oregon and Washington including the Road Brothers Northwest Motorcycle Club, Solutions Motorcycle Club, Northwest Veterans Motorcycle Club, High-Side Riders, and the Freedom Fellowship Motorcycle Club. Support club members conducted criminal activities in support of the GJMC and served as a source of new members and revenue for the club. ""The heinous nature of these crimes truly warrant these life sentences,"" said ATF Seattle Field Division Special Agent in Charge Jonathan T. McPherson. ""ATF has vigorously investigated, and will continue to investigate, these outlaw motorcycle gangs when they perpetrate criminal acts."" U.S. Attorney Asphaug and Special Agent in Charge McPherson made the announcement. This case was investigated by the Portland Police Bureau and ATF, with assistance from the U.S. Marshals Service, IRS-Criminal Investigation, the Clark County Sheriff’s Office, Oregon State Police, and the Oregon and Washington State Crime Labs. Leah K. Bolstad and Steven T. Mygrant, Assistant U.S. Attorneys for the District of Oregon, prosecuted the case with Damaré Theriot, Trial Attorney for the Criminal Division’s Organized Crime and Gang Section. This case was brought as part of Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN). This prosecution is the result of an Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) investigation.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:29 pm Trammart News Service INDEPENDENCE -- It was a bright and starry night, not a dark and stormy one. And nothing floated through the air except cheerful conversation. But Big River Paranormal, which investigates suspected hauntings, got down to business downtown last Saturday night in the hunt for ghostly phenomena at the Lyon Lodge on Main Street. However, unless you consider spooky costumes as evidence of a ghoulish presence, there wasn’t anything to report by the time the children for the youth session departed the Masonic building, where the special event was being held. “We look for possible explanations before we call anything potential paranormal evidence,” explained Jason Hassler, one of the investigators. In fact, those associated with Big River Paranormal seemed the opposite of the characters in the classic film “Ghostbusters.” They’re a group that might be more accurately described as “ghost-bidders,” seekers of neighborly contact with the netherworld. Participating youth were shown the kind of tools used by Big River Paranormal, which involve recording technology and computer analysis. On one of the laptops, a past investigation conducted in Independence was shown, from the Pink House Café. What could be called a late-night whispering was heard, along with a creaking door – at a time when no one was in the building. Not to worry, though, the ghost that was reported at the restaurant a few years ago, dubbed “Sarah,” was seen as a warm and friendly one. In fact, many of the spirit-world encounters that have been said to occur in the city’s historic district match that description. “This idea that ghosts are out to hurt us, it is just not true,” said Mariah Hassler, whose work outside of ghost-hunting is professional dog grooming. If such entities reside in a different realm along with humans, what they likely want is just not to be provoked, she explained. The eight members from Big River Paranormal, who gathered in the upper room of the historic structure to get ready for the adult session after the children left, all said they detest the way efforts at paranormal investigation are portrayed on some television shows. “This idea of getting slammed against walls” is just wrong, said Kathy Covey, who is an emergency medical technician when not tracking down signs of spirits. Yet TV programs are often where the public gets the idea that ghosts swoop around trying to harm or scare people. As a result, phenomena that should be a source of wonder and curiosity often causes fear instead, they pointed out. The crew of Big River Paranormal – which is mostly from Oregon, with a few from Washington – functions a bit like a family, traveling together to visit and explore sights or sounds of places where hauntings are suspected or reported. Independence is a great spot because it has a well-documented history of such alleged occurrences, chronicled in the book “Haunted Independence, Oregon,” by Independence City Councilor Marilyn Morton. Many mysterious stories are associated with the Cooper Building, a town landmark. One reportedly occurred in the dome-like cupola, occupied for years by mannequins in the window, presumably as decorations to represent a rumored bordello from long ago. Then, one day, a smashed mannequin was found on the ground below. There was speculation she had jumped from the window, although why? After all, she was only a ceramic creation. Had a troubled soul inhabited what looked like a life-sized doll? “Apparently, the dummy was despondent and decided to end it all,” Morton concluded in her book’s account of the incident. Those in town seemed to appreciate the visit by Big River Paranormal. Nicole Marlin said she decided to take her two children to the ghost-hunting party after the they thoroughly enjoyed the “Ghost Walk” in the downtown area about two weeks ago. She said she thinks ghosts are a distinct possibility – she saw or heard strange noises and inexplicable light flickers “multiple times as I was growing up.” Though scientists have argued the human brain is hard-wired to experience illusions that may be interpreted as ghosts, studies show at least 20% of people believe in them. “We really want to find natural causes,” said Covey, who has been a longtime member of Big River Paranormal, now two decades old. In all the time she has been with organization, only once has an encounter led to real shivers down her spine, she noted. “It was in this old post office in a very small town,” she recalled. As she was standing in it, silently listening, she distinctly heard a voice say, “Get out!” “So, I did,” she said. In Independence, the ghost stories tend to end in a more poignant way. One common tale is of a deceased boy from pioneer days who simply couldn’t stop playing in the building that once housed Main Street Antiques, which is now Coho Realty. The owner at that time, who lived upstairs, needed to get some good sleep at night, so he could be at his best to run the shop below during the day. Local lore has it that the store owner and the lad struck a deal: The boy could play on the second floor during the day, then migrate downstairs to frolic during the night. Last Saturday night, as new strings of lights lit up Main Street in time for Halloween, the atmosphere outside appeared festive, while inside the Masonic building it seemed cozy. Could all that welcoming ambience attract some ghostly interaction? The investigators from Big River Paranormal said it wasn’t possible to predict. In fact, the only sign of a ghost in the room was a white cloth with a face that looked a little like the cartoon Casper, draped by the fireplace. However, a parent participant from the children’s portion of the evening said she had no trouble making a forecast for the adult party. “Everyone is going to have a great time,” she said. Note: Proceeds from the ticket sales to this event are planned to be donated to Masonic youth programs.

Throughout his career, Robinson spoke out about the rampant racism in the industry while also mentoring journalism students as a professor at Federal City College in Washington, D.C., and the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. He received numerous accolades for his work, including the Capital Press Club Journalist of the year award, an Ohio State Award, and the National Education Association (NEA) award. Robinson also served as co-founder of the National Association of Black Journalists. A post shared by BeingAnike (@beinganike) The beloved journalist passed away on December 20, 1988 at the age of 49 due to complications from AIDS, the Los Angeles Times reports. While he never publicly acknowledged his battle with the disease, his dying wish was for his family to reveal his diagnoses so that his story could help others in the Black community be aware of the dangers of the disease as well as options for treatment and education. Robinson left behind a massive legacy, paving the way for generations of journalists who walk in his footsteps and stand on his shoulders. We honor and salute the legacy of trailblazer Max Robinson. Because of him, we can!

SPRINGFIELD: When it comes to hitching a ride to school, we\'re told by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that riding a school bus is the safest way to go about it. In fact, the NHTSA reports that while four to six school-age children die each year in school-owned vehicles, school buses are the safest roadway travel mode. While those kinds of statistics are impressive, the Springfield School District wanted to know, ""if school buses really are safer than cars, why don\'t most school buses have seat belts,"" Stanly Slocum, the district\'s transportation manager, told the school board last week. Fran Brecker overplayed the extent of her injuries after her husband\'s errant ball set off a chain of events last Saturday. A lot of it comes down to how they\'re designed. Unlike other vehicles on the road today, traffic analysts say school buses offer better crash and rollover protection. That\'s because they use ""compartmentalization,"" which includes spacing seats close together. Additionally, seats in school buses feature high, energy-absorbing backs. That feature is said to prevent children from being tossed around in a crash. As safe as school buses are, it\'s important to note that most school buses don\'t have seat belts. While such belts are an absolute necessity in most cars and have been since 1968, that\'s not always the case with school buses. And if you\'re wondering why? It\'s because seat belts just aren\'t necessary for school buses, the NHTSA reports. ""There is no question that seat belts play an important role in keeping passengers safe in these vehicles. But school buses are different by design, including a different kind of safety restraint system that works extremely well,"" the NHTSA explains. And that safety restraint system? It\'s all in how school buses are designed. ""Through compartmentalization, children are protected from crashes by strong, closely-spaced seats that have energy-absorbing seat backs,"" the NHTSA says. However, while most school buses don\'t have seat belts, some do. In fact, the NHTSA requires that small buses or school vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds or less must be equipped with lap or lap/shoulder belts. School buses are designed with your child\'s safety in mind officials say.. And while they may not come readily equipped with seat belts, the NHTSA reports that\'s OK.""

Several well-established and reputable brick-and-mortar universities, such as Spalding University, have been offering busy professionals with full workloads new career advancement opportunities with a higher-tier qualification than the entry-level Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) qualification. They are accomplishing this by offering the entire program for study online, allowing people with family obligations, financial commitments and busy working lives to study from the comfort of their own homes. The programs are designed to be completed around existing commitments, not instead of them. An advanced online social work degree from Spalding University such as the Master of Social Work (MSW) qualification can, for all intents and purposes, be seen as a career-building strategy. Trained social workers with the BSW entry-level qualification can progress to more senior and specialized roles within the profession upon gaining their MSW degree. These roles not only grant them more leadership influence in their agency or work setting of choice but also require a higher tier of training to enter. In addition to the specialties mentioned in the introduction, the MSW degree equips social workers who successfully earn it to become executive directors or senior administrators of their chosen agencies. While it is true that increased authority must be accompanied by a heightened sense of duty and responsibility as well as deeper expertise, it is also true that this advanced credential brings with it very attractive financial rewards. For example, a social worker holding a BSW degree and working with children, families or in a school setting can expect to earn an average salary of $45,281; with an MSW degree, this leaps to $67,400. Similarly, a medical social worker with a BSW qualification can expect to earn $58,139 per year, but this climbs to $67,545 with an MSW degree. Of course, the roles occupied by MSW graduates tend to include more complex duties. Those wishing to specialize as Licensed Clinical Social Workers can expect an annual salary of $75,855, but this specialty is only available to professionals who have earned an MSW degree or higher. The MSW equips its graduates with enhanced critical thinking skills and the capacity to draw on research methodologies to improve evidence-based practices in core areas such as engagement, assessment, intervention and evaluation. Holders of the MSW credential will stand out from other candidates with more limited experience and less advanced qualifications. Moreover, the degree equips those who have earned it to go beyond the arts of interpersonal communication and understanding. It extends to encompassing the wider cultural, social and political contexts in which such relationships are embedded. Social work intervention thereby becomes informed by more theoretically sophisticated and multidimensional perceptual frameworks. In effect, practice extends beyond face-to-face interactions with clients and colleagues to encompass effective interactions with community leaders, policy makers and funders.'}]"
