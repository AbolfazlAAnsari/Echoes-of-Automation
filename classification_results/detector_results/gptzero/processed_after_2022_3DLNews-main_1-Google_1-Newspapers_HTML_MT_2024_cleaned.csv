Nero fiddled while Rome burned. I think that’s fake news, but the point is clear: the guy at the top was playing by himself while his empire was being destroyed. MAGA Republicans choose to believe that Donald Trump is or should be the guy at the top. So those in the U.S. House of Representatives are basically guarding his playtime while the world order established after World War II — led by the rich and powerful United States of America — fizzles. They said they wouldn’t pass a bill to continue supporting Ukraine in its almost 2-year-long war against basically fascist Russia unless the bill included significant support in dealing with our southern border. Senators from both sides of the aisle spent four months working out just that, and President Biden said he would sign the bill immediately once the House approved it, but no, Trump thinks that would take away the only issue he has to campaign on, so House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) won’t even let the bill come to consideration. Montana is the fifth highest state for veterans, and our Senator Jon Tester has worked long and hard on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee to improve services and support for them and veterans all over the country. They offered their lives to support that world order established after World War II. Is that all to go up in smoke because Donald Trump wants to be like Putin and run the show? On Tuesday, Nov. 5, we as voters get to help decide that. In the meantime, if you “get it,” contact Matt Rosendale and Ryan Zinke, our Congressional Representatives, and ask them what they’re trying to do. (Rosendale is not a veteran, but Zinke makes a big deal of having been a Navy Seal, supposedly defending the very world order at risk here.)

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 2:52 pm Editor Native American actress Alaqua Cox stars as Maya Lopez in Marvel Entertainment's 'Echo' showing on Disney+ and Hulu this week. SANTA FE, NM —Marvel Entertainment presented a special screening of their latest Hulu and Disney+ series ‘Echo’ in November. The first two episodes were shown to a small gathering and featured a short Q&A with director Sydney Freeland (Navajo). Streaming on Disney+, the origin story of ‘Echo’ revisits Maya Lopez, played by Alaqua Cox (Menominee and Mohican), whose ruthless behavior in New York City catches up with her in her hometown. She must face her past, reconnect with her Native American roots and embrace the meaning of family and community if she ever hopes to move forward. Echo is a spin-off from the 2022’s “Hawkeye” limited series. Unlike previous Marvel television outings through Disney+, Echo will be geared for more mature audiences, much like the former Netflix-released Marvel shows Daredevil, Punisher, Iron Fist and Jessica Jones. The main character, Maya Lopez (aka Echo), is based on the comic book character. She is Native American, deaf, partial amputee and a ‘villian’ set in the Daredevil storyline. She is a protégé of William Fisk aka Kingpin (Vincent D’Onofrio). Sydney Freeland (Navajo) directed and set the tone for the 'Echo' five-episode series. Alaqua is perfect for the role as well. Like Maya, Alaqua is Native American, deaf and a partial amputee. Echo is Alaqua’s first acting role, having been an Amazon/Fedex employee before being cast as Maya Lopez. Darnell Besaw, who plays Maya as a child in Echo, is also Alaqua’s cousin. The screening presented the first two episodes. Episode one recapped Maya’s history with clips from ‘Hawkeye,’ plus new footage. Daredevil fans will be excited and disappointed to know there is a cameo from their favorite blind superhero (as seen in footage leaked on TikTok), and an extensive history with Kingpin. Second episode delves into Maya’s strained relationship with her family and community as she seeks to make a name and place for herself. The first two episodes feel distinctly part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This is a world where Iron Man, Captain America and Thor are heroes, Thanos nearly wiped-out half of all living beings, and alien worlds are now known. Maya starts off as a mere human criminal working for a powerful and dangerous crime syndicate, but a run-in with an Avenger who tells her who ordered her father’s murder changes that. She begins to connect with her community and tribe, and in the process, ancestorial forces that are awakening. Yet, for Native Americans there is something also familiar about Maya’s interactions with family and friends, with the way the community speaks to each other, and the sense that distance doesn’t mean separation. ‘Indian humor’ is prevalent throughout with a lot provided by Graham Greene (Dances With Wolves, The Last of Us). Director Freeland, who helped develop the series, directed the feature film ‘Drunktown’s Finest’ in Gallup, New Mexico, on the Navajo Reservation, and had directed episodes of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, Reservation Dogs and The Walking Dead. Freeland said they worked with the Choctaw Nation to guide the story, and to accurately represent their culture. Morningstar Angeline (Navajo/Chippewa/Blackfeet/Shoshone/Latinx) takes part in the 'Echo' series. Freeland said the Choctaw Nation was at first apprehensive about working with Marvel. She told them that Marvel wasn’t just telling them they were going to make the series, but instead wanted to ‘partner’ with them to tell an accurate and faithful depiction of the tribe and have their input. The Choctaw then worked with Marvel on story and historical and culture accuracy. Marvel recently showed the series to the Choctaw Nation. The first Echo series trailer was released on YouTube in two versions, the second with Choctaw subtitles. There are several Native American superheroes in Marvel comics, and Disney+ series ‘What If?’ introduced a Haudenosaunee superhero Kahhori, but Echo is the first Marvel Entertainment property to feature Native American representation in a series or movie. Superhero movies have been criticized for their lack of diversity, though Marvel has produced movies like Shang-shi and Black Panther that delved into Chinese and African storylines. So far, reviews of the series have been positive, while social media has challenged Marvel’s so-called ‘woke’ agenda by releasing media that feature and star people of color, women or LGTBTQ+ people. Prior to any footage or story details being released, alleged media critics blasted the show. Much of the same criticism faced Prey, the latest movie in the Predator franchise starring Amber Midthunder (Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux tribes) as a Comanche hunter set in the 1800s. Many panned the movie before it was released, yet Prey was met with acclaim and good reviews when it was released online. All five episodes of Echo will be released on January 9, which is a change for Marvel Television releases. Previous Disney+ series have been released week-by-week. The change has alarmed some online critics who’ve alleged that insiders say Disney, who owns Marvel Entertainment, are disappointed with the final product and are pushing out the episodes at once to get them out of the way. However, Echo is allegedly the start of more adult-themed television shows like the cancelled Netflix Marvel television series. Unlike the previous Marvel pantheon, Echo is released under ‘Marvel Spotlight,’ and future project include the continuance of the Daredevil series starring Charlie Cox and D’Onofrio. It will be interesting to see what Indian Country thinks of Echo once it’s released. Echo also stars Chaske Spencer (“Wild Indian,” “The English”), Graham Greene (“1883,” “Goliath”), Tantoo Cardinal (“Killers of the Flower Moon,” “Stumptown”), Devery Jacobs (FX’s “Reservation Dogs,” “American Gods”), Zahn McClarnon (“Dark Winds,” FX’s “Reservation Dogs”), Cody Lightning (“Hey, Viktor!” “Four Sheets to the Wind”) and Vincent D’Onofrio (“Hawkeye,” “Godfather of Harlem”). Episodes of the series are directed by Sydney Freeland (Navajo) and Catriona McKenzie (Gunaikurnai). Executive producers are Kevin Feige, Stephen Broussard, Louis D’Esposito, Victoria Alonso, Brad Winderbaum, Richie Palmer, Marion Dayre and Jason Gavin (Blackfeet). Co-executive producers are Jennifer L. Booth, Sydney Freeland and Amy Rardin. Christina King (Seminole) is supervising producer. Cast: Alaqua Cox, Chaske Spencer, Graham Greene, Tantoo Cardinal, Devery Jacobs, Zahn McClarnon, Cody Lightning and Vincent D’Onfrio. Directed by: Sydney Freeland, Catriona McKenzie.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:56 pm Cowboys try to defend the basket, but Shelby tops them. The Shelby Coyotes picked up two conference wins last week, defeating the Conrad Cowboys 47-34, and the Rocky Boy Stars 61-59. Friday the Coyotes traveled to Conrad and started a little slow, and trailed after the first quarter, 16-13, the Coyotes and the Cowboys had a slow second quarter, but Shelby outscored the Cowboys 7-5, trailing one at the half, 21-20. Shelby opened the third quarter with stingy defense, only allowing Conrad four points, but scored 11 taking a six point lead into the fourth quarter. Shelby kept the pressure on the Cowboys in the fourth, and grabbed the victory 47-34. Kyle McDermott led the scoring with 16 points, Hayden Schilling dropped in 11, Randon Richman added nine, Kobe Hooker netted five, and Kody Standiford, Tyler Hansen and Brenden Clark each scored two. Saturday the Coyotes were in Rocky Boy looking to avenge a loss from earlier this season. The game was close all through, the score was tied at 10 after the first quarter. Shelby claimed a two point lead in the second quarter outscoring the Stars 20-18, in what would be the difference in the game. The fourth quarter saw the lead swing back and forth, and Shelby had the ball with the score tied and 29 seconds to go. Rocky Boy stole the ball but missed a layup with ten seconds to play. Richman grabbed the rebound and was looking to advance the ball when he was fouled with 1,7 seconds on the clock. He sank both free throws to give the Coyotes the victory. Richman led the scoring charge with 23, McDermott added 22, Schilling and Hansen each had six, and Clark added four. Coach Mike White stated, “Coyotes had a strong weekend. Winning in the 1B is always a challenge, winning on the road is even harder. Very proud of kids’ effort and grit! Collectively we rebounded better, which was a big focus this week. Tyler Hansen stepped up for us Saturday night and gave us huge minutes. Scored six big points and controlled the paint. He has been patiently waiting for a moment like that and I couldn’t be prouder of him. We look forward to finishing the regular season next weekend with two big games. We travel to Fairfield Friday night and then at home Saturday against the Wolves, as we celebrate Senior night.” Log In Keep it Clean.

The Assessment was created to share concerns and give feedback on what would improve healthcare in the area. The top three needs that came to light were improved quality of care, more primary care providers and more specialists. Logan Health asked, the public answered and now the solution is here. Logan Health Shelby will officially be opening the doors to its new clinic, located in the space vacated and previously utilized by Marias Healthcare Clinic, on Jan. 15, 2024. “We’re opening the clinic with these goals in mind, bringing in experienced providers who live in Shelby, but work elsewhere, to provide primary care,” said Carrie Taylor, Logan Health Director of Shelby Rural Health Clinic. “We also hope to bring in additional rotating specialists to see providers in clinic or via telehealth. The clinic is officially open Jan. 15, 2024 and we will be seeing our first patients on Jan. 17, 2024.” Providers at Shelby Rural Health Clinic are Shelby residents who have been traveling to work at other facilities. Molly Asper, who specializes in geriatrics and family medicine, has been working at Logan Health Cut Bank Clinic and will now be transferring to Shelby. Ariel Weishaar, specializing in pediatric and family medicine, has been practicing in Great Falls and already seeing many patients from Shelby. Shane Jenson specializes in pain management and family medicine and also has ties to Shelby. He will be joining the staff at the end of February and RN Lisa Aichlmayr, currently at Logan Health Shelby Assisted Living, will also be making the move to the new clinic. “Additionally, we have added a new specialist at Logan Health Shelby, Dr. Eddie Jones, who will perform advanced endoscopic procedures,” said Taylor. “Once fully open our visiting providers will also see patients in that space.

The remodel is being done in two phases, with most of the clinic being remodeled in phase 1, with completion expected by fall of 2024. Due to limited space during the remodel the facility is starting with just the three providers but, the goal is to bring in additional primary care and specialty providers. Another goal upon completion of the remodel is the ability to offer extended evening hours for urgent care. While it will take some time before the extended urgent care hours are available, Logan Health Shelby has added three new full-time, highly skilled, certified emergency medicine providers for the emergency department at Logan Health Shelby. “Collectively, Greg Bayse, APP, Vicki Lear, PA-C, and Laura Wittman, ENP-C, FNP-C, have 45 years of experience in emergency medicine,” said Taylor.
