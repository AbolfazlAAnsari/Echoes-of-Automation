(KPEL News) - The man behind ""Bad, Bad Leroy Brown,"" “One Less Set of Footsteps,"" and other hits was doing a tour of southern colleges in 1973 when he made a stop in Natchitoches, Louisiana. After performing at Northwestern State University, his plane took off from a small airport near campus. However, the pilot did not get high enough to evade a pecan tree near the runway. The plane crashed, and Jim Croce died 50 years ago today. Croce\'s death resulted in a massive posthumous sales boom that is still unrivaled to this day, according to Billboard. The sudden death of someone who was so new to the mainstream was of course a shock. But few would have expected what would happen next: Croce’s death triggered one of the biggest posthumous sales booms in history. “I Got a Name,” which was released the day after Croce’s death, reached the top 10 on the Hot 100 in November. The following month, the poignant “Time in a Bottle” (which had appeared on his 1972 album You Don’t Miss Around With Jim) became his second No. 1. It made Croce just the third artist in the history of the Hot 100 to top the chart posthumously, following Otis Redding (“(Sittin’ on) the Dock of the Bay,” 1968) and Janis Joplin (“Me and Bobby McGee,” 1971). Moreover, Croce became the first artist in Hot 100 history to top the chart both while living and after his death. Croce\'s plane, a Beechcraft E18S, failed to clear a pecan tree while taking off and crashed. There were six people on board the plane at the time of the crash - including Croce, his guitarist Maury Muehleisen, comedian George Stevens, manager Kenneth D. Cortose, road manager Dennis Rast, and pilot Robert Elliott. All were killed in the crash. The event remains a notable part of the history of Natchitoches and is still talked about in the community. On Monday evening, the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame & Northwest Louisiana History Museum hosted a ""standing-room-only crowd of music lovers,"" according to the Natchitoches Parish Journal. One of the most notable stories from the period involves Croce\'s widow, Ingrid, and the mayor of Natchitoches at the time. According to sources, when awarding Ingrid and her son, A.J. a key to the city, the mayor told her, “You’ll be glad to know we cut that damn tree down.” Days after the crash, she received a letter Croce had sent her that day. It talked about his desire to retire from performing, instead becoming “a public hermit,” who concentrated on writing in order to attend to his family. Croce closed with “Give my little man (A.J.) a kiss,” followed by, “Remember, it’s the first 60 years that count, and I’ve got 30 more to go.” 50 years later, Croce\'s music is still well-known in the music world, and his death is being remembered across the world.'}]"

(WPIX) – A kilo press that packages “large quantities of drugs” was found inside a New York City day care center where four small children overdosed on Friday, leaving one of the children dead, according to the NYPD. Joe Kenny, the NYPD Chief of Detectives, said at a press briefing that officers responded to find three of the children unresponsive inside the Divino Nino day care center in the Bronx on Friday afternoon, all “exhibiting symptoms of opioid exposure.” Narcan was administered and revived two of them, a 2-year-old boy and 8-month-old girl. But 1-year-old Nicholas Dominici could not be saved. Mayor Eric Adams, who also spoke at the briefing, said he had been in contact with the mother and father who lost their baby son. It’s believed fentanyl could have been involved in the child’s fatal overdose. Thanks for signing up! Watch for us in your inbox.

Chief Kenny said a fourth child had been removed from the day care at 12:15 p.m. Friday by his mother and brought home. The 2-year-old boy was acting “lethargic and unresponsive,” so the mother brought him to Bronx Care, where Narcan was administered. “His life was saved,” Chief Kenny said. Health Commissioner Ashwin Vasan noted opioids are powerful drugs driving the city’s overdose crisis. “A small child is not someone we would think would be at risk of interaction. … It can come through inhalation, ingestion, or through touching the skin, intoxicating the recipient,” Vasan said at the briefing. Sadly, small children have been exposed to opioids like fentanyl before, often in homes, sometimes with deadly results. “This crisis is real,” Adams said, “and it is a real wake-up call for individuals who have opioids or fentanyl in their homes.” The Health Commissioner said Divino Nino was a “home-based” childcare site that opened in January this year under the official authority of the New York State Office of Children and Family Services. Vasan revealed the city’s Department of Health conducted inspections on behalf of the state, with the most recent one being a “surprise” inspection last week on September 9. No violations were found during that visit, Vasan said. Kenny said investigators are actively looking for the people who were utilizing the kilo press found in the day care. “Tonight is every parent’s worst nightmare,” Police Commissioner Edward Caban added.

The presidents of Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) all had to defend their policies, though they often declined to give specifics. “Today, each of you have a chance to answer to atone for the many specific instances of vitriolic, hate-filled antisemitism on your respective campuses that have denied students the safe learning environment,” Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), chairwoman for the House Education Committee, told them in her opening statement. All three used their speaking time to highlight efforts they have made to protect Jewish students, such as increasing campus security, providing mental health services and investigating complaints of antisemitism. UPenn President Liz Magill pointed to an action plan announced last month at her school that focuses on security, engagement and education. The university also created a task force that will “identify concrete actionable recommendations” and produce a report. “Our campus actions to date have protected students’ safety, minimized disruptions to campus activities and protected the right to free expression,” said Sally Kornbluth, the head of MIT, also mentioning efforts the school has made to educate students on antisemitism even before the Oct. 7 attack. These answers failed to satisfy lawmakers. Rep. Donald Norcross (D-N.J.) went after Magill for a festival that was held at UPenn by students where antisemitic speakers were invited. While Magill said she personally condemns those speakers’ views, she added the school will not “censor based on the content.” Norcross then asked if Magill would allow speakers with racist views at her campus, to which she only responded that the school would “follow our policies.” Harvard President Claudine Gay took some of the biggest hits in the hearing, fielding complaints that the school does not care about intellectual diversity and could have been influenced by foreign money in its response to the Oct. 7 attack. Gay said it is a hard task balancing free speech with safety in these times, admitting in her opening statement she had “not always gotten it right.” She denounced speech she found abhorrent, such as calls to “intifada” since the attack, and she said it is “not OK” for students to shout down speakers with whom they disagree. The Israel-Hamas war has created hotbeds of controversy on college campuses, with numerous protests for and against Israel over the past two months that have led to assaults and complaints of antisemitism and Islamophobia. Even at the hearing, protesters could be heard yelling from the hallway. Members of the public were dressed in Israeli and Palestinian flags and symbols and attempted to grab a seat in the hearing. Many were ushered to an overflow room, but some stayed outside the hearing room where commotion was overheard inside. Several people outside called for a “cease-fire now,” and others asked “what happened before October 7th?” Capitol police told people to stay away from the hearing room door. Republicans allowed Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), a Harvard alum, to speak six times, and she peppered Gay with questions while reiterating her calls for the school president’s resignation. Stefanik asked each university president if the call to genocide against Jewish people violates bullying or harassment policies on their campuses. “If the speech becomes conduct, it can be harassment,” Magill said. “Conduct meaning committing the act of genocide?” Stefanik fired back. Each president said that it depends on the context of how the call is made, leading Stefanik to say such answers are “unacceptable.” Rep. Brandon Williams (R-N.Y.), who is a graduate of UPenn and was a visiting student at Harvard for a year, said it was “unfortunate” to be connected to such institutions after their behavior. Several Democratic lawmakers also highlighted instances of Islamophobia and other forms of hate on college campuses on the rise since the conflict began. Rep. Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.) asked Gay to detail the steps taken by Harvard to support Palestinian students since the start of the conflict, but she ran out of time to provide an answer. Fellow Connecticut Rep. Joe Courtney (D) called out House Republicans for denouncing antisemitism while also calling for budget cuts to the Department of Education’s Civil Rights Office, which investigates discrimination including antisemitism and Islamophobia. He also highlighted the recent shooting of three Palestinian students in Burlington, Vt., near a campus last week. The shooting, he said, proves why the office “needs to get full funding” as the House continues to discuss the government’s fiscal 2024 budget. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Mich.) raised a question about government intervention on college campuses in reference to recent efforts to limit academic diversity, equity and inclusion programs, in addition to discrimination and hate. She asked what happens when we allow the government to dictate what is going on on college campuses, particularly “what we’re seeing in Florida and in West Virginia.” The hearing went into recess for lawmakers to vote on a resolution condemning the “drastic rise of antisemitism.” All Republicans voted for the resolution, which “clearly and firmly states that anti-Zionism is antisemitism,” while Democrats were split on the issue. The vote ended 311-14-92. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

(WVUE) - A Chalmette woman has filed a petition objecting to the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump and seeking an injunction to disqualify him from the Louisiana primary ballot next March. Ashley Reeb filed the lawsuit against outgoing Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin, asking that Ardoin be compelled to disqualify Trump from the state’s ballot because of the former president’s role in the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. “Both Trump’s actions (engaging in insurrection) as well as his inaction (giving aid and comfort to insurrectionists) on Jan. 6, 2021, disqualify him from holding any office of/under the United States,” the petition asserts. Reeb filed for the injunction on Dec. 22 in the 19th Judicial District Court in East Baton Rouge Parish. She confirmed her role in filing the suit but declined further comment to Fox 8. As the petitioner, Reeb asserts that Trump should be disqualified from seeking a second term in the White House, based upon Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution. That provision states: “No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrections or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.” Related coverage Michigan Supreme Court will not hear appeal in Trump case, allowing him to appear on primary ballot Colorado Supreme Court bans Trump from the state’s ballot under Constitution’s insurrection clause Police investigating incidents involving Colorado justices after Trump removed from state’s ballot A similar challenge to Trump’s eligibility, citing the same Constitutional argument, recently succeeded in Colorado. That state’s Supreme Court on Dec. 19 removed Trump from the ballot on a 4-3 vote from its justices, who wrote, “We do not reach these conclusions lightly. We are mindful of the magnitude and weight of the questions now before us. We are likewise mindful of our solemn duty to apply the law, without fear or favor, and without being swayed by public reaction to the decisions that the law mandates we reach.” The Colorado decision has been stayed through Jan. 4. Trump’s campaign has given notice it intends to appeal the Colorado decision before the US Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the Michigan Supreme Court on Wednesday (Dec. 27) rejected a similar effort to remove Trump from the ballot in that state. “Significantly, Colorado’s election laws differ from Michigan’s laws in a material way that is directly relevant to why the appellants in this case are not entitled to the relief they seek concerning the presidential primary election in Michigan,” Justice Elizabeth Welch wrote Wednesday, explaining the court’s decision not to take up the case. Disqualification lawsuits relating to Trump’s appearance on the ballot are pending in other states, including Texas, Nevada and Wisconsin. Dillard University political analyst Robert Collins described Reeb’s petition as “a very long shot.” “It might be a different situation if he had been criminally convicted in a court of law of insurrection,” Collins said. In the aftermath of the Jan. 6 riot, the House of Representatives impeached Trump and he faces a federal indictment for his role in attempting to subvert the election results Congress was certifying that day. The Republican-controlled Senate voted to acquit Trump, and he has not been convicted of criminal wrongdoing. “To make an interpretation that a president had engaged in insurrection, and to remove him from the ballot, I think most judges ideologically are just not there,” Collins said. LSU political science professor James Stoner agreed that the lack of a conviction likely undermines the petition. “The whole meaning of the rule of law is that a prosecutor can’t just jail you because he thinks you’ve done something wrong,” Stoner said. “That’s only the first step.

He indicated multiple employees of the fast food outlet were interviewed as part of the initial probe, and some may be interviewed again. A coroner\'s vehicle arrived in the late night hours and took the body to the morgue for an autopsy to confirm the victim\'s identity and cause of death. “We\'re going to re-examine all the evidence tomorrow and they\'re going to conduct an autopsy to give us the cause and manner of death. So there are a few more steps that we need to take before a (final) determination is made,” the police captain said. Autopsy results weren\'t expected to be available for a number of days.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) - Zion Williamson sprinted down the sideline of an empty practice football field on a campus that houses the headquarters of the NBA\'s New Orleans Pelicans and NFL\'s New Orleans Saints. Nearby, a couple members of the Pelicans\' training staff oversaw the injury-plagued forward\'s offseason conditioning work. That scene back in August symbolized a substantive change Williamson made in an effort to come back healthy after playing in just 29 games last season because of a hamstring injury. No longer was the 2019 No. 1 overall draft pick spending offseasons away from New Orleans, doing his own thing. “I wanted change,” Williamson said. “If I wanted to change, I’ve got to do something different. So, I sat down with the Pels and came up with a great plan."" Williamson is among a handful of promising young NBA players aiming to become successful comeback stories this NBA season - from Charlotte\'s LaMelo Ball, to Detroit\'s Cade Cunningham and Oklahoma City\'s Chet Holmgren. “Those guys can change your organization. They\'re impact players,” Pelicans coach Willie Green said. “So, when you\'re missing them, you\'re trying to figure out how to make adjustments, generate offense, the style that you want to play. But when you have them and your team is whole ... it gives you a glimpse of what the possibilities are. “A big part of it is staying healthy, being on the floor,” Green added. “Hopefully, all of those guys do. It\'s better for the NBA.” Williamson is entering the first year of a five-year contract extension he signed in July 2022 that could pay him more than $200 million if he remains fit and produces as hoped. His potential to be a dynamic, high-scoring force has been evident when he\'s played. He\'s averaged about 26 points and seven rebounds. His combination of explosiveness, vertical leap and ball-handling is unusual for a player of his listed size: 6-foot-6, 285 pounds. That\'s one reason he\'s captured basketball fans\' imagination since his high school days in Spartanburg, South Carolina, and through his lone college season at Duke. Fans in New Orleans celebrated in the streets when Williamson was drafted, but haven\'t gotten to see him play much in person. Williamson has played in 114 total games in his first four NBA seasons - 61 during the pandemic-affected 2020-21 season, when arena crowds were limited to just a few thousand per game. He played 24 games as a rookie - mostly because of a preseason right knee injury - and missed all his third pro season because of a fractured right foot. This past offseason, Williamson said he “stayed in New Orleans for a big part of the summer, working with the Pels, being on the same page with them,” and “really just locking in to every aspect of my body.” He made it through the preseason healthy, periodically providing promising, above-the-rim highlights, and is slated to play in the Pelicans\' regular season opener in Memphis on Wednesday night. LAMELO BALL The Hornets\' star point guard played in just 36 games last season because of ankle problems, including a fracture in February that sidelined him the rest of the way. He\'s back now, albeit in ankle braces. Ball was among the more productive point guards in the league when he played last season, averaging 23.3 points and 8.4 assists per game. The Hornets averaged 6.8 more points per 100 possessions with Ball on the court. Charlotte coach Steve Clifford said the Hornets simply can’t win without the 2022 All-Star, who was also the NBA\'s third overall draft choice in 2020. “I think that he is ready to take a step,” Clifford said. “When you actually sit in the summer where you can go slower and watch, he was making really good progress in a lot of ways."" CADE CUNNINGHAM Drafted first overall out of Oklahoma State in 2021, the point guard was limited to 12 games last season by a stress fracture in his left leg. But Cunningham proclaimed himself “100%” when Pistons training camp began. Before that, USA Basketball chose Cunningham to join its select team to practice and scrimmage against its World Cup team. “You saw glimpses of how good he is, and also forecast how good he can be, at the USA deal this summer,” first-year Pistons coach Monty Williams said. Now Cunningham aims to build upon his first pro season, when he averaged 17.4 points, 5.6 assists and 5.5 rebounds - and was unanimously voted to the NBA All-Rookie first team. CHET HOLMGREN Drafted second overall out of Gonzaga in 2022, Holmgren missed his entire rookie season with a lisfranc injury in his right foot. Now he says he\'s as ready as he can be to join a team that made last season\'s Western Conference play-in without him. When his injury occurred, Holmgren said he was determined not to let ""this one bad thing spiral into many bad things and let it accumulate to one big, bad situation.” This offseason, he was well enough to join Cunningham on USA Basketball\'s select team. “I didn’t want to shy away from opportunities to play against good players,” Holmgren said. “I feel like I did a really good job this summer of really calculating where I was playing and the situations and the settings - but still going out and really chasing the competition and opportunity to get better.” ___ Your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers:'}]"
