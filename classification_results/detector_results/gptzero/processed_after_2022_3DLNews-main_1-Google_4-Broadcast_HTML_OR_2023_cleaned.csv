EUGENE, Ore. – Staff at popular weekly publication ‘Eugene Weekly’ said they have been dealt a “massive financial blow” after they recently discovered someone had allegedly been taking money from them for years, forcing them to make drastic cuts to their operations. Editor-in-Chief Camilla Mortensen said just before Christmas, staff discovered a “trusted person, someone we saw every day” appeared to have been pocketing money from the paper. “To the degree that we are massively in debt,” she said. “We have creditors all over town that we didn't know about and we're fighting to keep the paper going.” Homepage of Eugene Weekly's website. A spokesperson with the Eugene Police Department confirmed they took a theft report, but could not comment further as the case is under investigation. Mortensen said staff were always aware they were facing financial struggles like many newspapers do, but were shocked to know embezzlement may have contributed to their challenges. “I would say more than $100,000, at least,” she said when characterizing the paper’s overall debt. “And that's not including small business loans and things we had taken when we thought we were operating normally.” Eugene Weekly’s owners have hired forensic accountants to figure out the damage done from the alleged theft, Mortensen said.

Every so often, though, a story picks up a much wider audience – often when people are seeking information as breaking news unfolds. Crime and mayhem always draw attention, but readers also gravitated toward stories about unique Salem events and projects, and to our investigative work about a cyclist killed in a collision involving an on-duty DEA agent. Here are the 10 most-viewed stories of the year produced by your Salem Reporter team. The second year of the revived holiday parade put on by the Salem Main Street Association was popular, and people wanted all the details. If you haven’t yet had your fill of Christmas lights, you can see our photo gallery here. There are hundreds of apartments being built across Salem, along with several other commercial and retail projects. We rounded up the major ones downtown. If you’re curious about where these projects stand, we’ll have an update on many of them later this week. Salem has seen an uptick in the past two years of shootings involving teenagers, both as perpetrators and victims. It’s an issue our team is dedicated to covering, both through day-to-day crime reports and, more importantly, deeper looks at root causes and solutions. This report, a drive-by shooting injuring a 13-year-old boy, stood out for the victim’s young age. This was one of several stories our team put out after one of Salem’s most iconic churches caught fire in August. Police said a man started a dumpster fire which quickly spread to the church. Reporter Abbey McDonald visited St. Joseph Catholic Church last week as Father Jeff Meeuwsen prepared for Christmas mass. The latest on the church’s rebuilding is here. Salem police initially released few details about a March collision between a cyclist commuting home from her state job and a pickup truck. Only after probing from Salem Reporter did police confirm the pickup truck’s driver was a DEA agent. Reporter Ardeshir Tabrizian has followed the investigation since, producing several reports based on public records and witness interviews in the weeks and month following the crash. After months of investigation and review, a Marion County grand jury indicted DEA agent Samuel Landis in September, charging him with criminally negligent homicide. The agent has since argued successfully to move the case to federal court so he can argue immunity from prosecution based on his law enforcement role – a defense not available in state court. Salem Reporter continues to follow the case. Salemites had an extra reason to visit a city park this year – the chance to find one of 120 unique glass birds. The project ran from June to September, featuring four parks across the city. Every year, people across Salem and Oregon set off both legal and illegal fireworks on the 4th of July – and complain about their neighbors doing the same. A last minute decision by city leaders, and then county leaders, to ban all fireworks sparked frustration from people who had to belay their celebration plans. Salem got through the holiday without major fires. A high risk grass fire in the hills south of Salem placed hundreds of people under evacuation orders on Aug. 23. Firefighters contained the blaze after it burned 25 acres and two structures. Early in her tenure as governor, Tina Kotek threw cold water on the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians’ plans to build an off-reservation casino in northeast Salem. The project has been years in the making. The tribe’s plans remain under federal review, though the governor’s approval would be required to move forward. This story was the first of several updates our team put out during a chaotic day when a man died in a shootout with police. A fuller account of the day’s events following a grand jury review of the shooting is here. What issues and stories do you want to see our newsroom cover in 2024?

Taylor Mirfendereski Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video Play Video Close Video The arsenic discovery King County\'s violations Employee Complaints MAPLE VALLEY, Wash. Even the simplest of tasks are harder for Jon DeMello than for most people. Whether it’s a trip to the grocery store, a trip to the mailbox or just a walk up the stairs, he said he becomes so winded that he has to stop everything to catch his breath. “It hasn’t been easy, that’s for sure,” he said. DeMello, 75, has been in and out of Washington state hospitals and medical clinics for years, searching for answers about why he developed the lesions on his lungs that doctors said are contributing to his respiratory problems. It’s the latest medical condition of many for the North Bend resident, who previously had kidney cancer and open heart surgery. Now, doctors who specialize in occupational and environmental hazards are looking into whether arsenic exposure at the King County landfill where DeMello works has affected his health. “He’s just so sick, and he’s not getting any better,” said his wife, Debbie DeMello. For more than 30 years, DeMello has worked for King County’s Cedar Hills Regional Landfill as a truck driver. The 920-acre facility in Maple Valley is where all but two cities in King County dump their trash. But it’s also home to a years-long arsenic problem that has both plagued and puzzled the county – drawing attention from environmental regulators and concerns from employees. A KING 5 investigation found that for a decade, the King County Solid Waste Division repeatedly discovered high levels of arsenic at the Cedar Hills landfill – violating state and local rules that exist to protect the environment and public health. Multiple landfill employees accused their bosses of failing to adequately inform employees or protect them from the highly toxic chemical, including DeMello and at least two King County engineers. “We’ve always been told that, ‘It’s not a hazardous environment. You’ve got nothing to worry about. You work in a safe environment,\'” DeMello said. ""We never were told that arsenic in high levels was at the landfill."" Arsenic is a naturally occurring chemical that is found in food, water, soil and the air. It can also be released into the environment by certain agricultural and industrial processes. The inorganic form of arsenic is a highly toxic carcinogen that can cause negative health impacts from long-term exposure to high levels. According to the World Health Organization, adverse health effects can include heart disease, lung disease and cancer, but it can be difficult to distinguish the medical conditions caused by arsenic from conditions induced by other factors. The King County Public Health Department and the Solid Waste Division said the arsenic at Cedar Hills doesn\'t pose a health risk. But some workers are skeptical of that assessment and are calling for more thorough evaluations. Exactly how high levels of arsenic made it to the Cedar Hills landfill is controversial, according to a KING 5 review of court documents and public records from local, state and federal agencies. Records show elevated levels of arsenic were discovered as part of King County’s process of managing its landfill gas – a natural byproduct of decomposing trash. Landfill gas contains about 50 percent methane, 50 percent carbon dioxide and a small percentage of toxic chemicals, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). To prevent hazardous chemicals from escaping into the atmosphere, landfills typically choose to burn the gas or convert it to be used as a renewable energy resource. Since 2009, Cedar Hills\' landfill gas has been converted into renewable energy. A private company called Bio Energy Washington (BEW) contracts with the county to capture the landfill gas and convert it into natural gas. The operation provides enough gas for about 19,000 homes each year, according to the company. That process of creating natural gas produces a liquid called “condensate,” which contains much of the arsenic that led to trouble for both King County and the energy company that operates at the landfill. BEW and King County are currently in a stand off – a legal battle – about who is responsible for causing and addressing the elevated arsenic. The county alleges that BEW’s industrial processes led to the elevated levels. BEW, which has shut down operations amid the lawsuit, claims King County\'s landfill gas already contained too much arsenic when the company received it. “I don’t believe we’ve done anything wrong. We’ve got nothing to hide,” said Kevin Singer, the BEW plant manager who oversees the company’s operations at Cedar Hills. “We don’t add arsenic into the process so all the arsenic…comes from the landfill gas that was delivered to us from the county.” King County got in trouble with regulators because for a decade, BEW dumped its arsenic-laden condensate into two landfill lagoons. The wastewater in the lagoons is discharged into King County’s wastewater treatment plant in Renton – the same place where sewage is treated before it flows into the Puget Sound. To protect toxic chemicals from entering the waterways, oversight officials from King County’s Industrial Waste Program (KCIW) set limits on how much arsenic is allowed to be in water that goes to the plant for treatment. The agency determined that for years, King County’s Solid Waste Division exceeded the amount of arsenic it was allowed to dump from the Cedar Hills landfill, according to KCIW enforcement records reviewed by KING 5. In 2018, KCIW fined Cedar Hills more than $90,000 for arsenic exceedances that occurred over a five-year period. Oversight officials found the Solid Waste Division was in “significant non-compliance” of its wastewater discharge permit for discharging more arsenic than allowed on 56 occasions between October 2013 and March 2018. Regulators issued a compliance order to correct the violations. They also ordered the King County Solid Waste Division to conduct additional and more frequent arsenic testing, noting the landfill had ""chronic violations” and failed to ""accurately report"" its noncompliance. Since then, the Solid Waste Division has remained in “significant non-compliance” of its permit, and it has continued to receive annual violations. As a consequence, KCIW publicizes the landfill\'s arsenic violations annually in ads that appear in the Seattle Times – a mandate for companies that violate the Clean Water Act. The most recent ad, which published in May, again called out Cedar Hills for discharging too much arsenic. Alison Hawkes, a spokesperson for the King County Wastewater Treatment Division, said the landfill\'s arsenic discharges have ""not yet affected"" the operations or environmental permits of the Renton-based treatment plant that received the landfill\'s wastewater. But, she added, ""such noncompliance is a serious matter and must be corrected."" Pat McLaughlin, director of the King County Solid Waste Division, said the county has worked “vigorously” with regulators and industry experts to deal with the problem, and it is currently developing solutions to remove the arsenic. “It’s easy for arsenic to show up in the landfill. It’s hard to get it back out,” he said. Hawkes said the Solid Waste Division has “continued to make good faith progress” toward a solution to address the arsenic exceedances, and must develop a workable plan by July 2024. In addition to the violations from county regulators, the Washington State Department of Ecology and the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) also cited the county for violations related to arsenic at Cedar Hills, according to a review of records from those agencies. Colleen Christensen, a veteran engineer for the Solid Waste Division, is one of at least three King County workers who formally voiced concerns about the Solid Waste Division\'s response to the arsenic problem, according to a review of whistleblower complaints to King County\'s Office of the Ombuds.

He says economic conditions are worse now than during the pandemic, when he started the appliance business, and he isn\'t selling as much as he used to. John Ruwitch / NPR On the northern edge of Xi’an, a 45-year-old man surnamed Jiang tells a typical story of dream-chasing in China’s reform era. He left his home village at the age of 18 to work in a diamond factory in southern China\'s Guangdong province, a manufacturing juggernaut. The pay was decent, he says, but after a decade he was restless. So he returned home, where he started a small construction equipment rental company. Business was fine, he said, until state-backed competitors began attracting all the contracts. So he moved again, this time to the northwestern city of Xi\'an, China\'s onetime imperial capital, now home to 13 million people. ""My hopes were big,"" he says, sitting in the back of the secondhand kitchen appliance shop that he runs with his family, surrounded by refrigerators, stoves and blenders. ""Slowly, though, they have been obliterated."" A year ago, China lifted draconian COVID restrictions that were an anvil around the neck of the economy and placed unprecedented controls on a society that, for the previous four decades, had grown accustomed to expanding personal freedoms, not shrinking them. Related: A year after lifting COVID rules, China is turning quarantine centers into apartments Many expected the country to bounce back quickly, with economic growth reverting to a slower but respectable mean. That hasn\'t happened. And as 2024 approaches, there is a crisis of confidence in China that the authorities appear to be doing little to address, instead nibbling at the edges of policy and avoiding bold steps to revive the economy and regain public trust in policymaking. Jiang is one of several people NPR recently spoke with to try to gauge the mood in post-pandemic China and highlight how things have changed over time. For Jiang, who did not want his full name used for fear of possible repercussions for speaking candidly to a foreign reporter, economic conditions are actually worse now than during the pandemic, when he started the appliance business, he says. He isn\'t selling as much as he used to. Like many in China who have been conditioned to avoid publicly criticizing the ruling Communist Party, he chooses well-worn rhetoric absolving the leadership when asked if he thinks policy might be to blame. ""Whatever the national policy, it\'s meant to do good for the country and the people. You can\'t deny that,"" he said. ""But as they say: The higher-ups have their policies and the lower-downs have their ways of getting around them. ... Each policy that comes from the top is discounted on the way down, and then discounted again as it goes down line. The policies are definitely good, but when they get down to the local level, they\'ve completely changed."" At this point, Jiang\'s ambition — the same drive that, multiplied across hundreds of millions of people, fueled China\'s economic rise — has been sapped. Related: Why China’s ‘zero COVID’ policy is finally faltering In Beijing, Joerg Wuttke has had a front-row seat to China\'s spectacular rise. He first came to the country as a businessman from Europe 41 years ago. ""When I was coming in \'82, people took pictures with cars and paid for the picture. And now we have 5 million cars in Beijing. So it\'s a completely different country, with upsides but also with it downsides,"" he said. (The Beijing government said that at the end of 2022 there were, in fact, more than 7 million motor vehicles registered in the city, and over 12 million drivers.) Joerg Wuttke, then the European Chamber of Commerce president, at a press conference in Beijing in 2015. Ng Han Guan / AP I first met Wuttke a little over 20 years ago, when our offices were in the same building near Beijing\'s Liangma River. China had just joined the World Trade Organization. The reform-minded Zhu Rongji was premier. ""It was a China which actually was very open and could sort of give us some indications of where we\'re heading, you know, to a more open, liberal society. Globalization would be coming into town,"" said Wuttke, who has been doing business here for most of the past four decades, and lobbying for European companies as head of the European Chamber of Commerce for part of that time. Today, he says, the Communist Party has become more dominant across society than he thinks it was when he first came to China — before reform and opening really started to take off. ""For Xi Jinping, it\'s clear ideology trumps the economy,"" he says of China\'s current leader. He says that\'s underpinned an intrusion of politics into business. Chinese leader Xi Jinping reviews the honor guard at the Great Hall of the People in November in Beijing. Florence Lo / Pool/Getty Images ""You have party cells coming up into Chinese private enterprises. You have a far more [and] stronger party awareness on TV or radio than it was maybe in \'82. So, yeah, it\'s, it\'s more ideologically driven these days than it was 40 years ago,"" he said. Combined with geopolitical frictions, Wuttke says it has become ""far more complex"" to steer any company in China. In November, quarterly data showed that foreign direct investment in China contracted for the first time on record. Business confidence is down, and the real estate sector is struggling, underpinning weak consumer confidence. The future is less certain than it always seemed to be. The World Bank forecasts that China\'s GDP growth will slow sharply in the next two years. ""I think the opening-eye moment for me came in 2022,"" Wuttke says.

The title was awarded June 22 during the annual conference of the Coalition of Oregon School Administrators (COSA), in Seaside. In a news release, COSA said Taylor has had a positive impact noticed by teachers and students alike, despite joining the district just last year. “(Taylor) is a principal who cares deeply for his community and leads transformative change with purpose and with students at the center,” said COSA Executive Director Craig Hawkins. Taylor joined Mount Angel Sschool District in 2022 after spending time as a principal in the Woodburn School District. At the start of the last school year, Taylor said his goal was to help teachers feel prepared and supported, and to build a system that gives meaningful help to students who fall behind. COSA said Taylor’s bilingual skills have played a key role in accomplishing these goals, as well as building relationships with local families. He speaks English and Spanish, and is working on his Russian. COSA said Taylor’s caring nature was also “vital to building strong relationships with families, students, and staff.” “(Taylor) is known as a relational leader who is patient and a thoughtful communicator who builds inclusive environments and supports the learning of each of his students,” said the news release. “…His dedication and commitment are noticed by staff, students, and the community.” MASD Superintendent Rachel Stucky described Taylor as “a knowledgeable educator and an authentic instructional leader.” The award places Taylor in the running for National Middle School Principal of the Year awarded by the National Association of Secondary School Principals in October. He will also be recognized at COSA’s national conference in Denver this summer along with winners from other states.

Fox News and Tucker Carlson, the right-wing extremist who hosted the network\'s highly rated 8pm hour, have severed ties, the network said in a stunning announcement Monday. Monday\'s shocking announcement that Fox had parted ways with Carlson appeared to come abruptly. Tucker Carlson was informed Monday morning that Fox News had decided to part ways with the prime time host, according to a source familiar with the matter. The person, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, declined to further elaborate about the abrupt end to the right-wing opinion host\'s employment at the network.

Just prior to the network\'s announcement, Fox had been promoting on its air a Monday night interview by Carlson with GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.

The announcement came one week after Fox News settled a monster defamation lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million over the network\'s dissemination of election lies. Fox News said that Carlson\'s last show was Friday, April 21. Carlson was a top promoter of conspiracy theories and radical rhetoric at the network.

Tucker Carlson was a key figure in Dominion Voting Systems\' mammoth defamation lawsuit against Fox News, which the parties settled last week on the brink of trial for a historic $787 million. In some ways, Carlson played an outsized role in the litigation: Only one of the 20 allegedly defamatory Fox broadcasts mentioned in the lawsuit came from Carlson\'s top-rated show. But, as CNN exclusively reported, he was set to be one of Dominion\'s first witnesses to testify at trial. And his private text messages, which became public as part of the suit, reverberated nationwide. Dominion got its hands on Carlson\'s group chat with fellow Fox primetime stars Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, and a trove of other messages from around the 2020 presidential election. These communications revealed that Carlson told confidants that he ""passionately"" hated former President Donald Trump and that Trump\'s tenure in the White House was a ""disaster."" He also used misogynistic terms to criticize pro-Trump lawyer Sidney Powell and reject her conspiracies about the 2020 election -- even as those wild theories got airtime on Fox News. The lawsuit exposed how Carlson privately held a wholly different view than his on-air persona. A Dominion spokesperson did not comment on Carlson\'s departure from Fox. But it\'s unclear if Carlson\'s departure is directly connected to the Dominion case or other lawsuits related to Fox\'s election denialism. The statement that Fox issued Monday didn\'t offer any explanation for Carlson\'s departure. Carlson was also one of the biggest promoters of conspiracy theories in right-wing media, sowing doubt about the 2020 presidential election, the January 6 insurrection, and Covid-19 vaccines. In the two years since the attack on the US Capitol, the Fox primetime host used his huge platform to amplify paper-thin theories that the attack was a false-flag operation orchestrated by the FBI and government agents because they loathed Trump, and that the criminal rioters were themselves the victims. The baseless theory originated from a right-wing website, and Carlson catapulted it into the mainstream by repeatedly featuring it on his show. He routinely suggested that Capitol rioter and Trump supporter Ray Epps was actually an FBI provocateur who sparked the deadly riot. In a ""60 Minutes"" interview that aired Sunday night, Epps had this to say about Carlson\'s lies: ""He\'s obsessed with me. He\'s going to any means possible to destroy my life and our lives."" Carlson\'s disinformation campaign about January 6 reached its apex just a few months ago, with an assist from the newly installed House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican. The top-rated Fox host obtained and aired never-before-seen footage from Capitol security cameras, but the clips were cherry-picked and selectively edited. He said on his program that he ran the tapes by the US Capitol Police before airing the material, but they disputed his claim. Abby Grossberg, the ex-Fox News producer who has since disavowed the network, claimed in recent lawsuits that there was rampant sexism and misogyny among Tucker Carlson\'s show team. Last month, she sued Fox News, Carlson, his executive producer Justin Wells and other figures, as well as Fox\'s parent corporation. Grossberg, who joined Carlson\'s team after the 2020 election, said in her lawsuit that after her first day on the job that ""it became apparent how pervasive the misogyny and drive to embarrass and objectify women was among the male staff at TCT,"" referring to ""Tucker Carlson Tonight."" The lawsuits also claim that Grossberg alerted Wells to some of the ""inappropriate and harassing conduct"" that she endured while working at the show, but he ""brushed aside"" her concerns, according to court filings. Fox News is aggressively fighting two lawsuits from Grossberg. A Fox spokesperson previously said the lawsuits were ""riddled with false allegations against the network and our employees."" In a lawsuit filed last month, Grossberg said Carlson ""was very capable of using such disgusting language about women in the workplace."" She cited some of Carlson\'s private texts, where he used the phrase ""c-nt"" to refer to Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, a top 2020 election denier. Her lawsuits also describe seeing sexually suggestive posters that were visible in the workplace, facing ""uncomfortable sexual questions"" from Wells about her former Fox News boss Maria Bartiromo, and witnessing internal debates on which women politicians were ""more f--kable."" In a TV interview, she said the sexual harassment was so bad that she considered suicide. Wells was well-aware of the massive impact he and Carlson had on GOP politics, according to Grossberg\'s lawsuit. She quoted a November 2022 editorial meeting where Wells allegedly said they had ""the power to select the 2024 GOP presidential candidate"" and a January meeting where he said Carlson planned to ""save the Republican Party"" by resolving the epic intraparty struggle over the House speakership. Carlson\'s departure at Fox News comes after the network also severed ties with right-wing bomb thrower Dan Bongino, who had been a regular fixture on the network\'s programming, in addition to hosting a weekend show. ""Folks, regretfully, last week was my last show on Fox News on the Fox News Channel,"" Bongino said on Rumble, chalking up the exit to a contract dispute. ""So the show ending last week was tough. And I want you to know it\'s not some big conspiracy. I promise you. There\'s not, there\'s no acrimony. This wasn\'t some, like, WWE brawl that happened. We just couldn\'t come to terms on an extension. And that\'s really it."" Fox News responded in a statement, ""We thank Dan for his contributions and wish him success in his future endeavors."" Shares of Fox Corp. fell 5% on the news. The stock had been up slightly before the announcement. Carlson did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.

Judge Arthur Engoron did not hold Trump in contempt of court, but warned that further violation of the gag order he imposed after Trump’s Truth Social account made the post could result in serious punishment, including steeper financial penalties, contempt or even jail time. “Donald Trump has received ample warning from this Court as to the possible repercussions of violating the gag order,” Engoron said. “He specifically acknowledged that he understood and would abide by it.” “Accordingly, issuing yet another warning is no longer appropriate; this Court is way beyond the ‘warning’ stage,” he added. The post, posted on Trump’s account while he sat just feet away from the clerk, derided her as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s (D-N.Y.) “girlfriend” and included personally identifying information about her. Once Engoron became aware of the post, he issued a limited gag order barring Trump or any other party in the case from posting or speaking publicly about members of his staff. He also ordered Trump to delete the post, and while it was removed from his Truth Social account, it remained on his campaign website for 17 days. In court Friday, Trump lawyer Chris Kise blamed the “very large machine” of Trump’s presidential campaign for allowing his deleted social media post to remain on his website, calling it an unintentional oversight. Engoron acknowledged Trump’s assertion that the post staying up was inadvertent and said he would give him the “benefit of the doubt.” However, the gag order was still violated, he said, warning that in the “current overheated climate, incendiary untruths can, and in some cases already have, led to serious physical harm, and worse.” Trump, the Trump Organization and the former president’s two adult sons — Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump — are on trial in Manhattan after New York Attorney General Letitia James’s office filed a lawsuit against them last year alleging decades of fraud. It claims the Trump Organization falsely inflated and deflated the value of its assets to receive lower taxes and better insurance coverage. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, describing the case as a politically motivated “witch hunt” and both James and the trial judge as biased against him. His repeated attacks against them echo the attacks he has lodged against judges and prosecutors in his other cases. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan issued a limited gag order earlier this week against Trump in his federal case over efforts to overturn the 2020 election after the former president made similarly inflammatory remarks about people tied to that case. Trump faces a combined 91 charges across four criminal indictments and is a party in several other civil cases. Those legal matters are expected to head to trial next year amid the former president’s 2024 White House bid. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Camryn joined NewsWatch 12 as a reporter/producer at the end of January, 2022. GRANTS PASS -- The Daily Courier, Grants Pass’s local newspaper, has plans to expand its news coverage into the Medford and Ashland area. This comes after the long-time newspaper, The Mail Tribune, shut down its operations on Friday. The Daily Courier made this announcement of expanding their news coverage last Wednesday, saying “The Daily Courier is acting quickly to increase its investments in Jackson County.” The paper says they can ensure the Courier can start reporting more on Medford and Ashland news within the coming weeks. Daily Courier’s Publisher Travis Moore says when the Mail Tribune stopped publishing print newspaper last fall, the Courier saw hundreds of new subscribers from the Medford area. “Since last Wednesday, we've had hundreds of people sign up for online subscriptions and hundreds more call to inquire about getting print subscriptions,” says Moore. The Daily Courier is attempting to hire some of the Mail Tribune journalists to make this transition as quick as possible. “We will announce the hiring of a former Mail Tribune reporter on Tuesday. It is someone all former Mail Tribune readers will definitely recognize,” says Moore. All week the Courier will be conducting interviews. He says they plan on hiring three new newsroom staff as soon as possible and expanding from there as circulation and advertising increase. With more coverage comes more mail distribution routes in Medford, this will take time says Moore. “Within two months we were distributing nearly 500 more papers per day down there than we had before. We currently have four routes in Medford, and Ashland and should have another soon,” says Moore. The Daily Courier has been around for 138 years, serving quality community journalism in the Grants Pass area. Moore says the Courier’s staff is looking forward to serving the new subscribers of the Medford and Ashland area. “I want to thank everyone for their patience. With the hundreds of people calling for new subscriptions and with questions, it's a bit overwhelming,” Moore says overall the goal is to become the Rogue Valley’s daily newspaper. Moore says with the number of readers they expect to get in the Medford area, “It will make the Courier an even more attractive advertising option for all Rogue Valley businesses.” People interested in advertising can contact the Daily Courier at (541) 474 – 3807 and people interested in subscribing to their newspaper can call (541) 474 – 3702.

There’s not much to miss about that time – when many Americans were still out of a job or under stay-at-home orders because of the pandemic – but inflation hadn’t yet exploded. Since then, the cost of just about everything, from groceries to gas to housing, has skyrocketed. An inflation tracker created by the members of Congress’ Joint Economic Committee shows the impact of inflation on the average household in every state. (While the joint committee is chaired by a Democrat, the report and data was put out by the committees’ Republican members.) The report uses January 2021 as a benchmark “because it was the last time inflation was within recent historical norms.” Now, the report claims, most American household would need to spend an additional $10,000 or more just to afford the same goods and quality of life they had less than three years ago. As cost of living varies by state, so does the cost of inflation. Even in the most affordable states, like Arkansas, Maine and Oklahoma, the average household still needs to spend more than $8,000 more to cover their needs when compared to January 2021. Of all the states, Colorado households have it worst, according to the report. The annual cost of recent inflation for them is $14,995. In Washington, D.C., it’s actually worse than any state. Families and households in the nation’s capital need to spend $17,109 to keep up with where they were at the beginning of 2021. Hover over your state on the map below to see the cost of inflation annually where you live, according to the Congressional committee members’ analysis. The map was first released in 2022, but has been updated monthly since. The data reflected in the map above is up-to-date with October 2023's cost of living calculations. The report's findings are in line with how people feel about inflation. In a recent Bankrate survey, 60% of employed Americans said their income and wages have not kept up with increasing prices. Even most of those who've gotten a pay increase say it hasn't been enough. A CBS poll also found more people are having a hard time paying bills and covering expenses in 2023 than they were pre-pandemic. Prices of most goods and services aren't dropping – and economists say it would be a very bad thing if they were – but inflation is slowing. A report from the Commerce Department released Thursday said prices were unchanged from September to October, down from a 0.4% rise the previous month. Compared with a year ago, consumer prices rose 3% in October, below the 3.4% annual rate in September. That was the lowest year-over-year inflation rate in more than 2 1/2 years.

Here is the list of the bills taking effect Monday. DRUG CRISIS 1.Improving Implementation of Voter-Approved Measure 110 (House Bill 2513): Also known as the Hope and Recovery bill. It makes changes to voter-approved Measure 110 (The Drug Addiction Treatment and Recovery Act). 2. Educating Oregon’s Youth About the Dangers of Fentanyl (Senate Bill 238): Directs the Oregon Health Authority, State Board of Education, and Alcohol and Drug Policy Commission to develop curricula that teaches students about the dangers of synthetic opioids and laws that provide immunity or other protections related to drug or alcohol use. 3. Preventing Opioid Overdose Deaths (Senate Bill 1043): Requires health care and drug treatment facilities to provide two doses of opioid overdose reversal medicine and related medical supplies upon discharge to patients who were there for treatment for opioid abuse. The bill also establishes civil liability protections to people who administer opioid overdose medication to a person experiencing an overdose. This bill was introduced at the request of Gov. Tina Kotek by Senate President Rob Wagner. 4. Increasing Access to Addiction Treatment While In-Custody (Senate Bill 529): According to the Department of Corrections, 63% of adults entering custody report having a substance-use disorder, and 50% are classified as having a “severe” need for treatment. This bipartisan bill modifies the procedures of accepting participants into the current alternative incarceration program, requires intense addiction programs that address chronic disease, and includes a range of treatment services. PUBLIC HEALTH & SAFETY 1. Preventing Organized Retail Theft (Senate Bill 340): Increases penalties for individuals convicted of retail theft that adds up to at least $5,000 in value, targets the same business or corporation over a six-month period in any part of Oregon. Individuals convicted of organized retail crimes could face up to two years in prison, and penalties increase if employees are put in danger during the theft. The measure was developed by the Organized Retail Crime Task Force, which is made up of industry and labor stakeholders negatively impacted by organized retail crime. 2. Mental Health Support for First Responders (House Bill 3426): Requires 9-8-8 crisis hotline centers to have policies and train staff on serving firefighters and other first responders. 3. Expanding DUII to Include Influence of Any Impairing Drugs (House Bill 2316): Expands Oregon's Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicants (DUII) laws. Currently, laws regarding convictions of DUII are treated differently depending on which statute you are charged under. This bill amends multiple statutes to reconcile felony DUII statutes governing repeated offenders and expands the offense of DUII to include the influence of any impairing drugs. HOUSING 1. Converting Commercial Buildings to Housing Within the UGB (House Bill 2984): Allows local governments to convert commercial buildings within the urban growth boundary to residential housing without requiring a zone change conditional use permit. 2. Improving Financing of Affordable Housing (House Bill 2761): Oregon Housing and Community Services (OHCS) is responsible for the planning, development, and management of affordable housing projects. This bill expands OHCS’s ability to finance certain housing development portions for households earning at or below 120% of median area income. ECONOMY: AFFORDABILITY & CHILD CARE 1, Reducing Barriers for Early Learning Workforce (House Bill 2504): A report by the Oregon State University’s College of Public Health and Human Services released in 2019 found that early childhood professionals whose first language is not English are less likely to participate in the Oregon registry professional development system. This bill directs the Department of Early Learning and Care to develop standards and processes that reduce barriers for international early childhood professionals to enter the workforce. 2. Putting Money Back in Families’ Pockets with the Oregon Kids Credit (House Bill 3235): This bill creates Oregon’s first-ever state-based child tax credit – a fully refundable $1,000 tax credit per child between the ages of 0 and 5 for families earning $30,000 or less. 55,000 children across Oregon will benefit from this credit, with a higher representation in rural communities and communities of color. Oregon families can apply for this credit when they file their tax returns in 2024. EDUCATION 1. Upgrading School HVAC Systems (House Bill 3031): HB 3031 works to improve air quality and eliminate airborne pathogens in schools around the state. The bill will help Oregon schools receive federal funds to upgrade their HVAC systems, assess ventilation systems, place carbon dioxide monitors in each classroom, and submit a report on ventilation and carbon dioxide levels to a mechanical engineer for review. The districts will then implement any improvements recommended by the engineer. 2. Increasing Students’ Financial Literacy (Senate Bill 3): In 2022, a study from the Oregon Department of Education studied high school graduation requirements and made a recommendation that future planning credit requirements be added. Senate Bill 3 adds a half-credit for higher education and career path skills and a half-credit for personal financial education to graduation requirements starting in 2027. HEALTH CARE 1. Training More Nurses (Senate Bill 523): SB 523 expands the number of institutions that can offer nursing degrees, especially in rural Oregon. It permits community colleges to offer Bachelor of Science, nursing degrees in addition to applied bachelor's degrees. Community colleges may apply to the Higher Education Coordinating Commission for approval of the proposed BSN degree program. 2. Eliminating Costs for Breast Cancer Screenings (Senate Bill 1041): Makes medically necessary breast cancer diagnostic imaging tests and supplemental breast exams free to patients by requiring commercial insurance plans to cover those costs. While the total cost of a mammogram is usually covered by insurance, further diagnostic testing such as an MRI or ultrasound is not. These diagnostic tests can cost up to thousands of dollars to patients, even though they are absolutely essential to identifying breast cancer. ENVIRONMENT & WILDFIRES 1. Banning Use of Polystyrene Food Containers (Senate Bill 543): SB 543 would prohibit the use of polystyrene foam containers and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in sales of prepared food. The ban was introduced in response to the significant negative impact that polystyrene has on the environment. 2. Protecting Homeowners Impacted by Wildfires (Senate Bill 82): Makes clear that insurance companies may not cancel policies or increase premiums for homeowners based on the statewide wildfire risk map. It will also improve transparency on policy renewals and premium decisions related to wildfires by requiring insurers to tell homeowners how they can lower their premiums through home hardening or other wildfire mitigation. 3.

Ore. — 2023 proved a challenging year for many. Here are the top headlines that Oregonians and Portlanders kept up with the most, in no particular order: Between February and May, four women — Kristin Smith, Charity Perry, Bridget Webster and Ashley Real — were all found dead in mostly rural locations around Portland. Portland police previously said in early June that they had no reason to believe the cases were connected. In July, the Associated Press, The Oregonian and Willamette Week all cited law enforcement sources who identified Jesse Calhoun as a person of interest. Calhoun had a lengthy criminal history, which included physically abusing women, and was released from prison a year early in 2021 when he received clemency from then-Gov. Kate Brown. Police have not disclosed publicly how the cases may be connected, except to say at least one person of interest is linked to all four of the victims. The Multnomah County District Attorney\'s office has not officially named a person of interest. Calhoun has not been charged in any of the deaths. He\'s currently being held at Snake River Correctional Institution in eastern Oregon on charges unrelated to the women\'s deaths, but wrote to KGW from jail, claiming he\'s ""no killer."" RELATED: Man linked to deaths of four Portland-area women writes to KGW from prison Beginning in May, Senate Republicans in Oregon refused to show up for work. They called the action ""a constitutional protest"" over what they claimed were violations of Senate rules, while Democrats accused the Republicans of walking out over opposition to two bills that were about to go before the Senate, bills that focused on abortion and gender-affirming care and gun safety. Although a fairly common occurrence for GOP lawmakers in Oregon, this particular one went on for six weeks, stalling Senate business with hundreds of bills on the line. The standoff ended in June, marking the end of the longest legislative walkout in state history and the second-longest in U.S. history, according to the Associated Press. Measure 113 came into the mix. An amendment to the state constitution, approved by voters last November, penalized lawmakers with 10 or more unexcused absences by forbidding them from running for reelection in the following term. During the walkout, Republicans signaled that they intended to challenge the legality of Measure 113, pouncing on ambiguities in the measure\'s language that were not present in the explanatory statement provided to voters. However, Oregon Secretary of State LaVonne Griffin-Valade determined that the measure should be interpreted as it was intended. Recently, a Republican state senator, Lynn Findley, who is suing the Oregon Secretary of State after being barred from running for reelection in 2024, announced that he does not plan to run for the office next year. Findley (R-Vale) is one of five GOP senators behind a lawsuit expected to go before the Oregon Supreme Court. Lawyers for the group of senators and the Secretary of State presented their arguments to the state supreme court in mid-December. Said senators are challenging the Secretary of State’s ruling that they should be barred from the upcoming term after accruing 10 or more unexcused absences during the 2023 walkout. A federal judge rejected a request from the senators who boycotted the Legislature to be allowed on the ballot after their terms end; however, the federal case is separate from a lawsuit currently before the Oregon Supreme Court. Record levels of late-season snowfall took Portland by surprise, causing the airport\'s runways to be gridlocked, along with school closures, power outages and backups on Interstate 5, with drivers even abandoning their vehicles as conditions escalated. Those drivers later found themselves stuck with a hefty towing bill or found their vehicles a target of vandalism and break-ins. At the time, the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) said the agency was operating at a disadvantage due to a staff shortage that slowed down the pace of road clearance. Throughout October, ODOT began claiming it would not have the funds to keep roads up to the standards of prior years, pointing to a decline in fuel tax revenue. But recently, Gov. Kotek announced a $19 million bailout from the Oregon Legislature to fund ODOT winter maintenance. Portland continues to grapple with the housing crisis, with many unable to find a permanent place and remaining on the street, a dangerous circumstance for women in particular. In an effort to combat this, the city decided to launch several projects. Portland’s first RV park for homeless people opened in August, with another in September. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler announced two mass-sanctioned campsites. The first campsite opened in late July, but due to the need for a referral to get in, many found it difficult to actually find a space to live. The second location in North Portland is known for its long history of industrial use — and thus, still needs to be tested for toxic chemicals. A daytime camping ban began in July, and Wheeler later drew fire for unexpectedly proposing its enforcement in November, which was blocked by a judge. Portland crews also removed 1,408 homeless campsites under ADA lawsuit settlement. Meanwhile, Wheeler and Multnomah County leaders unveiled a concept for a three-year extension of the Joint Office of Homeless Services that they hope will get things on the right track to combat homelessness between the counties. In July, a gunman killed a security officer, Bobby Smallwood, and injured a hospital employee in a shooting at Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center in Northwest Portland. A few hours after fleeing the medical center, he was stopped in a vehicle by police in Gresham, and during the stop, the suspect was shot and killed after officers opened fire. Gresham police later confirmed the man\'s identity as PoniaX Kane Calles, previously known as Reginald Kane Jackson; he had reportedly threatened hospital staff in the days before the shooting and had a long history of domestic violence. A friend of Calles told KGW that he agreed to give the man a ride to Gresham on Saturday, saying he didn\'t realize Calles was a shooting suspect until police caught up with them. RELATED: Man says he unknowingly drove Legacy shooting suspect to Gresham as he was fleeing police A Multnomah County grand jury later determined that the officers\' use of force was not criminal under Oregon law in fatally shooting Calles. A flight bound for San Francisco from Everett, Washington, had to be diverted to Portland International Airport (PDX) after an off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot, Joseph Emerson, attempted to ""disrupt the operation of the engines"" on Oct. 22. Emerson had been riding in the cockpit as an Alaska Airlines off-duty pilot. He was subdued by the flight crew, and the plane was diverted to Portland, where it landed safely with more than 80 people on board. According to charging documents, Emerson told Port of Portland police following his arrest that he had been struggling with depression, that a friend had recently died and that he had taken psychedelic mushrooms about 48 hours before he attempted to cut the engines. He also said he had not slept in more than 40 hours, according to the document. The averted disaster renewed attention on cockpit safety and the mental fitness of those allowed in them. Emerson\'s defense argues that he didn\'t intend to hurt anyone, but passengers that were onboard filed a class-action lawsuit against the airlines, claiming that the failure to prevent Emerson from being in the cockpit breached a duty of care to its passengers. Emerson was released from federal and state custody to await his trial. His charges include state reckless endangerment charges and a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew.

In his new film The Journey: A Music Special with Andrea Bocelli, the Italian tenor embarks on a 200-mile horseback ride with his wife Veronica and a few friends. The legally blind singer notes that he learned to ride as a youngster before completely losing his sight. He's still an avid rider and the film shows him travelling across Italy as he talks about faith with fellow artists and performs at different locations along the way. The journey begins with a stop in Rome with a brief visit with the Pope. Afterwards, Bocelli and his companions travel on the Via Francigena, an ancient road in Italy. As Bocelli himself notes, “Nature is one of life’s greatest miracles” and the feature shows that, capturing some beautiful shots of the Italian countryside. During different legs of the trip, the group is joined by other singers and performers. Singers like Tori Kelly, Tauren Wells and Michael W. Smith join Bocelli to discuss their backgrounds and how faith guides them in their lives and in their careers. In addition to these personal chats, the feature includes performances from those artists and others including Taya and world-renowned cellist Hauser.

It’s easy to see the beautiful surroundings that Bocelli and his friends ride through here but it would’ve been nice for the film to show more of the cities and stops they visited. One moment that stands out here is a time when a woman holds Bocelli’s hand for a few moments while he’s riding on his horse. It feels like a real connection and one only wishes that the film would’ve captured more moments like that. What the film does accomplish though is capturing a more personal side of some of the artists involved and showcasing a few truly great stand-out performances. A particular stand-out showcase is Tauren Wells performing the inspiring Hill and Valleys, a single he released in 2017.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said Tuesday it was classifying the COVID variant JN.1 as a variant of interest. Here are 5 things you should know about the new variant of interest. JN.1 was first detected in August, according to WHO, and is a “descendent lineage” of the subvariant BA.2.86, otherwise known as Pirola. Pirola itself is a descendant of the BA.2 omicron subvariant. In August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned BA.2.86 may be better at causing breakthrough infections, meaning that even if you’ve been vaccinated or had the virus, you could still become infected. While JN.1 is a descendant of BA.2.86, it’s unclear what potential it has to cause breakthrough infections. According to WHO’s risk assessment of JN.1, the variant has been detected in 41 countries as of December 16. Among those reporting the largest rates of JN.1 cases are France, the U.S., Singapore, Canada, the U.K., and Sweden. Worldwide, WHO reports there has been “a rapid increase of JN.1 reported.” In October, JN.1 comprised about 3.3% of COVID cases sequenced. That rate has since grown to more than 27%. In early November, JN.1 comprised 3.5% of COVID cases sequenced in the U.S., according to the CDC. Current projections estimate 21% of COVID cases are now caused by JN.1. That’s less than another omicron subvariant, HV.1, which is believed to be the dominant strain in the U.S. this month at 30% of sequenced cases. The CDC estimates JN.1 is most prevalent in the Northeast, causing about one-third of newly sequenced COVID cases as of early December. In the central U.S. — Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, and Missouri — about 26% of cases are believed to be JN.1 related. There are no variant estimates for the Northwest, the South, or much of the East Coast. So far, there are no stand-out symptoms that make JN.1 different from other COVID infections. The CDC warns those infected with COVID can experience a range of symptoms, but lists possible symptoms as: WHO gave JN.1 an overall risk evaluation rating of “low,” explaining that “available evidence on JN.1 does not suggest additional public health risks relative to the other currently circulating omicron descendent lineages.” Still, the health agency warns the subvariant may be able to evade immunity from the vaccine or previous infection. They also warn that JN.1 could “increase the burden of respiratory infections in many countries” where winter is setting in. Over a dozen states are already experiencing “high” to “very high” levels of respiratory virus activity, according to the CDC. WHO notes that while JN.1 may be able to evade immunity, current COVID vaccines “continue to protect against severe disease and death” from the circulating variants. The CDC continues to encourage basic health and hygiene practices, like handwashing, to prevent the spread of COVID and other viruses. They also recommend staying home if you believe you have COVID or have tested positive.

neighborhood association. Read our last installment from November here. Salem is divided into 17 neighborhood associations that meet monthly. They serve as a conduit to city officials for things like park improvements, road projects and planning and building. Learn more and find your association here. Neighborhood association leaders are invited to submit an item monthly about what’s happening in their neighborhood, including upcoming events or issues of concern. Submissions are lightly edited for style. Join us in spreading holiday cheer to our senior residents! The Highland Neighborhood Association and Salem Center 50+ are teaming up for a festive Decorate & Donate Event on Saturday, Dec. 16th, from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at Center 50+. Gather your family and head to Center 50+ at 2615 Portland Rd. N.E. for a day filled with fun holiday activities. Activities for the day include cookie decorating (thanks to Center 50+ and Highland Neighborhood Association for supplying cookies and materials), gift wrapping (bring your own supplies, including boxes and bags for cookies), and creating holiday greeting cards (bring your creativity, card-making supplies appreciated!). We welcome volunteers to help facilitate the event and appreciate donations of supplies. We’ll be putting together gift bags for seniors. Consider contributing to the joy with thoughtful gifts from our Amazon Wishlist or bring items such as hand/body lotion, reading glasses, adult activity books, toiletries, towels, pens, stationary, stamps, prepaid gift cards, playing cards, jigsaw puzzles, nightlights, flashlights, soft blankets, gift baskets, slippers, socks, hats, scarves, gloves, t-shirts, sweaters, or robes.

MURAL: A public hearing with be held on Dec. 13 at 3:30 pm by the Salem Public Art Commission to determine whether a partially-finished mural in the alley at 1380/1390 Madison N.E. will be allowed to remain and be completed or will be required to be removed by the city. NEN is supporting the graffiti mural by multiple artists in a commercial alley. ENGLEWOOD PARK POLLINATOR GARDEN: Hundreds of native plants are being added at historic Englewood Park’s Pollinator Garden this month with youth from the IKE Box. A Community Volunteer event on MLK Day, Monday, January 15, is being held from 9 a.m. to noon to care for the park, a beautiful respite in our community. AFFORDABLE HOUSING: The City of Salem has purchased the property at the site of the former Salem Hospital, for a proposed two-stage affordable family housing development of about 200 one- to four-bedroom units. The land will be sold to the developer, Green Light, once they receive funding. UPDATE: We are delighted that a problem property for many years at Market and 16th Streets has been purchased and is being cleaned up and will be renovated thanks to advocacy from neighbors, help from the city’s Code Compliance Dept. and the Salem Police Department. This was a complex situation but we are grateful it is being addressed for the safety and livability of the community. Note: Neighborhood association leaders reflected on the recent city report on gun violence in Salem, which showed an uptick in shootings and violence involving teenagers over the past five years in Salem. When taxes were lower in the 1950s, the sole breadwinner was the father in a household. Some of you may recall watching “Lassie Come Home,” “I Love Lucy,” “Leave it to Beaver, “Ozzie and Harriet TV Show,” to name a few of the 1950s TV series. You might have noticed the trend was wives or mothers stayed at home to tend to house matters and when their children returned home from school, the mothers would be there to greet them. Now, with the governmental taxes being so high, the mothers were compelled to go to work as well to keep up. This might have helped to disengage the families’ security. Additionally, fatherless children are a major problem now. Single mothers work hard during the day and by the time they return home, they are often too tired to discipline their kids. So, the kids get off easy for bad deeds. Children still played with neighborhood kids but became more independent yet more disorderly. The teens became easy targets for recruiting gang members. In gangs, they are treated like family members and groomed to become one of them. Once they are in, they are rewarded for their loyalty and even given initiation tests to see what they can do. The more impressive, the more chances to climb up in their hierarchy. Another thought. Since there was inadequate housing and few jobs available, the unemployed turned to crime to survive. Then, individuals found safety in numbers. So, they began to band together, thus forming gangs. Early gangs were made up of the poorest people. In Salem, the kids from the working class usually consisted of Latino families. Now we have gangs of Latinos fighting amongst each other. Since crime is rising dramatically in some areas of Salem, judges and prosecutors should start arresting the criminals. After all, it must be discouraging to a police officer who did all he could to arrest the criminal and just because of a judge who is sympathetic to the criminal or thinking there aren’t enough jail beds, to return the criminal back to the streets. Also, it seems the judges release people without investigating the records from the police department. They need to be properly assessed based on the level of crime and make them stay in prison or get treatment rather than letting them go free which sends a message to others, like teenagers, that crime is allowed here. Look what happened to the criminals released during covid times by then Governor Kate Brown many of whom have committed serious offenses such as murder. They are a big burden to society. According to the result of the research shown at the Nov. 20 council meeting, gun violence with gang members doubled after 2018 to 2023. In 2021 Trevor Womack was appointed new Salem police chief. . One of the things he did was dismantling the Gang Task Force Unit of law enforcement officers. At the same time, he was trying to recruit more law enforcement. Police in general were made unpopular after the George Floyd incident and were looked down upon, so many officers quit. One positive factor recently was the collaboration of Salem police with the Marion County Sheriff’s Office to improve law enforcement. However, we do sincerely hope that because of the increase in gang violence, the chief will listen to the community requesting to reenact the Gang Task Force Unit of Salem Police. We do hope that will happen since Chief Womack has emphasized establishing legitimacy and trust with the police and community. During his first six months as chief, he said, he prioritized meeting with different community members to understand the city’s needs. We at Northgate Neighborhood Association are pleased to say the chief accepted our invitation to attend our January meeting. We would like to conclude by saying we are very grateful to organizations such as Boys and Girls’ Club, YMCA, YWCA, churches who take on children after school so that they, whose parents are working, have a safe place to be. Further, children should be taught about the problems with drugs in schools and addiction and their consequences. They should also be taught about depression and anxiety. They need to have time away from violent video games and other social media on phones and play like children to have a healthier mind and body as well as forming friendship. They need to be taught the basics like reading, writing, and learning about history, geography, and basic math so that academically they would do better and regain self confidence in themselves. So if the students acquire self-confidence and knowledge as defense to keep away the recruiters, dealers or others like that, there is a better chance for our community to feel safe again. Please join us at our December meeting for a snacks and sweets potluck! Wednesday, December 13, 5:30 PM at Pringle Community Hall in Pringle Park at 606 Church St. S.E. We will have introductions from some local business and nonprofit leaders, as well as a rousing discussion on the prevention of vandalism, graffiti, and other crimes in our community. All are invited to find out what your neighborhood association does for you, and how you can be involved! SCAN is sponsoring a holiday decoration contest. Anyone within the SCAN neighborhood is invited to enter by taking a photo of their exterior decorations, then following and tagging @scansalemofficial on Instagram. The contest is open through December 18. Three winners announced on December 23 will win prizes from local Salem businesses. One last item – Preserve Oregon is running a coat donation drive through the end of December. Visit www.onewarmcoat.org/donate for details. Our'}]"
