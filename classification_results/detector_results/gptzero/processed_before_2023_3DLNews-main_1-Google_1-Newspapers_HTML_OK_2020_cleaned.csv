Trump sat stone-faced while the verdict was read as cheering from the street below could be heard in the hallway on the courthouse’s 15th floor. He is being sentenced on July 11, just days before the Republican National Convention. Manhattan prosecutors did not say whether they would seek prison time for Trump. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have agreed to hold two campaign debates, on June 27 hosted by CNN and on Sept. 10 hosted by ABC. CNN says its debate will be held in its Atlanta studios with no audience present. The Democratic president earlier Wednesday announced he won’t participate in fall presidential debates sponsored by the nonpartisan commission that’s organized them for more than three decades. Biden proposed two debates with the Republican ex-president, excluding third-party candidates. Trump says, “Let's get ready to Rumble!!!” CNN holds open the door to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s participation if he or any other third-party candidate meets polling and ballot access requirements. The condition of the U.S. economy is top of mind for CNHI readers recently surveyed across 22 states.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 4:06 pm Ted Okoroh scored a late goal and helped Bacone cap a night of streak breaking Saturday, as the Warriors defeated Randall University 1-0 in a road match at Moore. Janay Wilson scored two goals and Donatella Lucarelli added one as Bacone won the women’s game, 3-0. The men’s win is the first for the program since a 1-0 outcome Oct. 31, 2017 at St. Gregory’s and the first under coach Roosevelt Peters — who played in that October win. It ends a streak of 23 consecutive setbacks, but three of those registered as forfeits after last year’s team folded late in the year. Peters, who took over late last summer, did not actively recruit until this past off-season due to his late arrival to the program. He coaches both the men and women. Two of the Lady Warriors — Alyssa Rankin and Dominique Webster — remain as part of the last women’s squad to win a game. That was Oct. 26, 2017, in a 2-1 home win over Southwestern Christian. That’s a streak of 11 played games. The team did not compete in 2018 and forfeited an additional three games last season after opting out of the last portion of its season. Okoroh’s goal was unassisted from about 25 yards out with under five minutes to play. Wilson’s was assisted by Lucarelli and Jessica O’Dell, and she got the assist herself on Lucarelli’s goal. Solomon Kamara started in goal for the men and left due to injury about 20 minutes into the contest. Pablo Sandoval completed the shutout. Nautica Alexander got the shutout in goal for the women. The Warriors (1-3) and Lady Warriors (1-4) continue with the second of a four-game road swing, continuing with Tuesday’s matches at Central Baptist (Ark.). They’ll be back at home (Hatbox Complex) on Oct. 9 against Randall. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.

Footage courtesy Will Blessing After students protested peacefully for an hour outside and inside the Union, a group including self-identified Proud Boys entered the building and attempted to enter the Molly Shi Boren Ballroom where Coulter was speaking. Due to the ballroom being at capacity, the group of an estimated 10-15 members were denied access by event staff and began to move back outside. A Daily reporter witnessing the moment saw the words “Proud Boys” displayed on the T-shirts of an estimated four to five members of the group, captured by footage from an OU Nightly videographer. According to Southern Poverty Law Center, the Proud Boys are self-described “Western chauvinists” and a fraternal group spreading an “anti-political correctness” and “anti-white guilt” agenda. Recent actions of the Proud Boys have gained national attention, including clashes at Black Lives Matter protests in Seattle and Portland. Along with these instances, the group received a shoutout from President Donald Trump during the first presidential debate in October. When asked to condemn white supremacists by moderator Chris Wallace, Trump called to “Proud Boys” and ordered them to “stand back.” “The Proud Boys, stand back and stand by,” Trump said. While the group was reportedly labeled by the FBI as “an extremist group with ties to white nationalism,” according to a report by Michael McCabe, an official with the Clark County Sheriff’s Office in Washington, the statement was later clarified by a Portland FBI official. Renn Cannon, the special agent in charge of the Portland Division of the FBI, said FBI agents provided a background briefing to county officials on “domestically inspired acts of violence,” according to an article from Oregon Public Broadcasting, which included acts committed by members of the Proud Boys. Coulter appeared at OU despite a history of “misogynistic, racist, xenophobic and ableist rhetoric” two days after Election Day, according to Student Advocates Against Governmental Injustice member and microbiology senior Susie Kerr. The Daily reached out to OU Director of Media Relations Kesha Keith for comment at 8:21 p.m. Nov. 5, and received a statement at 11 a.m. Nov. 6. ""At OU, we believe the values of inclusion and diversity are essential to making our university a place of excellence, openness, and learning. These values certainly include diversity of thought and ideas. We also believe in the right to free expression, preserved in the Constitution,"" the statement read. ""These beliefs are fundamental to who we are and what we aspire to be, though at times they are in tension with each other. In no way does that tension inhibit or compromise our commitment to either principle."" The statement acknowledged the Proud Boys\' presence and highlighted the security measures the university deemed appropriate for the event. ""In preparation for the event, (the OU Police Department) determined to supply additional security made up of six high-ranking OUPD officers and four extra (Contemporary Services Corporation security) staff. Additionally, 12 OU staff were on site to help manage the event,"" the statement read. ""A group of the Proud Boys was briefly present in the Oklahoma Memorial Union, and throughout that time, security and staff worked diligently to achieve a safe and orderly event."" Emily Wilkerson, president of the OU TPUSA chapter, asked The Daily to publish a text message exchange between herself and The Daily’s news managing editor as a statement from TPUSA on the Proud Boys members\' presence at the event. “Hey Emily, this is Blake from The Daily — thanks for hosting us this evening. I was reaching out specifically regarding the report that a group including members of the Proud Boys showing up outside the event,” The Daily editor said in a text message to Wilkerson. “Didn’t know if TPUSA was wanting to offer any statement on this or disavow their presence, or any other general media statement from the evening.” “Did they beat anyone up? Did they break any laws?” Wilkerson asked at 9:53 p.m. after being asked for comment. “No violence, jeering with protesters — though offering comment nonetheless,” The Daily editor replied. “Then why are you talking to me about this?” Wilkerson replied. “Both the Southern Poverty Law Center and the FBI have acknowledge(d) the group as an extremist group engaging in political violence, so their presence is fairly notable at any event,” The Daily editor replied. “SPLC is America’s lea(d)ing hate group,” Wilkerson replied. “I can’t believe you’re citing them.” “So no official statement,” The Daily editor replied. “No,” Wilkerson said at 9:56 p.m. At 9:58 p.m., Wilkerson sent another message to The Daily’s editor. “Please print everything I responded to about the Proud Boys. That is my official statement,” Wilkerson replied. “Print in full with your questions. Do not edit. That’s the official statement."" On Nov. 11, Wilkerson reached back out to The Daily editor via text message. ""TPUSA did not invite the Proud Boys. Nor did we know they were going to be there,"" Wilkerson said. ""We were not aware. This event was (open) to the public and if they wanted to show up, they could. But we did not invite them."" The student protest began 30 minutes before Coulter’s speech on the east side of the Union’s front lawn. It was then moved into the building’s bottom floor after being denied access to the ballroom. On their way out of the union, the protesters and the group including Proud Boys intersected at the east entrance briefly and exchanged insults including “fascist” and “racists.” After leaving the building, OUPD instructed protesters as well as a reporter from The Daily to “stay away” from the group including the Proud Boys. Student Advocates Against Governmental Injustice COVID-19 Officer and OU biology junior Logan Pesina said she saw the official Proud Boys logo printed on the group’s T-shirts and masks “clear as day.” Fearful for protesters’ safety, Pesina instructed them to leave the event in groups in order to avoid potential conflict with the Proud Boys. “Ann Coulter and Turning (Point) USA nationals took advantage of OU’s Turning Point chapter and the university’s protection of free speech as the least expensive means of getting onto (a) public campus and bringing hateful ideologies with them,” OU Student Government Association President Justin Norris tweeted at 8:46 p.m., roughly 45 minutes after the event’s conclusion. “This event benefited them, not one student."" Editor\'s note: This article was updated at 11:26 p.m. Nov. 5 to correct Ann Coulter\'s name spelling in the headline from ""Anne,"" and at 11:20 a.m. Nov. 6 to include the university\'s statement. news managing editor If you\'ve read this far, you are as invested in this city and campus as we are.

first broke, the public was understandably worried: First the coronavirus, now “murder hornets”? What’s next, three days of darkness? But bug experts from Washington, where the hornet was discovered in the U.S., to California agree is that the 2-inch hornet is probably not worth all the buzz it has generated — at least not yet. “It’s not an existential threat; it’s something that can be managed. You just have to know that they’re there and take the necessary steps,” said Doug Yanega, senior museum scientist at the University of California, Riverside’s Entomology Research Museum. He helped Washington scientists identify the hornets when they were first found. The Washington State Department of Agriculture has confirmed only two Asian giant hornets, both spotted late last year in Blaine, in the crook of the northwest corner of the U.S. There are also two unconfirmed reports of hornet sightings about eight miles down the road in Custer, according to Washington State University. And just across the border — and the skinny Strait of Georgia — in British Columbia, Canada, a colony of the Asian giant hornets was found and eradicated in September. But so far that’s it, and scientists hope it stays that way. “We’re still trying to determine the extent of the infestation,” said Tim Lawrence, associate professor and Island County extension director at Washington State University. The main concern about the Asian giant hornet is its potential to harm honeybee populations. The queen hornet usually emerges in April to begin feeding and building up her nest of worker hornets. By late summer or early fall, her worker hornets begin foraging for food, swarming beehives, cutting off bees’ heads and sucking out the hive’s larvae and pupae to bring back to their burgeoning nest. “What the hornet does is it feeds on — it preys on — honeybees,” said Dessie Underwood, an entomologist and the chair of California State University, Long Beach’s Department of Biological Sciences. The hornets are unlikely to attack humans — though if they do, they pack a painful punch. But an Asian giant hornet’s sting isn’t likely to kill humans. In Japan, said Susan Cobey, a bee breeder at the Washington State University, about 50 people die every year from hornet stings, and that number is probably attributable to allergies. In the United States, an average of 62 people die each year from hornet, wasp or bee stings, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Early genetic testing shows that the Canadian colony originated in Japan, and at least one of the Washington hornets came from South Korea, said Karla Salp, public engagement specialist with Washington’s agriculture department. Several scientists said they believed the hornets likely hitched a ride on cargo brought to an American port from Asia. European honeybees, which have long lived in North America, are not equipped to defend themselves against the Asian giant hornet. In Japan, where the hornet typically lives, Asian honeybees have evolved a defense mechanism, Cobey said. The bees make a massive ball around the hornet scouts and smother them to death with the heat of their beating wings. Honeybees in the United States already face existential threats of increased pesticides, loss of habitat and a changing environment, she added. A newly introduced hornet could endanger the bee population and have a domino effect on the American food supply. Fruits, vegetables and even plant-grown animal feed could suffer without enough pollinating bees. Anyone who thinks they may have spotted an Asian giant hornet can report it to their state’s agriculture department. People can also help by not killing innocent bumblebees, Lawrence said.'}]"

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 4:06 pm Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs launched a campaign to roll back treaty rights upheld by a U.S. Supreme Court decision that reaffirmed the existence of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation\'s reservation boundaries. The Oklahoma City-based conservative think tank sent a letter last week to the state\'s congressional delegation, asking them and other members of Congress to formally disestablish the reservations of the Five Tribes. The letter was sent as plans were being made to celebrate Indigenous Peoples\' Day. Muscogee (Creek) Nation Principal Chief David Hill, in response to inquiries about the letter, said the tribe was ""grateful for the OCPA letter."" He said for the first time someone finally ""is telling the truth about the real motives behind legislation to address McGirt."" ""We have said all along that legislative efforts to undermine McGirt would harm Indian nations,"" Hill said. ""But now it\'s clear that the full goal of those pushing legislation is the eradication of sovereignty and the ultimate disestablishment of reservations."" The ruling in McGirt v. Oklahoma determined the ""land these treaties promised"" in exchange for giving up ""their ancestral lands in Georgia and Alabama ""remains an Indian reservation for purposes of federal criminal law."" That meant the state lacked jurisdiction to prosecute Jimcy McGirt, an enrolled member of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, for three serious sexual offenses committed on Muscogee (Creek) Nation reservation. Larry Parman, chairman of the OCPA Board of Trustees and a former Secretary of State and Secretary of Commerce, said disestablishing the reservations is necessary to ensure ""fairness, certainty and unity"" in the application of all laws. He believes the McGirt decision brings uncertainty to laws and regulations as they relate to criminal and civil jurisdiction, taxation, regulatory issues and economic development. Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. rebuffed that notion, describing the OCPA\'s ""anti-tribal views"" as ""outdated and ill-informed."" He said OCPA\'s request ""should be promptly rejected"" by Oklahoma\'s congressional delegation. ""OCPA’s letter is not just in opposition to the U.S. Supreme Court McGirt ruling, but it’s also in opposition to the Cherokee Nation,"" Hoskin said. ""We knew our reservation was never diminished, but it took more than a century for the government of the United States to acknowledge this and for the state of Oklahoma to come to terms with the continued existence of our reservation."" Hoskin acknowledged the McGirt decision might create some jurisdictional gaps for all Five Tribes in eastern Oklahoma. But he said tribal leaders will work together — as they have in the past — with state and federal officials to solve those issues. ""That action needs to respect our tribes, not erode our sovereignty,"" Hoskin said. ""Congressional action needs to empower tribes to do what we’ve done best for over two decades, which is work with the state of Oklahoma, resolve legal issues, and work towards stronger communities across our reservations.” The Commission for the Protection of Cherokee Nation Sovereignty, which Hoskin created after the Supreme Court announced its McGirt decision in July, has taken steps already to address some of those issues. It issued recommendations on Friday about how it plans to expand the tribe’s courts, attorneys and marshal service. Hill vowed to contest any effort to diminish the tribe\'s reservation or its sovereignty. ""We will fight so that not one iota of the sovereignty, treaty rights, and jurisdiction affirmed in McGirt is surrendered through legislation,"" Hill said. ""We stand with hundreds of other tribes across the nation when we say “see you on the battlefield!"" U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe had not seen the letter when he met with the Phoenix editorial board Thursday, the day it was sent to Washington. After the McGirt decision he expressed confidence he could work with state officials, ""tribal organizations and the delegation to find a workable solution for everyone that ensures criminals are prosecuted and brought to justice in the most appropriate manner."" Inhofe said later he did not want to be involved with anything unless the tribes were involved. Democratic challenger Abby Broyles said OCPA, with its letter, ""is only trying to cause unnecessary division."" ""There’s a serious path forward, but this isn’t it because McGirt v. Oklahoma was a narrow ruling,"" Broyles said. ""I’ve said all along, what’s good for the tribes is good for Oklahoma — we must work together for the mutual interests of the tribes and our state.” Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:37 pm Haskell County Sheriff Tim Turner (left) and Rogers County Sheriff Scott Walton (right) spoke out against State Question 805. State Question 805 is under fire from two Oklahoma sheriffs. Today, Rogers County Sheriff Scott Walton and Haskell County Sheriff Tim Turner shared their concerns and criticisms on State Question 805, which will appear on the Nov. 3 ballot. ""We\'ve seen recent ads that we want to dispel. There\'s great concerns with the language and the misinformation,"" said Walton. ""We want people to do their homework and do the research as they would on any voting decision they might enter into. But we look at state questions—780,781 etc—and I consistently see false information that comes out."" Walton continued, ""in the SQ 805 ad there\'s a caption that says it\'s endorsed by police officers and prosecutors. I\'ve yet to see a prosecutor that I know of that supports this. And when you look at the police officer that speaks in favor of it, he\'s in Lindsay, Okla., an ex-police chief of a town of 2,800 people….I don\'t know how many cases he\'s worked, that\'s for him to answer."" Walton said advertising focuses primarily on those who say they\'ve been victimized by the criminal justice system. ""But in reality, if your job today was to get into the penitentiary, you\'d have to work at it. If you don\'t rob a bank or kill somebody, your chances of going to the penitentiary on a first, second, or even third offense is almost non-existent,"" he said. ""805 eliminates the enhancement of sentencing of habitual, repeat offenders."" Walton said law enforcement focus isn\'t on heavy sentencing for first time offenders the majority of the time. ""The weak link is when they send that person to Lexington, Okla., to the department of corrections. It\'s become the joke that they\'re there long enough to get a haircut, their picture taken, an Aids test, and they\'re back home. We see it time and time again….Our ability to put a habitual offender away is still a hard job, it takes good police work, aggressive prosecution, good judges, and it still takes all of us working together. To think that we\'re going to take the teeth out of law enforcement. This is putting handcuffs on the wrong people–we\'re taking them off of thugs and putting them on law enforcement."" Walton went on to answer the question—what are state questions doing to law enforcement? ""We\'ve decriminalized most everything in 780. And 781 was supposed to create a slush fund for mental health…but we\'re still providing that out of county budget money. It\'s not being subsidized by any health fund created by 781,"" he said.

A controversial state question that would reform the state’s criminal justice system has qualified for November’s general election ballot. About State Question 805 State Question 805 applies to individuals that are convicted of non-violent felonies. Under Oklahoma state law, a felony offense is a crime where punishment includes imprisonment in the state penitentiary or death. The measure does not apply to those who have ever been convicted of a violent felony. State Question 805 would prohibit a person\'s former non-violent felony convictions from being used to enhance the person\'s sentence. In other words, the measure would not allow a convicted person\'s sentence to be made longer or harsher due to past felony convictions. The measure would provide for sentence modifications for eligible individuals that are serving or are set to serve sentences that were enhanced due to past felony convictions. A court could modify a person\'s sentence to be no greater than the current maximum sentence that would be imposed on a convicted person that had no former felony convictions.(Ballotpedia) Baron writes for the Claremore Progress, a CNHI publication.

In the past week, he has used a Tesla earnings call with analysts to call the stay-at-home orders “fascist,” and gone on Twitter to call upon governments to “give people back their freedom” and proceed with reopening businesses that have been closed during the pandemic. Coronavirus is officially responsible for more than 73,000 deaths in the U.S., and more than 265,000 worldwide. But, when speaking with Rogan, Musk said he thinks the mortality rate “is much less than, what, say, the World Health Organization said it was. Probably at least an order of magnitude less.” “The state of public perception is shifting,” Musk said. “It’s (coronavirus) recognized as not as fatal as we thought or feared.” But, Musk added that “at some point, there probably will be a pandemic with a high mortality rate. Something that’s killing a lot of 20-year-olds; killing large numbers of young, healthy people. This is at least practice for something like that. Given that there’s just a matter of time that there will be some such pandemic.” Musk also said he thinks the current situation has already resulted in a better understanding of illnesses like coronavirus, and that society might end up learning some lessons from the current crisis that it will able to apply to the next pandemic, whenever it occurs. “It’s highly likely, I think, coming out of this that we will develop vaccines that we didn’t have before for coronaviruses and other viruses, and possibly cures,” Musk said. “I think there will some amount of silver lining here. Hopefully more silver linings than less.”'}]"

The Wilburton Diggers and Hartshorne Miners are set to once again clash in the annual Battle of Gowen Mountain on Friday. The Diggers (3-4, 0-4) are coming off a 51-6 loss at Eufaula, but will now be setting their sights on their heated rival. In 2018, Wilburton broke an 11-game win streak by the Miners as they took a win on the road at Hartshorne. But the Miners would avenge that victory with one of their own at Seldon D. Taylor Field in Wilburton. Fast forward to 2020, where the Miners (1-6, 1-3) are coming off a loss on the road at Atoka, but now return to Butler-Jennings Field to defend home turf and last year’s victory. The Miners will look to the leadership of its veteran corps, as well as its up-and-coming younger talent. Senior quarterback Bryson Cervantes leads the charge with nearly 500 passing yards on the season, while also adding 185 yards on the ground with a combined five scores. Top receiving targets Xavier Fraser and Timothy Noriega have combined for over 300 yards and a couple touchdowns. The air attack is aided by the run game anchored by senior Micah Baker, who has amasses 482 yards and four scores so far this season. Rowdy Nimrod has also added over 200 yards and a score to propel his team forward. For the Diggers, injuries have caused a shuffle. But it’s an offense that has continued to put up numbers. Quarterback Grayson Mathis had amassed nearly 1,000 passing yards before being sidelined due to injury. Top target Christian Gockel, who had wrangled in 17 passes for over 400 yards, stepped into the signal caller role, splitting time with freshman Troy Clark. Wilburton’s receiving corps has seen help in the shuffle with the ground game, with Gockel, Clark, and Ralph Camacho combining for over 400 yards. In a game that has normally played a part in determining playoff contention, both teams will be eligible after the OSSAA’s decision to have a wide-open playoff field. So this one will be all about bragging rights, and who will get to take home the newly casted Battle of Gowen Mountain traveling trophy. Warner at Canadian, 7 p.m. The Canadian Cougars will be back to action after having an extended fall break when its game was cancelled due to COVID. The Cougars (2-3, 1-1) had back-to-back games cancelled due to COVID-19 situations surrounding their opposing teams.

Canadian is led by a crafty offense that has amassed over 500 rushing yards and nearly 400 passing yards in five games. Defensively, the Cougars allow an average of only 210 yards per game.

The trip has gotten longer since portions of the bridges were damaged in May 2019. “It’s been a pain,” he said. “You go to Ponca City, the shortest distance is an extra six miles. If it’s wet, then you’ve got to go [Highway] 60 or Highway 11, so you’re looking at about 10 or 12 miles extra.” More than a year and a half after a series of May floods washed away parts of the bridge system, county officials have received a $10.9 million grant from the Federal Highway Administration to build a new bridge across the Chikaskia River on Hubbard Road, Kay County District One Commissioner Jack Godberson said Friday. However, that bridge won’t be opened for four or five years while several studies – including an environmental study – are conducted. In the meantime, landowners say they’re worried that nearby cropland could continue to erode during flooding. WHY IT MATTERS Hubbard Road is the shortest and most direct route between Blackwell and Ponca City, the county’s two largest towns. Godberson said an average of 2,200 cars per day traveled the road when it was open. Using Hubbard Road, the distance between the two cities is 14 miles. From the southern edge of Blackwell, drivers take US Highway 177 south for two miles before they connect with Hubbard Road. They turn east onto Hubbard Road and drive 12 miles to the northern edge of Ponca City. To get to Ponca City, drivers can also use State Highway 11, an east-west highway north of Blackwell, and State Highway 60, an east-west highway south of Blackwell. Both routes are about 16 miles long. County officials closed Hubbard Road to through traffic after the May 2019 flood damaged the bridge system, which includes the main bridge over the river and an overflow bridge built in 2015 to alleviate flooding in the area. The system is located near one of the river’s oxbows, a place where the river curves and is beginning to cut a new channel through nearby land. The area floods during heavy rains, and it poses challenges to engineers as they build bridges there. HISTORY OF TROUBLE Floodwaters damaged parts of the overflow bridge after it was built in 2015, forcing the contractor on the project to make repairs. The flooding in May 2019 washed away even larger portions of the bridge, so county officials closed it. The contractor who built the bridge has gone out of business, Godberson said. When engineers designed the overflow bridge, they cut the amount of space available for water to flow, Godbehere, the landowner, said. By narrowing the channel of the water, engineers increased the water’s velocity, giving it additional power to wash away soil and rock. Godbehere’s family has lived near the river for more than 60 years, he said. Over time, he’s watched how the flow of the river has changed. “[Other landowners and I] told them it was going to be a problem whenever they built it,” he said. “Whenever they started filling in over there, they closed up the overflow and put a 170-foot bridge in there. They needed about a 600- or 800-foot bridge in there to cover the overflow. “For several years, we were in a drought then. It was several years before we got a good flood on it, and you can tell that the first flood, it increased the velocity of the water going through that bridge, and then it increased the velocity coming [over the land] because I lost about three or four acres over there.” Godbehere said he isn’t the only person whose land has been damaged by flooding. Farmers miles downstream have lost soil, too. To prevent further erosion, the riverbanks near the bridge and oxbow need to be shored up with additional rock once the new bridge is built, Godbehere said. Rock used to shore up riverbanks is called “rip-rap.” While the federal grant will pay for some rip-rap, it won’t pay for all of it. Donnie Head is the district manager for Circuit Engineering Division No. 8, a group that helps county governments plan infrastructure projects. He said the grant will pay for rip-rap to be applied around the bridge and roadway, though the grant won’t pay for rock around other parts of the riverbank. “It’s going to be expensive to rip-rap that and put in some of these jetties and try to control water as it comes around that oxbow,” Godberson, the county commissioner, said. WHY SO LONG? Bridge construction will take less than a year to complete, officials say. Preparing for the project takes the most time. County officials recently voted to hire Oklahoma City-based engineering firm EST, Inc. to design the new bridge, which will be an estimated 500 feet long and will replace the original bridge over the river. Bridge contractors will try to salvage parts of the 2015 overflow bridge that weren’t damaged, Head said. The Oklahoma Department of Transportation will oversee the project. In order to build a new bridge, state transportation officials have to conduct an environmental study that lasts anywhere from a year to 18 months to determine how construction could impact wildlife in the area, Head said. “The engineer has been selected, so the next step is to get the engineer contract, and that’ll probably take four to six months, give or take a little bit,” Head said. “It’s got to go through ODOT, and then I think it’s got to be approved by the Federal Highway [Administration] because it’s federal highway money paying for it. “Once that’s done, then they can turn into environmental studying. With the environmental study being on the Chikaskia River, that’s regulated by the Corps of Engineers. So that study will probably be a year to 18 months timeframe that it’ll take.” Head said ODOT has to conduct the environmental study because the project is funded with federal money. Officials can’t reuse an environmental study conducted for the 2015 bridge project because it is now out-of-date – and because the 2015 project was funded through the state’s County Improvements for Roads and Bridges fund, not through the Federal Highway Administration. “Most of the time, those studies are good for three years, and it was probably done two years before that project was built,” he said. “So it would be about seven years old. That was CIRB money, and this is federal highway funds, so the feds require the same type of study.” Other studies analyzing the river’s flow will also be conducted. Once the studies are completed, county officials have to allow bridge construction contractors to bid on the project. After a contractor is hired, construction of the bridge should take around nine months, Head said. “By the time you get the ‘OK’ to get a project started, it’s about four to five years to get it to that point on just about any given project,” he said. That’s why drivers won’t be crossing the river anytime soon, Godberson said. “It’s just a lot of red tape,” he said. “It just takes time to get something done.” Until the land is shored up and the new bridge is built, landowners like Godbehere say they’re left to watch soil be carried away by floodwaters. “Just get it fixed,” he said. “It’s a nightmare to me. Every time the river comes up, I’m wondering how much more is going to be lost to the river and guys on downstream.” You may also like:'}]"
