That means there were potentially more than 470,000 residents (of a professional/working age) who could be eligible for an Accomplished Under 40 (AU40) award this year. Photo by Pete Grady Photography To shine a spotlight on this valued segment of the state, each year, the Idaho Business Review (IBR) through its AU40 awards program rightly honors 40 dynamic people in industry, government and the nonprofit sector who will be the decision-makers of tomorrow. The AU40 awards rules are simple: Prospective honorees must be a resident of Idaho or working in the state, and they must be under the age of 40 (as of June 2, 2022 for this year’s awards). The awards finalist determination involves a two-step nomination and application process: First, an individual must be nominated by the community at large. This nomination could come from anyone who knows the individual well — be that colleagues, friends or family members. Self-nominations are also accepted. The second step requires the person who is nominated to fill out an application for consideration and to submit letters of recommendation, resumes and other pertinent background information. Once the application window closes, a judging panel of past winners undertakes the major task of scoring the many qualified candidates, taking into account the categories of professional achievement, leadership, mentorship and community service. The top-scoring candidates, based on a unified scoring system, are then named the 40 finalists. “It is a privilege to recognize these young talented individuals, and we are thrilled to be able to celebrate all their accomplishments in person this year with the support from program presenting sponsor, Boise State University College of Business and Economics (COBE),” said IBR Publisher Cindy Suffa. An exciting change to announce for this year’s program is that the AU40 awards will be co-located with IBR’s Icon Awards, which honor Idaho’s change-makers over the age of 50 — pioneers who are in a class of their own, continue to kick-start innovation and champion their industry through professional creativity and leadership. It’s a great opportunity for these two generations to get in a room together to network and learn from each other. This year’s awards program to honor the AU40 and Icon Award winners will be held in person at 5:30 p.m. on Thursday, June 2 at Boise Centre East. If you’d like to attend the ceremony and networking event, tickets are available now. The leaders will be profiled in a printed magazine (two separate publications for AU40 winners and Icon Award finalists) to be distributed at the awards event and then released to subscribers on June 10.

in the early morning at the Idaho Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial to celebrate its 20th anniversary on Tuesday. It was cool and sunny at 8:30 a.m., and there was free rugelach — a pastry that originated in the Jewish communities of Poland — from Goldstein’s Bagels & Bialys and coffee from Neckar Coffee on hand. Wassmuth Center for Human Rights Executive Director Dan Prinzing spoke, addressing both the history and future of the memorial. “When we give tours here, the first question folks ask is ‘How the heck did this ever happen in Boise, Idaho?’” Prinzing said. “It’s because it’s who we are. It is the heart of the city. It is the heart of the community. It is us. It is a statement to the public that this is who we are in Boise. This is what we believe in.” Prinzing then talked about a new initiative coming to the memorial to bring an augmented-reality game — phones where people interact with their environment like “Pokemon Go.” It will be “a game to counter the radicalization of youth,” Prinzing said. “How exciting for a new generation, to bring them into this space, to become involved in the story. It’s not somebody else’s story. It’s my story. It’s how I find myself within the space, how the space works in me, thinking and reflecting.” Boise Mayor Lauren McLean also spoke at the event. “I said to Dan (Prinzing) this morning, it’s really impossible for me to remember this space not being here,” McLean said. “It feels as though it has always been a part of the community because it is such an important part.” In the ‘90s, she also wondered why the memorial was built in Boise. “It was because at the time we needed to put a flag in the ground and remind ourselves, given all that was happening in our state and particularly in north Idaho, and everybody else who it is that we aspire to be and can be and are,” McLean said, ”but how likely and easy it is to become that which we don’t want to be.” McLean recounted her own experience as an undergraduate visiting Anne Frank’s house and Auschwitz. She still remembers the smallness of Frank’s house and how big Auschwitz was. “I remember walking up the stairs, seeing and feeling those small spaces, and really not being able to imagine how someone just a little younger than me at the time could have written as she wrote and held such hope in such dark, dark times,” McLean said. There is still work to do, she said. “We find ourselves in so many similar situations that we need to have this. We need to mark this memorial of 20 years,” said McLean. “More importantly, together, we need to say that in the next five, 10, 15, 20 years, we’re going to be able to look back at this anniversary and remember that we not only marked this in our conscience as a city, but that we are willing to continue to take action together.” Boise Police Department Chief Ryan Lee also spoke to the crowd — about the partnership the police department has with the center and how officers routinely go there for tours and conversations. “We come and listen to the important lessons that can be learned here,” Lee said. “We hear of the transgression of the past, and really sit down and question and understand what our roles are as police officers. Fundamentally, that is, for police officers in a free and private society, is swearing to protect human rights.” He also spoke about how safe Boise is, not just because of the police, but because of the community. “Frankly, the fact that this monument is here, this memorial is here, is a testament to the content of this city’s character,” Lee said. Prinzing ended by talking about the new Wassmuth Education Center and how the construction process will start behind the memorial’s waterfalls in mid-October and will finish in August 2023. “How’s it happening?” Prinzing asked. “Because of you. Because of the support of a community that recognizes, in spite of everything, people are still good at heart.” Your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers: Account processing issue - the email address may already exist Sign up with Thank you .

LOGAN, Utah — A woman in a motorized wheelchair crossing Main Street at the intersection of 200 North was fatally struck by a cement truck on Friday morning. According to a press release from the Logan City Police Department, the accident occurred around 10 a.m. as the adult female was crossing the street in a motorized Jazzy wheelchair. The cement truck turned right from 200 North and hit the victim. The woman sustained fatal injuries and died at the scene. Logan City Police Assistant Chief Jeff Simmons identified the woman as 65-year-old Tina Marie Jackman of Logan. Traffic in the area was affected for sometime while Logan City Police, Cache County Sheriff’s deputies and Utah Highway Patrol investigated the incident, according to the release. Main Street has since been reopened. According to Simmons, the factors in the incident are still under investigation but said the driver of the high-profile truck may not have seen the victim’s low-profile wheelchair. Simmons said the driver was “pretty emotional” and shaken up after the accident. Speaking in generalities, Simmons encouraged drivers to put cellphones away and minimize distractions while driving to reduce traffic accidents.
