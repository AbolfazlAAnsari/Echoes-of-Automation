The Storm Lake City Council voted to sue Buena Vista County over the misplacement of several million dollars in tax increment financing. We saw that coming. Here is what we did not foresee, when Buena Vista County Supervisor Kathy Croker, R-Lake Creek, spoke: “We were expecting dialogue between the board and the city. We were expecting that,” Croker said. “We’re sorry, too, especially for the taxpayers.” That is the first time we heard someone say they were sorry to the taxpayers in public.

She gives the city an opening to take up her offer and have a serious conversation about how to restore $5 million or so to the city, which was misdirected to other taxing authorities by an error in the County Auditor’s Office. The city should take that opening. We have a suggestion: Put Croker in a room with a council member like Maggie Martinez because they are both smart and funny. They could make each other smile.

The county can scratch that together over a three-year period if they take their lumps and own up. Maybe the city is bidding a touch high but we couldn’t know because an audit has not been done, not by a CPA firm, not by the state auditor, or the Iowa Department of Management. Estimates have been made. Agree on something that helps fill Storm Lake’s hole. Make sure lawyers are not in the room. Not even local ones. You need them later to write up what you just agreed to.

It got burned on the waterworks lawsuit by its insurer. It’s getting burned again because its insurer won’t cover the error. If a lawsuit were to be filed, it should be the county against its insurer. This was, by all accounts, an honest mistake. There was negligence by the city but the county owns the mistake. Again, we cannot know because all of the public business is done in secret. We know that the county’s insurance is pretty good if you don’t file a claim. Likewise, the city should have been covered by its insurer. What good is the insurance if you cannot get paid on a claim?

The Ogden Community School District has over a dozen new employees this year, but will have to navigate without a few key positions as they continue to look for a hire. The district also will attempt to keep things moving forward as Joshua Heyer settles into his first year as superintendent with the school year quickly approaching. Heyer said their top goal this year is student achievement and is always a top priority. He also wants them to feel valued, feel heard and seen while also harboring a safe environment for them. 'Fraser, Iowa ~ Then and now' was the program presented at Battin Chapel this Sunday by Amy Laube of Fraser and Rich Abrahamson of Waterville, Maine and formerly of Boxholm. Over 40 people attended the photographic and oral history that focused on Fraser's history, people and industry that included coal mining, a power plant, a tile factory and more. With the retirement of Dr. Pam Dodge at the end of the past school year, the Ogden Community School District conducted a search for her replacement. In January, they found their candidate in Joshua Heyer, who had previously been with the Winterset School District before accepting the position in Ogden, and started on July 1.

The expansion of wind generation has been, and continues to be, a boon for rural development. Wind energy is one of the fastest-growing sources of electricity across the nation. Several Midwest states, including Iowa, are leading the charge in its development, according to recent reports from the U.S. Department of Energy. In 2022, wind power accounted for 22% of new electricity capacity in the nation, representing a $12 billion investment. While it was considered a down year for installations due to supply chain issues, forecasts for wind energy investments have grown by almost 60% thanks to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. In 2021, Iowa wind turbines generated approximately $57 million for state and local taxing bodies and paid out $67 million in lease payments to landowners. County governments used these funds to improve county highways, revitalize town centers, and increase funding for essential services. The industry has also created jobs for rural residents. According to Clean Jobs Midwest, 12,000 rural Iowans worked in the clean energy sector in 2022. Wind energy has been expanding in Iowa for more than two decades and is second in total generation capacity at 12,783 megawatts (MWs). It also leads the nation in the share of in-state generation at 64% and electricity sold at 82%, which accounts for most of the state’s energy consumption. In 2022, Iowa built on its existing capacity by installing the fourth most wind generation capacity at 484 MWs. This amount could power an additional 145,000 homes annually. Given wind energy’s potential positive impact on rural development, capitalizing on it is essential for economic growth. Iowa has paved the way as a leader in the industry’s growth, which will pay dividends for rural communities for decades to come. Alex Delworth is a policy associate at the Center for Rural Affairs. The Center’s mission is to establish strong rural communities, social and economic justice, environmental stewardship, and genuine opportunity for all while engaging people in decisions that affect the quality of their lives and the future of their communities.

Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led a joint letter warning four news organizations about concerns that freelance journalists who supplied photos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel may have had ties to the terrorist organization. In the letter, Bird and 14 other Republican state attorneys general argue that the news organizations may have provided “material support to terrorists” by paying for photographs from journalists with alleged ties to Hamas. Bird The letter is addressed to officials at the New York Times, Associated Press, CNN and Reuters. A November report from HonestReporting, a pro-Israel media watchdog, questioned whether freelance photojournalists for the organizations had advance knowledge of the Oct. 7 attack. The news organizations have denied they had any knowledge of the attack. One of those reporters, Hassan Eslaiah, posed for a portrait with Yahya Sinwar, a Hamas leader in a resurfaced social media post. CNN and the AP, who ran Eslaiah’s photos but said he was not working for them on the day of the attack, have since said they are no longer working with him. According to the New York Times, photojournalist Yousef Masoud, another reporter named by HonestReporting, said he was awoken by rocket fire on the day of the attack. His first photos were taken 90 minutes after the attack began, and the Times denied he had any prior knowledge. The letter cites federal law that bars providing “material support” to terrorist organizations, and notes that it is illegal under state law in Iowa as well. The letter goes on to say the news organizations are “on notice.” “You should ensure that you are taking all necessary steps to prevent your organizations’ from contracting with members of terror organizations,” the letter says. “We urge you in the strongest terms to take care that your hiring practices conform to the laws forbidding material support for terror organizations.” Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds joined 16 other Republican governors in a letter calling for President Joe Biden’s administration to block purchases of U.S. land by the Chinese government. The letter points to plans for a 270-acre purchase in Michigan by Gotion, a subsidiary of Gotion High-Tech, a Chinese company. The site of the facility, which is planned to manufacture electric vehicle batteries, is about 100 miles from a Michigan National Guard facility. Several of the governors who signed the letter, led by Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, have moved to limit foreign ownership of land. Iowa law prohibits foreign entities from owning agricultural land unless it is less than 320 acres and used for non-farming purposes. “For too long, we have allowed dangerous and adversarial governments to infiltrate our country,” the letter says. “Our states will tolerate such allowances no longer. The Biden Administration must reckon with the fact that such entities are plain threats to our national security, our farmers, and our citizenry.” The letter calls on administration officials to use “all available tools” to prevent acquisition of U.S. land by foreign governments and entities. Gov. Kim Reynolds speaks at the Iowa Renewable Fuels Summit on Feb. 7, 2023. The Iowa Department of Education named Ann Mincks Iowa Teacher of the Year for 2024. The English Language Learner teacher at Hoover High School in Des Moines joined Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds for a commemoration ceremony on Monday. “Ann is an exceptional teacher. By providing her students the skills necessary to achieve literacy, she is creating a foundation for them to thrive in school, work, and life,” Reynolds said in a statement. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and First Gentleman Kevin Reynolds will host Christmas at Terrace Hill on Dec. 17. The annual event, scheduled from 1 to 3 p.m., includes photos with Santa Claus and the first family, ornament decorating and a station to send letters to deployed National Guard members. Event organizers will also collect donations for deployed service members. At the event, Reynolds will read “No Company for Christmas,” a story about the historic Terrace Hill residence.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 3:01 pm Antitrust regulators should block the proposed sale of OCI Global’s Iowa Fertilizer Co. plant in Wever to Koch Industries. The deal would be outrageous, but we must look back to fully understand why. Then-governor Terry Branstad and his Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds offered nearly $550 million in tax giveaways to OCI’s predecessor, Orascom, to build the plant prior to its 2017 ribbon cutting. That included $133 million in local tax giveaways like Lee County property tax abatement. Another $112 million in state tax giveaways. And an estimated $300 million in federal tax giveaways via disaster bonds created after the floods of 2008. Now, I don’t fault Branstad and Reynolds for investing money in building a fertilizer plant. Farmers are paying way too much for fertilizer due to issues like excessive industry concentration, and those inflated costs rob farmers of profits, contribute to the hollowing out of Iowa, and increase food costs for everyone. More jobs are always welcome, too. No, where they got it wrong was giving away the farm to land the project. At the time, Branstad and Reynolds argued the estimated $300 million in federal tax giveaways wasn’t enough to keep the plant from being built in Illinois, and that’s how they justified an additional $245 million in tax giveaways. Sorry, but that math ain’t mathing. As former state senator Joe Bolkcom noted, “The flood disaster bonds gave Iowa a $300 million advantage over Illinois from the start.” That’s because none of Illinois’ proposed sites qualified for the bonds. Additionally, Branstad said, “Illinois is the loser … not just because of the incentives,” but rather “… because of the way they have mismanaged their state’s finances for too long.” If Iowa had a $300 million advantage that Illinois couldn’t match, and Illinois was allegedly so poorly managed that they didn’t pose a real threat to winning the plant, then why did Branstad and Reynolds offer an additional $245 million? It’s a case of incompetence or corporate cronyism, but either way it’s embarrassing. Branstad even argued for the project by attacking the same Koch Industries now trying to acquire the plant when he said, “I understand the Koch brothers don’t want the competition … They want to keep out competition. We want competition.” Fast forward to today. While Koch failed to stop a competitor plant from being built then, they’re attempting to get the last laugh at Branstad and Reynolds now. If the proposed Koch acquisition is approved, then our tax dollars will have gone toward building a fertilizer plant owned by Koch that project proponents like Branstad and Reynolds argued at the time was needed because there weren’t enough fertilizer plants not owned by Koch. The more than half a billion in taxpayer dollars offered to build the plant was intended to create jobs, increase competition, and drive down costs. Permitting the Koch deal to go through would achieve exactly the opposite. That’s why I look forward to seeing now-Governor Reynolds and other Iowa Republicans ask regulators to block Koch’s acquisition of OCI’s Wever plant. If for some reason they don’t, the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission should protect farmers and consumers anyway and block this deal. The DOJ and FTC are our nation’s antitrust guardians and are required to review deals like these for anticompetitive concerns. That’s good news because this is Koch’s latest attempt to further consolidate its market power. That includes a 2021 acquisition of Compass Minerals micronutrient assets and a 2022 acquisition in Jorf Fertilizers Company III, the “world’s largest phosphate mining and leading global fertilizer group.” Koch’s already one of the top nitrogen fertilizer producers, earning a place as one of the companies that comprise Big Fertilizer. To get a sense of how concentrated the market is, just imagine a Cy-Hawk football game hosted at Kinnick Stadium, but the Cyclones get to control who sits in 52,000 of the 70,000 seats. That’s the reality for farmers today, where Big Fertilizer controls 75 percent of the nitrogen market according to farm group Farm Action. The proposed Koch-OCI deal would hand over control of even more Kinnick seats to the Cyclones. With such concentrated control of the market, Big Fertilizer price gouges Iowans and forces farmers to operate in a system where the house always wins. When Big Fertilizer engages in this kind of theft, it increases the amount that the rest of us pay not only for food and fertilizer, but in taxpayer subsidies for farmers, too. Rather than blame farmers for receiving subsidies, we need to redirect anger to the corporate monopolies like Koch that make the subsidies necessary in the first place. We can start by keeping Koch from gaining even more power over us. Indeed, the only thing more embarrassing than making “the worst economic development deal in state history” would be if our own tax dollars contributed to increasing Koch’s concentration of the fertilizer market too.

They’ve usually experienced trauma, so behaviors can be a little higher, but in all reality… I mean, I’ve had some really great teenagers come in and out of here.” Moon’s own two adopted children came into her house as teenage foster children. “I had Joe for 13 months before I adopted him [in October 2020],” Moon said. “This year in April I adopted another boy that I had in foster care, Skyler.” Both boys were 13 when they came into Moon’s home. If looking to adopt as a foster parent, Moon said the process takes at least six months. “When termination (termination of parental rights) happens, the kiddos have to be in your care for at least six months before you can adopt,” Moon said. “If you’re not already licensed [as a foster parent], that sometimes takes three months to get licensed, three or four months, by the time you complete classes. There’s 11 classes you have to take for foster/adoption, it’s a series.” While fostering or adopting might take a lot of time and work, Moon said it’s important that it is done. “Every child deserves a home where they can call home,” Moon said. “A lot of their behaviors is because they’ve had so many placements. My youngest had nine placements in four years before he was with me. That’s a lot of placements. They have a sense of not belonging and that’s a part of, all of us need a sense of belonging.” Many people specifically fear fostering or adopting older children, but that’s something Moon focuses on. “I work a lot, so teenagers are easier for me with my work schedule,” Moon said. “There’s something about teenagers where you’re helping them learn how to live, not just getting them day to day. You’re teaching them how to do money, you’re teaching them how to be responsible with the real world, where they can succeed once they’re 18.” Moon said the need for foster parents is high in the area. She encouraged those interested in fostering to find more information at Four Oaks Family and Children Services, where she works. “We’re licensing case workers for every area in Iowa,” Moon said. “There’s somebody there to help guide them. We need foster parents. We don’t have a lot here in Creston, we don’t have a lot that are licensed for foster care.” Originally from Wisconsin, Erin is a recent graduate from UW-Stevens Point.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 3:17 pm VINTON — By the time Santa arrived from the North Pole on Saturday morning there were already about 15 cars of kiddos waiting to see him at the Depot Museum in Vinton. From 10-2 on Dec. 2, Benton County Historical Society invited folks inside the depot to have hot cocoa and cookies with Santa Claus. Families gathered at tables in the holiday-decorated depot while they waited for their turn with Santa. Julie Schenker passed out cookies and hot cocoa provided by the Benton County Historical Society. Julie said there was a steady stream of little ones for the duration of the event. Among the attendees, there was a mixed reaction to the jolly guy. Tiny infants seemed to enjoy the soft, fluffy suit, while older infants and toddlers varied from trepidatious to terrified. School aged children did not waste the opportunity to give Santa their Christmas list. Preschoolers tended to be a bit more skittish, but could usually be persuaded to share their wishes too. Contessa’s Photography was on hand to capture the moment for families. Families could choose to have their kiddos sit on Santa’s lap and then purchase the professional photo. Parents were welcome to snap as many shots of their own at the same time. Visit Contessa’s Photography Facebook page for more highlights about this event or for a sneak-peek of other photo shoots.

Wingert Stacy Hale, of Fort Dodge, began using methamphetamine at age 16. After years of struggling with addiction -- in her own words, she ""lived to use, and used to live"" -- she entered treatment at the YWCA of Fort Dodge on April 9, 2016. Now, she\'s an outpatient counselor for the STARS program at Community and Family Resources, helping youth affected by substance use disorders navigate recovery. Editor’s note: This is the first in a four-part series on substance use recovery. September is National Recovery Month, sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). To learn about your options for recovery and get connected to resources, visit YourLifeIowa.org. When Stacy Hale was “in the grips” of her addiction to methamphetamine, all she cared about was her next high — nothing else mattered. Not her kids, not her home, not her job — or lack thereof. “It’s a self-made prison is what it is,” she said. “The last 10 years of using (meth), I was just walking around as an empty person. I had no joy. Nothing. Sometimes I felt like a robot.” After battling with addiction her entire adult life, Hale walked into the YWCA of Fort Dodge for substance use treatment on April 9, 2016. All she had was a backpack full of dirty clothes and a desire to escape that “self-made prison” for good. Hale was 16 when she tried meth for the first time. She’d used marijuana and alcohol before, but this was the first “hard” drug she tried. “Right away, I was addicted right away to meth,” she said. At the time, Hale was a teen mother and attending an alternative high school in Des Moines. That’s where she started spending time with classmates she describes as “troubled.” One day, those troubled friends invited her to use meth with them. “I didn’t think about not doing it,” Hale said. The addiction was immediate. “I liked how this made me feel and I just always wanted more.” At 22, Hale moved to Fort Dodge because she liked the schools for her two children — whom she had custody of at the time — and because it was closer to her kids’ grandparents. Hale had a few periods in her life where she didn’t use drugs for an extended period of time, and for a while, this was one of them. Hale earned her GED and began attending college at Iowa Central Community College. She wasn’t using drugs, but she was drinking heavily and partying with her classmates. Eventually, Hale began using methamphetamine again. She started finding excuses for why her kids would need to spend the night at their grandparents’ so she could use meth. By this time, she had three young kids and the Department of Human Services got involved. “Today, looking back on it, I can thank them because I was not a good mom,” Hale said. After DHS took the children, they went to live with their grandparents permanently. “I’m thankful for their grandparents because they gave them what they needed. I was just very unstable. I was not reliable — all those things that come along with addiction.” Over the years and through her recovery journey, Hale has been able to restore some of those broken relationships with her older children. Her oldest daughter is 26 and lives in Webster City. “She was just at my house last Sunday,” Hale said. “We grilled and I spent time with my grandbaby. In recovery, I’ve learned to be present and not focus on the things that happened in the past.” Hale’s oldest son lives in Fort Dodge and she talks to him from time to time. She has a 17-year-old son she hasn’t seen in many years and hasn’t had any contact with him, but she hopes that could change one day. Her youngest daughter lives with her in Fort Dodge. “I’m grateful for what I have,” Hale said. “I don’t have all my kids in my life, but maybe someday that will be different. I have learned in recovery that I can’t dwell on the ‘what ifs?’ I just need to be present, and that’s what I’m doing.” Hale first entered treatment for her addiction in 2006. After graduating the program, she moved into the YWCA of Fort Dodge, which she said was more like a homeless shelter at the time, until she was accepted into a transitional housing program and moved into a place of her own. “That first day, as I was moving in, I saw people that I used to hang out with and I got high that day,” she said. “We were moving in boxes and getting high.” Before moving into her new apartment that day, Hale had been “clean” from drugs for five-and-a-half months and regularly attended recovery meetings. And then she started hanging out with people she now says she shouldn’t have, which then “veered” her back to where she was before. “I had started gaining things back in my life,” she said. “And then I lost them right away — I have kids that were removed from my care that I never got back. I had family that didn’t want to talk to me.” Looking back, she understands why the Department of Human Services removed her children, and at the time she knew they were being taken care of, so she didn’t feel that they needed her. “I was in the grips of my addiction,” she said. “Nothing else mattered.” Eventually, something changed. “It was just weird,” Hale said. “One day I woke up and I was just like, ‘I don’t want to do this.’ … For so many years, that’s all I did. I lived to use and I used to live. That’s another thing they say in recovery.” It was spring of 2016 and her boyfriend, who had also struggled with addiction for many years, had just entered treatment and suggested Hale look for help too. Hale credits her “higher power” for giving her the clarity to listen to what her boyfriend suggested and follow through with seeking treatment. “When I decided I didn’t want to use anymore, I was homeless,” Hale said. “I had a backpack with dirty clothes in it. There were times I didn’t eat or have anywhere to sleep.” She started by visiting a few meetings of a 12-step program. There, she connected with a sponsor who also worked at the YWCA of Fort Dodge and helped her apply for the treatment program there. “They gave me a bed — I was so grateful to have that bed,” Hale said. “I had my own room there. I felt rich.” Five months after entering treatment at the YWCA, Hale graduated in September 2016. Her boyfriend had also recently completed treatment and they got an apartment together. “Life happened the way it was supposed to after that,” Hale said. Before they moved in together, Hale and her boyfriend established “house rules,” created boundaries and worked on budgeting together. They weren’t going to let anyone using drugs into their home. Hale also started working as a housekeeper. “I really didn’t work (when I was using),” she said. “Half the time I didn’t even have a cell phone. I couldn’t tell you where my ID was or my Social Security card was … and those things cost money, so I couldn’t afford to get stuff like that.” Hale would apply for jobs, but most weren’t able to get in touch with her since she didn’t have a phone or a home. The few times she was able to find employment, if she learned that someone she knew was nearby using drugs, she’d walk off the job to go get high with them. In her recovery, Hale learned to be reliable — with her work, with her relationships and with her recovery. “I got really involved with my recovery and got connected with great women who I consider my family,” she said. “All I’ve done is surround myself with healthy women that I want to be like. I’ve learned from these women how to be a good girlfriend, a good mom and a good employee — all of the things that I had to relearn how to do.” After completing treatment in 2016, Hale decided to go back to school.

throughout the Davenport Municipal Airport on June 22 and 23, this exhilarating aerial celebration featuring airborne performances, aerobatic teams, helicopters, squadrons, information booths, vendors, musical entertainment, and much more. With highlights from the eagerly awaited annual event including free concerts in the park, a Swedish Maypole celebration, a book signing, children\'s activities, and more, everyone is invited to attend the 2024 Bishop Hill Midsommar Music Festival on June 22, a family-friendly celebration of this Swedish holiday. Authors of fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and more will share their talents and help strengthen the talents of others during the Midwest Writing Center\'s 2023 David R. Collins Writers Conference at Augustana College\'s Sorensen Hall, a June 27 through 29 celebration of the written word boasting workshops, readings, book pitches, and more, with special events planned at several additional Quad Cities locales. Delivering a blend of local history, environmental issues, education, entertainment, and fresh air, Davenport\'s River Action will again present a series of outdoor presentations in the first month-plus of the annual Channel Cat Talks and Riverine Walks: weekly programs that, from May 28 through June 29, will address such topics as local abolitionist freedom fighters, steamboating, birds of prey, infrastructure, and the Quad City River Bandits. From May 28 through September 15, fascinating stories of struggle, perseverance, tragedy, and triumph will be shared at Davenport\'s German American Heritage Center in the venue\'s Immigration Then & Now: Finding Refuge in the Quad Cities, a meaningful, locally themed exhibition presented in partnership with World Relief Quad Cities and supported by the Moline Regional Community Foundation. A state law essentially designed to prevent Republicans from appointing legislative candidates to the ballot after the March primary was ruled unconstitutional by a Sangamon County judge last week, but her ruling only applied to the fourteen Republican plaintiffs in the case who are running for the Illinois House and Senate. Illinois House Speaker Chris Welch gave added meaning to the phrase “winning ugly” during last Wednesday’s early-morning hours. I’ve never seen anything like it, so let’s take a look. House members were told to be in their seats by noon on Tuesday after the Senate had easily passed the entire budget package on Sunday. The World Health Organization\'s (WHO\'s) attempted global coup is mere days away. If you ever thought of calling your legislators, now would be an ideal time to express your objection to assigning emergency management to a foreign entity. For everyone\'s sake, leave politics out of it. I’m not sure I’ve seen a stranger roll-call than last week’s House vote on Senate Bill 2978. The data privacy bill is an initiative of Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias, and he was on the House floor during the debate. The far-right ginned up social-media opposition to the bill by claiming that it would allow non-citizens to vote. More than 1,400 electronic witness slips have so far been filed in opposition. On May 28, 2023, my wife and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary at our home in Davenport with family and friends when we began to hear police and ambulance sirens racing downtown. News reports soon made it clear that there had been a horrific disaster: 324 Main Street, a 116-year-old, six-story building housing numerous low-income tenants partially collapsed from top to bottom. Given the gravitas of what had transpired in 2019 with the flood wall disaster and in 2023 with 324 Main St. disaster – both of which occurred on (former city administrator) Corrin Spiegel\'s watch as the top paid city official – compared to the school-age-girl-thin-skinned complaints in the finally released September 2023 demand letter, one could say Spiegel\'s demand letter is a “nothing burger.” The Quad Cities’ summer-theatre season is finally underway and Quad City Music Guild’s production of A Little Night Music, with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, a book by Hugh Wheeler, and directed by Colleen Houlihan, is a good start to it, boasting strong performances and some killer vocals. With freshly painted arches and some ghostly trees on the furthest front flats, set designer Miranda Callahan’s work on Medea was interesting enough to generally distract me from the gnats that were apparently immune to insect repellent. Care to enjoy some frolicking, singing gorillas (and people) without leaving the QC? I suggest visiting the Spotlight Theatre for Tarzan: The Musical, an adaptation of the 1999 Disney animated film. A Tony Award-winning classic that, according to the New York Telegram, ""ranks with Dracula and sometimes sets your spine to as much tingling,"" author Maxwell Anderson\'s legendary stage chiller Bad Seed enjoys a June 14 through 23 run at Moline\'s Playcrafters Barn Theatre, this powerfully creepy entertainment the inspiration for an Oscar-nominated movie and a work shortlisted for the 1955 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Presenting its latest season of free summertime Shakespeare in Iowa City\'s Lower City Park, Riverside Theatre will thrill audiences with a stunning outdoor production of the Bard\'s historical tragedy Julius Caesar from June 14 through 30, this classic from 1599 having been performed over the years by such thunderous worldwide talents as Marlon Brando, Orson Welles, John Gielgud, and Denzel Washington. On June 16, the music of the locally famous composer, musician, and band leader Professor Ernst Otto will once again fill the air at Davenport\'s Schuetzen Park, with several of Otto\'s best-known compositions performed by Dr. Marian Lee, the gifted pianist and associate professor of piano at St. Ambrose University. With his outfit lauded by LAST.fm for their ability to ""seamlessly blend and arrange the root elements of rock and roll while forging new territory,"" singer/songwriter Billy Allen and his band The Pollies headline a June 19 concert at Davenport\'s Raccoon Motel, the group also praised by LAST.fm for ""songs that sound so natural and effortless that you don\'t notice the intrinsic complexity and massive undertaking that each track represents.""

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 3:18 pm Oelwein’s second RISE Ltd. group home shows the project is off to a great start toward its early June completion date. Much can be accomplished in a short amount of time if the weather cooperates. That can be especially true this year with a basically mild fall and early winter allowing the construction season to stretch far into December. Just two short months ago, a groundbreaking was held in the 100 block of Second Avenue NW for the site of a new RISE group home. A drive past the location Thursday morning revealed the house structure complete with windows, doors and roof has already been accomplished. A worker from Steege Construction of Waverly, the general contractor for the project, was seen taking a ladder and tools inside on Thursday. It is safe to say work on the interior of the house can now be done through the colder months keeping the project on schedule for completion by early summer. RISE Ltd. is a source for persons with mental disabilities to live in safe housing with 24-hour staffing. Originating in Elkader in 1982, it expanded to the Oelwein area in 2018, purchasing Alternative Living Corporation’s two five-bed group homes, Curtis House and Frederick House, both on North Frederick Avenue. Residents of Curtis House moved into the first new RISE group home in January 2022, on the corner of East Charles Street and Third Avenue NE. The single story, five bedroom home with attached two-stall garage is completely handicap-accessible and is a vast improvement for residents from their former century-old house. Now, the second RISE home will be a mirror image of the first and will house the residents of Frederick House upon completion. Both building sites for the RISE houses were made possible through the city of Oelwein’s Neighborhood Stabilization Project, whereby dilapidated residences were taken down and lots prepared for new residential housing.

Amidst all of that, she always had time to talk with editors and publishers about matters at the top of their minds.” Patterson Plank is just the third executive director in the 40-year history of the Iowa Newspaper Association, following Bill Monroe (1983–2009) and his wife, Chris Mudge (2009–2016). The INA formed Jan. 1, 1983, when the Iowa Press Association and Iowa Daily Press Association merged. Anselm said the process of hiring the next INA executive director is underway with the formation of a search committee, which be head by Terry Christensen, past president of the INA board. Patterson Plank, who has offered to assist association leaders in the hiring process, stated in her resignation letter, “It has been a great joy to serve this organization.” Cooper, retired executive editor of the Telegraph Herald, Dubuque, is currently writing a history of the INA and its predecessor organizations.

Previewing the Ron DeSantis-Gavin Newsom debate A Democrat and a Republican will debate on prime time cable on Thursday, pitting their governing philosophies against each other in a battle of big ideas, and neither of them is their party’s nominee for president — at least, not yet. The debate between Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, moderated by Fox News’s Sean Hannity, is being billed as “the great red vs. blue state debate.” DeSantis and Newsom lead two of the most populous states in the country and have become rising national stars within their parties. The two governors have a storied history of taking shots at each other on social media and in advertisements antagonizing each other over COVID-19 policies, economic success and various gauges of freedom. The clash looks set up to be political theater at its best (or worst, depending on your outlook). Hannity has compared it to as stepping into “the octagon” for an MMA bout. It’s a matchup of two confident, fiery politicians who have a personal disdain for each other, and it’s sure to make good television. It’s hard to say how much impact the debate will have on the Republican presidential primary. It’s not an intra-party fight, and viewers will probably tune in ready to root for their own team rather than look to be convinced by the force of the governors’ arguments. But there is clear incentive for DeSantis to step into the proverbial ring on Thursday. It puts him center-stage without having to compete for attention with other Republicans, in front of a largely Republican audience that may yet be undecided in their primary vote. The DeSantis campaign argues it is an opportunity to unite Republicans against the Democratic vision for the future. One YouGov poll found that about 46% of those who voted for Former President Donald Trump in 2020 will tune into the debate. Obviously, not all of those people support Trump in the primary, but it puts DeSantis in front of more Republicans who may not have been paying much attention to the primary. It will also be a preview of how he would perform in a debate against President Joe Biden and allows him to contrast his vision of governance more directly with the Democratic viewpoint. Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas who is well versed in running Iowa caucus campaigns, said on Hannity Tuesday night that the debate is an opportunity for DeSantis to give a jolt to his campaign. “He hasn’t been on the stage yet in the debates in which he just walked away with it,” Huckabee said. “His numbers have not moved, if anything they’ve declined since he first got in.” Speaking with an Iowa radio show last week, DeSantis said he wants to contrast his viewpoints with Newsom’s and show Americans the pitfalls of Democratic policies. “I think the American people need to see the contrast because you look at somebody like Newsom, he’s a much more left wing version of Biden,” he said. “He’s joined at the hip with Biden, he likes everything Biden’s done, but he would accelerate the direction that the country is going and that would accelerate our country’s collapse if someone like that were able to get in there.” DeSantis also suggested, as many other Republicans have, that Biden “may not be the candidate” for Democrats in 2024, so Republicans need to be prepared to be running against a figure like Newsom. Newsom has repeatedly said he is not planning to primary Biden in 2024, but he pretty clearly has presidential ambitions. If not this year, events like this help elevate his national brand and lay the groundwork for a potential 2028 run. The debate will give him the opportunity to defend Biden’s record and advance his own vision of the Democratic Party. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has endorsed DeSantis, even previewed the showdown in a column in the Washington Examiner co-written with Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt. The governors wrote that the debate will offer a clear distinction of the choice in 2024. “Will our country embrace the failed Biden-Newsom model, inviting more crime, inflation, regulation, illegal immigration, and far-left social policies?” They wrote. “Or will we follow the DeSantis vision to revive our cities, grow our economy, and support our nation’s families?” Hannity wants a red vs. blue state debate.

Email Submit ← Back Front row pictured left to right: Ryan Reynolds, Ryce Reynolds, and Angela Reynolds. Back row pictured left to right: MACHS Head Coach Brad Elliott, Coach Tiffany Bolles, Coach Melissa Shields, and Coach Daniel Showalter. Ryce Reynolds made his college choice official last Thursday, December 21, signing on to Stanford University at a ceremony surrounded by family, friends, fellow students, and Mount Ayr community high school track and field coaches. Reynolds will head to the San Francisco Bay Area in September, with a partial academic scholarship and partial athletic scholarship to continue his pursuit of record-breaking runs. Reynolds first heard from Stanford University during his junior year, just before the spring track season. They reached out to introduce Reynolds to their athletic and academic programs and express their interest in working with him. At the time, Reynolds was only looking at in state schools like Iowa State University, University of Iowa, and University of Northern Iowa, where both his parents received their undergraduate education. He broadened his search beyond Iowa after the state track season, and talked to roughly eight coaches. “Don’t be afraid to reach out to a coach,” says Reynolds, “There’s no down side to doing that.” Prior to discussing his options with others, Reynolds narrowed down his top four choices to the University of IA, University of Kansas, University of Arkansas, and Stanford, all of which had offered comparable athletic and academic scholarships. Mount Ayr high school track coach Brad Elliott believes the school is a good fit for Reynolds. “With Stanford having an enrollment around 8,000 students, he’s going to get a lot more attention there than he would at larger universities,” said Elliott. Stanford offers close student and faculty interaction and boasts an approximate 5-to-1 student-to-faculty ratio. Ryce credits Mount Ayr Community High School for helping him prepare for his future at Stanford University. “I enjoy being so connected to my coaches, teachers, and community,” explains Ryce, “the small school feel has helped me grow up very humble.” Reynolds made his first visit to tour the 8,180 acres campus and facilities in September of 2023. “He had three months to process everything prior to receiving the phone call,” said his mother, Angela Reynolds, “They had a good conversation, and he accepted their offer before hanging up.” “The opportunity he has to experience both academic and athletic pursuits is unusual,” said his father, Ryan Reynolds, “I’m very excited for him.” According to the U.S. News and World Report, Stanford University has an acceptance rate of just 4%. Admissions officials at Stanford University consider a student’s GPA a very important academic factor. Stanford University is ranked number 3 among National Universities in the 2024 edition of Best Colleges. While Reynolds is confident in the opportunity ahead of him at one of the nation’s most prestigious universities, he has yet to select a major from the seven schools at Stanford, including business, education, law and medicine. Three of Stanford’s seven schools award undergraduate degrees: Humanities and Sciences; Engineering; and the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. Reynolds will be studying alongside students from all 50 states with 36% of students coming from CA, and another 14% from nations outside the United States. According to Ryce, the strong rapport he was able to build with Jarius Cooper, the assistant coach for sprints and hurdles, had a lot to do with his final decision. “I’m excited to go out there and see what he has for me,” states Reynolds, “I’m looking forward to working with the whole coaching team.” J.J. Clark, Stanford’s Franklin P. Johnson Director of Track and Field and Cross Country since 2019, oversees Stanford’s track and field and cross country programs. Jarius Cooper has coached Stanford’s sprinters, hurdlers, and relays since the fall of 2019. A USA Track and Field Level 1 certified instructor, Cooper ran hurdles at University of Florida. Prior to arriving at Stanford, he coached under J.J. Clark at Connecticut in 2019 after six seasons as an assistant at Arkansas State. Cooper’s influence has been substantial, and the proof is in the resurgence of Cardinal sprinting. “Historically a distant dominant track team, Stanford has had recent success in shorter sprint races,” says Reynolds, “one guy just went pro.” In 2023, sophomore Udodi Onwuzurike won the NCAA outdoor championship in the 200 meters and was sixth in the 100. Onwuzurike became the first from Stanford to win an NCAA men’s sprint title since 1963. Onwuzurike’s time of 19.76 in the 200 semifinals was the third-fastest collegiate time in history and a Pac-12 Conference record. Onwuzurike’s 9.92 at the NCAA West Prelims was the 11th-fastest 100 in collegiate history. Athletes coached by Cooper broke numerous school records in 2023. Among them was by the men’s 4×100 relay team, which broke a mark that had stood for 58 years. Maya Valmon twice broke the women’s 400 record and helped the 4×100 team and distance medley relay to others. In all, Cooper’s athletes broke or tied Stanford indoor or outdoor records 18 times in 2023. Both Stanford men’s and women’s teams earned top-four team finishes at the NCAA Track and Field Championships in 2023, a first in the history of the 130-year program.

Throughout his speech, which lasted more than an hour, Trump reiterated his belief that the country only has declined since he left office and that only his reelection can curb that trend. “This is what we must do to restore our country to greatness,” Trump said. “We are a failing nation.” Trump’s words were met with enthusiasm from his supporters, many of whom arrived at Grand River Center early in the morning to get in line to see Trump. For Deborah Kimm, of Amana, Iowa, previous experiences at Trump rallies are partly what drew her to support the president in previous elections. For her, there simply is no beating the energy and excitement that come with them. “He says what he thinks, and he’s honest,” Kimm said. “People who say they hate Trump have never been to a Trump rally.” Throughout the event, Trump touched on a number of issues facing the nation. He said he will improve southern border security, restore the economy by lowering regulations and taxes and end ongoing hostilities between Russia and Ukraine. The former president’s stop also drew some opposition. About 10 protesters gathered just outside Grand River Center. One of those protesters, Tom Ressler, of Dubuque, said he believes Trump is a threat to American democracy. “He’s a criminal,” Ressler said. “If he gets reelected, it will be a disaster.” Prior to the event, the Iowa Democratic Party held an online press conference leveling criticisms against the former president, including his appointment of U.S. Supreme Court justices that eventually led to the overturning of Roe v. Wade, ending federally protected abortion rights. “His stop is a harrowing reminder of how Donald Trump has ripped away women’s freedom to make their own reproductive health care decisions,” said Iowa Sen. Pam Jochum, D-Dubuque. “His extreme agenda against women has rippled throughout this nation, and Iowa women are suffering the consequences.” During the event, Trump took credit for overturning of Roe v. Wade and called it a major accomplishment of his presidency. “For 52 years, people talked, and they couldn’t get the job done,” he said. “I got the job done.” Trump clarified that he believes abortion should be allowed in cases of rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. The remarks came as Trump has drawn criticism from anti-abortion advocates in recent days after he refused to commit to national abortion restrictions and said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ signing a six-week abortion ban was a “terrible mistake.” While Trump touched on the topic of abortion, much of his speech focused on the southern border and illegal immigration. He contended that current border enforcement policy under President Joe Biden has allowed child smugglers and violent criminals into the country. “We have the worst border probably in the history of the world,” Trump said. “Millions and millions of people are probably coming in.” Trump’s speech at the Grand River Center was preceded by a panel on illegal immigration that included Iowa Rep. Shannon Lundgren, R-Peosta, and former U.S. Rep. Rod Blum. Trump also reiterated claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him through fraudulent election practices. Numerous election reviews and recounts throughout the country have found no evidence of systemic voter fraud that would have changed the results of the election in which Biden won the presidency. The former president also claimed he would end the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia on his first day in office, if elected. “I’m on the side of stopping all those people from being killed,” Trump said. “I will prevent World War III.” Attendees of Wednesday’s rally were ecstatic to hear the former president speak. Chris Kindred drove four hours from his hometown of Pawnee, Ill., to see Trump in person.

But this time, lawmakers are pushing their biggest battles to the new year. When Congress resumes work on Jan. 8, they’ll have less than two weeks to fund transportation, housing, agriculture and energy programs by Jan. 19. Then they\'ll have only three additional days with both chambers in session before Feb. 2, when they need to fund all other agencies and avert a government shutdown once again. However, appropriators in the House and Senate don\'t agree on how much they want to spend, gumming up the bicameral work necessary to build and pass a budget. They’ll also have a fight over funding for Ukraine and the border-security policies tied to it. Even as Senate negotiators stay in town to work out a framework deal, divisions remain between both chambers and within the Democratic Party that will make additional aid far from guaranteed. Here\'s what you need to know about Congress\' unfinished business. As part of the debt ceiling agreement brokered this spring, President Joe Biden and then House Speaker Kevin McCarthy agreed to spend $1.59 trillion on the 2024 fiscal year, which began in October. That deal, codified as the Fiscal Responsibility Act, included an additional $69 billion in nondefense spending that was not included in the law itself. Since then, the House replaced McCarthy with Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana. Now, many of the House\'s most conservative members are pushing Johnson to drop the $69 billion they call “gimmicks,"" but which got many Democrats to sign onto the debt ceiling deal. Johnson said earlier this week that House Republicans would stick to the $1.59 trillion but reject the $69 billion, which would cut nondefense spending by more than 9% below 2023 levels. ""The Senate has been projecting and writing well above (the FRA) by billions of dollars. That\'s not what the law says,"" Johnson said Tuesday. ""As the rule-of-law team, we\'re going to follow the law."" That puts the House out of step with both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, where they are more aligned on adhering to the original deal struck between McCarthy and Biden. The short timeframe to work out the differences will make it challenging to meet the deadlines Johnson set in the unique ""laddered"" funding extension approved in November. If they can\'t come to an agreement, Johnson has pledged not to pass another short-term extension. Instead, he will support a ""full year"" extension through the end of the 2024 fiscal year in order to ""refocus Washington on fiscal year 2025."" But that’s not as simple as it sounds, due to a provision of the debt ceiling deal intended to keep negotiations on track: If Congress can\'t pass all 12 spending bills by the end of April, there will be an across-the-board government spending cut. It was originally intended to bring both sides to the table, but new budget estimates show the cuts would disproportionately impact nondefense spending. Johnson has also floated the idea of putting forward a full-year extension that includes some changes that would further hit nondefense spending if the final appropriations bills don\'t have ""good conservative wins."" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Tuesday that Democrats would not support a full-year funding extension because it would trigger painful cuts. ""Get back to the full deal that you cut, that you voted for, and let’s do our jobs,"" she urged Johnson. Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the chief Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, told USA TODAY on Monday that the two sides remained far apart and also urged Republicans to commit to the original deal. ""In the absence of (House Republicans) making a determination to follow the budget agreement the way they did in the Senate,"" she said, ""we are on a trajectory to shutting the government down."" While House members are wheels-up for the holidays, the Senate remains in town as a group of leaders negotiate a border security package with the White House. Earlier this year, Biden proposed an aid package that would include about $60 billion in aid to Ukraine, $14 billion for Israel, $10 billion for humanitarian assistance and $14 billion for U.S. border policies. Republicans in both chambers – who include some skeptical of offering additional foreign aid to Ukraine – said they couldn\'t support the funding without new policies aimed at stemming migration at the southern border, including making it harder for migrants to qualify for asylum and easier to deport people who overstay their visas. Senators of both parties, representatives from the White House and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas have been working to reach a deal on policy changes that could get the funding through the Senate, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York asked the upper chamber to stay in Washington to vote on a shell bill that will carry the supplemental into the new year. However, Republican senators have said they won\'t vote to advance a deal with only a framework instead of a full bill. And Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., a member of the negotiating group, said Thursday that Republicans would not put forward a deal that doesn\'t have the support of a majority of Republican senators. ""It would make no sense,"" he said. ""Similarly, if we had all 50 Democrats vote for it that would be problematic because that means we haven\'t negotiated to a point where it truly is"" securing enough concessions. House Republicans have been insistent that the deal should hew closely to the border security bill they passed earlier this year. A source close to House leadership told USA TODAY that Johnson doesn\'t feel he must take up what the Senate agrees to, but that they are looking for substantive immigration changes that can justify aid that many House Republicans oppose. The debate is coming as battle positions between Ukraine and Russia is cementing and winter is setting in. The Biden administration has warned it is running out of funding to help Ukraine fight off Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s troops. ""We know the world is watching. We know autocrats like Putin and (Chinese President) Xi (Jinping) are hoping for us to fail,"" Schumer said Thursday. ""So we need to try with everything we have to get the job done.""

He said in the letter that he has been unable to obtain a copy despite his requests. Bishop Joseph Strickland of Diocese of Tyler leads a Mass in March 2016 at St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Longview. He stated no mention was made of administrative problems or mismanagement of the diocese as a reason for his Nov. 11 removal. “The reasons given seemed to be related, for the most part, to my speaking the truth of our Catholic faith and to my warnings against anything that threatened that truth,” the letter states. “Mention was made of my not walking alongside my brother bishops as I defended the Church and her unchangeable teachings, and of my not implementing the motu propoio Traditionis custodes, which were I to have implemented, would have required me to leave part of my flock unfed and untended.” “Traditionis custodes” (Guardians of the Tradition) is an apostolic letter issued by the pope in July 2021 regarding the continued use of pre-Vatican II rites.

He has been particularly critical of the pope’s recent meeting on the future of the Catholic Church during which hot-button issues were discussed, including ways to better welcome LGBTQ+ Catholics. The Vatican earlier this year sent in investigators to look into his governance of the Tyler diocese amid reports Strickland was making doctrinally unorthodox claims. It is rare for the pope to forcibly remove a bishop. Bishops are required to offer to resign when they reach age 75. When the Vatican uncovers issues with governance or other problems that require a bishop to leave office before then, the Vatican usually seeks to pressure him to resign for the good of his diocese and the church. But with Strickland, the Vatican statement made clear he had not offered to resign, and Francis had instead “relieved” him from his job. Bishop Joseph Strickland of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tyler kisses the alter before leading a mass at St. Mary’s Catholic Church Wednesday, March 9, 2016 in Longview. In the interim, Bishop Joe S. Vásquez, of Austin was appointed by the pope as apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Tyler. Vásquez said he accepts the “Holy Father’s trust” in him and asked for prayers as he takes on the additional responsibility. “As I continue my ministry as Bishop of the Diocese of Austin, over the next few weeks I will travel to the Diocese of Tyler to be present to you — the clergy, religious, diocesan staff and lay faithful of the diocese,” Vasquez said in a statement. “I am grateful to the staff of the Diocese of Tyler with whom I will collaborate during this transition and interim period. I look forward to meeting you and come with a desire to listen and understand the particular needs of the Diocese of Tyler. According to the Diocese of Tyler, there is no timeline for how long it could be before a new bishop is appointed in Tyler.

It\'s the result of a strong midterm election cycle for the Iowa GOP: Nunn won election to Iowa\'s 3rd District seat in November, ousting two-term incumbent Democrat Cindy Axne. Republican incumbents won reelection to the state\'s other three U.S. House seats. Nunn anticipates Iowa\'s four Republican votes will give the state more power in the House, where Republicans will hold a majority in 2023. ""This is the loudest voice that Iowa is going to have in Washington, basically since the Eisenhower administration,"" Nunn told the Des Moines Register. Iowans also reelected U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley to his eighth Senate term. He will join Republican U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, who has another four years remaining in her term. However, Iowa’s “red wave” was an outlier in the country where Democrats hung onto seats and cling to their control of the U.S. Senate. After two years of a Democratic trifecta, Congress will be divided in 2023, making it harder for either party to push through their priorities. More:The Republican red wave foundered nationally, but in Iowa it swept away Democrats In pre-election candidate surveys, recent statements and interviews with the Register, Iowa’s congressional representatives outlined their goals for the upcoming term: curbing inflation, addressing illegal immigration and promoting the year-round sale of biofuels. They also highlighted potential bipartisan efforts, including bills to lower prescription drug prices and support community colleges. Incumbent U.S. Reps. Randy Feenstra, Ashley Hinson and Mariannette Miller-Meeks each said in pre-election surveys: promoting and legalizing the year-round use of biofuels would be a top domestic priority for 2023. Under current law, higher ethanol blends may not be sold in the summer months due to concerns about increased air pollution. President Joe Biden temporarily waived that standard in 2022 to help combat high fuel prices, but Iowa leaders called for a more permanent change. “I am committed to proving that clean, renewable energy is attainable for every state by using Iowa as a framework to show how it can be done,” Miller-Meeks had said. Hinson argued that focusing on biofuels will help address inflation, which appeared to be soaring before the election. “I am championing an all-of-the-above energy strategy that prioritizes Iowa biofuels to bring down the cost of gas and restore our energy independence while boosting Iowa’s agriculture economy,” Hinson had said. Nunn said his top domestic priority would be addressing inflation and “reducing government interference with our lives.” As he did on the campaign trail, Nunn called for the federal government to mirror Iowa, where the Republican-led Legislature championed tax cuts and a budget surplus. ""It was the number one issue that I heard when I knocked on doors,"" he said. ""It\'s the number one issue that I still continue to get email about."" Meanwhile, Grassley said Friday he was calling on the Biden administration to make a New Year\'s resolution for ""border security."" ""The Biden administration’s border policies are allowing Mexican drug cartels to rule the roost along our southern border. And that has created grievous harm to the social fabric of America,"" Grassley\'s statement said. ""Let’s ring in the New Year with a commitment to stop the humanitarian and drug trafficking crises at our border once and for all."" Ernst also said ""our national security and defense remain top of mind"" as she goes into the 2023 session. ""While we secured a number of strong priorities in this year’s defense package, I’ll continue to push legislation that ensures our military remains the most lethal fighting force on the face of the planet,"" Ernst said in a statement Thursday. More:Republicans appear poised to expand majorities in Iowa Legislature after election red wave Republicans won a slim majority in the U.S. House — a power shift that included Nunn’s flipped 3rd District seat. But with Democrats controlling the Senate and Biden still in office, Iowa’s all-red delegation will need to work across the aisle to get anything signed into law. ""I\'m not naive,"" Nunn said. ""I think it\'s gonna be challenging... but there\'s still a lot of opportunity for good bipartisan work to happen."" Nunn and Grassley had said they were interested in working with Democrats to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Grassley has pointed toward a 2019 bill he sponsored with U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, to cap out-of-pocket prices for medication. That bill passed a Senate Finance Committee vote that year, when Republicans controlled the Senate. It has not advanced since. “Our bipartisan bill would lower costs without harming life-saving cures and treatments the American people expect,” Grassley has said. Miller-Meeks, an ophthalmologist, was also hopeful that lawmakers could find common ground on medical issues. She highlighted a bipartisan proposal to improve protocols for step therapy, a practice that requires patients to try cheaper medications before being prescribed more costly prescriptions. Ernst said she intends to use her role on the Democrat-led Senate Small Business Committee to address childcare shortages. She also emphasized the importance of the annual farm bill, promising to ""prioritize the needs of Iowa’s farmers and growers on the Senate Agriculture Committee."" Hinson said hopes to work with Democrats on community college programs and expanding Pell Grants. Feenstra said he intends to keep pushing for a bipartisan bill to require more price transparency from major meatpacking companies. Katie Akin is a politics reporter for the Register.
