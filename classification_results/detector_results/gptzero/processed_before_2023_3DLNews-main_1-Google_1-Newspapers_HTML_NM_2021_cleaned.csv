Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 8:46 pm Paul Apodaca, 53, has been charged with stabbing and killing Taos County woman Althea Oakeley in Albuquerque on June 22, 1988. Apodaca confessed to the killing this month during interviews with Albuquerque Police investigators, according to a criminal complaint. After 33 years, an Arroyo Hondo family might finally have closure in the murder of Althea Oakeley, a former Taos Fiestas princess and 22-year-old University of New Mexico student who was stabbed to death in Albuquerque on June 22, 1988. A case filed in Bernalillo Metropolitan Court on Thursday (Aug. 19) charges 53-year-old Paul Apodaca with first-degree murder in the long-dormant case. A criminal complaint states that Apodaca was being held in custody on other charges when he told a University of New Mexico Police Department officer that he was the one who killed Oakeley all those years ago. Cold case According to a story published in the Taos News on June 30, 1988, then Albuquerque police spokeswoman Mary Molina Mescall said Oakeley was attacked on 1320 Buena Vista, S.E., not far from where she was living at the time. She had attended a party the night of June 22 with her brother and her boyfriend. After an argument, she left by herself to walk home. According to Mescall, three people heard Oakeley’s cries for help around 8:42 p.m. that night. “The witness said they heard her scream and looked out into the street,” Mescall said at the time. “Then they heard her say, ‘I’ve been stabbed’ and she collapsed.” Oakeley died during surgery at University of New Mexico Hospital from numerous stab wounds to the torso, Mescall said. One witness claimed to have seen the offender. “We got some pretty detailed information,” Mescall said. The eye-witness said the suspect was an Hispanic male, 20-24 years old, five feet seven to five feet nine inches tall, weighing about 140 pounds, medium build with short, dark brown hair. The suspect was said to be wearing a white T-shirt, faded blue jeans and white tennis sneakers with a black stripe down the sides. Despite having a description and a police artist rendering of a suspect at the time, the case went cold for more than three decades – until Apodaca’s arrest this week. Confession A charging document states that the UNM officer who first interviewed Apodaca was suspicious when the 53-year-old began divulging information about the old crime, but after multiple other interviews this month, investigators with Albuquerque Police Department determined that Apodaca’s story matched up with very specific details of the crime. Apodaca said he was working as a security aide at the time at the Albuquerque Technical Vocational Institute (now Central New Mexico Community College), whose campus is .7 miles away from where Oakeley was murdered. When Apodaca saw the 22-year-old walking that night, he said his intention was to rape her, but instead he wound up killing her. He said he had witnessed other men also carry out violence against women, and developed his own “anger” for the opposite sex. He recalled the exact clothing Oakeley was wearing that night: a long denim skirt, a red and white striped shirt and red flat shoes. Apodaca said he followed Oakeley in his vehicle for some blocks before exiting and waiting for her. When she saw him, he said she smiled at him. “That’s, that’s the worst part. That’s the worst part” he told investigators. “I hurt someone that smiles at you.” He'}]"

Got it Due to structural issues with the existing floor inside the Pan American Center, NM State athletics announced Monday afternoon that a new court will serve as the playing surface for the Aggies' men's basketball, volleyball and women's basketball teams for the remainder of the 2021-22 season. In early July of 2021, NM State athletics revealed a new look for the existing playing surface inside the Pan American Center. The updates to the look of the iconic parquet floor inside the Aggies' home were cosmetic in nature and no part of the actual floor was removed or revamped. One month later, in mid-August, officials from both NM State athletics and the Pan American Center were informed of high humidity levels in the Pan American Center which caused the floor to warp and become uneven in certain spots. Pan American Center officials are not able to control humidity levels in the building, which were exacerbated due to a steam pipe that burst inside the building in the summer of 2021. Installation of the rental floor inside the Aggies' home started last Tuesday (Oct. 5) and wrapped up Thursday (Oct. 7). Following the conclusion of the 2021-22 seasons, a new floor will be purchased and installed inside the Pan American Center. In all, a total of three parquet-style floors were used as playing surfaces inside the Aggies' home. The most recent one was installed ahead of the 2011-12 season, replacing the previous one which made its debut during the 1986-87 season. The Pan American Center's original parquet floor graced the facility from its opening in 1968 until flooding damaged it in 1986, necessitating the installation of a new playing surface.

wrapping up my final semester as an undergraduate student, graduating with my Bachelor of Science in environmental science and minor in sustainability studies. I’ve compiled some of my greatest hits because the past three and a half years have been chock-full of enlightenment and enrichment. The University of New Mexico has been an exceptional place to grow up and blossom into my fullest self. I moved to New Mexico from North Carolina to study at UNM without really knowing anyone or anything about Albuquerque, except that it was a beautiful place with lots of sunny days and clear, blue skies. With a fierce passion for amplifying Indigenous worldviews in climate change issues, Julia Bernal is a graduate student pursuing degrees in community and regional planning and water resources at the University of New Mexico. She works to assert diverse perspectives through water management in New Mexico. Bernal, an enrolled member of the Sandia Pueblo, has been a steadfast contributor to efforts concerning the oil and gas drilling in the greater Chaco Canyon landscape, which has been a key focus in her work with the Pueblo Action Alliance. She said her graduate studies at UNM will help give her “some credibility in this attempt to merge grassroots efforts to water management and water planning.” The city of Albuquerque released its heat map findings from the report in late November, compiled by Climate Adaptation Planning Analytics Strategies, a contractor of National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. The study looked at heat impacts on human health through temperature and humidity data points collected on July 9, 2021. Kelsey Rader, the city of Albuquerque's sustainability officer, said this report was an opportunity to evaluate how existing infrastructure was supporting active and public transportation users. The study produced results showing a temperature difference of nearly 17 F from the hottest to coolest parts of the city. Rader said this is a call to action to manage this discrepancy through tree plantings, which has a dedicated budget with the city. Over 200 educators in New Mexico, from early childhood teachers to college professors, signed a letter calling on the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association to stop using disingenuous public campaigns to promote more oil and gas development. These educators want the expansion of revenue sources and lessened dependence on the fossil fuel industry in the state. “It has been extremely disappointing to watch the oil and gas industry and its allies use educators and students as props in campaigns against progress on climate and clean energy policies,” read a Nov. 30 press release sent by lobbying and public relations communications specialist Charles Goodmacher. Though she got her start in microbiology in her undergraduate program, University of New Mexico professor Amy Farnbach Pearson now studies medicine through the humanities lens. She seeks to broach conversations on how disease presents in societies and what it means for patients perceived to be afflicted. Farnbach Pearson joined the Honors College team this year, an environment that has been historically welcoming to interdisciplinary conversations and out-of-the-box curricula. She’s a temporary part-time professor teaching “Tuberculosis to COVID-19: What is Health?” this semester, which is one medium she uses to have conversations on how Western societies have and continue to respond to diseases. President Joe Biden announced on Monday that his administration will block federal oil and gas leasing within a 10-mile buffer zone around Chaco Canyon, a sacred Indigenous site in New Mexico. A two-year ban on leasing will be enacted in the coming weeks, which will enable the Bureau of Land Management to conduct environmental analysis and public comment. They will then consider a 20-year withdrawal of drilling on public lands in the region. “The Department of the Interior Secretary Deb Haaland is basically pushing the Bureau of Land Management to do a full environmental assessment of the region, in terms of its impacts relating to oil and gas,” Julia Bernal, director of Pueblo Action Alliance, said. The recognition of successful women in STEM continues with eyes on University of New Mexico alumna Kate Anderson, chief of staff for energy systems integration at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a sector of the U.S. Department of Energy. This year, Anderson is the recipient of the C3E Social, Economic, and Policy Innovation Award, which recognizes women in clean energy. “There are not a lot of women in clean energy … but there should be,” Anderson said. “An award like this helps because it helps people see themselves and see that, ‘Oh, that’s something that I could do too,’ and not just view it as a man’s field.” President Joe Biden’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill was approved by the U.S. Congress in early November and signed into law on Monday, Nov. 15. The bipartisan law, H.R. 3684, is climate-focused and uses a dynamic approach to dispersing funding, with money going to highways, wildfires, electric buses, water and other related projects. New Mexico’s apportionment of the law is $3.7 billion, which will seek to invest in and address vulnerabilities of the state’s water, highway and bridge infrastructure, among other key ventures. University of New Mexico Professor Claude Morelli, scholar of transportation planning and policy at UNM, said the largest cut of New Mexico’s share, $2.5 billion, is going toward highway development. $255 million in the infrastructure package will also address bridge needs across the state as super storms have undermined bridge foundations, causing the collapse of bridges and necessitating more maintenance, according to Morelli. The Environmental Protection Agency released guidance for tightening methane regulations in early November proposing a series of protections to mitigate the impacts of the oil and natural gas industry nationwide. This comes due to methane’s critical role in advancing the warming of the atmosphere, with emissions having the potential to trap about 80 times as much heat as carbon dioxide in the first 20 years following the initial emissions release. To cut down on the methane waste products associated with oil and gas drilling, the EPA seeks to codify actions that would force states to fix leaking production wells and eliminate venting of natural gas for new and existing sites, according to the agency. With a lifelong commitment and passion for protecting public lands in hand, University of New Mexico senior Kai Hollenberg embraces the challenges of conservation. As a biology major with a focus in conservation who serves as the president of the UNM Wilderness Alliance, her ongoing work with the U.S. Forest Service and National Park Service as well as opportunities to address pressing environmental concerns across the country has prepared Hollenberg for a life of service in the conservation sector. “When I think about how much time the average human spends working, I really want it to be for something I believe in,” Hollenberg said. “Conservation and the health of our planet is definitely at the top of that list for me.”""}]"
