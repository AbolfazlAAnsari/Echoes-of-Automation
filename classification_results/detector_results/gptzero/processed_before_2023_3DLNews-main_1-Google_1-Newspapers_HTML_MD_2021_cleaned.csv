River ran aground near Chesapeake City — injuring all six occupants, including two who were flown to a regional trauma center in helicopters, according to Maryland Natural Resources Police. “Alcohol is suspected in this incident. However, charges have not been filed, as this investigation is still ongoing,” Lauren Moses, a NRP public information officer, reported in a written update late Sunday night. Also on Sunday, Moses alleged that the boat was traveling about 40 mph when it crashed into land, not approximately 60 mph — information that the agency initially released on Saturday. In addition, included in that update, Moses reported late Sunday night that a total of six people were aboard the vessel when it ran aground, four of whom received medical treatment for minor injuries. Maryland State Police helicopter crews flew the other two to University of Maryland’s Shock Trauma Unit in Baltimore, where they were treated for non-life-threatening injuries, according to Moses. One of the people who had been on board the vessel was reported missing at the crash scene, triggering a massive search by the U.S Coast Guard, the Cecil County Department of Emergency Services and area volunteer fire companies, according to Alec McLennan, chief of the Chesapeake City Volunteer Fire Company, which was at the scene. The search on and along the Elk River in and around the Port Herman community off Town Point Road, south of Chesapeake City, involved fireboats and CCDES drones equipped with infrared imaging, in addition to emergency workers scouring the land on foot, McLennan reported.

This article has been updated. Efforts to revitalize and reenergize the economy of Indian Head recently garnered an award from the International Economic Development Council. In an Oct. 7 release, Charles County announced that the College of Southern Maryland’s new Velocity Center and the revitalization of Indian Head had garnered a silver rank award in the category of real estate development and reuse. The award was officially presented to the Charles County Economic Development Department for facilitating the changes that are taking place in and around the town. “It’s not often that projects get that sort of recognition, but it’s extra special when you’re talking about the Velocity Center project where all levels of government came together to formulate and make it happen,” Indian Head Mayor Brandon Paulin said. The Velocity Center is a 13,000 square foot building on Indian Head Highway constructed by CSM, which opened its doors last year. The center was opened as part of a partnership with the Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head Division, according to the information page on the College of Southern Maryland website. In a conversation with Southern Maryland News in June, College of Southern Maryland President Maureen Murphy called the center a “catalyst for economic development for Indian Head.” The center has already hosted events in partnership with Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head division, as apart of center’s mission to be “a place of innovation, learning and collaboration for academia, the Navy and the community,” according to the information page on the website. Over the summer, the velocity center hosted the “Wargame for Innovation and Frontline Improvisation,” which was put on by Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head Division and funded by the Office of Naval Research and the Technology Transfer Office. The event, held this past July, brought together technology developers, military officials and acquisition experts to simulate different war fighting concepts. According to a release from Naval Sea Systems Command, the event brought together three teams composed of naval scientists, engineers and active duty sailors and marines to engage in different scenarios centered around a fictional conflict near the Philippines in 2025. “The scenario was developed not just to be solution-based, but to also raise awareness of the climate between U.S. allies and China in the South China Sea,” the release read. In addition to holding war games, the Velocity Center also has a has a permanent tenant, the Energetics Technology Center, which provides engineering and data analytics services for government, academics and private industry. The Energetics Technology Center signed a five-year lease agreement for 3,000 square feet of space last November. The U.S. Bomb Technician Association, which established an office in Indian Head early this year, has also announced plans to partner with the Velocity Center for events. According to a press release on the U.S. Bomb Technician Association website, the group signed a memorandum of understanding with the College of Southern Maryland in June to bolster economic growth in Charles County. The signing comes after the association announced in November plans to redevelop the former site of the CVS Pharmacy on Route 210 into the Maryland Technology and Training Campus. The campus, which sits across the street from the Velocity Center, will be a multi-use facility and house non profit organizations, academic institutions and other industrial concerns in support of the Naval Surface Warfare Center.

Brown, a former Calvert sheriff’s office deputy, and his wife died in an ATV crash in Arizona. The Calvert County Sheriff’s Office reported Friday that a former deputy and his wife were victims of an all-terrain vehicle crash last week in Camp Creek, Ariz. Scott and Laura Brown, both 44, were residents of Owings and the parents of three children. According to the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office, on Wednesday, Aug. 18, at approximately 3:50 p.m. deputies received a call about witnesses seeing an ATV RZR “floating and tumbling down the flooded Camp Creek wash area.” During this time deputies were also rescuing multiple individuals in the same area. Arizona has what it calls a “monsoon season” every summer where parts of the state experience heavy rainfall. In Maricopa County, a flash flood warning had been issued around the time the Browns embarked on their ATV ride. It appeared all of the parties had been accounted for until later that day when the agency received a call from a local rental company advising they had an ATV RZR (an abbreviation of the word “razor”) “that was rented and not returned, which was in the same area as the rescue,” Maricopa authorities reported. Deputies conducted an intense search of the area with no results. On Thursday morning the search resumed and the Browns were located deceased still inside the RZR. The Maricopa sheriff’s office is continuing to investigate the incident. Scott Brown joined Calvert’s sheriff’s office in October 2004. He left the local agency in January 2011 to become a federal agent. While with the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office, Scott Brown served with the patrol and criminal investigations bureau and was also a member of the special operations team. “Brown always served with honor and dignity,” said Sheriff Mike Evans (R) in a statement released Friday. “He will be remembered for how he loved his family and community, and how he cared deeply for those he served with.” Twitter: @MartySoMdNews Get any of our free email newsletters.

eNewspaper Trending: The Tudor home remained filled with the couple’s shared possessions — books, eclectic art, musical instruments — but suddenly felt achingly empty.Shelby French knew she had to move after she discovered that her husband of 18 years, 49-year-old Justice Department lawyer David Pehlke, took his life in their second-floor bedroom late in the evening of Easter Sunday this year.In shock and running on instinct, French, 52, a clinical social worker, closed the bedroom door. She never spent another night in the room, retreating with the couple’s 13-year-old son to the first-floor living room to sleep on couches and air mattresses. Within months, she sold their beloved but now forever tainted, century-old Silver Spring home and moved two decades’ worth of the couple’s belongings to a new home in neighboring Takoma Park.She brought their black-and-white wedding photos, a painting they had purchased of a whimsical dragonfly, the Boggle game that had become a pastime, and his collection of guitars and banjos.But she entered her new world without a lifeline they’d hoped to never need.On the advice of a financial adviser, the couple each took out life insurance policies in July 2019 to provide security in the event of a family tragedy.Both policies included a “suicide exclusion” common to life insurance but that French — supported by her congressman, Jamie Raskin, whose 25-year-old son, Tommy, took his life last New Year’s Eve — considers anachronistic and needlessly cruel.The clause specifies that the company won’t pay benefits “if the insured commits suicide” within two years of the policy’s issuance. Instead, the beneficiary receives a refund of the paid premiums plus interest, which for French would mean a few thousand dollars compared with $2 million for herself and her son. To Raskin, the exclusion seems to reflect a view of suicide that has been overtaken by a contemporary understanding of depression as a serious disease. His son left a farewell note that said: “Please forgive me. My illness won today. ”“I do believe there is something off about the underlying assumption that someone would purchase a life insurance policy in order to commit suicide and have the proceeds go to their family,” the congressman said. “Shelby is raising a truly important issue for everyone to look at.”Standard in the insurance industry, suicide exclusions are intended to protect companies from people who may have financial incentive to kill themselves. Maryland, like most other states, allows the exclusions but limits them to two years.Lincoln National Life Insurance Co., which issued Pehlke’s policy, told The Baltimore Sun it “understands that the loss of life carries with it financial implications for the deceased’s family and does pay beneficiaries policy death benefits in cases of suicide following the 2-year exclusionary period.”Lincoln National declined to comment on French’s case, citing privacy considerations. It said the exclusion generally “helps balance price affordability with prudent risk management and strengthens claims paying ability for all customers.”Companies also deny benefits for other reasons, such as dangerous or criminal behavior, or when a claimant lies about their health status.Opposition to the suicide loophole comes from diverse quarters.“It’s not like they’re burning their house down for the insurance money,” said University of Louisville law professor Timothy S. Hall, who has written in opposition to the clauses. “My sense of this is that right now we are making our mistakes on the side of denying coverage to people who did nothing that is morally blameworthy.”The American Psychiatric Association doesn’t have a position on the insurance policy restrictions. But Columbia University psychiatry professor Paul Appelbaum — a former association president — considers it “very unlikely” that many people are motivated to end their lives for an insurance payout “in a premeditated way.”“And the reason for that,” he said, is “suicide is almost invariably an impulsive act.”Interviewed in her new home — where three of Pehlke’s guitars rest against the living room wall and his faded Chicago Cubs cap is displayed on a shelf — French said she has tried to gather any available clues to piece together the mindset of her gentle 6-foot-4 husband, who seemed to love being part of their small family. Shelby French kept her late husband’s beloved Chicago Cubs cap and displays it on her living room shelf.Old videos and Polaroid photos show him clowning with her and their friends, playing with the dog, and — nine years ago — lifting his son over his head to position the star on their Christmas tree. “What do you think? Want me to straighten it a little bit?” he says to the boy.Pehlke was working on a noir mystery novel when he died. French is contemplating trying to finish it, imagining it might feel like a joint project.“I could probably interpret the rhythm of where he was going,” she said.She said he was never diagnosed with an underlying medical condition that could have contributed to suicide.French told claims investigators he didn’t see a therapist. She said he walked 20,000 steps on most days.“I can guarantee that in July 2019, David was not thinking of suicide,” said French, referencing the month the policy was issued. “It wasn’t David who said we need more life insurance. It was the financial adviser.”But French said his outlook may have worsened in the isolation of the coronavirus pandemic.“He was telling me he was depressed a couple weeks before. There were indications of feeling overwhelmed at work,” she said. “But warning signs of impending suicide weren’t there.”As he often did on Sunday evenings, Pehlke volunteered on Easter to drive to pick up dinner for the family at a nearby grocery store.Receipts show he also stopped at a hardware store, located in the same shopping plaza as the Whole Foods, and purchased the tools he used in his death. She still has flashbacks of finding him.“This is why I’ve come to the conclusion that this was extraordinarily impulsive,” French said.As a claims investigator reviews her case, French said she is certain she will be denied because she wrote plainly in a required affidavit that “My husband died by suicide at our home,” and because his death fell — by three months — within the exclusion period.French, who has worked internationally designing programs for vulnerable children and youth, said she has enough money to make ends meet but wants to help others avoid the “re-victimization” of enduring a loved one’s suicide, followed by an insurance denial.She is beginning an informal lobbying and education campaign with the goal, she said in a planning document, of compelling the life insurance industry to thoroughly consider “the new and constantly updated information about what we know about depression and other mental health issues that contribute to the act of suicide.”French concedes that “a small number” of people may attempt suicide to try to funnel money to family members.That’s why she says she doesn’t favor eliminating the suicide exclusion, but rather shortening it to a period — she hasn’t determined exactly how long — that reflects how quickly self-harm can arise and doesn’t treat suicide “like fraud.”The National Alliance of Life Companies, a trade group representing life and health insurance companies, declined to comment on the exclusion.Insurance wasn’t an issue in the case of Raskin’s son. But the congressman said he would like to help French, though he’s not yet sure exactly how.“I don’t pretend to be a psychiatrist or psychologist,” the former constitutional law professor said. But, he said, “it would be a great thing to have a serious legislative discussion about that rule and whether the line is drawn in the appropriate place.”Since the suicide of his son — a Harvard law student — Raskin, 60, has said he wants, in any way he can, to ease the stigma still associated with depression.French said the insurance industry’s treatment of suicide perpetuates old notions of mental health issues as moral failings.Suicide rates rose 33% between 1999 and 2019 before falling slightly the past two years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although there is disagreement over the cause of the increase, many researchers cite an increasing lack of community or family connections. While suicides haven’t gone up during the pandemic, there have been alarming trends such as a rise in attempted suicides by adolescent girls that is widely attributed to isolation from teachers, friends and other traditional forms of support.French and many other insurance reform advocates prefer to say “died by suicide” instead of “committed suicide” because they say the latter sounds akin to a crime.“I hope we’re at an age where we can look at these things through the lens of science and public health rather than criminal law and moral judgment,” Raskin said.He said it gives him hope that, since Tommy’s suicide, he and his wife, Sarah, have received more than 15,000 letters from people not only offering sympathy but “talking about their family’s situation and what they’ve been through.”Last June, Raskin appeared at a news'}]"

According to a news release, Nancy Cordes, CBS News chief White House correspondent, will emcee the live presentation at 5 p.m. Friday, May 7. The presentation will include the official release of the 2020 River Report Card and a question-and-answer session with the Choptank, Miles-Wye, Chester and Sassafras riverkeepers. The event is free and does not require a Zoom account; register at shorerivers.org/events. Maryland’s Eastern Shore waterways are negatively impacted by excess nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment runoff from residential, commercial and agricultural properties, the release states. Seasonal flares of bacterial contamination pose risks to human health. ShoreRivers conducts the only comprehensive water quality testing and monitoring of these and other pollutants in local waterways, according to the release. The 2020 Report Card reflects the results of these tests throughout four watersheds that span more than 1,650 square miles of the middle and upper Eastern Shore. With data collected by four professional riverkeepers and citizen scientist volunteers, the Report Card provides a science-based approach to water quality analysis that fuels action, the release states. “The state of our rivers is in our hands,” said ShoreRivers Executive Director Isabel Hardesty. “Good water quality and equitable, easy access to our rivers depend on the actions of our communities; the science tells us where to start. The State of the Rivers event is designed to welcome everyone to the conversation.” Headline topics for the event will include tributary and overall river grades, regional river health trends, strategies to clean local waterways and a discussion of equitable accessibility. Participants will be able to ask questions of their riverkeeper in breakout rooms. In a special highlight of the event this year, ShoreRivers will honor Nick Carter with its Award for Environmental Stewardship in recognition of his transformational accomplishments. After 35 years of service to Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources, Carter is renowned for his spectrum of influence on Chesapeake Bay policies and his singular, moral voice for all woodland and wildlife, the release states.

Directed by Elizabeth Rohm, the film premiered on Oct. 23. A post shared by Justina Machado (@justinamachado) “Switched Before Birth” follows Olivia Crawford (Skyler Samuels) and her husband Brian (Bo Yokely), who stretch themselves to financial limits after multiple failed in vitro fertilization (IVF) trials and miscarriages. While going through her latest round of IVF, Olivia meets and becomes friends with Anna Ramirez (Machado), who is struggling to have a child after years of focusing on her successful restaurants. “I really don’t have a formula for this,” Machado said in a joint interview with her friend and the film’s director, Elizabeth Rohm. “I’m always looking at the character. And I really could relate to what she had to offer. Anna Ramirez loved everything that was going on in her life. The only thing she couldn’t deal with was what she couldn’t have. We all know what that feels like.” When Olivia and Anna become pregnant, they both celebrate and prepare for their babies’ arrival. But Anna suffers a devastating miscarriage and struggles to move forward, while her marriage to restaurateur Gabe Ramirez (Yancey Arias) crumbles. A post shared by Elisabeth Rohm – Artist (@elisabethrohm) When Olivia and Brian finally welcome their twins, Olivia feels her life is complete. But the couple’s world is turned upside down when they discover one of the babies is biologically Anna and Gabe’s child, who had been implanted into Olivia by mistake. Pitted against each other, Olivia will do anything to keep the baby she delivered, while Anna will stop at nothing to bring her son home. “Justina just kills it as Anna,” said Rohm. “People don’t know how we have our miracle babies. … I think this movie will do a lot to help people understand what is possible in this modern age.” “This powerhouse was also the director. I’ve acted with her,” said Machado pointing to her friend. “Elizabeth is a talented lady. As for me, I just dig into the script. It is so much fun to be able to be this character and truly show what she is going through.” The actor and director might work together on another project. Rohm hinted that she and Machado may team up again to reboot the 1980s police drama “Cagney & Lacey.” Justina Machado Co-Stars in Lifetime’s Drama ‘Switched Before Birth’ was published in collaboration with LatinHeat Entertainment.

will be coming to Maryland in April. CHESTERTOWN — The “American Pickers” are returning to Maryland as they plan to film episodes of The History Channel television series in April 2021. “We understand that with the proliferation of COVID-19, we are all facing very uncertain times. We at American Pickers are taking the pandemic very seriously and will be following all guidelines and protocols for safe filming as outlined by the state and CDC,” said producer Sarah Perkins in a news release. “While we plan to be in Maryland this April, we will continue to re-schedule if conditions change for the worse. Regardless, we are excited to continue to reach the many collectors in the area to discuss their years of picking.” “American Pickers” is a documentary series that explores the world of antique “picking.” The show follows skilled pickers in the business, as they hunt for America’s most valuable antiques. They are always excited to find sizable, unique collections and learn the interesting stories behind them, the release states. According to his biography on the “American Pickers” website, Mike Wolfe has been searching for hidden treasure since he was 4 years old. “Where other people see dilapidated barns and overgrown yards, Wolfe sees the beauty of long-lost things and the stories of the people who made them, used them and somehow saved them,” it states. Picker Frank Fritz worked for many years as a fire and safety inspector but always had a passion for antiques and junk, his biography states. He is known to get carried away by anything with an engine. Shop manager Danielle Colby is a lover and collector of all things vintage, her biography states, adding that she is drawn to anything that tells a story. As they hit the back roads from coast to coast, the pickers are on a mission to recycle and rescue forgotten relics. Along the way, the pickers want to meet characters with remarkable and exceptional items. They hope to give historically significant objects a new lease on life, while learning a thing or two about America’s past along the way. The pickers have seen a lot of rusty gold over the years and are always looking to discover something they’ve never seen before. They are ready to find extraordinary items and hear fascinating tales about them. Pickers only pick private collections. So no stores, malls, flea markets, museums, auctions, businesses or anything open to the public, according to the release. The “American Pickers” TV Show is looking for leads and would love to explore your hidden treasure. If you or someone you know has a large, private collection or accumulation of antiques that the pickers can spend the better part of the day looking through, send your name, phone number, location and description of the collection with photos to american pickers@cineflix.com or call 855-OLD-RUST.

Trees were selected based on the requested 15-foot or 20-foot height. “It’s nice to see the trees,” said Commission member Pete Cosby. “Is it possible to get any on the east or west side or is that not possible to fit in?” Eugene Dvorchak, senior engineer at MDM Surveyors & Engineers, responded that there is a storm line that runs down one side where there is some grass, which connects the rear stormwater management system to the stormwater management system in the front of the property. “The day after our previous meeting for this site plan approval, Mr. Dvorchak, he reached out to our stormwater engineer, EA Engineering, and myself, and the three of us talked about it and they found a way to put these trees in in the front that will still satisfy stormwater requirements and the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) and it does not interfere with view lines for State Highway for U.S. [Route] 50,” said Dave Engelhart, Berlin’s planning director. Murphy submitted two color variations for review – a gray color scheme or a beige, earth-tone color scheme. “Auto Zone’s first choice is the gray color scheme,” he said. Murphy also discussed the architectural changes made from the first site plan, including four faux windows, three different roof height variations, a decorative cornice on the roofline and pilasters that protrude from the main building made with split face block. He added that the parapets have always been incorporated in the design. “I’ll just say, Kevin, thank you for making all the changes. It looks great,” said Commission member Austin Purnell. “I know it was some extra work on your guys’ end and a delay from last time, but it looks great. I like it, and I’d say go with the earth-tone. That’s my opinion.” The commission members favored the earth-tone option. The Auto Zone project passed unanimously with Commission member Ron Cascio and alternate David “DJ” Lockwood absent. Responding to Murphy, Engelhart said the project does not need to proceed for approval from the Berlin mayor and Town Council because the planning commission approves site plans. Engelhart added that the mayor and council would only be involved if the project involved annexation.'}]"
