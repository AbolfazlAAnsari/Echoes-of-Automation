She’s working on her doctorate in Irvine, Calif., but helped her father, Victor Delgado, get a vaccine close to his home in Benton County, Wash. “In my own personal experience, it’s been very complicated,” she says. “Working around schedules of essential workers but then also making sure that, OK, he can’t travel too far, he can’t go all the way to Yakima on a work day, that would be just too far.” Across the Northwest, many Latinx families are facing similar barriers to getting vaccinated and other issues. Adding to the complexity is powerful misinformation on social media and by word-of-mouth, the recent health concerns over the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and religious reasons for vaccine hesitancy. Ultimately, Delgado did get her father an appointment in Grandview. But she had to wake him up at 11 p.m. to tell him about his appointment the next day. “It’s been complicated to navigate all that stuff,” she says. “Trying to keep up with two different states with two different counties.” Although it’s gotten easier to access shots for farmworkers with clinics that stay open longer, and on weekends, Delgado says it still would have been complicated to get her farmworker father a shot if he didn’t have her help negotiating the technology, the timing and the language. Now, public health officials are scrambling to vaccinate migrant farmworkers who follow the crops into different communities throughout the growing season. Hours and transportation Farmworkers were approved to be vaccinated in Washington in mid-March. But many farmworkers don’t have their own transportation. Nor do they have the time off work to wait in line for a vaccine appointment after working one or sometimes two jobs. “They may be out in their environment of work by sunrise, and they’ll do a day’s work. Then in the evening they’ll move on to their second job, go home and sleep and do it all again the next day,” says Heather Hill, a nurse and the communicable disease program manager for the Benton-Franklin Health District, covering Washington’s Tri-Cities region. “Oftentimes this is up to six days a week. They just do not have the time in their work day to go to a clinic somewhere in town. That’s why it is so important for us to meet them at the worksite.” Benton-Franklin Health District recently started and is increasing mobile clinics in the fields, orchards and produce packing sheds. But Hill says the agency is still not reaching everyone. Farmworkers are also moving into and out of different communities following the crops. Most of them work in the Northwest in June, July and August. So vaccinating people where they are at will be a top priority throughout the season -- not just a spring endeavor. “It’s so important for us to understand the life of the person we’re trying to reach, and make sure we fit into it,” Hill says. “Rather than try to have them fit into what we’ve already set up in town.” Last year there were several COVID-19 outbreaks in agricultural communities, especially in August. Hill says they’re trying to avoid that same scenario this year. Child interpreters Even if the shot is accessible, many people are skeptical about taking it. Delgado says that initially her father didn’t want it. She had to look up medical information and talk to him before he was willing to take it. “I remember in the beginning he was a little hesitant about it,” she says. “He said it was done way too fast, and we don’t know the side effects yet. It was me getting the shot, and other people getting it, too, that made him feel more comfortable.” Delgado explained to her father that the side effects were very rare and that the vaccine helped stave off hospitalizations and death with COVID-19, especially since in his mid-50s, her father was near the higher-risk group. Delgado is a Ph.D candidate in sociology at the University of California, Irvine, where she studies the interactions between children and their immigrant parents. She says many times it takes children convincing their parents to get the vaccine. “Sometimes, you don’t know all the answers,” she says. “Sometimes, I see others too, say ‘I don’t know, but I’ll get back to you.” That strategy requires many children to research and Google the answers to complex questions, Delgado says. “This is work that millions of (children of immigrants) here in the U.S. are doing in order to make sure that their parents get the best resources that they can,” she says. As a result, children are often acting as interpreters and advocates to get shots in the arms of their parents and extended family. Fear and misinformation Some fear of vaccines is rooted in truth. In the past, vaccines given to children in Mexico used large needles that hurt and left permanent pock marks on their arms. Latinas haven’t always had a choice over their medical procedures. Many people remember the women who weresterilized in California without their knowledge and a now famous lawsuit brought by four of those women in the 1970s. But another barrier to getting vaccinated is fear, fueled by misinformation. The Latinx community is coming off Trump administration policies and rhetoric that targeted farmworkers, South American migrants and those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status. Vaccination clinics run by uniformed National Guard can be frightening to families whose members have a mix of legal status. Many times, families need clarification that they won’t get in trouble. “OK, you’re not going to get in trouble if you go get the vaccine,” Delgado says. “Especially on the heels of an administration that was much more punitive to undocumented families. Those are things that (children of immigrants) had to clarify within a climate that has been very hostile toward Latinos and immigrant families.” In Yakima, St. Paul Cathedral even asked the National Guard not to wear uniforms to make Latinx parishioners more comfortable for a vaccination clinic held there. Religious reasons Many Latinx people are also reluctant to get the shot for reasons of religion -- primarily because they believe it’s against their Catholic faith. But church leaders, like Father Jesùs Mariscal and Bishop Joseph Tyson — both of the Diocese of Yakima — want to be sure their parishioners get vaccinated. At Easter, a special clinic was set up after the traditional services. Many Catholics have concerns with the stem cell lines developed from abortive tissue that have been used to develop or produce the vaccine. Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson have all used fetal material in testing vaccines. Johnson & Johnson is the only one of the three to use stem cells in the production of the vaccine as well. But none of the three contain fetal material. Nancy Jecker, a professor of bioethics at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, says the issue of vaccines and stem cells is very complex. “But my bottom line is that I respect the right of anyone to refuse a medical procedure,” Jecker says. “And I think we need to have exceptions for those who on religious grounds are not wanting to go forward with any of the vaccines that are currently available.” She says there is a lot of pressure in the U.S. to get vaccinated. “This country has said we’re in a race.

Yet, in general, WDFW staff recommend using disposable gloves for handling any wildlife carcass and to avoid harvesting or consuming animals that are visibly ill. “This is the first documented instance of this disease in Washington since the last outbreak in Goldendale in 2017,” said Kristin Mansfield, WDFW veterinarian. “At this point, the disease appears to be localized to the San Juan Islands.” Signs of deer with AHD include rapid or open-mouth breathing, foaming or drooling from the mouth, diarrhea, weakness, and emaciation. Fawns are most commonly affected, but all ages of deer are susceptible. Death can occur within three to five days from the time a deer is exposed to the virus, although not all infected deer die. Cases of AHD typically peak in midsummer and taper off in the fall. There is no known cure or treatment for the virus. AHD is transmitted by direct contact between deer, making it more likely for the virus to spread in areas with high deer concentrations, Mansfield said. “For that reason, we ask people not to concentrate deer by providing feed or water for them,” she said. “That is the best way we can help minimize the spread of this disease.” People in the San Juan Islands who see live or dead deer with signs of AHD are asked to report their sightings online through the reporting link on WDFW’s wildlife diseases webpage, wdfw.wa.gov/species-habitats/diseases. Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife works to preserve, protect and perpetuate fish, wildlife and ecosystems while providing sustainable fish and wildlife recreational and commercial opportunities. Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife officials confirmed that AHD is behind an increase in reports of sick and dead deer across San Juan and Orcas Islands and suspect additional cases on Lopez Island after receiving laboratory results completed at the Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory at Washington State University. The disease is specific to members of the deer family and is not uncommon in other states, including Oregon where outbreaks occur every year.
