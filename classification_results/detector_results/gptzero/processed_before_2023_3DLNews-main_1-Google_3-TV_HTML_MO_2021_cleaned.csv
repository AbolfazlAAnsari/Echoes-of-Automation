He went on to say, ""And didn’t have the guts to do it in daylight, but only under cover of darkness so you could hide. You’re scum. And we won’t be intimidated."" Hawley is one of at least a dozen Republican senators and more than 100 House members that have announced they would object to the electoral votes certified in as many as six states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin. The Associated Press reports these are the same states where President Donald Trump and his allies were unable to overturn election results based on unsupported claims of widespread voter fraud. Not all members of the Republican party are on board with this plan, however. Congresswoman Ann Wagner on Monday said she will not be joining Hawley and other Republican members of Congress in formally disputing the results of the election. Rep. Wagner from Missouri\'s Second District released a statement Monday to share her perspective saying she took a ""solemn oath before God and Country to \'support and defend the Consitution of the United States\' and that she has ""faith"" in the nation\'s legal process and believes in the rule of law.

She went on to say that allowing Congress to alter the outcome of the election would ""irreparably"" damage the nation\'s system of government and ""defy"" the Consitution. Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska issued a pointed rebuke last week of GOP attempts to object to the Electoral College tally of the presidential election, warning colleagues against a ""dangerous ploy"" that could damage the nation\'s civic traditions. Sasse posted a lengthy explanation of his views on social media, including a paragraph by paragraph dismantling of allegations of voter fraud in key states won by President-elect Joe Biden, the Associated Press said in a report. Sasse said he felt compelled to speak ""truth"" as constituents and those supporting President Donald Trump wanted to know where he stands on the issue. ""I will not be participating in a project to overturn the election,"" Sasse wrote. He said he wanted to explain ""why I have been urging my colleagues also to reject this dangerous ploy."" In a Facebook post last Wednesday, Sasse wrote that he couldn\'t ""simply allege that the College Football Playoff Selection Committee is \'on the take\' because they didn\'t send the Cornhuskers to the Rose Bowl, and then – after I fail to show evidence that anyone on the Selection Committee is corrupt – argue that we need to investigate because of these pervasive \'allegations\' of corruption."" And, one of Hawley\'s longtime supporters and a former Missouri Senator, John Danforth, this week called the effort to challenge Biden\'s election victory a ""radical"" and ""highly destructive attack."" The written statement from the 84-year-old three-term Republican senator was especially stinging since Danforth has long been a supporter of Hawley. Danforth publicly backed Hawley\'s successful runs for Missouri attorney general in 2016 and the Senate in 2018. Those on board with objecting to the election results include Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Steve Daines of Montana, John Kennedy of Louisiana, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Mike Braun of Indiana. The group of Republican House and Senate members is preparing for a final challenge of the election results during a joint session of Congress on Wednesday. The Associated Press explains this will be the last chance for members of the GOP to formally dispute President-elect Joe Biden\'s victory before he and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are inaugurated on Jan. 20.'}]"
