Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 5:48 pm CHARLES TOWN — American Public Education Inc., the parent company of American Public University System, announced recently that it has completed the acquisition of Rasmussen University. “We, at APEI, are excited to now serve the approximately 18,000 students at Rasmussen University, who are fulfilling their purpose,” CFA, SVP, Chief Strategy and Corporate Development Officer Steve Somers said. “This includes the nearly 8,500 Rasmussen nursing students who are building careers in health care and addressing the nation’s critical need for new nursing professionals. The additional of Rasmussen University alongside APEI’s Hondros College of Nursing means that APEI is now collectively the No. 1 provider of pre-licensure nursing education, with nearly 11,000 nursing students. “Opportunity to purpose one’s purpose and a focus on student success is at the core of APEI’s mission, and this acquisition furthers that mission. Providing affordable and relevant higher education is a top priority, whether that’s in cursing, cybersecurity, STEM or business, and we are intently focused on career training and degrees that provide pathways to employment and career advancement.” Rasmussen is a nursing and health care-focused institution, with both an in-person and virtual presence. According to a press release from APEI, on a trailing 12-month basis, as of June 30, 2021, nursing represented $200 million of revenue and almost a third of APEI’s total revenue. Rasmussen added more than 8,000 additional students to the 2,300 already served by Hondros. The acquisition nearly doubles APEI’s revenue to approximately $600 million and angles to student population to be roughly one-third military and veteran students, one-third nursing students and one-third online adult learners for more than 110,000 total students. Giving opportunities to nursing students when there’s such a critical need for skilled workers in the field is a great step for APEI. “At a time when there is a critical ongoing nursing shortage, we are committed to supporting learners who aspire to become nurses,” Somers said. “The Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that there will be 175,000 nursing job vacancies annually in each of the next several years, and we are excited by the role that APEI will play in fulfilling that important societal need. “Our newly combined company now has 30 campuses in eight states, giving APEI that largest nursing campus footprint in the country. We are predominately focused on creating new nurses through our pre-licensure programs that lead to students being able to sit for the NCLEX licensing exams.” Rasmussen will continue to operate as a separately accredited institution, led by Tom Slagle, who has been the CEO since 2010 and driven the university’s focus on nursing and growth over the last 11 years. The institution is 120 years old, offering a mix of online courses with on-campus labs and clinical experiences. All APEI institutions take pride in serving nontraditional students who juggle personal and professional responsibilities, including many first-generation college students.
