They started the process in January 2006 and the first issue came out March 9, 2006. The original address for the newspaper was 318 S. Lincoln Avenue in downtown Lakeview, Michigan. Dana started doing production and layout and advertising design. Rich Boomer (Dick’s son) and Kim Boomer (Dick’s daughter-in-law, the wife of his other son, Chris) were the first advertising sales persons. Dick Boomer handled the finances. The first week in April 2006, just four weeks after the first newspaper was published, Linda Huckins started writing for the newspaper. Linda was transplanted from out east with a journalism degree and lots of newspaper and magazine experience. “My dream has always been to open a small-town newspaper, but I didn’t have the capital,” she said. “When I walked into the Lakeview Area News office, I knew I was home. Working there was the next best thing.” That same week, there was a death in the Keilholtz family. Linda volunteered to cover the front desk at the office so Dana and Dick could attend the funeral, and she has been with the newspaper ever since. Dana needed some time off to help her husband grieve and Linda agreed to fill in. After a few weeks, there was a shift in responsibilities. Linda took over production and layout and handled editorial issues and writers as well as doing some of the writing herself. Rich and Kim had to leave the newspaper because of other obligations, so Dana then concentrated on selling and designing ads. As the paper grew in popularity, the job became too big for Dana to handle alone. Lisa Jensen took over some of the ad design responsibilities and Pam Hufford came on board as a sales person. The 29” broadsheet design was too large and cumbersome. It was decided to switch to a smaller 25” size, which most local newspapers use. At the same time, they switched printers to Pioneer Press in Big Rapids. Robin Ward came to work for the newspaper when Dick Boomer owned the paper and she stayed on working for Dana and Linda. Robin put in many long hours proofing and editing the paper as well as performing layout duties. It was during those years that she developed the Ruffs by Rosco column expressing the world through the eyes of her faithful dog, Rosco. Robin still writes that column, and it is one of the newspaper’s most popular features. Our many thanks to Robin for her dedication and support of our newspaper. Within a year, the newspaper expanded coverage into Six Lakes, Remus, Blanchard, Edmore, Howard City, Amble, Stanton, Sheridan, and other areas surrounding Lakeview. The response has been overwhelming. Several local people wrote weekly or bi-monthly columns, others willingly submitted articles on a regular basis, and others submitted story ideas. In October 2007, Dana and Linda bought Dick out and took over the newspaper as partners. The newspaper then became the Lakeview Area News, LLC. They continued running the paper until February 2010 when Dana bowed out and Linda became sole owner. By this time, Pam Hufford no longer worked for the paper. Two other ad representatives joined the staff – Julie Camp and Kristina Marsh. Linda hired other office and layout staff as well. Two are still working at the newspaper – Sandy Dean, who is office/billing manager and ad designer, and Kelly Wright, who is layout editor. In September 2011, Linda sold the newspaper to the current owners, Gerald (Jake) Kinsey and Charlene Kinsey. The name stayed the same, except it no longer is an LLC. Linda stayed on as Managing Editor for a couple years to run the day-to-day operations, and the Kinseys handle the business end. Linda retired in 2014, but she continues to write articles and helps in other ways. The first issue under the Kinseys’ leadership came out September 15, 2011. Shortly after buying the newspaper the Kinseys started renting their current office space in the Lakeview Family Chiropractors building at 960 S. Lincoln Ave in Lakeview. 960 S.

La Salle and his ship, Le Griffon. The Griffon, built in 1679, sank that same year somewhere in the Great Lakes. Divers and shipwreck enthusiasts from all over have spent years trying to piece together clues from the ship’s last days to find where it had gone down, but with no luck. “And I was sort of in a daydream, but I was thinking about the ship, like most young kids, boy or girl, would do,” Libert said. “And (the teacher) walked right alongside me, put his hand on my shoulder and said, ‘Who knows, maybe someone in this room will find it one of these days.’ Being the most famous shipwreck in the Great Lakes, the search for the Griffon has inspired several local underwater explorers, including Valerie van Heest of the Holland nonprofit Michigan Shipwreck Research Association, whose work on the search was featured on “Expedition Unknown” on the Discovery Channel. More: More: Local explorer joins Josh Gates in search of Griffon Over the centuries, there have been more than two dozen claims of discovery, but all of them have been proven wrong. ibert, a 67-year-old Charlevoix resident, believes he has found the final resting place of the Griffon in Lake Michigan. The discovery of a colonial-aged shipwreck was made in 2018, and the recent publication of a book detailing Libert and the Great Lakes Exploration Group’s findings has renewed interest in the enduring mystery of the Griffon. “The research started 40 some years ago,” Libert said. “Actually diving was (started in) like 1981. Everything\'s been documented for a book and it\'s taken a lot of years to search for it.” The Griffon was built in 1679 above the Niagara Falls. When the ship launched in August 1679, it was the largest ship on the Great Lakes. It began its journey into those lakes and was last seen that September, when La Salle and most of the crew disembarked at islands near the entrance to Lake Michigan\'s Green Bay, and the ship was sent back to Niagara with six men aboard. The ship was not seen again. Libert — who retired as a senior intelligence analyst with the chief of U.S. naval operations — and his group first made a discovery connected to the Griffon in 2001 when Libert bumped into something while swimming. “I didn\'t know what it was,” Libert said. “I thought it was the bowsprit and the reason I thought it was is because I really couldn\'t see, but I knew whatever I bumped into wasn\'t any anchor line. It was hard. … But I did put a marker on it. And we came back the following year.” However, Libert and his crew ran into legal trouble with the state, which has strict requirements and permits for removing materials from the lake bottom. Litigation dragged on for 12 years, involving the state, tribal governments, the federal government and the country of France, which claims ownership of the Griffon. Once the legal matters were settled, the Great Lakes Exploration Group launched a major expedition in 2013 with U.S. and French archaeologists at the site where Libert believed the bowsprit was located. The search received widespread news coverage at the time. However, the resulting excavation showed the bowsprit was not connected to a ship’s hull as originally thought. Other pieces of timber were also recovered at the site, but not a full wreck. “Once we excavated, we found out that it wasn\'t connected to a ship,” Libert said. “So I thought, ‘Well, how can this be wrong?’ But that\'s just the way the science goes.” Libert added that the chief underwater archeologist for France told him that he believed they would find the ship somewhere near the 2013 excavation site. “He says in all of his experience that when a ship that age goes down, usually all the rigging comes off of it first,” Libert said. “And the ship ends up miles away before it actually sinks or disappears. He says, ‘I think you\'re going to find a ship within four miles from this bowsprit.’ Well, he wasn\'t too far off. It was exactly 3.8 (miles).” During a period of ill health that kept him out of the water, Libert decided to continue looking for the ship using satellite imagery. “My wife always said, ‘You know, you need to look where the historic records says it is. Look in the shallow water.’ She\'s been saying that for 20 years,” Libert said. “‘I said, there is no ships going to be in the shallow water. So why am I going to waste my time?’ Well, I should have listened, because sure enough.” Libert found something that looked like a ship, although when he sent the images for analysis archaeologists said it looked like a tree branch. “So that question mark was there, and then it took another couple of years before I could get my health back in the condition to go diving on it,” Libert said. “And I was determined that I\'d be the first one to dive on it, but I had to get the go ahead from my doctors.” In 2018, Libert arranged to dive at the new site he had seen in the satellite images. Initially hampered by bad weather, a dive on Sept. 10, 2018, revealed a shipwreck. “It was the best day I think I’ve ever seen out there,” Libert said. “It was so calm, and I didn\'t even have to dive on the ship. I could look at it and see it.” Following decades of research, dives and delays due to litigation and health concerns, Libert said he felt elation and relief looking at the wreck. “I think it\'s just a lot of tension and pressure,” he said. “We\'re talking 40 some years, not only looking but the litigation aspect, it really just drained me of energy and financial resources.” While diving at the shipwreck, Libert looked for artifacts, but didn’t find any. “And I\'m thinking, ‘Well, what\'s happened?’ You have to remember, this is a 342-year-old ship, so I can\'t find them,” Libert said. “I can\'t find any artifacts, but I don\'t know enough about ships to know exactly how old this ship could be. I just know what I was not finding is not anything modern, no threaded bolts or nuts.” Libert knew he had discovered an old ship, but he turned to Al Pertner, a shipwreck interpreter from Charlevoix, to help determine just how old. “(Libert) had a series of amazing pictures that soon as I saw those pictures, a guy like me right away knows that this is old and very, very old — not a little bit old like me, but extremely old,” Pertner said. “We\'re talking several hundreds of years old, and built in the old way.” In analyzing photos, Pertner identified key elements that pointed to the ship’s age. For example, there was no sign of modern fastenings. Everything was hand forged. As a naval architect, Pertner also analyzed the shape and size of the wreck and its related pieces to develop a set of lines for the boat. “And so I came out with a ship just the size that the Griffon should have been,” he said. Libert called the Griffon both the “holy grail” and the “most sought-after vessel in the Great Lakes.” If the wreckage examined in 2018 is the Griffon, it would be the oldest shipwreck to have been found in the Great Lakes, predating the HMS Ontario, a British warship which sank in Lake Ontario in 1780. The HMS Ontario wreck was found in 2008. ""Different divers have been looking for (the Griffon) for a very long time, and it’s been reported, \'We found it,\'"" said Sean Ley, development officer for the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society. ""But then again, you have to have proof about that."" Libert said not much is known about the history of 17th century vessels because they deteriorate over time. But wrecks found in cold, fresh water — like the Great Lakes — are preserved better than wrecks found in warm, salt water. “What you have to understand is a lot of ships, early ships, we don\'t know what they look like,” Libert said. “Why? Because they\'re 300, 400 years old in the oceans. They disintegrated, basically, most of them, unless they\'re buried and then when they\'re buried, you can\'t find them. Or you don\'t find the whole ship. In this particular case, most of the ship’s here because it’s in cold water and fresh water.” Both Libert and Pertner said the shipwreck evidence pointing to a specific size and shape of the ship, along with how the ship was constructed, fits what is known about the Griffon. The Griffon would also have been the only ship of that size and age to be in the Great Lakes at that time. “The French'}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 10:07 pm The parents of Guadalupe Moreno could not have known, when they named her in honor of Our Lady of Guadalupe, that she would someday become a Sister and a servant of the Church and of God. According to Moreno, Guadalupe is the source of spirituality and prayer, “embedded in our hearts and collective memory of the people of the Americas. Many Hispanic families have immigrated to the United States carrying the image of Guadalupe in their hearts.” Moreno has lived into her name throughout her life and ministry, providing spiritual and practical guidance for those she serves, and praying always for their needs. Born in Tampico, Tam, an important port in the Gulf of Mexico, she was the oldest of 8 children and grew up in a home where education and Christian values were a priority. Her personal call to the convent came when she was just completing high school at age 17. “I had visited religious communities and in one of the spiritual retreats, (I was) reading the Gospel of John when Jesus called his first disciples (1, 43-45) and He said ‘Follow me.’ (This) just made an impact on me and (I) began to think: What if God is calling me to serve him? I thought about it for two years and I made my decision. I wanted to dedicate my life to God.” Moreno describes this decision as exciting and joyful. “It was like an adventure, a discovery of a new life,” she recalls. She had heard stories from the religious Sisters, about the places where they had lived and the adventures of missionary work. “The nuns always were very kind persons. They were young, looked very happy and full of enthusiasm. They were my inspiration. I wanted to be like them.” She joined the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio, Texas. They are dedicated to make the love of God, as shown in the Incarnation, a real and tangible presence in the world today, with missions in Mexico, Peru and the United States. She studied for several years to prepare for the ministry and holds a master’s degree in psychology and pedagogy, receiving certificates to teach in elementary and high schools and to serve as a principal. Moreno has served in Mexico, as an elementary teacher in Torreon Coahuila, as principal of an Elementary School in Tampico, Tam for five years, and in San Luis Potosi for two years. She later taught Spanish for three years at Our Lady of Guadalupe in San Antonio, Texas, which is a bilingual parochial school, before returning to Mexico as principal of the Normal School Instituto Miguel Angel in Mexico City, preparing students to teach elementary school. Moreno’s next call was to work at the National Office of Education for Private Schools, where she stayed for three years. “It was (a) very exciting job organizing and giving courses, conferences, and seminars (and) participating in (the) Congress of Education at (the) Latin-American and global level,” she recounts. With this extensive experience, one might well wonder what brought Moreno to rural Hart. The story is that she had free weeks during the summer while working in education, and Father Ted Kozlowski, Director of what is now the Hispanic Ministry of the Diocese of Grand Rapids, invited her to come and serve with the ministry of reaching out to communities of migrant farmworkers. “This was an unknown world for me,” she recalls. “I always lived in big cities. Now I discovered the magnificence of the northern woods, the roads with a very few cars and beautiful roadside scenery, the panoramic view of large areas of land, the farms with their large variety of vegetables and fruits, the freshness of the produce and the hard work of the migrant farmworkers. My job was to provide pastoral services to the migrant farmworkers’ families.” In doing this work, she came to realize how essential these farmworkers are to the rural economy. The Diocese of Grand Rapids had a holistic program for Hispanic families and specifically for migrants so, she continues, “I visited the families, got to know them, and I was a channel to provide services for their needs.” She learned that migrant families came to the north in search of work to support their families, and in this pilgrimage, they are also in search of God. “The migrants are people of great faith in God, very family-oriented, with great values and a great sense of community. I just fell in love with this job.” After she had volunteered for two summers, Father Ted invited her to work year-round, and in 1986, she agreed to come for one year. Ultimately, she spent 33 years in this ministry, working as a coordinator for the Diocese in Hispanic Ministry and later as Assistant Director in the counties of Oceana, Mason, Newaygo, Lake and Muskegon, with an office at St. Gregory Catholic Church in the center of her activity in Hart. She worked with the local priests and networked with the West Michigan Migrant Resource Council and other agencies to provide services for Hispanic families and migrant farmworkers, recruiting volunteers, creating several groups, and training them to give a variety of services in the parish and in the migrant camps, including the teaching of the catechesis, bringing jackets, blankets and other necessary items to the camps, and holding a prayer service. When visiting the migrant camps, she provided information about Spanish church services and programs the parish offers for them. “Their faith in God is ingrained in their culture,” Moreno explains. “They trust their Church. For them I am the messenger of God.” In addition, she started a weekly program at St. Gregory’s, using volunteers. It provides formation, creates community, and gives an opportunity to socialize, including a meal for all the family, as well as prayer, singing and religious classes. “I am impressed with the desire and openness of the families to learn about God and the Bible, and the relationship they have in their lives with God,” Moreno emphasizes. She has now operated this program for 20 years, except for last year because of Covid-19. When she retired from the Diocese of Grand Rapids in October 2018, Father Tom Bolster, then pastor of St. Gregory, invited her to work part-time for the Parish in Pastoral Care, though she says, “Working in ministry is not (a) part-time job.” But she adds, “I appreciate and enjoy the trust of the people who ask for services, and I feel very pleased and fulfilled serving the Hispanic community.” She describes the last year as a sad chapter, and relates that, like many of us, she lost people she was close to, knew and served to the virus. As she explains, “The frustration for me it is that I was not able to visit the family, console, and pray with them like I usually do in this difficult time.” Despite her long service, Moreno still has goals for the ministry going forward. She hopes to better integrate the Hispanic Community in the life of the parish and society, to reaffirm the baptism call of adult Hispanic parishioners at St. Gregory’s and share the healing love of God for humanity. She also wants to share the faith that is the heritage of Hispanic ancestors, and the hope that their lives and futures can be improved. To accomplish these goals, she will recruit, train and support volunteers for programs and activities related to Hispanic Ministry. “These goals are very ambitious (and) do not happen in one month or year, but I believe (this) is the foundation for their lives now and for the future,” Moreno declares. Finally, Moreno shares that she has never regretted becoming a Sister, because she says, “I am sure it is what God wants me to be, and I feel privileged to be called by God to serve him and his people. I enjoy the work. It is richly rewarding.” The Herald Journal mobile app brings you the latest local breaking news, updates, and more.

Though they offered few specifics and little evidence, their claims represent the culmination of months of warnings and frustrations over the cozy relationship between some prominent Republicans and the violent fringes, including white nationalists, animated by lies about voter fraud and a stolen election. A week after the Capitol was stormed by a pro-Trump mob, Democrats did not directly name GOP lawmakers they suspected of being involved, citing ongoing investigations. Some suggested rioters seemed too good at navigating the building\'s hallways and pointed out that there were unusually large groups of visitors the day before. Black lawmakers, who have long warned of nationalist rhetoric from some in the GOP and the Trump administration, said they weren\'t surprised that many of those who raided the Capitol belong to right-wing hate groups and waved Confederate flags. The violence left at least five people dead and dozens more arrested. “From the highest office in the land, Donald Trump provided white supremacists, right-wing extremists, and conspiracy theorists validation and free reign to spew hatred, bigotry, and racism, and yes – commit extreme violence,"" Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said in a statement Wednesday when she voted to impeach the president a second time. ""Last year, he gave an order to the Proud Boys to ‘stand back and stand by,’ and that – they did."" Other members of the Congressional Black Caucus raised the specter of being targeted during the riot. One lawmaker was missing an iPad from a discreet office. Another said the panic buttons in her office had been ripped out before the riot. Offices throughout the Capitol were ransacked, so it is unclear whether there is other evidence that Black lawmakers were targeted. The suspicions come as staff and lawmakers inside the Capitol were left rattled by the violence that forced them to retreat to secure locations within the building. Once the ideal of secure government, the Capitol is now a fortified complex and crime scene as authorities try to pick up the pieces of the Jan. 6 insurrection. Lawmakers who normally roamed the halls are now met with a substantial National Guard presence and metal detectors before entering the chambers. At least one federal agency, the Inspector General of the Capitol Police, launched a wide-ranging investigation into last week’s security failures, according to a congressional aide familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak on the record. It’s unclear whether investigators will look into the potential role of insiders who may have helped the rioters. Other agencies that have been contacted by lawmakers, including the Government Accountability Office and the two sergeants at arms, have not confirmed whether they’ve opened any formal investigations. Some lawmakers questioned how insurgents knew where to go when they breached the building. Maps of the layout of each floor inside the Capitol are easily located on the internet, and some mark the House speaker’s and other leaders\' offices. Jane Campbell, president and CEO of the U.S. Capitol Historical Society, said that while the bowels of the building can be confusing to navigate even for staff, the main areas penetrated on Jan. 6 are not difficult to locate. “Once you’re in the building you could find the chambers and you could find the speaker’s office,” she said. “That’s pretty well-marked."" Still, there is sentiment among some Democrats that their Republican colleagues in Congress played a role in the violence, at best by inciting the mob into action or, at worst, by providing them access to the building. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y, speaking in support of Trump\'s impeachment Wednesday said the ""accomplices"" in the House to the rioters ""will be held responsible."" Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a former U.S. Army captain, last week requested a wide-ranging investigation – that includes reviewing actions of congressional colleagues – by Comptroller General Gene Dodaro, who leads the Government Accountability Office. In a letter co-signed by 107 House Democrats, Crow asked the agency to review the “impact of rhetoric by government and elected officials that contributed to or led to the insurrection” as well as “efforts by government and/or elected officials to limit preparation, coordination, or response, particularly regarding the use of force and arrests.” Chuck Young, a spokesman at the Government Accountability Office, confirmed the agency received Crow’s request but said it has not launched an investigation yet. “It still needs to go through our formal review process before decisions are made,” he said in an email, noting that the GAO does not usually duplicate efforts by other investigators. Some Democrats have raised questions about groups of visitors that came to the Capitol complex the day before the riots. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., along with over thirty of her fellow lawmakers, wrote to the Capitol Police and both the House and Senate Sergeants at Arms demanding investigations into colleagues she said led people through the Capitol on Jan. 5 in what she termed a ""reconnaissance for the next day."" Her request was directed by letter to the acting House sergeant at arms, acting Senate sergeant at arms and United States Capitol Police, citing ""suspicious behavior and access given to visitors to the Capitol Complex” before the riot. “This is unusual for several reasons, including the fact that access to the Capitol Complex has been restricted since public tours ended in March of last year due to the pandemic,"" she wrote. Sherrill, a Navy veteran, said that her office contacted the Sergeant at Arms before the riot to raise concerns about the tours. USA TODAY attempted to contact both Sergeants at Arms for more information about any possible investigations, but neither has replied. In multiple conversations with reporters, Sherrill has declined to name who exactly may have signed those visitors into the Capitol building. U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-FL, said he did not see anything like what Rep. Sherrill alleged. ""Congresswoman Sherrill\'s claims of a criminal conspiracy by unnamed members of Congress is startling and hard to believe,"" Buchanan said. ""If she has evidence that a member of Congress conducted \'reconnaissance tours\' to help the rioters plan last week\'s attack she needs to release it immediately. I saw nothing of the kind when I was on the House floor that week and would be shocked to learn it was true."" According to guidance sent out to members of Congress from the Office of the Attending Physician and the Sergeant at Arms at the beginning of this Congress’ session, the Capitol and its visitor center are closed to all tours. But members of Congress and their staff routinely flout such rules and can still have ""official"" business visitors. Sherrill, in a follow-up interview with northjersey.com, part of the USA TODAY Network, maintained that ""there\'s no way those groups could have gotten into the Capitol without a Member of Congress or a staff member of a member of Congress,"" though she declined to name individuals, citing an ongoing investigation. She said that on a Wednesday conference call between Democratic members of Congress, some members had raised concerns that members of color had been targeted. ""The group appeared to have targeted certain members of congress, especially prominent members of color,"" she said. ""Some of these members relayed that they have offices that are hard to find."" One member of the Black Caucus, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., said her office’s panic alarm system had been ripped out before the riot. “Learning that those panic buttons and panic alarms had been removed from my office was certainly unnerving,” she told CNN Thursday. “There is an investigation underway. So I can’t say more than that.” Another member, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), said last Sunday on CNN that rioters went to his ""unmarked office"" in the Capitol where he does most of his work rather than his office in one of the Capitol office buildings, so to him, it ""indicates that something untoward may have been going on."" Bennie Thompson, D-MS, wrote on Facebook last week, condemning those that incited the violence. ""To all those who were complicit (elected officials & cabinet members),"" he said, ""You all supported this foolishness for 4 years and benefited from it. You don\'t get to excuse yourself now and pretend to be blameless."" Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa., said when Sherrill raised concerns about the tours it “rang a bell for me” because she witnessed a group of six to eight visitors on a tour in the Capitol’s tunnels ahead of the Jan. 6 riot. She couldn’t recall whether it was one or two days before. “It was noticeable to see people getting tours from congressional aides in the Capitol because that hasn’t happened since Covid struck,” Scanlon said. “There are rules that we’re not supposed to be giving those tours and we’re not supposed to'}]"

Curtis: Unpublished Alaska, the Lost Photographs Sept. 16 through Jan. 9, 2022. This first-time public showing features images made from recently discovered original negatives by Edward Sherriff Curtis. Unpublished Alaska features over 100 images along with excerpts from the personal journals of Curtis and his daughter, Beth Curtis Magnuson, describing their harrowing adventures in the Bering Sea. On June 8, 1927, Curtis, accompanied by daughter, Beth, and newly employed Stewart C. Eastwood, set sail on the steamer ship Victoria towards Nome, Alaska. The purpose of their voyage was to complete the photography and research for the final, 20th volume of Curtis’ masterwork, The North American Indian. Begun in 1898, The North American Indian was the defining passion of Curtis’s life, an attempt to record, in writing and photography, the lives of the indigenous peoples of the southwestern, western, and northwestern United States. This trip, planned for a single season, would be the final voyage to complete his epic quest. Curtis took hundreds of images on his journey, only part of which were published. The rest sat, unseen, passed down through the family until today. This exhibition accompanies the 2021 publication of the complete journals by Curtis’s descendants John and Coleen Graybill in the book Edward Curtis: Unpublished Alaska. The book is available to purchase at the MMA Store or by phone at 231-720-2580. The event will include a reception at 5 p.m.; book signing at 6 p.m. and a lecture at 7 p.m. The Graybills will visit the MMA Thursday, Sept. 16 to sign books and to give a lecture as part of an exhibition opening event. The event is free and open to the public. Reservations are not required. The MMA is open 11 a.m. – 5 p.m. daily, 11 a.m. – 8 p.m Thursdays, and closed Mondays.

Mich. — A local Republican organization has censured Rep. Fred Upton for a second time this month, after Upton voted with Democrats to strip a controversial GOP representative\'s committee assignments. The Cass County GOP voted Tuesday, Feb. 23, to censure Upton, R-St. Joseph, for his decision to vote with Democrats to strip Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, on her committee assignments. Greene lost her assignments on the House Education and Labor Committee and the House Budget Committee earlier in February following a House vote. Upton and 10 other Republicans sided with Democrats over Greene\'s musings about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi being assassinated, the possibility of Jewish-controlled space rays causing wildfires and the taunting of school-shooting survivors. The Cass County GOP had already censured Upton earlier in 2021 after Upton sided with Democrats to impeach former President Donald Trump. Other local organizations, including the Allegan County Republican Party, have also censured Upton. The Macomb County Republican Party has called on the state organization to censure both and Rep. Peter Meijer, R-Grand Rapids, who also voted for Trump\'s impeachment but did not vote to remove Greene from her committees. In its resolution to censure Upton, the Cass County GOP wrote Greene\'s loss of committee assignments was ""unfair."" ""We believe Congressman Upton’s vote is a betrayal of his oath of office and core values of the Cass County Republican Party,"" the resolution stated. ""We believe this vote was not cast in accordance with the voice of the voters of Cass County and against our interest."" On Twitter, Upton defended his decision and criticized the Cass GOP, saying its defense of Greene\'s comments was inappropriate. THREAD: Tonight, the Cass County GOP censured me for voting to remove Marjorie Taylor Greene from the education committee, and in their resolution they stated that ""her comments have not been out of line with anyone else\'s comments."" Really? More: Fred Upton votes with Dems to strip Marjorie Taylor Green of committee seats More: House impeaches Donald Trump a second time, Meijer and Upton vote in favor ""Tonight, the Cass County GOP censured me for voting to remove Marjorie Taylor Greene from the education committee, and in their resolution they stated that \'her comments have not been out of line with anyone else\'s comments.\' Really?"" Upton tweeted. ""She taunted a Parkland school shooting survivor, argued that California wildfires were started by a Jewish space laser, accused Democratic politicians of running a pedophile ring out of a pizza parlor, and questioned whether 9/11 really happened. ""Does the Cass GOP really think someone like that represents Republican values and should be serving on the education committee? I served on that committee and met with Columbine school shooting survivors. I have since met with Parkland and Sandy Hook School shooting survivors and heard all of their personal stories. She should not be on the education committee, and Congress was right to remove her, period."" The Cass County GOP meets on the fourth Tuesday of each month. Cass County GOP Chair Mark Howie did not respond to a request for comment. Upton has represented the area comprising the modern day Sixth Congressional District since 1987. The Sixth District includes all of Berrien, Cass, Kalamazoo, St. Joseph and Van Buren counties, and includes most of Allegan County.'}]"

Low 56F. Winds light and variable.. Cloudy skies. Low 56F. Winds light and variable. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 10:08 pm TRAVERSE CITY — A video recently released by Canadian oil company Enbridge has elicited both criticism and condemnation from Indigenous leaders in Michigan. Tribal leaders and activists from across the state contend the video, produced by a consultant and posted to the company’s website, appropriates Anishinaabek practices to gain support for the company’s controversial pipeline operations in the state. All five tribes with treaty rights near the Straits of Mackinac oppose the 68-year-old Line 5 pipeline and its proposed tunnel-enclosed replacement. They assert that this is a violation of their protected hunting and fishing rights. They cite threats to those rights from direct damage via oil spills, as well as climate change from the cumulative effects of fossil fuel use. The United Tribes of Michigan, with membership from 11 of the 12 federally recognized tribes in the state, also passed a resolution opposing continued flow of oil through the Straits. The video called, “Seeking peacemaking with Michigan tribes,” was produced by 7th Legacy LLC, a consulting firm operated by two GTB citizens, Desmond Berry and Kris Ingrao. Up until 2019, Berry directed the tribe’s Natural Resource Department and had been a prominent voice in calls to shut down Line 5. His departure to start a business and immediately serve Enbridge as a client shocked and upset tribal leadership and activists. Critics say the video is an attempt to make it seem that the company has buy-in from Native communities via an appropriated and misused version of peacemaking. “Peacemaking is a bit of a fantasy when you’re also simultaneously engaged in taking anti-tribal, anti-environmental positions in numerous forums around the country,” said John Petoskey, a citizen of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTB) and associate attorney with the Environmental Law and Policy Center. He pointed out that state and federal decisions on Enbridge permits and projects legally require tribal consultation, and the company would have to show evidence of consultation during any court reviews. “It’s a litigation tactic. It’s a way that Enbridge can say it engaged with tribes in a genuine way,” said Petoskey. Enbridge and the state of Michigan are entangled in several court disputes about the fate of the dual Line 5 pipeline, which was placed under the environmentally sensitive Straits of Mackinac in 1953 following an agreement (easement) between the company and the state. In November, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered the revocation and termination of that easement — effective May 12 — while giving Enbridge the same deadline to decommission the pipeline. Enbridge is fighting that order in court to keep Line 5 operating, and has made it clear it will not shut down the pipeline unless Michigan secures a court ruling that gives Whitmer’s directives legal backing. The video Berry’s firm produced for Enbridge emphasizes the values of reconciliation and commitment to resolution as part of the Anishinaabek peacemaking process. Berry’s daughter, Kristen, is one of the speakers, alongside Tony Davis of the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians. “Native Americans are the original peacemakers,” Berry says in the video. “A council of elders was called to preside over meaningful conversations that included both parties engaged in the conflict, as well as the entire community,” she continues, describing what would traditionally happen when conflict arose in Anishinaabek communities. “These discussions would continue until both parties were able to effectively communicate their issues and find a peaceful resolution,” says Berry. The Anishinabek Caucus of Michigan responded to the video with a statement calling it a “misleading representation” of Tribes’ positions on Line 5. “Enbridge recently posted a video implying that the 12 federally recognized Tribes of Michigan are open to ‘starting the journey and the possibility of reconciliation’ concerning Line 5 via traditional peacemaking,” the statement reads. “This is false.” Aaron Payment is chair of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians and president of the United Tribes of Michigan. “Misuse of our cultural concepts is cultural appropriation and is patently offensive. Enbridge is hereby instructed to stop!” Payment said in the release. 7th Legacy did not respond to a request for comment. The video disappeared from Enbridge’s website shortly after Indigenous mapmaker Aaron Carapella asked for its removal on Sunday. “Your company has illegally utilized my map in this video about 2 minutes in,” Carapella’s email to Enbridge reads. “Please remove it immediately. Not removing it may make you subject to legal ramifications” In a statement, Carapella told the MichiganAdvance and Traverse City Record-Eagle his maps were “not intended to bolster the perspective of giant corporations,” and he has requested that Enbridge never use his maps again. “This is a perfect example of why their position is manipulative and disingenuous,” Carapella added. The video was reuploaded Tuesday with a different map of tribal nations to replace Carapella’s version. Petoskey said peacemaking is a process used frequently in tribal courts in situations like domestic disputes and is intended to reduce incarceration. It does not translate to abdication of one side, which is what he believes Enbridge is trying to promote with the video. He noted that one of the baseline assumptions in peacemaking is first, “the abuse must stop”. “[And] they’re never going to give up the Great Lakes tunnel, they’re not going to give up on Line 3, they’re going to keep Line 5 running through reservations in the 1842 Treaty territory, and they just have no intention of conceding on any of that. And so it certainly is a bastardization of the process,” Petoskey said. “It’s just super puzzling as to why some think that engaging with the company in this way is going to be effective,” he continued. Nathan Wright, a citizen of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, said he initially noticed Carapella’s map being used in the video and brought it to his attention. Wright is a core member of MackinawOde, an Indigenous water protection group that protests Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac, and addressed the video in a post on their Facebook page. “It is disgusting how low they will go,” he wrote. “They even displayed a sacred pipe in the video. That in itself is bad medicine...that can come back to haunt you. Not by people but by spirits and karma.” He said MackinawOde has no desire to sit down with the company. “We do want their dangerous decrepit pipeline out of our sacred waters,” he wrote in the post. “There is no peacemaking with a destructive entity that goes against all our cultural teachings.” GTB Chairman David Arroyo called the video “vastly inappropriate” and “insulting.” “The only video I’d like to watch from Enbridge is if it was footage of them shutting [Line 5] down,” Arroyo said. Arroyo added that he thinks Enbridge commissioned the video to demonstrate goodwill in the public eye, but the result is the opposite in his view. In a statement before Enbridge reposted the video, spokesperson Ryan Duffy said the company is “committed to peacemaking with Michigan Tribes and their citizens.” “Enbridge’s understanding of Tribal values has increasingly grown over the years. … As described in the video, peacemaking requires a significant effort, yet with strong processes and commitment, reconciliation can occur. We are in the process of updating the video, and it will be back online as soon as possible,” Duffy said. He did not respond to a question Wednesday about why the video was reuploaded, nor did he address criticism levied by those who feel the video is manipulative and appropriative. The video is just one part of a larger media blitz Enbridge has undertaken in order to promote the Line 5 tunnel project and support the current pipeline. The company has spent at least $863,341 on television ads in 2021 alone, according to public cable buy information compiled by the liberal nonprofit group Progress Michigan. Enbridge’s associated group, “Great Lakes Michigan Jobs,” has also spent more than $112,500 on Facebook/Instagram ads since 2018 to promote the tunnel project. Ishkwaazhe Shane McSauby, another GTB citizen and a documentary filmmaker, was arrested in Minnesota on March 25 while protesting Enbridge’s replacement of its Line 3 oil pipeline. While he and other Indigenous water protectors peacefully prayed in an Anishinaabe lodge on an Enbridge construction site, he said police ripped sacred medicines out of their hands and threw them on the ground before making arrests. Police later cut apart the lodge. McSauby and others were charged with unlawful assembly and trespassing. He called the Enbridge/7th Legacy video “hard to watch.” “You’ve got people using their spirit names in this video, and telling people how we use our pipes and how we use our ceremony, how we use our medicines,” said McSauby. “And all in the name of Enbridge, all in the name of destroying the land and water.” McSauby said there is a long history of governments and corporations trying to'}]"

The move will largely affect people in “professional roles at our World Headquarters in Ada,” Susan Nemes, manager of global PR at Amway, said in an email to MiBiz. The company expects 90 percent of the expected layoffs, or about 800 positions, will come from its West Michigan operations. In a memo to employees, the company said it sent the voluntary separation plan to more than 1,000 people. The plan will offer “financial and healthcare benefits above and beyond Amway’s already generous standard severance,” per the memo. Executive-level employees will receive the offer first and have 45 days to opt into the plan, “after which, involuntary separation of executives will be decided by function.” Other Amway North America employees will be able to opt in “by early May.” The company expects the majority of the layoffs to take place from July through the end of 2021. Manufacturing technicians and most maintenance personnel are not eligible for the plan and will be provided with a “unique, enhanced retirement benefit,” which the memo does not detail. “Whether voluntary or involuntary, with so many of our colleagues and friends departing Amway, we recognize that things will look, feel and seem different for some time to come. The Global Leadership Team is committed to continuing work started to improve the overall employee experience, and we will stick to the intense prioritization we have set forth. This will not end up as a ‘just do more with less’ workplace,” according to the memo. Executives arrived at the decision “after months of deep discussion and building of cross-functional alignment.” As part of the restructuring, Amway also plans to shift some Nutrilite manufacturing capacity from Buena Park, Calif. to West Michigan. The move will involve the creation of 125 manufacturing positions locally, according to the memo. “Nutrition is our fastest-growing category and will lead us into our envisioned future. We aim to continue being an entrepreneur-led health and wellness company; and to manufacture in the United States, the preferred country of origin for these products across the world,” according to the memo. The company also plans to combine its personal products and skincare plants into one facility in Ada, and will outsource its home care production.

Geddert took his own life Thursday afternoon, hours after a judge issued a warrant charging him with human trafficking, racketeering and sexual assault. Michigan State Police said Geddert\'s body was found at a rest area along eastbound Interstate 96 in Clinton County about 3:24 p.m. An investigation was ongoing on Thursday evening, and no other details were being released, state police tweeted. “My office has been notified that the body of John Geddert was found late this afternoon after taking his own life,"" Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a written statement. ""This is a tragic end to a tragic story for everyone involved.” \'You are heard and believed\': Rachael Denhollander supports abuse survivors after John Geddert dies Geddert. 63, formerly owned and coached at Twistars gymnastics club in Dimondale, where hundreds of women and girls say convicted sex offender Larry Nassar sexually abused them. Many said Geddert knew of this abuse, as Nassar had regularly treated young athletes in a back room at Twistars. Geddert was charged Thursday morning with 24 counts ranging from human trafficking to lying to police. He was expected to turn himself in for arraignment later in the day. During a news conference held Thursday before the death was discovered, Nessel said Geddert was accused of using force, fraud and coercion against young athletes, putting them through multiple acts of verbal, emotional, physical and sexual abuse. Athletes who worked with him were subjected to excessive physical training and were forced to perform while injured, Nessel said. Athletes also attempted suicide, harmed themselves and suffered from eating disorders, she said. Geddert faced 20 counts of human trafficking and forced labor and one count each of first-degree sexual assault, second-degree sexual assault, racketeering and lying to a police officer. The human trafficking charges were related to forced labor that resulted in injury to 19 athletes, all of whom are minors, authorities said. Two of the charges were connected to a single athlete. The trafficking charges all were alleged to have occurred between 2008 and 2018. The six charges involving minors carry a maximum penalty of up to 20 years in prison upon conviction. The charge of lying to police was the only charge directly related to Nassar, Assistant Attorney General Danielle Hagaman-Clark said. Authorities alleged Geddert knew Nassar was sexually abusing athletes but failed to take action, then lied to police when asked about it. They said Geddert lied by saying he had never heard complaints about Nassar\'s treatment, by denying he was aware of any athletes receiving intravaginal treatments at Twistars and by saying males were not allowed in the female locker room. ""These charges against Mr. Geddert are for his actions and his alone,"" Hagaman-Clark said at the news conference with Nessel. ""(The charges are about) his behavior in his gym related to his coaching."" Nassar and Geddert were linked for years at Twistars and later at the Olympics. Nassar treated and traveled with USA Gymnastics national women\'s teams for years. Geddert coached the US women\'s gymnastics team at the 2012 Olympics in London, where they won team gold. The two counts of sexual assault against Geddert involved a single athlete between the ages of 13 and 16. First-degree criminal sexual conduct carries a maximum penalty of up to life in prison upon conviction. The racketeering charge was based on allegations Geddert had trafficked 15 of the athletes, referred to in court documents only by their initials, for financial gain. The listed address for the racketeering count was 9410 Davis Highway in Dimondale, which is the building formerly used by Twistars. An attorney for Geddert, Chris Bergstrom, did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. Gymnastics abuse: Ex-USA Gymnastics coach Geddert knew about Larry Nassar\'s sex abuse of athletes, charge alleges Ties to Larry Nassar: Gymnastics coach John Geddert charged with human trafficking: How it connects to Larry Nassar Survivors: Twistars, Gedderts would pay $2.1 million on top of USA Gymnastics settlement with Nassar survivors Rachael Denhollander, the first person to publicly accuse Nassar of sexual assault, referred to Geddert\'s death on Twitter on Thursday. ""So much pain and grief for everyone,"" she said. ""To the survivors, you have been heard and believed, and we stand with you. Thank you for telling the truth. What you have done matters. Please stay safe, you are loved and wanted here."" Denhollander told the Indianapolis Star in 2016 that she had been abused by Nassar. The Star published an article about the accusations that September. Hundreds of woman and girls would follow Denhollander with stories of their own abuse at Nassar\'s hands. Denhollander made the final victim impact statement in Ingham County Circuit Court, prior to Nassar being sentenced to 40 to 175 years behind bars. Angie Povilaitis, the lead prosecutor in the Nassar cases, also tweeted about Geddert\'s death. ""A lot of folks may not realize how heavy & hard today\'s news of John Geddert\'s suicide is.(on many victims and former gymnasts,"" she said. ""Speaking to them directly: HE made his decisions & choices-ALL OF THEM. None of the weight of his choices or burdens should be yours to (bear)."" In a Thursday night interview with the Louisville Courier-Journal, Denhollander, who lives in Louisville, said Geddert\'s suicide will bring ""an incredibly devastating reality"" for the victims in his case, adding that ""there may be false guilt for the choices that he made. ""And that\'s that\'s something all survivors struggle with — feeling like their abuser\'s choices are a result of something they did,"" she said. ""And this might not be any different.

However, his work at Grand Blanc High School keeps him busy and out-front during the COVID epidemic, while many other Michiganders work from home. Randall has worked for Grand Blanc Schools since 2002 and is quick to point out that if he is an everyday hero, then so are his fellow staff members. His duties during the COVID shutdown included screening visitors to the school and helping distribute schoolwork for the “Bobcat Virtual Learning” at the west campus. As a part of the security team, he is also a first responder for all types of medical and safety emergencies in the school. Randall says he loves working with people and students and enjoys seeing how much the kids learn as they grow from children to young adults. “COVID took away a lot of my interactions with the staff and students, and I miss that, he said.” He has also helped others during the pandemic by taking people to doctor’s visits and shopping for them when they needed it. He also lost a family member to COVID when an uncle, who survived a stroke last winter, was sent to rehab to get his strength back. When COVID broke out in his assisted living center, he passed away in the spring. Now that the students are coming back to school, Randall finds it is nice to get back to keeping the students and staff safe from intruders and helping them get proper care if they have COVID symptoms. In addition to these vital tasks, Randall sad he also feels it is part of his job to let the kids know how important they are, that the staff wants them to succeed and feel safe and know that COVID will soon pass.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 5:40 pm Education reporter BENZONIA — Three players showed up for the first preseason meeting of Benzie Central’s boys soccer team. Three. Eleven are needed to field a full team. The Huskies were eight short for the 2021 season. Kevin Hubbell, the team’s star forward, couldn’t help but be disheartened that he might not be able to play the sport he loves in his final year of high school — not unless he could find more of his peers to join the squad. “I knew that I needed to reach out and bring some guys in,” he said. “I had to take that leadership role and step in and do what was necessary to get them on the field so we could have enough players to play our first game.” Even with just the trio of players, Benzie Central head coach Chris Batchelder kept the meeting going. He wanted to know the goals those three had in their hearts and minds. Both team goals and individual goals. Hubbell was straightforward with what he wanted to accomplish. For the team, a district championship. For himself, at least one individual state record. The 17-year-old phenom is widely considered to be one of the best players in the area and across Michigan. The prospect of etching his name in the Michigan High School Athletic Association record books wasn’t much of a stretch. Hubbell fell just shy of the record for most consecutive hat tricks, scoring three goals in a game, with eight. The state record is nine. So he set his sights on another — most goals in a single game. He eyed that record since that Aug. 9 meeting. Before every game, Hubbell turned to his coach just as he was about to take the pitch and said, “I’m breaking that record today.” The record didn’t fall in the first game or the second or the third. Not until the 11th match of the season did the opportunity to make history arise. He took it. Hubbell found the back of the net eight times in the first 10 minutes of the Huskies’ Sept. 29 game against Kingsley. Breaking the 10-goal state record, set by Cheboygan’s Karl Trost in 2003, was within his grasp. Three goals later, it was firmly in his hand. Five goals after that, Hubbell eclipsed the 14-goal national record — a mark Dale Self of Sumter, South Carolina, set 41 years ago. “It was something that I never thought I would see,” Batchelder said. “What you put into this game is what you get out of it. To see someone who’s worked so hard his entire life blow it up like that was just breathtaking.” Others didn’t see it the same way. Soon after news broke of Hubbell’s double record-setting performance, social media and the comments sections on news websites were flooded with criticism of the 16 goals and the Huskies’ 17-0 win against a struggling Kingsley team. Poor sportsmanship. Classless. Bullying. It seemed more criticized the accomplishment than celebrated the record. “We are in a society where negative speaks before positive,” Batchelder said. “I knew everyone wouldn’t agree when he broke the record. I knew there’d be some people upset with it.” Batchelder said the criticism is fine — as long as it’s directed at him and not Hubbell. But plenty fired at the 17-year-old. “I want this to stop, and I want to get back to appreciating soccer,” Batchelder said. “All that noise is just noise.” The backlash and repercussions likely will continue. Kingsley Area Schools Superintendent Keith Smith said discussing how the district will respond is premature, but the matter is set to go before the Kingsley Board of Education on Monday. “We feel that there needs to be some type of response on behalf of our boys, there are just varying degrees of opinion on what the most appropriate way to do that is,” Smith said. Athletic directors and administrators called Smith the day following the game to give their support and express how “unbelievable” it was that Hubbell scoring 16 goals was allowed to happen. Smith said he wouldn’t have had a problem with the record performance if the game was competitive; but unfortunately for the Stags, they haven’t stayed close in any games this season. Heading into Saturday, Kingsley had yet to win a game. The Stags’ 0-14 record included 11 shutouts and 11 mercies, which ends the game before regulation when a team is losing by eight or more goals after at least one half of play. Benzie previously mercied Kingsley 9-1 on Sept. 13. “If high school sports degenerates into ‘Let’s try to hang the most points we can’ and taking advantage of people when they’re down, we’re really missing the mark and need to reevaluate why we’re doing this,” Smith said. Kingsley head coach Tim VanWingerden said the season was tough before it even started. Much like Benzie, VanWingerden wasn’t sure he’d have enough players to field a team. He didn’t have a player like Hubbell and was working with mostly freshmen and others playing varsity for the first time. Injuries, eligibility issues and problems on the field only magnified those challenges. That 17-0 loss was “pretty demoralizing,” VanWingerden said. “For me and for the players,” he said. “To go after a personal record like that at the cost of another team’s dignity was a little uncalled for. Soccer is not the right place for that. Soccer is a gentleman’s sport.” VanWingerden had a long talk with his players the next day at practice. He reassured them that they have nothing to be embarrassed about, and he told them how proud he was of them for not calling it quits when it would have been easy to just hang it up. “They’re tired. They’ve gotten the crap kicked out of them,” he said. “These kids keep showing up every day and working every day — even with people laughing in their faces. They’ve earned the right to represent their school with pride, regardless of how good they are.” VanWingerden put some of the blame on his shoulders, suggesting that he should have forfeited the game before it got completely out of hand. “I should have tried to protect my players’ dignity more than I did,” he said. “I could see how frustrated and demoralized they already were, and I didn’t do a thing to stop it.” Coaches outside of Kingsley have noticed the Stags’ valiant effort, too. John Vermilya, head soccer coach at Buckley High School, trudged through a winless season — 0-18 — in his first year leading the Bears. Half of those losses were mercies, and most were mercies by halftime. But now they’ve built a program that made a run to the state semifinals in 2017 and just won the program’s first Northwest Conference title since 1999. Yet he knows just how VanWingerden and his players feel. “Can you imagine getting shellacked every game and still coming back for more? That’s heroic,” Vermilya said. Vermilya said he never would have put up 17 goals on a team facing as much adversity as Kingsley. What happened in that game, Vermilya said it was poor leadership. “Beating on the weak doesn’t make you strong — it makes you a bully,” he said. “Everything about coaching is teaching these guys to be better men.” Many, including Vermilya, said Batchelder should have taken Hubbell out of the game well before he broke the record and allowed his other players to get time on the field. The only problem is Batchelder didn’t have many subs he could put in to take Hubbell’s spot. He only had one player on the bench that day. Batchelder took Hubbell out of the game three times, allowing him to play 29 of the 40 minutes in the first and only half. “I’m happy to see programs like Leland and Buckley that’ve got so many players. I love that because I want to see soccer grow here,” Batchelder said. “We don’t have that luxury at the moment. My goal is to build that uprising.” Despite the disapproval Batchelder and Hubbell received, they’ve gotten plenty of congratulations as well — including from the man whose record Hubbell broke. “I love it. I think that’s great,” Trost said. “It’s something to shoot for, and it’s something to try and beat.” Trost received backlash when he broke the record, but he admitted it wasn’t anything like what Hubbell is experiencing. Trost’s achievement — which came in a 20-0 game against East Jordan — was before the advent of social media, so all he saw was a comment here and there on online news coverage. The backlash, Trost said, stems from jealousy. “It’s all garbage. People just love to talk,”'}]"

HOUGHTON — The Boeing 747-E4B Nightwatch circling the Keweenaw Peninsula since early Tuesday afternoon is not a security concern, the North American Aerospace Defense Command said. The Nightwatch, a U.S. Air Force plane nicknamed the ‘Doomsday Plane’, has circled the Keweenaw Peninsula since about 2:45 p.m. Tuesday. The plane cruised at about 430 knots (494 mph) at 25,000 feet for five hours over the Keweenaw. It broke from the holding pattern and flew east at approximately 6:45 p.m. The plane circled numerous times in an elongated holding pattern northwest to southeast, from about 40 miles north of the Porcupine Mountains, traveling as far east as Big Bay, north of Marquette. The plane is an asset of the U.S. Strategic Command. The U.S. Strategic Command could not be reached for comment. The plane based at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, Neb., took off from Lincoln, Neb., at 1:30 p.m. EDT, and flew over Duluth and then to the Keweenaw Peninsula, according to data on the flight tracking website flightradar24.com. Flightradar24.com Shown is the flight path The Nightwatch took in flying over the Copper Country Tuesday afternoon. The Nightwatch is described by the U.S. Air Force as a modified Boeing 747-200B for the National Emergency Airborne Command Post. It’s designed to carry the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff during a nuclear attack. An E-4B in the air is noted as a National Airborne Operations Center. The plane is designed to survive an electromagnetic pulse and uses traditional analog flight instruments as they are less vulnerable to an EMP blast. The plane is capable of operating with a crew of up to 112 people including flight and mission personnel. There are at least 48 crew aboard any E-4B mission. The plane contains a conference room, projection room for computer graphics and overhead transparencies, and can deploy and tow a five-mile-long cable for communicating with nuclear submarines. With in-flight refueling, the plane is capable of remaining airborne, with a test flight lasting 35 hours. The plane was designed to remain in the air for a full week in the event of an emergency. The E-4B fleet consists of four aircraft with a cost of $250 million each. It costs about $160,000 per hour for the Air Force to operate.

coordinator, Don Yost, production manager, and Cecil Batchelor, plant manager, keep the wheels turning at Michigan Web Press’ two printing plants in Davisburg and its newest location in Greenville, Mich. DAVISBURG —After the successful acquisition of Stafford Printing in 2019, Michigan Web Press now has state of the art printing facilities on both sides of the state. Michigan Web Press had similarly acquired Lapeer-based Webco Press in 2006. Proving that demand for print in general and printed newspapers in particular continues, the company is now the largest commercial newspaper printer in Michigan, serving more than 250 clients. Their four press lines, made up of 68 printing units and 6 folders, produce more than 3 million copies weekly. The company’s combined post-press inserting, bindery and mailing divisions deliver a turn-key solution for publishers who need a one-stop solution. The 24-7 operation also has full generator backup for uninterrupted production. “Insert preprint business continues to be a heavily used vehicle for local and national marketing professionals who need an effective way to get their client’s message to customers,” said Michigan Web’s general manager Todd Hagerman. “The continued popularity of preprint inserts is further proof that print remains an effective marketing medium. The many community newspapers we print provide an ideal delivery vehicle for the advertising inserts of retailers large and small.” Michigan Web Press, founded in 1979 and acquired by Lapeer native Rick Burrough in 1999, produces publications that are distributed throughout Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. Clients include Sherman Publications, The County Press, View Newspaper Group, C&G Newspapers, The (MSU) State News, the (UM) Michigan Daily and many others. Stafford Printing brought to the mix more than 160 customers, including daily, weekly and monthly publications covering the same geography. “The acquisition of Stafford Printing strategically positioned our company to more readily serve newspapers and other printing clients on the west side of the state,” added Hagerman. While the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily slowed the presses, the need to keep communities informed kept the newspaper business going and growing in 2020. Hagerman is looking ahead to a busy 2021. “Our company is strong,” said Hagerman. “We are dedicated to print and are especially proud to serve newspaper publishers throughout the Midwest.” Locally and independently owned, Michigan Web Press will continue to grow, and customers will remain the top priority. “We are a leader in the printing business with resources to serve clients with high quality printing, delivered on time, at a fair price,” said Burrough. “As publishers of one of Michigan’s largest community newspaper groups, we provide our clients with unparalleled support, whether it is graphics backup, advertising ideas and contacts or journalism networking. We are not beholden to a board or investors who are chasing the next shiny thing. We are committed to our print clients, committed to print newspapers, including their advertisers and readers, and committed to the communities we serve.” For more information about Michigan Web Press, please visit the company online at www.michiganwebpress.com or call 248-620-2990.

Vivian The Our Home Too documentary film and community outreach project is proud to receive the support of Rev. Dr. Howard C. Earle Jr., Senior Pastor of New Hope Baptist Church and Rev. C.A. Pace, Jr. Senior Pastor of the True Light Baptist Churchâ\x80\x93â\x80\x93and their respective congregations. Both churches and many of their members have been, and continue to be, essential to the Black freedom struggle in Grand Rapids. From approximately 1916 to 1970, about six million Black Americans left the South to escape economic oppression, exploitation, brutality, lynching, and harsh segregation laws. During WW I, the need for industrial workers and the prospect of social equality brought African American migrants to Grand Rapids. Many sought to avoid the widespread discrimination of larger, more complex northern cities. Established in 1922 on the west side Projectof Grand Rapids where living conditions were often substandard, True Light Baptist Church, and the surrounding community, provided a sense of pride and an environment of self-determination. From 1938 to 1954, Rev. Tolliver, True Light\'s pastor at that time affirmed a tradition of leadership at the church in the Black freedom struggle in Grand Rapids. Begining a forty-one-year tenure in 1954, Rev. W. L. Patterson continued and further established True Light\'s commitment to social justice issues. Now Rev. Pace continues and expands True Light\'s commitment to the Black freedom struggle in Grand Rapids with support for the Our Home Too documentary film and community outreach project. Rev. Pace states, ""Faith communities have always been essential to the progression of the liberation movement. True Light, along with many of the churches in our community work to provide spaces to cultivate opportunities for individuals to break the chains of systemic oppression and foster an identity of holistic freedom. As True Light celebrates our Centennial in Grand Rapids, we strive to continue to share Christ, show compassion and serve our community."" Rev. Howard Earle, Jr., the senior pastor of New Hope Baptist Church, has also voiced support for the project. He states, ""An idealistic and arguably naive perception of our country is one that believes racism no longer has the stronghold on the United States of America that it once held. However, racism is alive and well in this country and is deeply embedded in our nation\'s DNA. Stories such as the Our Story Too documentary Film project are critical to crafting and constructing accurate narratives about the history of our beloved country. The African American journey in the city of Grand Rapids is a rich and dynamic one that must be told from the African American perspective. This project could not be more timely as we watch the full-on assault of accurate American history on a daily basis."" Our Home Too will explore the journey of New Hope Baptist Church from its founding in 1934 when a group of Black Grand Rapidians formed a prayer band and met in each other\'s homes and at a location on Market Street. In April 1949, Rev. John V. Williams was called as pastor. He was the 6th pastor and also the longest serving pastor in the church\'s 85 - year history. Rev Williams established a hot lunch program at the church, and he was instrumental in the Progressive Voters League. Today New Hope continues its commitment to the Black freedom struggle with programs ranging from prison ministry to a drama ministry that brings biblical history to life through realistic interpretations. In the act of worship itself, the experience of liberation becomes a constituent of the communities being â\x80¦It is God\'s Spirit invading the lives of the people, ""building them up where there are torn down and propping them up on every leaning side."" The project team is in discussions with other area ministers, and we look forward to garnering their support. As we prepare funding grant applications, Plymouth United Church of Christ, Pastor Rachel Bahr is using the slogan ""Doing Really Good Stuff."" Plymouth is including the Our Home Too, project in the ""Good Stuff"" they are doing. Rev. Robert Dean pastor of New Life Church of God in Christ, like Plymouth has consented to be listed as supports in our funding proposals. Rev. Bahr states, ""Plymouth will be praying for you in this important venture. I look forward to when we can watch the documentary together as a community."" Conceptual, spiritual, and financial support from pastors and their congregations is greatly appreciated. However, the project needs grassroots community support. We must embrace projects that respect Black history and culture. As we navigate the foundation funding process the project requires immediate resources to document community elders for the film and the historical record.
