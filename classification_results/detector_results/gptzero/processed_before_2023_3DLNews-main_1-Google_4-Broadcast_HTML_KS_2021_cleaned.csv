those incentives work. The hope: Boost vaccinations — particularly among young adults, who are least likely to get the shot — and curb the spread of the highly infectious delta variant. Yet researchers from the Boston University School of Medicine found that lottery-based incentive programs don’t actually increase vaccination rates. And the Kansas schools have an uneven sense of how many people on their campuses are protected against the killer virus. Researchers said Ohio’s widely touted “Vax-a-Million” lottery, which offered adults the chance to win $1 million, was not associated with an increase in COVID-19 vaccinations. Widespread media reports initially suggested that the Ohio vaccine lottery, which also offered the chance for a full-ride college scholarship for children ages 12 to 17, spurred vaccinations by more than 25%. But those reports didn’t account for an expansion of vaccines to 12- to 15-year-olds that happened around the same time. “Our results suggest that state-based lotteries are of limited value in increasing vaccine uptake,” said Allan J. Walkey, a professor of medicine and author of the study. “The resources devoted to vaccine lotteries may be more successfully invested in programs that target underlying reasons for vaccine hesitancy.” Even so, over the past few weeks, Kansas colleges and universities have rolled out vaccine incentive programs. Here’s a brief rundown: Some smaller colleges are offering incentives, too. At Garden City Community College, students and employees who provide proof of vaccination by Oct. 15 will get $500 applied to their accounts or paychecks in November. If every student and staff member got the vaccine, the total payout would be about $500,000, officials said. Howard Smith, provost and vice president for academic affairs at Pittsburg State, said the goal of vaccine incentive programs is to protect the campus and those who use it regularly. “The more people on our campus vaccinated, the less likely disruptions will happen to our fall operations,” he said. “Students won’t miss as much class or as many activities, and everyone can have a safer, more productive semester.” Kansas State officials said about 84% of K-State students have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine — well above the 70% needed to achieve herd immunity. But only about half of faculty and staff are fully vaccinated. “We need to get ... the faculty and staff number higher for all of us to be safe, and for the individuals to be safe,” said K-State President Richard Myers during a virtual town hall last week. Most universities say they're not sure how many students or employees are vaccinated, but they hope incentive programs could help them get a better gauge on the number. No Kansas colleges are requiring COVID-19 vaccines. According to data from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, about half of the state’s population have gotten at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Only about 43% of 18- to 24-year-olds have received at least one dose. Universities are funding their incentive programs with federal COVID-relief funding designated to help fight the pandemic, as well as through donations from university partners or foundations.

optimism with the 2021-22 Cloud County Community College men's basketball team ahead of Monday night's season-opening game at North Platte Community College. Despite being tasked with a 24-game Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference schedule as part of a 30-game regular-season slate, first-year head coach Devin Kastrup will look to rely on a roster that has eight players with at least one year at the collegiate level as part of an 18-man roster. Included in the list of eight players with collegiate experience is returners Malang Athian, Travis Beetch, and Savian Edwards as all three appeared in at least 19 games a year ago for CCCC. Edwards would be named Honorable-Mention All-KJCCC East Division following a year that saw the Topeka, Kansas native average 11.4 points and 2.7 assists per contest while reaching double-figures in nine of 21 contests that he played in. Transfers such as Nate Duckworth (Bloomington, IL) Uros Stepanovic (Belgrade, Serbia), and Joe Kearney (Oakdale, MN) will also look to play impact for the T-Birds alongside a group of 10 first-year freshmen. Kearney is one of three transfers from Southwestern Iowa Community College (Duckworth, Kearney, and Justin Graham) who have played under Kastrup with the three combining for 74 starts with the Spartans while averaging over 22 minutes per contest. A new-look KJCCC Division I conference will feature 13 teams and all teams playing in one division for the first time since 2017-18 as each conference team will play a double round-robin schedule against the remaining conference schools. Adding to the intrigue within the Jayhawk Conference this season is that eight of the 13 schools will have new head coaches patrolling the sidelines compared to a year ago, with only Butler, Coffeyville, Colby, Dodge City, and Pratt having the same head coach as last year. After CCCC's season-opening game at North Platte, the T-Birds will kick off a four-game homestand on Wednesday, November 3rd when the Friends University JV team comes to Arley Bryant Gymnasium as five of Cloud County's six non-conference games will be played at home. The KJCCC opener will take place on Wednesday, November 17th with a road trip to Northwest Kansas Tech before the T-Birds turn around to host Hutchinson on Saturday, November 20th in their KJCCC home opener. Eight of the 24 KJCCC games on the schedule will take place prior to the holiday break with action concluding on December 13th and then going on hiatus until January 5th when Cloud County hosts Coffeyville for an 8 p.m. matchup against the NJCAA Defending National Champions. Of the 16 games to take place in the months of January and February for CCCC, seven will be at home as part of 15-15 split to the 30 game regular season for home and road contests. The 2022 NJCAA Region VI Tournament will feature the top 12-teams in the KJCCC as the teams who finish in the top four of the standings will receive a first-round bye. Teams seeded fifth through eighth will host a first-round playoff game against the remaining four teams to qualify on February 28th with the quarterfinal matchups taking place at the home sites of the top-four seeds two days later on March 2nd. This year's semifinals and finals will be played at the Tony's Pizza Events Center in Salina, Kansas with the Region VI Champion earning the Region's automatic berth into the 2022 NJCAA Division I Basketball Championship Tournament. All Cloud County home men's basketball games will be live-streamed this year, with fans able to watch at www.cloudtbirds.com/tbirdsportsnetwork. General admission tickets for all CCCC home basketball games are also on sale now, with fans able to purchase tickets to sit in any non-chair back seat inside Arley Bryant Gymnasium at www.cloudtbirds.com/tickets.
