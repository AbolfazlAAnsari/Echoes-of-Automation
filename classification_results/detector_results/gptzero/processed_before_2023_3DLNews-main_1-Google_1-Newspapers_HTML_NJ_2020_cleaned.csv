Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:31 am HARDING TWP. – Township resident and centenarian Walter Ness has finally been recognized for the unique services he provided during World War II – more than 75 years ago. Brig. Gen. Vincent Malone, Commander of Picatinny Arsenal, made the presentation of medals on Wednesday, Jan. 20 during the regularly scheduled monthly meeting of VFW Post 3401 in Morris Plains, where Ness is a long-time member. Ness served in the Navy during WWII and attained the rank of Quartermaster Second Class. Ness has also recently been recognized in the township, where “Walter Ness Day” was feted last year. At the beginning of World War II Walter Ness, who turned 100 last November, was working for the Sperry Gyroscope Company developing military equipment under a Presidential Deferment, which delayed his entry into the war until March 14, 1944. After basic training, he was assigned to the mine sweeping ship YMS 216 and deployed to the Pacific, where he served until his discharge on April 28, 1946. As the war drew to a close the government was still using all the brass for munitions with none available for military decorations. It wasn’t until late 1946 that large-scale production of the brass military service medals was restarted. Apparently some of those discharged in early 1946 were overlooked in the process of distribution, and Ness was one of them. Recently, a family friend, a retired Naval Officer, heard of Mr. Ness’ service and became curious as to why he had not received his campaign medals. He decided to follow-up and, discovering the events of those times, was able to arrange a belated delivery of the three which Mr. Ness had earned. Albeit belated, a formal awards ceremony for the veteran was arranged through VFW Post 3401 in Morris Plains, where he has been a member for over 28 years. For this presentation, COVID-19 limited attendance, but the post has indicated that a formal, much larger celebration is planned for a later date. In Harding in November, there were police cars and fire trucks. There was an ambulance, lots of cheering neighbors. And, there was even a bagpiper. They all turned out – socially distanced- to fete ‘’Walter Ness Day’’ in the township. The long-time resident and World War II veteran turned 100 years old, and it was a time to celebrate his life and achievements on Tuesday, Nov. 24. Ness received two Distinguished Service Medals – one from the State of New Jersey, signed by Governor Murphy, and one from the New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs. That day, there was a banner in his honor hung in New Vernon and residents cheered with stick flags with Ness’ face on them. Mr. Ness’ daughter, Karen Pennett, and her friend, Amy Hurd Fetchko, arranged the shout out. “Due to COVID restrictions in place of a party, a “drive by” was arranged on Lee’s Hill Road,” Pennett explained in November. “The parade started at Harding Township Elementary School about 3:30 pm. The parade included the engines and ambulances of the New Vernon Fire Department and First aid squad, several police vehicles, a World War II Jeep and over 30 cars driven by friends and neighbors,” she said. Along the street by Walter’s house, she said, there were approximately 50 additional friends and neighbors cheering to celebrate his Birthday. She said cars were decorated to wish Walter a Happy Birthday. There was also a bagpiper in the parade. “The parade was quite loud with the sirens from Fire Trucks and Ambulances, honking of all the cars and the Bagpipes,” she said. “At the end of the parade, people parked their cars near by and joined the spectators in singing Happy Birthday, accompanied by the Bagpiper,” she said. “This “drive by” was a complete surprise for Walter. He couldn’t believe all this was being done for him. He was so excited and still hasn’t stopped smiling,” she said. HARDING TWP. – Talk about a hero’s welcome. Log In BE YOURSELF.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:11 am Superintendent Jennifer Shouffler goes over the protocols and procedures for this fall for a proposed hybrid learning model in Tewksbury Township, during a virtual Board of Education meeting held via Zoom on Wednesday, July 22. TEWKSBURY TWP. – The grades K-8 school board discussed the tentative options the district is planning on providing for the reopening of schools this fall at a virtual meeting held via videoconferencing platform Zoom on Wednesday, July 22. Superintendent Jennifer Shouffler also fielded numerous questions from parents and attempted to alleviate some concerns. The current plan for Tewksbury, which still must be approved by the state, is a hybrid model, integrating virtual learning with in-person learning. Students in grades 2-8 would be divided alphabetically into two cohorts in which the first would attend classes in school on Mondays and Tuesdays and the other on Thursdays and Fridays with Wednesdays as a virtual learning day for all. This would also provide time for the janitorial staff to clean both Tewksbury Elementary School and Old Turnpike School. Shouffler said parents would also have the option to have their children learn exclusively from home, if they do not feel comfortable with them physically being in school. Desks will be spaced six feet apart or more, when possible to comply with the CDC guidelines for social distancing, and, in hopes of “reducing mask wearing.” The administration has yet to make a decision on how many days students in K-1 will be in the buildings, but the thought is the same four days as the older grades. “It’s really critical for our youngest and most vulnerable learners to receive in-person instruction,” the superintendent said. “The research points to this and I think it can be done in the district.” Using the outdoor space for instruction time and lunch on nice days would be encouraged. Picnic tables would be installed for this purpose. Special education students and those in the English as a second language program would also likely have a four-day in-person schedule. For transportation, Shouffler said the hope is at least half of the district’s parents would agree to drive their own children to reduce the capacity on the busses, also making the need for masks not necessary. The district is also enlisting the local YMCA branch to help provide daycare at TES and assist students in logging onto their computers or tablets Monday through Friday. The full plan can be found here. Parent Concerns Shouffler answered a number of question from parents for about half an hour near the end of the meeting, attempting to quell any concerns about the hybrid plan. A few asked if it would be possible to have in-person instruction for all students four days a week instead of two, possibly by using larger spaces such as the library or all-purpose rooms. The superintendent said the reopening committee did look into it, but the concern would be the lack of ventilation, particularly in the libraries and not having enough staff to accommodate all of the students. “The health department asked us not to use those rooms for primary rooms all day long,” she explained. “They could be used for portions of those days, but they have to social distance in those rooms.” Several parents were concerned about what the curriculum for virtual learning would look like and how it would be integrated with in-person instruction. Shouffler said one of the options may be for teachers who don’t feel safe coming back to the classroom to solely provide remote learning lessons for students. Another idea would be for the teachers providing in-person lessons to set aside a specific time during the day to dedicate to remote learning. She noted other districts are looking into having teacher livestream their lessons in the classroom so the other students can still be present, but it would also present challenges. “I do see some issues with it in terms of students getting the attention that they need from their teacher,” Shouffler said. Lauren Simon, of Pruner Farm Road, asked how students in grades K-1 would be able to participate fully in remote learning, as they will most likely require more assistance than simply logging on to their classes. Shouffler said this is why the district is hoping to be able to have the students in the younger grades attend in-person classes four days. New Safety Measures The district, in order to ensure a safe return to school, will be providing protective equipment for teachers, administrators and janitorial staff. Business Administrator Lori Tirone said Tewksbury has received a CARES Act grant in the amount of more than $13,000 for personal protective equipment, including masks, face shields and hand sanitizer, as well as 10 student desk partitions. The district is also in the process of applying for a FEMA reimbursement grant for more supplies. She said the district is looking to purchase 100 more desk partitions as well as plexiglass shields for the main offices. To help with cleaning every surface inside the buildings, Tirone said two backpack electrostatic sprayers would be ideal. The district purchased a handheld sprayer in March before everything switched to remote learning and another in May, which has not be delivered yet. The downside is the cost of $7,245 per backpack sprayer. A handheld version would be $4,725. Board member Michael Deo said he would personally like to do more research on the sprayers before committing to paying so much money. “We don’t even know if the performance capabilities are there on $7,000,” he said. Fellow board member Angela Stein agreed, saying $7,000 seemed like a lot, if the first two sprayers the district purchased were both only $700 each.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:31 am MOUNT OLIVE TWP. – A new documentary by four Mount Olive High School seniors chronicles the 2019 Marauder football season, from the blood, sweat and tears of the summer workouts to the highs of winning and the lows of their final loss. The film, “Destination December: A Mount Olive Football Documentary,” was created and produced by MOTV fourth year students Caden Kramer, James McCool, Sean Sandak and Tim Marro, under the guidance of TV production teacher, Christopher Praml. Kramer was a Marauder captain who played quarterback and linebacker. Marro was at center and defensive line. McCool and Sandak were not on the team but were described by Praml as big football fans and overall sports buffs. The film that highlights the Marauders’ 5-5 season runs for one hour seven minutes and 13 seconds. It begins with a voice over about the meaning of the sport to the community. “I realize that football isn’t just a game, not just a sport for the players, it’s for everybody, for the community to come together. This is connecting with everybody, it’s not just a game” The documentary ends with the disappointing, final game, a 28-7 playoff loss to Old Tappan. “You deserve better than this. The ball bounces funny ways sometimes. This group of seniors has been tremendous this year,” head coach Brian O’Connor tells the team at the film’s conclusion. Student Ideas Praml said students in the fourth year TV program are required to create and complete a project. He said the football documentary was as successful as the two popular “lip dubs” produced by students in his class in 2016 and 2018. The lip dubs drew thousands of views on YouTube. TV4 students filmed every school club and sport and more. “The students tell me what to do,” Praml said. “They pitch the concept to me.” The four students proposed the football documentary in January, expecting that it would be a relatively easy task. “They didn’t realize the amount of hours that would be needed,” Praml said. “I’m very impressed with the work ethic and the amount of hours the kids put into this.” If done professionally, the documentary would cost thousands. But the Mount Olive students used the school’s equipment and the only cost was in terms of the many hours the students put in. They started filming at summer workouts in June and proceeded to film every workout followed by every game. They reviewed many hours of footage before editing it down to two and a half hours. “They thought they were done,” Praml said. But they were far from done. Praml told the students that their film seemed like a highlight video and lacked a theme. The students were disappointed but they regrouped and accepted that the film had to be changed, dramatically. “It came together pretty quickly after that,” Praml said. The students revised the documentary to focus on the successes and failures of the team. “The toughest part was letting them take the reigns and drop the ball every now and then,” Praml said. Kramer, McCool and Marro hope to pursue careers in film production while Sandak is interested in the business side of films. Other TV4 projects this year have included 60 second news shorts; a documentary about the Mount Olive TV program; movie shorts in various genres; a documentary about Irish dancing; and another that follows a day in the life of one student’s dog and the student’s anxiety over dating.

It is not about “thanking veterans” for their service. TO THE EDITOR: There are so many reasons that an 80-unit assisted living and memory care facility is not right for Columbia and Elm in Florham Park. The intersection was created when Columbia was a country road. It is now a 50 mph major thoroughfare in Morris County. I am facing a minor dilemma, and I am curious how other parents in this area might be dealing with it as well. I’ll call it “the summer jobs quandary.” Our area of New Jersey is a desirable place to live and with more people coming here we’re seeing more development, more impervious surface and more challenges channeling stormwater runoff.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:11 am MONTVILLE TWP. – Like most gatherings in 2020, holiday celebrations at elementary schools have adapted to meet the socially distanced needs of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Montville Township Public Schools, parents of fifth grade students in all five district elementary schools decided to come together and organize one holiday celebration – a town-wide “Rock ‘n’ Drop” holiday car parade. “The Rock ‘n’ Drop is where people give food for the food pantry,” explained fifth grade Hilldale student Dylan Kideckel. He volunteered to run food from the parade cars to the waiting SUVs. “The food pantry helps give food to people who can’t afford it.” The fun, festive, and contact-less, holiday-themed event provided an opportunity for students to decorate family cars, dress for the season, cheer, laugh, and safely come together while staying inside their own cars, according to a press release issued by the K-12 district. The “Rock ‘n’ Drop” was held on Friday, Dec. 18. More than 100 cars drove the parade route, and each donated non-perishable food for the Montville Township Kiwanis Club’s Food Pantry. Six vehicles waited for donations to arrive. They each were ultimately filled to the roof with over 175 cases and bags of donated food items. The Kiwanis Food Pantry provides food for those in the community who cannot afford to purchase food. “This outpouring of generosity tonight is awesome,” said Kiwanis Food Pantry representative, Ron Rauschart. “We had no idea – we had no idea it was going to be this huge.” With sirens blaring, The Montville Township Police Department and the Montville Fire Department escorted the car parade from the Montville Community Park to the parking lot at the Montville Township Board of Education Offices. The police and fire departments helped the Hilldale Fifth Grade Committee to organize the logistics of the event. Three police officers, five fire fighters and honorary fire fighter, Santa, attended the Friday night event. Santa was joined by The Grinch and Frosty – two parent volunteers. Superintendent of Schools René Rovtar also attended dressed in a bunny costume as Ralphie from “A Christmas Story.” “We just wanted to do something fun,” said Rock ‘n’ Drop co-organizer, Jamie Kideckel, a Hilldale Elementary School parent. “We wanted to do something fun for the holidays, and something that gives back to the community.” Jamie Kideckel, Amee Chatterjee and Melissa Jones, are parent co-chairs for the Fifth Grade Committee at Hilldale. In putting together the “Rock ‘n’ Drop,” they reached out to the four other elementary schools in the district. Fifth grade volunteer, Shalin Chatterjee of Hilldale explained that, with the help of the parent organizations in each school (PTAs, PTCs, HSAs), fifth grade families from Cedar Hill Elementary, Valley View Elementary, William Mason Elementary and Woodmont Elementary joined Hilldale in the holiday car parade and food drop. “We were honored to be asked to be a part of the combined, fifth grade, district-wide, event,” said Officer Scott McGowan, who is the Montville Township Public Schools School Resource Officer and a member of the Montville Township Police Force. “We were happy to help spark holiday cheer and help the Kiwanis Food Pantry. The Food Pantry is a wonderful organization that fills an important need in our community. This was a fantastic turnout.” Driving in decorated cars, fifth grade students and families joined in the parade. Once at the board offices, Santa, The Grinch, Frosty, and a team of over two dozen student and parent volunteers, all wearing masks, took food donations from the parade cars, and deposited the items into one of six large SUV vehicles that were waiting to receive the non-perishable donations. “It’s important to be here because we collect these presents, some of them can feed a family of four,” said fifth grade William Mason student William Ervey. Ervey also volunteered to greet the parade cars and collect food donations. Traditionally all Montville Township Public Schools, fifth graders are gifted a personalized sweatshirt designed and donated by their school’s parent organization. The sweatshirts generally have the Montville Township Public Schools’ logo on front and graduation year on back. For 2020, all five schools used the same design to promote #unity. The fifth grade students from across the district wore their sweatshirts to the combined “Rock ‘n’ Drop” as a sign of unity throughout the community. “This is exciting because we are collecting food for people who can’t afford it,” Hilldale fifth grade Rock ‘n’ Drop volunteer Lucas Jones said during the event. “You all, are to be commended for instilling the qualities of caring, sharing, kindness, and helping those in need, in your young students. Qualities we hope will remain with them throughout their lives,” Rauschart said to the Hilldale Fifth Grade Committee in an e-mail following the Rock ‘n’ Drop. “The beneficiaries of this effort are the many families we serve at our Food Pantry, who are in need, during these uncertain times, and throughout the holiday season.” A video of the Rock ‘n’ Drop event can be seen at https://youtu.be/XqXVs6Kg8e8 . The Montville Kiwanis Food Pantry is located at 91 Passaic Valley Road. Hours of operation are Thursdays, 4 to 6 p.m. and Saturdays, 10 a.m. to noon. In addition to the “Rock ‘n’ Drop Food Drop” event on Dec. 18, all Montville Township Public Schools, including the five elementary schools and Robert R. Lazar Middle School and Montville Township High School, have held food drives, clothing drives and toy drives since September 2020. The extensive outpouring of donations has benefited area families impacted by the global pandemic, according to the district. Log In BE YOURSELF.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:35 am Seward Johnson in his studio. Noted area sculptor and Grounds For Sculpture founder John Seward Johnson, Jr. died of cancer on March 10 at his winter home in Key West, Florida. He was 89. “Seward Johnson leaves a remarkable legacy,” said Gary Garrido Schneider, executive director of the Hamilton Township based Grounds For Sculpture in a prepared statement. “Through his sculptures, that generously invite the public to engage and interact, he has touched the hearts of millions across the world,” Schneider continued. “The Seward Johnson Atelier has nurtured a generation of artists who have made a creative living and lasting friendships through this community of sculptors he made possible. Grounds For Sculpture has grown over the last three decades to become one of the most beloved art institutions in our region and an essential beacon for sculptors worldwide.” The grandson of Robert Wood Johnson, founder of the New Brunswick-based Johnson & Johnson, a multinational producer of healthcare products, Seward Johnson used his family connections and wealth to create hyper-realistic sculptures, a world class atelier, the sculpture grounds, and, at times, controversy. A longtime Hopewell and former Princeton resident, Johnson was born in New Brunswick on April 16, 1930. His father was John Seward Johnson, a J&J director who, along with his brother, Robert, helped turn the company into a pharmaceutical giant. His mother was Ruth Dill, daughter of a Bermuda attorney general and parliament member Colonel Thomas Melville Dill. She was also the sister-in-law to actor Kirk Douglas. Although his family had a New Jersey estate in Highland Park, Johnson and his three sisters also lived for extended times in England, France, and Bermuda. Diagnosed with acute dyslexia, Johnson attended the Forman School in Litchfield, Connecticut. After a poor grades caused him to drop out of the University of Maine, he joined the United States Navy and saw action during the Korean War. That was followed by an unsuccessful attempt to join the family company and a failed marriage to Barbara Klein that resulted in publicly aired allegations of infidelity, investigations, and paternity DNA tests. He was also involved in the bitter legal fights after his 76-year-old father divorced his second wife, married his 34-year-old former maid, and bequeathed a fortune to her. The suits became national news and the subject of several books, including “Johnson vs. Johnson” and “Crazy Rich.” ‘The Newspaper Reader,’ which can be found in Princeton’s Palmer Square. In a 2014 U.S. 1 interview, Johnson said his life changed when he met his future second wife, novelist Cecelia Joyce Horton, on a flight to Nantucket and began a relationship that included taking walks and painting. Johnson credited Cecelia as leading him to sculpture after observing his dissatisfaction with his painting. “Cecilia said, ‘You seem to be artistically talented and you lived on a farm when you were young and seem to be very mechanical. Have you ever thought about putting both together?’ And she reaches into her pocket and takes out an ad for a sculpture class, and I went to sign up for it.” When his first sculpture, “Stainless Girl,” won a national competition in 1969, the then Massachusetts-based Johnson said, “I got a vocation.” Johnson returned to the Princeton area, where his sculpture needs inadvertently led to the founding of the Johnson Atelier and then Grounds For Sculpture. “I hired guys off the street and hired this fellow who used to have a foundry,” said Johnson in the above interview. “He was teaching how to get thing things done. He said, ‘Seward, what we have here is a school.’ I realized that I could deduct (expenses) if it were a school and went to a lawyer and incorporated. My wife said, ‘You never told me you were going to do something like this.’ I said, ‘I didn’t know.’” Johnson called the atelier “one of the most fantastic things that I have done.” By the late 1970s the center became a magnet for young American and international artists looking for work as well as a center that provided services for internationally acclaimed artists such as George Segal, Georgia O’Keefe, and Isaac Witkin. After outgrowing two Princeton-area locations, Johnson worked out an arrangement with his family’s foundation to purchase the former Garden State Fair Grounds in Hamilton in 1981 and the atelier was established in the mid-1980s. Grounds For Sculpture was born after foundry artists began to display their sculptures near the atelier and inspired the idea of a permanent exhibition site. ‘King Lear,’ on view at Grounds For Sculpture. The 42-acre property now houses Grounds For Sculpture, Johnson Atelier, and the International Sculpture Center. In 2014 Johnson mounted a popular major retrospective of his work to bolster public and private support as the governance of the grounds was transferred from Johnson and the family foundations to a nonprofit board of directors. That exhibition visually demonstrated that while Johnson mastered the creation of affecting abstract works he deliberately chose to produce his hyper-realistic series depicting everyday people and sculpture interpretations of famous paintings or famous photos. While popular with general audiences, Johnson’s work was often derided by established art critics such as Princeton art professor and critic Sam Hunter, who called Johnson’s folksy style “the worst sort of Kitsch.” Other critics and artists supported Johnson’s popular and even fun approach. Former New Jersey State Council on the Arts’ public art and Grounds For Sculpture current chief curator Tom Moran said, “Johnson’s sculptures of the common individual engaged in familiar types of daily activity energize the public spaces they occupy in unique ways which throw the viewer off guard with their realism. At the same time, his monumental sculptures have been very successful at stimulating the desire to have public art play an important role in the context and identity of the cities in which they have been installed.” And Joyce Carol Oates, the internationally known novelist, literary critic, and Princeton University professor found the artist’s “populist yet strategically calculated art” akin to the writings of American poet Walt Whitman and noted a “remarkable declaration of expansiveness, appropriate for our robust egalitarian American democracy, yet beneath the surface it is, perhaps, a statement of humility, mystical transparency.” Arguing that “it is easy to over-simplify Seward Johnson’s aesthetic,” Oates also supported Johnson’s “bold, playfully brash appropriations” of famous American scenes, including the World War II Times Square sailor and nurse kiss and the film scene where Marilyn Monroe’s skirt rises with a sudden gust. ‘Double Check’ by Seward Johnson. His work also had the ability to seize its own American moments as when his 1982 business man sculpture “Double Check” survived the September 11, 2001, World Trade Center attacks and, according to the New York Times, “evolved into a memorial to all who perished” and “a fitting metaphor for the city.” A replica of the work in the aftermath of the attacks can be seen at Grounds For Sculpture. Johnson himself said of his work, “I have a purpose in mind, and it is a social purpose. My work deals with society and what I think are the needs of society: the visceral response. To me the visceral response is where the value of art lies. Art is the highest form of communication known to man. When it is in a museum or wherever it is, it communicates the emotional message.” In addition to bringing thousands of international artists to the region to have their sculptures made, Johnson’s atelier attracted hundreds of artists who settled in the area, continue to create art, and contribute to artistic strength of the region. Johnson is survived by his wife, Cecelia; his son, John, and his wife, Susan; his daughter, India, and her husband, Eliot; and five grandchildren. Schneider said a memorial celebration and other events to honor Johnson will be scheduled when Grounds For Sculpture and other cultural venues resume operation when health precautions related to the coronavirus have been lifted. Grounds For Sculpture visitors will also have the opportunity to commemorate Johnson and his work in the Cecilia Joyce and Seward Johnson Gallery exhibition, “That’s Worth Celebrating: The Life and Work of the Johnson Family” on view through 2020.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:31 am SARAH NEIBART NICK MONAGHAN MENDHAM TWP. – Republicans kept a lock on the Township Committee leadership, again bypassing the one Democrat at the annual reorganization meeting on Thursday, Jan. 2. Before a packed audience, Republican Sarah Neibart, 27, was named one of the youngest mayors in Morris County history. Fellow Republican Nick Monahan was named deputy mayor. The vote for both was four to one. Neibart, Monahan and the newest GOP committee members, Tom Baio and Jordan Orlins, voted in favor and Democrat Amalia Duarte voted no. Niebart, 27, was appointed to the committee in March 2018 after the resignation of GOP Committeeman Rick Blood. She was elected to a full, three-year term last November. Monahan also was elected last November. Duarte was elected to the committee in 2016. She was traditionally next in line to be named deputy mayor but was bypassed by the majority Republicans last year and again this year. “I’m disappointed but not surprised that I was passed over as mayor and deputy mayor,” Duarte said. “We have a party of one Democrat. I’m being passed over again and people are tired of this divisiveness.” Neibart said her priority for 2020 will be to work to attract new ratables, review current zoning all in an effort to keep the municipal tax rate stable. “We made incredible strides to pay down the debt (in 2019),” Neibart said. “We can all agree that property taxes are just too high. We can deliver a budget this year with no property tax increase.” She referred to 2019 accomplishments including completing the new Ralston Playground; renovating the municipal beach; acquiring state and county funds to develop a trail at the Pitney estate off Cold Hill Road; and expanding shared services. Baio said he would work to expand private investment in town and use his experience as an architect who has been an expert witness before various land use boards. Orlins also said taxes are his priority. He said he moved to town in 2007 and that taxes have risen more than 40 percent since then. “We can lower municipal spending and cut the tax rate,” Orlins said. “Hold us accountable.” Students Mourned The Rev. Michael Drury, chaplain for the police department, welcomed the audience and asked for prayers for the families of Will Thomas and Matthew LaRosa, two high school students who died over the weekend. An obituary for Mr. Thomas was not available. An obituary for Mr. LaRosa said he was 18 and was the son of Jeffrey and Amy LaRosa and leaves brothers, Joseph and Timothy. He was a senior at West Morris Mendham High School where he was an honors student and a member of the National Honor Society. He was an accomplished lacrosse player having spent years playing for Patriot Elite Lacrosse and multiple years on the Mendham High School Varsity Lacrosse team where he was the team captain. He aspired to attend college and study business upon graduation from high school this year, according to the obituary from Bailey Funeral Home, 8 Hilltop Road. “Matt truly loved time spent with his friends, and you would often find him at the gym, on the soccer or lacrosse fields, at a basketball court, out for a bite to eat or just hanging out with these beloved friends,” the obituary said. The funeral was planned for 10:30 a.m., Monday, Jan. 6, at St. Joseph’s Church, 8 W. Main St A private burial was planned at at Hilltop Cemetery.

RentasMIDDLETOWN – The National Park Service has accepted a proposal from Stillman Development International to restore 21 houses on Fort Hancock, a former military base at the tip of Sandy Hook. Jennifer T. Nersesian, superintendent of Gateway National Recreation Area – which includes Fort Hancock – announced the news at The Gateway National Recreation Area Fort Hancock 21st Century Advisory Committee’s meeting Friday, Feb. 28 at Thompson Park Visitor Center. Nersesian said Stillman Development International, a real estate development firm based in New York City, proposed to rehabilitate 107,252 square feet of buildings overlooking Sandy Hook Bay. Since the fort’s closure, the historic houses have remained mostly uninhabited. Nersesian said there are only three buildings that are currently being leased and eight letters of intent. The committee, which officially formed in 2012, has been working with the NPS to re- vitalize Fort Hancock while preserving its past. They have been trying to lease the isolated buildings in an effort to bring life back into the community. Gerry Glaser, co- chair of the committee, said he has high hopes for this project. “This is the biggest thing to happen to this committee since it started,” Glaser said. Nersesian said Roy Stillman, the project’s developer and president of Stillman Development International, would essentially preserve all remaining buildings that are available. This excludes those that are currently being leased and those under any agreement or letters of intent. The proposal from Stillman includes use of all the remaining houses on Officers Row, except for buildings like the History House and those currently in use. A few of the buildings that are part of the proposal are not on Officers Row. Nersesian said that under the proposal, vacant buildings on Officers Row are expected to be used for long-term residential use and there should be approximately 93 renovated apartments once the project is complete. The houses are expected to have three floors with a total of five units. The first and second floors will have two apartments each, while the third floor will have one. Nersesian said there will be some form of shared storage. In addition to apartments, Stillman said they plan to rehabilitate some of the buildings that are not on Officers Row for commercial use. They are thinking of using one of the buildings as additional support for the wedding chapel, as well as opening a sundries store with a liquor license. Stillman said he believes there has to be a certain balance between residential and commercial use in order for it to be a success. He said he hopes there will be year-round occupancy. “We don’t want someone to come home and get asked, ‘Did you get the milk?’ and then they respond, ‘Oh no, I forgot. I’ll be back in 30 minutes,’ ” Stillman said. “An important sense of community includes conveniences like food and supplies.” According to Nersesian, the proposal has been deemed fully responsive to request for proposals and approved to move forward. The next step in this process it to negotiate a letter of intent so that all parties have a written understanding of each other’s requirements and capabilities. It is important to the NPS and committee that the buildings maintain their historical integrity while being rehabilitated. “This is a former military base and there’s a rich, rich history here,” Glaser said. “We want to be sure that whatever we recommend going forward incorporates that.” U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-6) learned about the proposed development Wednesday. He called the proposal “unacceptable.” “The idea of allowing a developer to come in and create apartments to live on the premises long term – whether they are condos for sale or rentals – is inconsistent with the purpose of the national parks and national park areas.” Pallone said he will be sending a letter to the superintendent and following up. In his proposal, developer Roy Stillman envisions rehabilitating some of the buildings not on Officers Row for commercial use. Photo by Raven Rentas Stillman, who attended the meeting, told the committee members that he understands the importance of preserving the houses’ historical and exterior appearance. “History is beauty and this is not the place for adventurous architecture in terms of design,” Stillman said. “This is the place to faithfully put back what was, at least in the external perspective.” He said that at the end of the project, Officers Row will look exactly the same. Stillman said he has been inside every single one of the 21 buildings his firm is going to rehabilitate. While he will try to preserve some of the interior design, Stillman said it will look a little different since the buildings are being used differently now. He said adaptive reuse is okay as long as it is done with respect. The exact timeline of the project is currently unknown. Stillman believes it will take between a year to 15 months to produce and receive approval of the architectural drawings. The architectural drawings need to be approved by both the NPS and the State Historic Preservation Office. He said once they start physical work, the project should take about a year and a half to finish. The project will be executed in phases, Stillman said. Stillman has professional experience preserving historic places. His firm is currently restoring the circa 1920 Times Square Theater at 217 West 42nd St. in New York City for retail, entertainment and restaurant use. Recently Stillman completed renovations of The Schumacher, a Romanesque building, also in New York City, constructed in 1885 to house lithographic printing businesses, into luxury condominiums at 36 Bleecker St. Stillman said he loves working on these types of projects and is excited for this one. “The magic here is to figure out how to embrace the beautiful history of the buildings and to set them up for their next 100 years of success,” Stillman said. “That’s the essence of what this project is in my personal opinion.” This story originally appeared in the March 5, 2020 print edition of The Two River Times.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:31 am The Pirate’s Cove splash pad at Turkey Brook Park in Mount Olive reopens on Monday, Aug.3, with social distancing restrictions in place. MOUNT OLIVE TWP. – Ahoy, maties! The township’s Pirate’s Cove Splash Pad at Turkey Brook Park will reopen for commandeering starting Monday, Aug. 3. The pad will remain open through Sept. 7. To ensure a 75-person maximum capacity, pre-registration the day before the visit is required. No walk-ins will be permitted. There will be four time entries to board the pad: 11 a.m. to 12:15 p.m., 1 to 2:15 p.m., 3 to 4:15 p.m. and 6 – 6:15 p.m. Also, while pirates prefer tossing caution to the wind in pursuit of fun, they will have to practice social distancing. If they don’t, the township reserves the right to take action. Offenders will not be forced to walk the plank or be keel-hauled but officials could close the pad and all play areas. Pirates and their parents – er, mates – must also follow these rules of engagement: • Stay at least six feet away from others you don’t live with. • Wear a cloth face covering when social distancing cannot be observed, although they are not required when in the water area; • Wash hands prior to entering the splash pad area with soap and water or hand sanitizer; and • Carefully consider use of splash pad and help children follow guidelines.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:11 am By GARRY HERZOG Managing Editor JEN WADEYKA ANDERSON COOPER MADISON – Jen Wadeyka of Douglas Avenue appeared on CNN with anchor Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night, March 25, to emphasize a warning to the public about the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic: “It can happen to you.” Sadly, Wadeyka was uniquely qualified to deliver the message. Her grandfather, Army veteran Ralph J. Amato, 91, of Parsippany, died of coronavirus Monday, March 23. Wadeyka, who has been “sheltering in place” but was running errands and shopping for her grandfather, looked at him through the window Friday, March 20, and became alarmed at his condition. She called 911 and watched him carried into an ambulance, bound for Morristown Memorial Hospital. She never saw him again. That same day Wadeyka, who similarly was “shopping and getting food” regularly for her mother, Karen Wadeyka of Basking Ridge, became concerned about her mother and again summoned an ambulance. Her mother was transported to Morristown Memorial Hospital and was tested for coronavirus. The test was positive. The family’s two emergencies happened on the same day, but the experiences were different. Ralph Amato was admitted into the hospital March 20. Wadeyka’s mother was taken to the Emergency Room, where “they determined she could go home” but should be tested in one of the tents the hospital had set up in a parking lot, Wadeyka said. “There was a 48-hour turnaround” for the result, she recalled, and it was positive for coronavirus. “So she’s quarantined in her home, in her room,” Wadeyka said six days later, on March 26. “Today she didn’t have a fever. She’s taking medication and doing better. She seems to be turning a corner.” Korean War Veteran Wadeyka’s grandfather, Ralph J. Amato, served as a Corporal in the Infantry Regiment of the Army during the Korean War and went on to graduate from St. John’s University in New York City. He worked throughout his life as a Financial Controller and was a Fourth Degree member of the Knights of Columbus. “He was very active in the VFW,” Wadeyka said, at Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Post 5481 in Montville, serving on its Finance Committee and leading the VFW’s Eagle Scout programs. While Wadeyka and her grandfather were both “sheltering in place,” she in Madison and he in Parsippany, and she was shopping for him, the 91-year-old Army veteran “was very active” and still left his home from time to time, Wadeyka noted. “I told him, we have to take this (self-isolation) seriously.” Looking back, Wadeyka suspects her grandfather may have been stifling a cough during her regular visits in March, when they would talk through a window. But when she visited him on March 20 he was visibly ill. “He thought he had the flu,” Wadeyka said. “I called an ambulance. I was unable to visit him at the hospital,” due to restrictions imposed by the coronavirus pandemic. Her grandfather died on March 23, and Wadeyka said those same coronavirus restrictions prevent any gathering for a celebration of his life at this time. “We’re going Monday (March 30) to pay our last respects,” she said, in private at the Stephen J. Priola Parsippany Funeral Service in Lake Hiawatha. Online condolences can be expressed at parsippanyfuneral.com .

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:11 am HANOVER TWP. – About 40 children came out to the grades K-5 Bee Meadow School (BMS) on Reynolds Avenue on Thursday, Feb. 13 to learn about the roles exercise, nutrition mindfuness play in healthy living during the school’s annual Health and Wellness Fair. Members of the community – parents and children alike – congregated in the school cafeteria at 6:30 p.m. before receiving their assignments and breaking off to three groups where they would participate exercise in the gym, nutrition in the cafeteria and mindfulness in the library/media center. The program was led by school nurse Wendy Busby with help from Morristown Medical Center registered dietitian Anisha Chhibber and Bee Meadow Coordinated Services Director Elizabeth Guiheen. Busby called the fair the combination of events that have taken place in the school all year long. “Wellness is something very near and dear to my heart,” Busby said. “This year we got our wellness video off the ground and we started so many wellness initiatives. This is the high point, the culmination of some of the work we’ve started with.” She said wellness goals focus on mindfulness, nutrition and exercise. “We want to provide opportunities to help children discover the strength and abilities of their bodies help them engage in positive social skills through sportsmanship and team play,’ she said. “We want to teach physical literacy and healthy habits that lead to lifelong wellness and also improve classroom behavior and learning by keeping both the body and the mind active.” The children with their ,arents rotated through three stations – a nutrition station in the cafeteria, exercise station in the gymnasium in a mindfulness station in the library media center with the focus on yoga. Busby noted a screen in the lobby of depicted pictures of children doing mindfulness exercises, deep breathing relaxation techniques, exercising and eating healthy foods. “We’ve had a big healthy snack initiative,” she said. “We did lots more fruits and vegetables coming in. Thank you parents for that.” Busby thanks everyone involved including Principal Darren Stark, the custodians, aides, teachers and secretaries. “It was a whole BMS effort,” she said. She noted the PTA provided funding and Chhibber, who has a daughter in first grade and another daughter in middle school. “Every year she has had a child here she has done some kind of a nutrition lesson in the child’s grade level all the way from kindergarten up to fifth grade,” Busby said. “She’s done whole school assemblies for us. Tonight is her night for the year and we hope she’ll keep coming.” Busby also thanked Wegmans for donating goodie bags with donations of fruit and also Kings for the fruits and vegetables in the cafeteria nutrition section. “We have healthy yogurt parfaits and vegetables and dips,” Busby said of the Kings nutrition section. Guiheen sent the children on their way to their different stations. “I hope you guys are ready to have a little fun and learn a little bit and be super healthy and have a good time being healthy,” Guiheen said. In the gym, physical education teacher Ken McPeek kept the parents and students hopping with floor exercises combined with games like Rock, Paper, Scissors. Yoga instructor Jen Jennings taught the kids some basic yoga techniques in the library/media center and Chhibber and Guiheen taught nutrition in the cafeteria with staff from Kings supermarket helping out. All venues but the gymnasium also provided crafts for the children. The event may only have lasted two hours but organizers hope the experience will begin a lifelong regimen of healthy living. The fair, coupled with lessons the school has been teaching all year long, could give kids a leg up as they grow. Log In BE YOURSELF. We do not accept and will not approve anonymous comments.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:31 am Fran Agnellino, third from left in front row, poses with other Grandview School teachers after she was honored by the North Caldwell Board of Education at its meeting Tuesday, Jan. 21. EAST HANOVER TWP. – After 18 years of greeting kindergarteners as they came to class in the morning, Fran Agnellino of East Hanover spent her weekday mornings saying goodbye to her three-year-old grandson as she drops him off for preschool. As her grandson walks into the classroom at Grandview School in North Caldwell with his backpack on, Agnellino tells him to have fun and that she’ll see him in a little while. Agnellino stepped down from her post on Friday, Jan. 31. She said in an interview on Feb. 5 that it’s important to keep school fun for kids, especially when they’re younger, even though they get more pressure later on with standardized testing. “But you still want to keep it fun for them at all ages because you want them to come back and enjoy school,” said Agnellino, who is the wife of former East Hanover Mayor William Agnellino. The last member of Grandview’s first full-day kindergarten crew in the 2004-05 school year, Agnellino said that she finds it amazing how nowadays, her kindergarteners log into her classroom iPads and learning Spanish, math and other subjects, especially since she learned how to type on a typewriter. Agnellino started at Grandview in 2002 during the half-day kindergarten program and took over management of the math-a-thon fundraiser in 2003. Since then, the program that runs every January has raised around $350,000 for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Agnellino started her teaching career in 1979, teaching basic skills for second and third graders in Hillside, and she eventually got her own classrooms for second, third and fourth grade students during her nine years working there. When she was pregnant with her first daughter, she took a maternity leave, but when she got pregnant with her second, she decided it was best to resign so that she could stay at home with the kids. Her husband, William Agnellino, who later served as East Hanover’s mayor from 2004 to 2008, was working many hours at the restaurant he owned. Once the kids started school, Fran Agnellino went back to school, teaching three-year-olds at the East Hanover Cooperative Nursery School while taking care of a three-year-old and a four-year-old of her own. When Agnellino first interviewed to teach at Grandview, the only paperwork she brought for job consideration was a portfolio filled with pictures of her with her previous students. She met the school’s Assistant Principal Linda Freda, who now serves as the district’s superintendent. After she got the job, she started working as a teacher’s assistant in the part-time kindergarten program when she had around 24 students in each of the two sessions, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Once she got her own full-time classroom in 2004, Agnellino learned that kindergarten is her favorite grade to teach because one sees so much development and growth of a child. “Not that I didn’t see it in the other grades, but with kindergarten, it’s just so cool because they come just knowing their letters, and they’re reading, and then, they’re writing,” Agnellino said. “And at the end of the school year, we don’t even want to let them go because it’s just so great.” After she did let the kids go, she would give her kids her home address so that they could write to her over the summer, and she loved hearing about what they were doing, whether they were on vacation, at camp, or occupying their time in some other way. Agnellino also said that an enjoyable part of her time teaching has been seeing her past Grandview students and their parents return to visit her. Toward the latter stages of her career, some of the Agnellino alumni were in high school when they visited. She said that she remembers her high school teachers as having a large impact on her, and that she remembers them telling her that she was about to go into the real world and needed to work hard to achieve what she wanted and believed in. Agnellino said that she remembers her high school teachers well, probably because she had them later in life. She doesn’t remember her her kindergarten teachers as well, and she said that many of her students will lose memories of her as they age. However, it can help if parents show their kids pictures of their time in kindergarten, she said. Board of Education member Mindy Opper has frequently reminded her three children of Agnellino and has shown them pictures of their time taught by her. “I go back to that because I taught a lot of families, sometimes two or three members of the family,” Agnellino said. “And then, it was just hard when they left. They weren’t going to see Mrs. Agnellino anymore.” Merideth Toth, who started teaching at Grandview in 2005 but has taught kindergarten since 2012, said that Agnellino was a firm but gentle teacher. “Her students knew she meant business, but she balanced that with sweetness and kindness and that is what made her very special to all of us,” Toth said. Toth also said that Agnellino was always 10 steps ahead of her colleagues, always looking to prepare for the next project and plan for the next month of teaching. While unpacking her classroom in the summer, she was also preparing for the end-of-year celebration, Toth said. “As a teacher, the demands that are placed on us yearly and daily are challenging, but Mrs. Agnellino always made sure that her students were loved and cared for every single day,” Toth said. “I admire Mrs. Agnellino’s ability to always make us laugh whether it was sharing a funny story about a student or something from her personal life, she put a smile on my face every day. We miss her tremendously, but are so incredibly happy for her retirement and the time she can spend with her growing family.” Another kindergarten teacher Genine DellaValle, who started at Grandview in 2017, said that one of her favorite aspects of working with Agnellino was knowing that she was always going to be her number one supporter. One of the best lessons that teachers can learn from Agnellino is to always treat students like their own, DellaValle said. “No matter the day, I could always count on Mrs. Agnellino to come into my classroom with a smile on her face, and be a constant positive light always in my corner,” DellaValle said. “She is honestly one of the most sincere people that I have ever met and made these past three years an easy transition into kindergarten.” Now, Agnellino will spend much of her time caring for her two grandchildren, the three-year-old and a 10-month-old, and she hopes to visit Italy with her husband again. “I’m happy with what I did,” Agnellino said. “I’m happy where I wound up, and kindergarten is my favorite grade.” Contact Brett Friedensohn at brettf@newjerseyhills.com.

Jack was also the founder of HappyJack (www.happyjacksworld.com) an apparel brand that featured his distinct art and is dedicated to raising awareness to mental health issues. Under Jack’s guidance, HappyJack donated thousands of dollars to the Child Mind Institute. Jack’s warmth and empathy was embraced by everyone who knew him. He entered a room with a big smile and left leaving people feeling good about themselves. He encouraged us all to do precisely what is important to each of us or else we will end up being “normal” and Jack knew that normal is boring. Jack wanted people to own who they are, be free of judgment and live every minute of every day to the fullest. Please know Jack was not a victim of mental illness, but was a survivor. His death was purely accidental and it’s important to know how much he cherished life and lived each moment to the fullest. He will be deeply missed. Services were private.
