America’s Newsroom anchor Bill Hemmer looks back at the top headlines of the past 12 months. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre\'s second year on the job consisted of memorable moments where she clashed with reporters. White House press secretaries of both parties often push back and have combative exchanges with the media while taking questions, and Jean-Pierre was no exception in 2023. While Jean-Pierre is often a target of Republicans for her answers and explanations over her comments, White House reporters themselves have challenged the press secretary during the daily briefings, with some accusing her of stifling freedom of the press. As President Biden comes under more scrutiny for his low approval numbers, his alleged involvement with his son Hunter Biden\'s business dealings, and his advanced age, Jean-Pierre has had to deal with reporters\' questions on these issues. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre answers questions during the daily press briefing at the White House on March 3, 2023 in Washington, DC. (Win McNamee/Getty Images) Here are some of the more memorable clashes from the past year: KARINE JEAN-PIERRE’S MOST MEMORABLE MOMENTS FROM FIRST YEAR AS WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY In January, the White House revealed that classified documents from Biden’s time as vice president were found at Penn Biden Center back in November 2022. Biden had previously lambasted former President Trump as ""irresponsible"" for keeping classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago home. CBS reporter Ed O’Keefe pressed the White House on Biden\'s possession of classified documents, though Jean-Pierre insisted that she was ""not going to go beyond what my White House counsel colleagues have stated."" O’Keefe pushed back against her refusal to answer questions in what became a ""contentious"" exchange. ""So, you\'re the one here talking to us about this. That\'s why we\'re asking you. So let\'s just remember that,"" O\'Keefe said to Jean-Pierre. ""Ed, Ed, Ed, we don\'t need to have this – we work very well together,"" Jean-Pierre interrupted. ""We don\'t need to have this kind of confrontation. Ask your question and I will answer them the best that I can."" ""Part of the reason we\'re laying that out is because you\'re laying out your part of the job, we\'re laying out our part of the job, which is asking questions,"" O\'Keefe shot back. ""I know, but I\'m just saying we don\'t need to have contention – you don\'t need to be contentious with me here, Ed,"" Jean-Pierre responded. In April, Jean-Pierre became agitated with NBC reporter Kristen Welker as she asked about the conflict between congressional Republicans and the president on raising the debt ceiling. Jean-Pierre insisted that the conflict was a ""political stunt"" by the GOP to force spending cuts and solely blamed the Republican Party for refusing to pass a clean bill. ""But doesn\'t everyone bear responsibility, including — and especially — the president?"" Welker asked. ""The responsibility to make sure that we do not default? It sits in the hands of Congress. And right now it is Speaker McCarthy and the MAGA wing… of the Republican conference. It is up to them to get this done. They are wasting time. And I\'ve already laid out what they did propose, how much that\'s going to hurt American families who are trying to make ends meet,"" Jean-Pierre responded. Welker pointed out, ""The president said, ‘Show me your budget.’ He didn\'t say, ‘Show me a budget that I agree with.’"" Jean-Pierre repeatedly interrupted, ""Well, you have to finish — you have to finish the statement. He said — well, you have to finish what he said,"" she said as Welker continued trying to ask a question. ""The statement that he made — his quote is, \'Show me your budget, and I\'ll show you what you value.\' That\'s what the president said. And by looking at this blueprint, by looking at the plan, they are certainly showing us their value."" Ateba has frequently sparred with Jean-Pierre, accusing her of discriminating against him and other reporters by ignoring members of the press placed in the back of the room. Those fights escalated multiple times throughout the year. One of the more contentious exchanges occurred in June after Jean-Pierre insisted that the White House was ""committed to the freedom of the press."" Ateba followed up, asking, ""So are you going to take questions from me?… because you’ve been discriminating against me for the past nine months."" ""You’re incredibly rude. You’re being incredibly rude,"" Jean-Pierre responded before later adding, ""If this continues, we’re going to end the press briefing."" ""I’ve been in this briefing room. I’ve been trying to ask you one question when I am on,"" Ateba responded. ""You\'re not giving freedom of the press."" Today News Africa reporter Simon Ateba and White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. (Getty Images) Ateba previously attacked Jean-Pierre for ""making a mockery of the First Amendment"" in March. ""This is not China. This is not Russia. What you are doing you’re making a mockery of the First Amendment,"" Ateba said at one point. Throughout the rant, a woman offscreen repeatedly yelled ""decorum,"" urging Ateba to quiet down. Attempting to make light of the situation, Karine Jean-Pierre turned around to the Lasso cast and said, ""fun times, welcome, guys,"" before asking Ateba if he was ""going to behave."" The White House press corps members appeared agitated with Ateba, grumbling and sporadically yelling at him to cease his vocal displeasure with Jean-Pierre’s conduct. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: 10 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY In June, the House Ways and Means Committee released testimony from IRS whistleblowers who alleged misconduct in the handling of the tax probe investigating Biden\'s son Hunter. Among the findings was an alleged WhatsApp text message Hunter Biden sent to a Chinese business associate using his father as part of what Republicans say was an illicit scheme. Reporters from CNN, New York Times, New York Post, Newsmax and NBC News all pressed Jean-Pierre on these allegations, only for the press secretary to refuse to answer. ""I\'m just not going to get into family discussion, personal family discussion,"" Jean-Pierre initially responded. ""As you know, Hunter\'s his son. I\'m just not going to get into that."" After repeated questions on the whistleblowers’ testimonies, Jean-Pierre appeared even more agitated towards New York Post correspondent Steven Nelson. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused to answer questions regarding Hunter Biden. (Getty Images) ""Steven, Steven, I just answered the question,"" she sternly replied. ""It\'s not up to you how I answer the question. I just answered the question by telling you my colleagues at the White House counsel have dealt with this, and I would refer you to them."" Jean-Pierre also stated that she was not planning on discussing the matter with the president. In October, Nelson sparred once again with Jean-Pierre, calling her out for not answering his questions for ""two seasons.""

'version': '2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': ""Since the genre began, punk music has held strong to the ethos of doing it yourself, or DIY for short. Very few punk bands make a living playing this music, it wasn’t commercially viable even before the recording industry was hollowed out by the rise of streaming services. Venues for aggressive music exist in cities with big enough scenes to support them, but in most of America these established venues are few and far between. This is where the DIY ethos shines, and how houses become DIY venues. Pat Jarrett, from the Virginia Folklife Program, began documenting DIY punk house venues in 2021. Playing shows and experiencing live music with his peers is a connection he’s nurtured since adolescence, and he’s never known life without that connection. Jarrett’s photos are on display with an essay by Harrisonburg’s Grant Penrod (from the band Crab Action) at the Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art in Virginia Beach as part of their group show, More Than Shelter, until February 5, 2023. In this episode of Folklife Fieldnotes, Pat shares sound he recorded at a variety of house venues in Virginia, along with an interview he did featuring Rocky McIntire who runs Cactus Crypt, a DIY house venue in Stephens City. ** Bands Featured In This Episode** Trapp Hill Collision (Stephens City); Crab Action (Harrisonburg); Lacking (Fredericksburg); Goat Piss (New Jersey); GWAR (Richmond) Pat Jarrett: So I've been going to a lot of basement shows lately. I've been working on a project about house venues in Virginia. A lot of punk and metal bands play in basements and play in houses. Because of Virginia's unique liquor license laws and beer license laws, you really can't have bars like we had in Cleveland growing up. In Cleveland, they're just bars with stages and they were open, they sold booze, they sold beer, and they had bands on stage and that was it. But in Virginia, you need to be able to sell food. So what that does is it forces a lot of these bands into DIY spaces and those are house shows. Harrisonburg was a hotbed of house show activity for years - still is. So Harrisonburg has JMU and it hasn’t always been the JMU that people know today. The downtown wasn't always what it was. There hasn’t always been venues. So I remember when I first moved here, people were talking about the house shows here in Harrisonburg. Grant Penrod, who is the front man of the punk band Crab Action, gave me a whole history of growing up here in Harrisonburg. Grant told me that they were probably about a dozen houses that were active at any time when he was growing up in the 80s and 90s and he was a skater going to shows. One of the longest-running in Harrisonburg is Crayola House and it has been active since the 90s which in house venue years is equivalent of an ancient artifact. This is like the Roman Colosseum having NASCAR races. Some of these houses in Harrisonburg would be active for a semester. They might be active for sometimes a show. As always, and is still the case, you have to know to know - you have to be part of the scene, the going phrase on the flyers is always “ask a punk for the address.” I talked to Rocky McIntyre up in Stephens City at the Cactus Crypt. Chris Boros: The cactus Crypt is one of these houses? PJ: Yeah, the Cactus Crypt is his venue. And the thing that he talks about is punk is a youth movement and the kids need a place to go. Rocky McIntyre: There's a lot of love for music around here, but the metal scene is much more active. There's always shows going on at Blue Fox, but the punk scene doesn't crossover because it's a younger crowd and they can't get into those venues, simply by not being 18. There are definitely kids in this area that want to experience live music and punk rock, and they want to embrace it, but kind of the only chance they really get to is when something happens at the Bright Box. It's like a big thing. It's a big deal. When Destructor Disc did their show there, I think 270 something people showed up to it. And they were all under 20. People would show up. It's just they need a place to show up to. Punk is a youth driven movement. We have 14, 15 year old kids coming to our shows here. That's awesome but that wouldn't happen when we're playing at a bar. It's going to be an older crowd and a crowd that's probably not really into punk rock either. CB: Explain to me what is a house punk concert? What is it like when you go to the Crayola House? PJ: Well, first of all, a concert is a pretty formal term. It’s a show. They're advertised - back in the day it was flyers, you hung up at the record store. You put them at the skate shop. Now a lot of it is on social media but you kind of have to know. Now there's a note that says DM for the address. Send a direct message for the address and that's so that you can be screened. We’ll check you out. CB: It's almost like needing the password at a speakeasy. PJ: It kind of is, man. CB: Pat sent me! Rocky: It's pretty hard for younger musicians to have a place to thrive because they can't play at the Blue Fox or Granny's. They can't go to shows there and booking at Bright Box is hard. Now that we have the space and we can just throw whatever shows we want, I can plan shows that we're not playing, I can focus on that stuff so that the bands can just focus on playing. They don't have the stress of having to set up their own PA and run their own sound. PJ: Over the past year, I’ve been photographing different houses around Virginia and surrounding areas. What I found out is that these places not only serve the bands, but it also acts as an incubator because the people that go to house shows are enthusiastic about the music. They know what they're getting into and they are more likely to talk to their friends about a band they saw at a house because they're passionate about it. It's kind of twofold the benefit of these small spaces. And a lot of these bands that will fill basements, you'll see them at clubs and people will be like, we're did all of these people come from? This is the first time they're on our stage. How are they filling the place up? And it's because they were selling out basements. CB: Do people live at the Crayola house? PJ: Yeah, these are residences. And so you have to take some precautions. There's a lot of trust and there's a lot of respect that comes along with inviting strangers into your house to see punk music. CB: I never thought of it that way, that you really are inviting people you don't know into your home, there has to be a lot of trust. PJ: There's a lot of trust and you see that. I went to a house in Takoma Park, Maryland, called Hell. It was one of the most radically accepting and loving places I've ever been. The community was so tight. I've never heard the phrase “I love you” more outside of a family gathering than I did at Hell that night. These communities, they really are communities, support each other. It's really full of love and acceptance and it's a great place for the weirdos and the punks to go to express themselves. It's awesome. CB: It seems like this community, they need a space like this to express themselves. PJ: That's it. Because a lot of the music is very extreme. And people need a place to go to express themselves and these DIY spaces provide that. Rocky: We are sitting at the Cactus Crypt in Stephens City, Virginia. There was a flyer I saw for these two bands that were playing a show. One of the bands was called the Cryptkeeper 5 and the other band was called White Cactus and the way it was laid out the words cactus and crypt were next to each other and I saw it and something just clicked and I was like, that’s the name. The Winchester scene is really interesting because there is both a punk and a metal scene. But metal really dominates because the metal scene exists in the bars around here. Blue Fox and Granny’s are like the bigger spots around here and then there's another venue called the Bright Box where anyone can book. That's where a lot of the punk bands play. Yeah, it's""}]"
