The Heartwarmers Quilt Guild donated the “Be Thy Neighbor” quilt in March, with raffle tickets selling through the end of April at local businesses. Skogen says she purchased just one raffle ticket, which was the lucky winner in a drawing conducted by the Clinic Search Committee on Tuesday, Apr. 30 at the Buffalo Center Tribune office.

Passengers queue for rebooking at Frankfurt Airport this month after workers went on strike, forcing hundreds of flight cancellations across Germany A wave of strike action has brought Germany to a standstill in recent weeks, as Europe\'s largest economy has struggled for growth and consumers have felt the pinch from sky-high inflation. Rail, bus and airport workers have walked out one after another amid bitter salary negotiations in a country that usually prides itself on good labour relations. The latest industrial action by airport ground staff on Wednesday led to the cancellation of 90 percent of Lufthansa flights, according to the Verdi union. At Germany\'s biggest airport in Frankfurt, 500 of the day\'s 1,100 planned flights were cancelled. How did the strikes start to pile up? Here are five things to know: Since the end of 2022, Germany has seen growing labour unrest, while real wages have fallen by four percent since the start of the war in Ukraine. A clutch of sectors received pay rises last year -- sometimes up to 10 percent -- but the new settlements did not ease tensions as inflation stayed high at 5.3 percent last year. The continued price pressure has strained pay talks and led to the number of strikes multiplying. At the end of January, train drivers staged a five-day walkout, before workers at airports and local transport services followed with their own industrial action. ""Workers have really felt the loss of income, they have less money in their pocket at the end of the month,"" Alexander Gallas, a political science professor at the University of Kassel, told AFP. At the same time, the unions\' bargaining power is strengthened by serious labour shortages plaguing German businesses. But union demands are clashing with ""the fact that many businesses are in crisis and do not have much to distribute"", making a quick resolution complicated, according to Hagen Lesch from the IW economic think tank. The proliferation of strikes has called into question the future of Germany\'s otherwise consensus-driven labour relations. ""It is the moment of truth for the German model,"" Lesch said. ""Unions were more willing to compromise during the coronavirus pandemic. That is over."" Germany has historically been among the countries in Europe where workers went on strike the least. Between 2012 and 2021, just 18 out of every 1,000 work days were disrupted by industrial action, compared with 92 out of every 1,000 in France. Collective agreements, which long underpinned the system, now cover just 43 percent of workers compared with 56 percent in 2010. But the current wave of strikes has enjoyed strong support among workers, according to experts, even if a single figure is not available.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 3:38 pm VINTON — Each year, the Smith-Geater Veterans of Foreign Wars Auxiliary 8884 holds an essay contest for third, fourth, and fifth graders in V-S Schools. This year, Shellsburg Elementary third grader Zachary Kuhn from Mrs. Patterson’s class wrote an essay that won first place in the district. Zachary’s winning essay: “I love America because we are free. If it wasn’t for our veterans we would not be free. Since you fought for our freedom I am able to do things I enjoy like playing football and playing basketball and spending time with my family. In the future I will work hard and not forget that you gave us freedom. Thank you very much.” The Annual Essay Contest is statewide, across the ten districts of the Iowa Veterans of Foreign Wars Auxiliary Department. This year, students at eight out of ten districts entered an essay. In V-S schools, 114 third-graders; 117 fourth-graders; and 63 fifth-graders submitted an essay, for a total of 294. 17 teachers did the essay as a classroom project. Each year the essay title for third grade is “I love America because…”. For fourth and fifth graders, the title is selected each year by the VFW Auxiliary Department President. This year’s title for fourth grade was “I am Grateful for Veterans Because….”, and for fifth grade, “I am Proud to be an American Because...”. Auxiliary 8884 President Jeannette Henry, who also serves as Department of Iowa Veterans of Foreign Wars Auxiliary Americanism Chairman, said that this year’s titles were more special than usual. “When I wrote my Americanism Program for Dru Novak, she asked if I would be her Americanism Chairman. I told her it would be my honor. Little did we know that she would pass away in March before her year was complete. This year was special since she had chosen these titles before she passed away,” Henry said. All 294 students who participate in the essay contest receive a certificate made by Henry and other members from Auxiliary 8884. “One of our other Auxiliaries members wrote the student’s names on certificates. Then their essays are put back to back and laminated. The top ten students in each of three grades receive a medal, engraved with their name, their teacher’s name, and Auxiliary 8884. The company Just Awards does the engraving for free. Each medal has a red, white, and blue ribbon attached to the medal,” Henry said. First place winners in each grade advance to the District competition. Second place winners in each of three grades will receive a certificate and $25. An assembly is held in the spring at each V-S elementary school, where first-place winners’ parents are invited for the medal presentation. As Department Americanism Chairman, Henry will announce the top two winners from the district in each grade at the Midwinter conference, which will be held this year February 23-24, in Des Moines. “Our third grader placed first place at the Department competition out of eight districts. We are proud of him and all the students and teachers and staff that supported our Auxiliary 8884. Our small towns support our veterans all year round,” Henry said.

Little did Christensen know, the class would not only have a lasting and important impact on him, but he would become an important figure for the program, being elected the iJAG State President.As educators work to bring relevance and meaning to the skills taught in classrooms, finding ways to bridge what is learned in the classrooms and the skills needed in the workplace has gained momentum and interest. iJAG is the Iowa affiliate of the nonprofit nationwide JAG (Jobs for American Graduates) organization. iJAG started out as 6 programs offered in one Iowa high school in 1999 and has grown to 155 iJAG programs across the state in middle schools and high schools. Laurie Phelan, a former state department of education official, started iJAG as a nonprofit organization on what she termed as “blind faith” to help every student succeed. Over the last 24 years, iJAG has not only seen growth, but achieved commendable achievements. These include a 97% graduation rate among students in the program, recognition from the National Dropout Prevention Center as a model program, acknowledgement from the Iowa Department of Labor as a Quality Pre-Apprenticeship Program, and played a pivotal role in establishing the first learning center, IGNITE Pathways in Woodbine, IA.Woodbine piloted an IGNITE Pathways school in 2021 which partners with and uses JAG models for teaching. Harlan Community School District started an iJAG program in 2023 with Lori Pilachai, iJAG Education Specialist, as the teacher. What started with 6 students has grown to 58 in its first year alone. Not only that, in a Leadership Development Conference that met in Des Moines, Christensen gave a speech to an audience of over a thousand at the capital about servant leadership. His speech had been chosen amongst 10 others across the state. Each school had one vote to cast, and Christensen was elected as the preinterm State President for iJAG. His term will start the fall of 2024 when the current president from Des Moines North High School, Alontae Gross’s term ends.The course is student driven. Opportunities are provided, but students lead meetings and take initiative to pursue career shadowing they may be curious about. Christensen leads many of the meetings. Christensen also attended the National Student Leadership Academy to begin his presidential role. On November 30th - December 2nd, Christensen was flown out to Washington D.C. to meet with other iJAG associates across the nation and learn from representatives and iJAG partners about skills in leadership and how to be servant leaders. One of Christensen’s favorite things about the program and experiences so far is the confidence he has gained from it. Christensen, who also gives thanks to his dad Paul Christensen for his support and acceptance, gives the advice, “ Strive to be unordinary, because being different is probably the best thing that has ever happened to me.”Pilachai is currently searching for job shadowing opportunities for students during or after school hours. After school and weekend internships or apprenticeships are also great opportunities. As part of the coursework, iJAG students are expected to complete 15 hours of community service. “If a company would like to ‘try on’ a student through community service prior to offering a paid position, that could benefit both student and business,” Palachai suggested.There is specific interest in the following professions: cosmetologist, cook/chef, music, engineer, accountant, nurse, psychologist, welder, architect, IT tech.“I also have students who are undecided in regards to career goals. Opportunities to shadow a variety of businesses may be helpful for these students,” stated Pilachai. Anyone interested in becoming a partner, can email to Lori.Pilachai@ijag.org.Though Christensen is not sure exactly what his path as iJAG State President will look like and where it will lead him, the possibilities are endless. A lot of unknowns also surround the program, as the HCSD makes room from its growth by reaching out to the community and businesses for partnerships and awareness and hires on another educator for an additional class next school year.

nation\'s most fractious poll in recent history. ""I believe in democracy and I think my vote matters,"" said 22-year-old psychology student Haleema Shafiq, among the first to vote in the capital Islamabad. ""I cast my vote as it\'s my duty,"" she told AFP inside a polling station. ""I wish for a deserving party to come to power."" Polls opened at 8:00 am (0300 GMT) for 128 million eligible voters, with the first participants trickling into the Noorpur Shahan girl\'s school and inking their fingers before stamping papers in gender-segregated booths. Early voters were outnumbered by around a dozen armed security personnel staffing the station, a day after twin blasts claimed by the Islamic State group killed 28 outside candidate offices in the nation\'s southwest. ""I want a government that can make Pakistan safe for girls,"" said Shafiq. Analysts predict a low turnout after a muted campaign overshadowed by the jailing of ex-prime minister Imran Khan and the hobbling of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party by the military establishment. ""Is this the way an election should be conducted?"" asked 40-year-old Imran Khan, a driver who shares his name with the jailed opposition leader. ""Everyone has the right to vote according to their own will,"" he said. ""Today is not the day to stay at home. Those who choose to sit at home today will do injustice to themselves."" Monitors say the treatment of PTI amounts to ""pre-poll rigging"", and the party has voiced fears that voters would face interference at polling stations. In a nation where nearly 40 percent of adults are illiterate, the ballot papers featured symbols associated with different parties, varying from a tiger to an arrow and a set of scales. A Supreme Court decision stripped PTI of the right to use their cricket bat symbol, which alluded to the charismatic Khan\'s star sporting career. As a result, PTI\'s selected candidates are running as independents with a hodge-podge of symbols on ballot papers ranging from eggplants to bottles and beds. Analysts have said it\'s one more hurdle being used to disconnect PTI from their voter base.

Pate Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate today announced the date for the 2024 Statewide High School Voter Registration Day, Feb. 13. On this day, Iowa high school students are encouraged to take steps to register to vote, make a plan to vote when they are eligible, and learn more about Iowa’s voting process. “Of course, voting is one of the best ways to make your voice heard, and registering to vote is the first step in that process,” said Secretary Pate. “We find that often, when young people are educated about the election process, they are more comfortable in participating in Iowa’s elections when they are eligible.” There are currently more than 4,500+ 17-year-olds already registered to vote in Iowa. This number is significantly higher than 3,400+ 17-year-olds registered to vote in September 2023 in the weeks leading up to 2023 National Voter Registration Day. Iowa law allows 17-year-olds to register to vote and participate in Primary Elections if they turn 18 prior to or on the day of the General Election. With this statewide day of action, Secretary Pate is encouraging high schools in all 99 counties to host a voter registration drive and educate students on the voter registration and participation process. Iowa law requires high schools to conduct two voter registration drives every school year. “Exercising your right to vote is a powerful way to help shape the world we share,” said Iowa Department of Education Director McKenzie Snow. “High School Voter Registration Day is an outstanding opportunity to learn more about the electoral process while taking the first step to fulfill your critical responsibility as engaged citizens.” Currently 2.2 million Iowans are registered to vote. Iowa has some of the best voter registration and participation rates in the nation and is ranked in the top three nationally for election administration.

President Joe Biden picks up an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union, an important boost to the Democratic president\'s reelection bid. “I’m honored to have your back and you have mine,” Biden responded Wednesday. “That’s the deal.” DES MOINES — A public employees union could be nullified if its public employer — like the state, school board or local government — fails to submit a list of workers eligible to vote in a recertification election under legislation advanced Wednesday by Republican lawmakers. The bill’s manager said during a legislative hearing the measure is needed to plug a loophole in the state collective bargaining law by which public unions were avoiding required elections. But one Democratic critic called it “union-busting.” From 2020 through 2022, the state did not receive information on union-eligible employees in more than 40% of instances in which a union was required to be recertified by a vote of its eligible workers, according to the Public Employment Relations Board, the state board that manages public employer-worker relations. That means in 40% of instances in which a union was required to be recertified, no election was conducted, according to the board. Sen. Nate Boulton, a Democrat from Des Moines and a lawyer, said that typically happens when the public employer is certain a bargaining unit would recertify or has a good working relationship with the unit and its workers, and thus does not feel compelled to force the election. Sen. Jason Schultz, a Republican from Schleswig, however, interprets it differently. Schultz said he believes some public employers are allowing unions to skip recertification elections to maintain harmony with workers and the unions that represent them. From left, Iowa Sens. Brad Zaun, R-Urbandale, and Jason Schultz, R-Schleswig, speak on the Senate floor while a vote is taken during debate Oct. 5, 2021. Schultz disputed the idea that Reynolds is directing Republican lawmakers, but he said her popularity has given her the confidence to be more vocal about her priorities. Schultz said he believes that after statehouse Republicans in 2017 passed a state law that stripped public worker unions of most of their collective bargaining rights, some of those bargaining units have been “gaming the system.” Schultz said his bill, Senate Study Bill 3158, would address that by decertifying a union if the employer fails to provide the list of eligible employees. “I believe, and I think the data shows, that the majority, if not all public employers who are not submitting the list are in sympathy with the union and not wanting to put them through a retention election, possibly because they know that the employees don’t feel they need representation. So we have removed the motive for a sympathetic employer to not submit the list,” Schultz said. The rate at which an eligible employee list was not provided to the state and a recertification election was not held fell to 26% in 2023, according to state data. Representatives of labor unions who spoke at the hearing on Schultz’s proposal at the Iowa Capitol said that figure dropped after the law was tweaked through the rule-making process by putting pressures on employers with hearings and penalties. Boulton called Schultz’s proposal an attempt to break up public worker unions. Boulton noted that in the years since the 2017 state law change, public worker unions have voted to recertify unions at high rates. Over the past four years, more than 700 bargaining units voted to recertify, while only 58 voted against recertification, according to state figures. “But now, Republicans are pushing (Schultz’s bill), which allows employers to cancel union elections before they even happen. The agenda is obvious: eliminate workplace rights, limit wages and benefits, and bust unions,” Boulton said in a statement. “We fought against the Republican union-busting agenda in 2017, filling the Capitol with workers and debating the bill all through the night. We won’t let them make another anti-worker power grab without a fight,” Boulton’s statement said. “We know Iowans want higher wages, better workplace protections, and a higher quality of life — not weaker laws and fewer rights. Now is the time for Iowans to stand up and speak out against Republican politicians’ anti-worker agenda.” Schultz, after Wednesday’s hearing, insisted his intention is not to break up public employee unions, but to ensure compliance with state law. He noted that, under the proposal, if an employer fails to submit the list of union-eligible workers, the bargaining unit can ask the state courts to compel the employer to comply. “My intent is not to beat up or beat down on any further (bargaining) units. But I want this loophole closed because I do believe labor organizations are gaming the system,” Schultz said. Schultz and fellow Republican Sen. Adrian Dickey, of Packwood, signed off on advancing the bill out of subcommittee Wednesday, making it eligible for consideration by the full Senate Workforce Committee. The third legislator on the subcommittee panel, Democratic Sen. Todd Taylor of Cedar Rapids, declined to put his support behind the bill. Representatives for labor organizations representing teachers, police officers and firefighters were among those who spoke in opposition to the bill during the public comment period of Wednesday’s hearing. Some expressed concern that a public employer could put a bargaining unit on a path to decertification by intentionally withholding the required list of union-eligible workers. Schultz said he does not believe any public employer would do that. But if it did happen, the bargaining unit would have the ability to petition the courts. The only groups who spoke in favor of the bill are financed by the conservative Americans for Prosperity and the Michigan-based Mackinac Center for Public Policy, both of which advocate across the country for conservative, limited government and free-market policies. The Mackinac Center in 2020 published a report titled, “Top 20 State-Level Labor Reforms.” To hear Hollywood talk about the current moment in labor history, American workers stand on a precipice.

At the Never Back Down office on Saturday, DeSantis told a crowd of supporters that they would never experience an election ""as meaningful as this one is going to be,"" urging them to brave sub-zero temperatures to caucus on Monday night. “They can throw a blizzard at us, and we are gonna fight. They can throw wind chill at us, and we are gonna fight,"" DeSantis told the cheering crowd. ""They can throw media narratives at us, and we are gonna fight. They can throw fake polls at us, and we are gonna fight. We are going to fight because we are going to turn this country around."" Brianne Pfannenstiel contributed reporting.

NEW YORK — Wall Street rose to the edge of another record-breaking milestone Wednesday as Ford Motor, Chipotle Mexican Grill and other big stocks climbed following their latest earnings reports. The S&P 500 got within a fraction of a point of the 5,000 level before ending the day at 4,995.06. The index rose 40.83 points, or 0.8%, to set another all-time closing high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 156.00 points, or 0.4%, to 38,677.36, and the Nasdaq composite gained 147.65 points, or 0.9%, to 15,756.64. A relatively calm day in the bond market helped keep things smooth for the stock market, despite some concerns about investors\' ability to digest a $42 billion auction of 10-year Treasurys by the U.S. government. Beneath the surface, though, were still some very sharp moves. The New York Community Bancorp logo is displayed Jan. 31 above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. New York Community Bancorp went from an initial gain to a steep loss of 14% and back to a gain of 6.7%. It\'s the latest dizzying swing for the bank, which is still down by more than half since rattling investors across the industry last week with a surprise loss. The bank is struggling with challenges related to its acquisition of Signature Bank, one of the banks that collapsed last year. New York Community Bancorp is also feeling pain from a problem dogging all kinds of banks worldwide: weakness in commercial real estate. Moody\'s downgraded the bank\'s credit rating to ""junk"" status from the lowest tier of investment-grade. Analysts also said they were concerned about the recent departures of key risk and audit executives. In response, the bank said it increased its deposits and gave details about how much cash it has on hand. Stocks of other regional banks were caught up in the drama, to a lesser degree, which brought back uncomfortable memories of last year\'s banking crisis. The KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking index swung between losses and gains through the day before ending 0.1% lower. UBS analyst Brody Preston said New York Community Bancorp\'s latest quarterly loss and dividend cut are due to problems related specifically to it and ""are not necessarily a proverbial canary in the coal mine for other banks in the space."" However, attention is likely to remain on potential bank losses tied to commercial real estate, particularly after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen highlighted them as a concern recently. Elsewhere on Wall Street, Chipotle Mexican Grill rose 7.2% after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its restaurants sold more meals to customers than they did a year earlier. CVS Health gained 3.1% after it likewise topped expectations for both profit and revenue in the final three months of 2023. However, the drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager also trimmed its forecast for full-year results. Ford Motor climbed 6% following its better-than-expected results, while Enphase Energy soared 16.9% despite falling just shy of forecasts. Investors hope weakness in demand for the supplier of solar and battery systems is nearing a bottom. They helped offset a 9.7% drop for VF Corp., the company behind Vans, The North Face and other brands. It reported weaker results than analysts expected. Snap tumbled 34.6% after its fourth-quarter revenue fell short of analysts\' expectations. The company behind Snapchat also gave a tepid forecast for 2024 after saying Monday it would lay off 10% of its workforce. Wall Street was also trying to game out the impacts from an announcement that ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery are planning to launch a streaming platform for sports. Many details are still to be worked out, as is how the deal will impact prices for broadcasting rights with sports leagues. But fuboTV, a streaming service that offers sports, fell 22.7%. In the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4.11% from 4.09% late Tuesday following the auction. Bonds have been on a jagged run recently as signals of a remarkably resilient economy force traders to push back forecasts for when the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates. While a delay in rate cuts hurts the stock market, strong economic data also carry an upside for investors: They should mean stronger profits for companies. Such hopes helped stocks build on their breakneck rally, which began in October, supplanting earlier hopes that a cooldown in inflation could mean imminent cuts to rates. In stock markets abroad, indexes were modestly lower in Europe and mixed in Asia. Stocks rose 1.4% in Shanghai but slipped 0.3% in Hong Kong following authorities\' moves this week to prop up what have been some of the world\'s worst-performing markets this year. Photo Credit: JLco Julia Amaral / Shutterstock One of the most common routes to attaining upward mobility in the U.S. is business ownership. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, America is home to more than 33 million small businesses, and more than 5 million applications for new businesses are received every year. These include both individually-operated businesses such as sole proprietorships or single-member LLCs and firms with employees beside the owner. And this path can be quite profitable: business equity represents 34% of Americans’ wealth from nonfinancial assets, and the typical net worth of self-employed families is more than four times higher than for families that are workers. Many Americans believe that another key ingredient for success is college attainment. Postsecondary education is strongly correlated with better employment outcomes, lower poverty rates, and higher lifetime earnings. However, as college costs have increased in recent decades, the public has become increasingly skeptical about the return on investment of a college degree. But between the earning potential for business owners and the financial and opportunity costs of college attendance, it’s no surprise to find that more than 7.5 million Americans who own a business never attended college. Amid record-high inflation and tuition, more business owners are forgoing college Source: Flippa analysis of U.S. Census Bureau\'s American Community Survey data | Image Credit: Flippa College education has become more common in the U.S. population over time, which has in turn led to a decline in the share of business owners opting out of a college education. In 2000, nearly half of all business owners—47.2%—had never attended college, but as of 2022, that figure sits at 41.9%. However, after nearly two decades of declines, this trend is showing signs of slowing or even reversing. College costs have risen by more than half since the year 2000, from $17,376 to $26,903, and many college attendees continue to take on significant debt loads to finance their education. At the same time, record inflation in recent years has further strained Americans’ finances, while high interest rates have increased borrowing costs for student loans. As these trends have converged, it makes sense that more business owners are deciding against a college education. The share of business owners who never went to college increased in 7 out of the nation\'s 10 largest industries Source: Flippa analysis of U.S. Census Bureau\'s American Community Survey data | Image Credit: Flippa College credentials are often a requirement in many industries and occupations, which can close off some of the potential options available for non-college educated business owners and make other fields more desirable. Among the nation’s 10 largest industries (measured by number of business owners), the share of owners who never went to college exceeds 50% in all but three: real estate (23.0%), consulting (8.9%), and legal services (5.1%). Furthermore, the proportion of owners who never went to college increased in seven of these 10 largest industries between 2020 and 2022. While the statistics pertaining to the nation’s largest industries may not be surprising given their nature, what is more interesting is that these trends are also affecting many unsuspecting sectors. For example, between 2020 and 2022 the concentration of non-college educated business owners increased in a number of tech and finance-related fields, such as design services, securities investing, insurance, advertising, and e-commerce.

The concentration of college-educated business owners in a location tends to correlate with that location’s rates of educational attainment overall. Many of the states with the highest share of non-college business owners are found in parts of the country where fewer people go to college in general. For example, more than half of all business owners in Arkansas (51.6%) forwent college, and the state has the third-lowest rate of college attainment.

created with the help of Senator Chuck Grassley, through bipartisanship, to create equal opportunities for all students, so that regardless of whether you lived in a rural area or an urban area, all children and educators had equal access and support to ensure Iowa students could achieve at the fullest. As a special education teacher, I greatly benefitted from the help I received from the Area Education Agency. I was able to increasingly improve my teaching, as we all collaborated to see my students to their next steps beyond school and prepare them for independent living. After teaching, I served as a curriculum director, principal, and superintendent in several rural Iowa schools. In all of these capacities, I frequently reached out to AEA staff for math, literacy, and science materials and professional learning opportunities for our teachers. Our schools incorporated AEA personnel as a part of our school improvement planning teams to study student data and determine ways to create increased positive outcomes for students. This frequently involved making modifications to our curriculum and instruction, which often meant more professional learning for us with the help of content experts from our AEA. In 2015, I moved from being a superintendent in rural Iowa to a superintendency in rural Connecticut. I shared seven school districts which served 1600 students and encompassed 275 square miles. I quickly learned two things about the regional service centers in Connecticut: 1) they did not have special education staff to assist schools and 2) professional learning, curriculum materials, and other supports to schools were on a pay for use basis. This required that we hire our own speech and language pathologists, school psychologists, contract out for occupational and physical therapists and vision and hearing specialists and pay for any specialized educational materials and equipment that some students required. To coordinate these professionals’ time and efforts with our seven rural schools necessitated that we have someone dedicated to oversee special education. For salary and benefits, travel between the seven schools, contracted services, and specialized curriculum materials and equipment for students, the annual cost was over $3.4 million dollars from our districts’ budgets. In Iowa, these services would be provided by the district’s AEA in Iowa. A school district in Iowa with 1600 students would receive approximately $600,000 in special education flow-through money that then gives the district these special education services. This should make us all take pause. Without the AEAs, more schools will pay more, especially rural schools, which could result in increased property taxes. Our current system enables our state to provide major cost efficiencies to our schools and guarantees the high quality services by specially trained personnel. In addition, since neither the Connecticut schools nor the regional service centers were accountable for children from birth to three, responsibility for the infants and toddlers fell to the state health and human services agencies, which meant there was not a seamless transition for infants to preschool, such as what exists with our Early Access program in Iowa. It was extremely difficult to find quality staff for our rural part of the state for these positions, as a number of professionals often preferred to have less travel and work in urban areas. A job vacancy had few if any applicants. When an educator called to request professional materials from the educational service center, if the center even had the materials, it was the school’s responsibility to acquire them. Not like the AEAs in Iowa who locate and deliver materials to schools every week at no additional cost. It is essential that we in Iowa understand what we have. We have a strong and connected system that works. The AEAs have worked to support all schools with staff, educational materials, and professional development. The AEAs and the schools in Iowa do not focus solely on students with special needs, but on all children. We consider that every child is a general education student first; helping to assist them with any learning needs that exist. If a student requires specialized services, this is provided with a group of professionals that work with the school and the family and follow that student throughout their school experience. If Iowa loses this system, these strong supports that have been so carefully woven together will be gone. We will lose many of the current professionals employed by the AEAs. Schools who are already having difficulty with budgets will be forced to reallocate their purchasing power. We will have inconsistencies in services from one part of the state to another. This will result in some children who will be served and others who will not. The Iowa Department of Education is supposed to be our schools’ first line of educational support and innovation. If the governor is questioning the quality of our state’s education, shouldn’t the Department be her first area of attention? Since the Iowa Department of Education, the governor, and her last several appointed directors have not been able to meet past expectations, how can we be assured that this top down approach will meet increased future demands? For years, school administrators have had little faith in the DE’s services. Administrators and teachers have much on their plates. We have a shortage of qualified special education professionals in our state. We cannot expect to pile on to each of their current responsibilities and yield better outcomes for our students. As a former special education teacher and administrator, I will say that not everyone in either of these professions has all of the knowledge they need to do what the staff at the AEAs do. And because of that, if this law goes through in any way shape or form, we will see huge disparities in how educators and students are served in this state. And when this happens, that is the greatest tragedy of all. The governor’s proposals are wrong for Iowa. The AEA is a critical resource that our children desperately need today and will continue to require in the future. Let’s support our children’s education and give them the best chance to succeed by preserving the AEA. Dr. Pam Vogel 2430 Terrace Road Des Moines, Iowa You must be logged in to post a comment.

More unlikely known is the Committee’s portal for whistleblowers to contact or submit documents via email to Judiciary_Whistleblower@mail.house.gov. Its ‘Select Subcommittee on Weaponization of the Federal Government’ (SS-WFG) is particularly appropriate for Americans who wish to see an investigation of the IRS for its targeted investigation of Euro Pacific Bank (EPB) and co-owner Peter Schiff. This online article contains an expansion of the content of my letter, yes - the whistleblower’s letter, addressed to Chairman Jim Jordan of the House of Representatives’ Committee on the Judiciary on 03 Jan 2024 [2]; a print article with the same title in the River Cities’ Reader of 03 Jan 2024 was an abridged version of the letter. Notifying the committee alone will unlikely lead to an investigation; for the committee to take action, our leaders need to hear your voice specifically calling to support an investigation of the IRS targeting EPB and Peter Schiff. Bank Closures of Two Kinds Schiff started EPB in 2011 after the 2008 financial crisis; the bank tailored its offerings for what depositors demanded - Safe, Digital, and Global banking. EPB provided risk free international banking, foreign currency exchange, investments in precious metal and brokerage accounts, and mutual funds. EPB moved to Puerto Rico from the St. Vincent in the Caribbean because of Puerto Rico’s more favorable jurisdiction. In Puerto Rico EPB could more easily obtain a direct relationship with the federal reserve and directly issue MasterCard, Visa or American Express cards – not because of more relaxed regulations in Puerto Rico but because of Puerto Rico’s better reputation for more compliance. In fact, EPB gave up the opportunity to take advantage of a bank secrecy law in St. Vincent when it moved to Puerto Rico. The bank attempted to refrain from admitting any U.S. citizen customers, but Schiff was intending to expand its customer base to include them. Banking at EPB was risk free because it was a full-reserve (100% reserve) bank - meaning the bank did not lend out depositors’ assets. Its account holders could liquidate gold and silver into international currency 24/7, and utilize the funds with bank cards via ATM withdraws or transactions with merchants across 210 countries and territories. Most of EPB’s customers were international companies. Schiff has nearly one million Twitter and over half a million YouTube followers of his regular analysis of financial markets, the federal reserve, predictions of the demise of the world reserve currency and other fiat currencies, the return to gold and silver as money, and criticism of taxation, economy, and monetary policies. Most of his followers did not have accounts with EPB. One might argue that expansion of EPB’s customers to include citizens of the United States was an additional favorable market opportunity. On 02 Sep 2020 Schiff granted an interview in his home in Connecticut with Nick McKenzie of Australia’s network ‘Nine’, which publishes The Age and broadcasts 60 Minutes Australia; the interview was granted under the expectation that the questions asked were about the economy, markets, currencies, etc., not EPB. In the unedited interview McKenzie asked Schiff, “Peter, to prepare for this interview, I have spoken to some investigators around the world. They say your bank is facilitating organized crime and corruption, money laundering, tax evasion – is that true?”[3]. On 18 Oct 2020, Charlotte Grieve, Nick McKenzie and Joel Tozer of The Age published an article expanding upon the allegations and 60 Minutes Australia broadcast an extremely abridged and misleading version of the interview [4-6]. Below: Raw video and audio (48 minutes) acquired by Schiff from discovery in his defamation lawsuit against Australia's 60 Minutes. Below: Australia's 60 Minutes broadcast from the 48 minute interview above: EPB’s model supported investors who desired to embrace gold and silver as well as equities in foreign markets so as to insulate themselves from the painful effects that would likely follow if Schiff’s predicted demise of the U.S. dollar came to fruition. This option challenged central banks’ existing fiat currencies and their natural evolution to digital fiat currencies. Is it coincidence that the IRS investigation led to a forced closure and liquidation of the bank and the defamation of Mr. Schiff [7,8]? All despite EPB having implemented one of the strictest, if not the most stringent, screening process for account holders world-wide (more later herein). Unsurprisingly, EPB, its employees, and owners were found to never have utilized the bank to facilitate money laundering, tax evasion or similar crimes. The OCIF appointed trustee has still not returned account holders’ assets [9]. Meanwhile, the second and third largest bank failures in U.S. history occurred in 2023 - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Both failed banks were fractional reserve banks, i.e., they lent customer deposits. Excessively risky loans and investments led to insolvency. Most customers were made whole via the FDIC up to the maximum covered account level of $250,000. But bailouts of ~$0.3B to $1B (~1,000 to ~4,000 times the FDIC maximum) were also made. According to federal regulators and officials, the bailouts were a necessary “systemic risk exception” for Americans with bank accounts, i.e., to avoid bank runs [10]. The IRS & J5 Target EPB & Peter Schiff The IRS, working in conjunction with international tax authorities of four other countries called the Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement or ‘J5’, targeted a bank co-owned by a United States citizen; the targeted bank was Euro Pacific Bank (EPB). On behalf of the IRS and the J5, Agent Jim Lee (Chief, IRS Criminal Investigation) publicly announced their investigation and named EPB specifically as their target. The IRS/J5 statement was coordinated with Puerto Rico’s OCIF Commissioner’s announcement of her office issuing a Cease & Desist Order to EPB in a press conference on 30 June 2022. The OCIF Commissioner reported that the sole shareholder at the time of the press conference was Peter Schiff (a United States citizen) [11-13]. Lee and the J5 stated that their coordinated ‘Day of Action’ named Operation Atlantis related to suspected crimes undertaken by EPB and took place two years earlier in January of 2020. But an email from the Netherlands government to a EPB customer indicates the IRS/J5 investigation of EPB was active as early as 2018 when the J5 was formed [14]. The Netherlands account holder was warned in 2018 to close his account because of expectations that EPB would be shut-down. Per Chief Lee, “During the day of action, each country independently executed enforcement actions consistent with the legal requirements in their countries. These actions included intelligence and information gathering, search warrants, interviews, production orders and subpoenas.”; in “a series of internationally led investigations” it was “revealed a number of clients used a series of sophisticated structures and international financial institutions to obfuscate their tax situations. These conscious attempts were for the purpose of evading their tax obligations and/or laundering the proceeds of their crimes.” [11]. The OCIF order was limited to accusations of failure to comply with regulations, not crimes, as affirmed by the Commissioner’s statement in the press conference that, “[T]he action is solely based on the lack of controls and lack of compliance with the requirements to operate, and the level of insolvency that the institution is. The action is not based upon claims of money laundering or other financial crimes.” However, the bank was not insolvent, as the trustee’s calculation on the same day of the press conference support [15]. And discovery in a defamation suit in Australia revealed EPB’s controls, screening of account holders and transactions, was proven to be very rigorous. However, Chief Lee and the J5 implied criminal wrongdoing in statements made in both the press conference and formal IRS/J5 media releases, all without any charges or any indictments to date [7,8, 11-14]. In the least, the IRS & J5 disclosures were inappropriate; however, the actions appear to be against federal policy [15] and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure [16]. Furthermore, the context and nature of what, when, and how the disclosures were made strongly support that the IRS intentionally misled the public and utilized domestic and international media to defame Mr. Schiff. The close collaboration of the OCIF with the IRS is highly suspect, not only because of OCIF actions, but because of the contrast between reported ‘facts’ and evidence Schiff obtained in discovery during a law suit with Australian network Nine (covered later herein). The bank was not actually insolvent, it used exemplary screening processes for applicants and account holders, and the OCIF did not permit Schiff to add more capital to the bank nor a qualified buyer to do the same while""}]"

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Short’s Burger and Shine in downtown Iowa City will remain open pending the outcome of an appeal from a lawsuit brought on by the restaurant’s landlord MidWestOne Bank. According to court filings, Short’s was ordered to vacate the premises of its restaurant at 18 S. Clinton St. by Feb. 10 after an order of judgment was filed on Jan. 31. The lawsuit alleged Short’s did not give MidWestOne Bank enough notice to renew the restaurant’s lease which ended in April 2023. The restaurant appealed the decision on Feb. 7, which will allow Short’s to stay at the property until the decision is determined. The bond to appeal was set at $4,147 according to Jan. 31 court filings. In the filing for the appeal, Short’s claims the court did not find burden of proof, findings of fact, and application of facts, among others. Short’s has been engaged in legal battles with MidWestOne Bank since 2022. The latest lawsuit in May 2023 is one of three lawsuits against Short’s from MidWestOne Bank. The other two lawsuits against Short’s were dismissed in April and March 2023. Short’s countersued MidWestOne Bank in March 2023 on claims the bank was not completing necessary repairs on the property that were required in the lease agreement. This lawsuit is still ongoing. According to a press release by Shearer Law Office, the lawyer in the case Shawn Shearer is quoted as “being pleased” that Short’s will remain open while the appeal goes through District Court. “My whole family and my employees are really grateful for the chance to be heard and the amount of public support we have received over the past week,” Kevin Perez, co-owner of Short’s Burger and Shine, said. “Thank you to everyone who has voiced support for this business and for saving H.D. Short’s building.” Perez spoke at the most recent meeting of Iowa City’s Ad Hoc Truth and Reconciliation Commission asking to put the protection of the property on the commission’s agenda due to the building’s history of Black ownership. The property was previously owned by third-generation African American business owner Haywood Belle. Belle died in 2016, leaving the building to a trust operated by MidWestOne Bank. No date in court has been set for the appeal at the time of this article’s publication.'}]"

Someone somewhere at some point tells someone else that they heard it’s gonna snow. When this rumor reached my dad, he’d swear, fuss and gripe. This led to the research. He’d watch the weather. Read the weather. And ask anyone he saw, “Did ya see the weather? What they say?” But the old man wouldn’t just take a meteorologist’s forecast of the weather, no. Every window he’d pass, the old man would look outside to see what it was doing. He would go outside every hour just to “check” what it was doing. I once saw him looking out the kitchen window with binoculars, I guess to see if it had snowed the next block over. It was during these times that you had to be extra quiet because he had to get his sleep, a nap here, a nap there, resting up. If you weren’t quiet, all hell would break loose. The old man would get angry and usually pull out his standard threat of throwing either you or the TV out, whichever one was making more noise. All of this leads up to the call. The bat phone would ring, and it would be Dad’s boss. They’d talk a minute, dad’d hang up, swear or groan, and say, “We’re goin’ out at two AM.” One consequence of having the old man as one of the local snow plow drivers is he would be the one going by the house. My ma would get up, bundle up, grab a shovel, and start scooping the driveway. Then my sister would get up and join her. I would help, but only in spurts due to the cold air and my asthma not mixing. We would shovel and shovel to get the driveway clear. My father would then drive by in the snow plow and fill it up again. I think the old man took a wee bit of pleasure in this sadistic action. I actually think I saw him laughing once as he went by. This being a small town and all where everybody knows everybody’s cousin, we’d be out and about and have people complain about him. They’d say to my ma, “Hey, could you tell your husband not to fill in my driveway every time he goes by?” My ma would reply by saying, “No, cause the %@$+@#! does it to us too.” One time, my ma, sister, and I were all out shovelin’ the snow. Suddenly, my ma slipped and fell into a snow drift. She didn’t get up. She didn’t get up. Finally, we asked if she was alright. A voice from the snow drift said, “Yeah, I’m just layin’ here.” My father is retired from the city now, so he does most of the shovelin’. Today, he went out before seven AM to start on it, for which there was no reason. It was my Ma’s day off. Work cancelled for my sister, so she was home. The old man is retired so he has nowhere urgent to go. And I’m always home. I probably shouldn’t say this. But since it’s just you and me here, I’ll go ahead and say it. My dad has been retired for a couple of years. And, he’s been taking the lead on shovelin’ the drive for a couple of years. And every single time I see him out there, just finishing up clearing the driveway. Almost done, but not yet. I wish upon a star that one of the guys drivin’ the snow plow now would come speedin’ by and fill the end of the driveway back in. Just frost it like a cake. I know…I’m a lil’ devil, ain’t I?

CHRISTOPHER PRICHARD Jury selection in the first-degree murder and robbery case of a Bellevue man was expected to begin Monday at the Jackson County Courthouse in Maquoketa. Christopher Eugene Prichard, 58, will stand trial for the murder of his estranged wife in October 2022. Due to the newspaper print deadline, coverage of the trial will begin in the Feb. 14 issue of the Sentinel-Press. Court documents estimate the trial will last about seven days. Prichard faces first-degree murder and first-degree robbery charges after Angela Prichard was found shot Oct. 8, 2022, at Mississippi Ridge Kennels, where Christopher and Angela had once been proprietors. The Jackson County Sheriff’s Office responded to a 911 call at about 7:50 a.m. Oct. 8 at the kennels, located north of Bellevue. That’s where they found Angela Prichard. She had a no-contact order in place against Christopher Prichard following April 2022 charges of domestic violence. An arrest warrant had been issued for him for allegedly violating that order. He was arrested at a Jackson County residence and taken into custody Oct. 9 following a search. At that time, a 20-gauge shotgun and ammunition were seized relevant to the homicide investigation, according to charging documents. During an interview with law enforcement, Christopher Prichard reported that he was angry with his wife about the no-contact order and argued with her about the kennel business. “Chris also stated he knowingly violated the aforementioned no-contact order by entering the (kennel) carrying a 20-gauge shotgun for the purposes of confronting Angela,” court records state. “Chris further admitted that he shot Angie with the 20-gauge shotgun and then left the scene.” Prichard pleaded not guilty on Oct. 31. He also waived his right to a speedy trial and demanded a jury trial. The trial was to begin in September 2023 but was rescheduled after Prichard’s public defenders claimed trying his case at that time would be prejudicial against him while new evidence and witnesses were still being introduced, according to court documents.

Must pass the hula hoop all the way around, without breaking the chain. RPS Jump Race The race is on! Split into two teams, one team on each end. Players must JUMP through the hula hoop obstacles until they meet their opponent, whereupon they will engage in a one-wins-it Rock-Paper-Scissors challenge. The winner continues JUMPING through the hoops until they meet their next opponent, and the challenge continues. The objective is to make it to the other end.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 3:39 pm You had a great 100-year run, AM radio, and your demise is breaking my heart. According to the Wall Street Journal, carmakers such as Tesla, Volvo and BMW are no longer providing AM radios in their new vehicles. Why? In part, because of the emergence of electric vehicles. As the WSJ explains, quoting the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a car-industry trade group, the onboard electronics on EVs “create interference with AM radio signals — a phenomenon that ‘makes the already fuzzy analog AM radio frequency basically unlistenable.’ ” EV makers can apply shielding cables and other components to make AM radios work, but, says the Alliance, that would cost $3.8 billion over seven years — which is why some companies are simply doing away with AM radio. It’s regrettably true that the economic and cultural heyday of AM radio is well behind us. America’s very first radio broadcast took place on KDKA Radio in Pittsburgh on Nov. 2, 1920, reports CBS News. From the ‘30s through the ‘50s, KDKA-AM broadcast news, jazz, big-band music and Pirates baseball games. In 1954 its in-house genius Rege Cordic created one of America’s first “morning teams.” Cordic & Company brought us several memorable characters and comedy sketches that helped KDKA capture a massive 85% of Pittsburgh’s listening audience. In the 1970s I remember waking every day before school and listening to Jack Bogut’s wonderful KDKA morning broadcast. I loved his show so much, my best friend Ayresie and I skipped school one December day in 1979 to watch him broadcast from a department-store window downtown — as he did every Christmas as he raised funds for the local Children’s Hospital. Now, thanks to the emergence of streaming broadcasts, satellite radio and other options, both AM and FM radio listenership have declined fast. According to Nielsen, reports the WSJ, America’s 4,500 AM radio stations reached 107 million people every month in the spring of 2016 — but only 78 million people per month in 2023. Due to the waning listenership and the cost of installing functioning AM radios in cars, then, more carmakers are opting to ditch AM radios altogether. But not so fast, say AM-radio advocates. For starters, conservative talk shows — a staple of AM programming since the rise of Rush Limbaugh in the early 1980s — have a lot to lose if AM radio goes away. More than 600 AM radio stations broadcast in non-English languages — making them invaluable sources of information to people for whom English is not a first language. And federal emergency officials are lobbying Congress to create laws that prevent carmakers from dropping AM radios from new vehicles because they say AM is still an important medium to convey emergency alerts and information.

Mail-in ballots in their envelopes await processing in Pomona, California in October 2020 Right-wing activist group Project Veritas and its ex- leader have renounced bogus claims that a Pennsylvania postmaster illegally backdated mail-in ballots during the 2020 US election, highlighting the power of litigation in combatting disinformation even years later. The organization and its founder James O\'Keefe, known for sting operations targeting progressives, admitted in statements Monday they had helped broadcast the lie, after settling a defamation lawsuit brought by the postmaster. The settlement is the latest in a string of such suits targeting those who intentionally spread lies about the 2020 US presidential election. Project Veritas admitted to having amplified a mail carrier\'s claims that he overheard postmaster Robert Weisenbach discussing a scheme to illegally backdate late mail-in ballots, an allegation that the group spread in articles and videos published after the 2020 election. ""Neither Mr. Weisenbach nor any other USPS employee in Erie, Pennsylvania, engaged in election fraud or any other wrongdoing related to mail-in ballots,"" both of their statements said, adding that there is ""no evidence"" fraud occurred. Previous defamation suits have forced similar retractions from Donald Trump\'s attorney Rudy Giuliani and others who parroted the ex-president\'s false claims about widespread fraud. ""The hope is that some of these defamation verdicts and settlements will play a role in deterring the spreading of election lies,"" said Rick Hasen, an election law expert at UCLA. ""They help show that people who try to undermine free and fair elections may pay a price."" The statements are also a reminder of the post-2020 chaos, which experts say could recur in 2024 as Trump eyes a rematch with President Joe Biden. ""We have seen new and often outlandish claims around every facet of the election process, from absentee voting by mail to the type of pens being used,"" said Tammy Patrick of the National Association of Election Officials. ""I imagine that trend will continue."" A Pennsylvania court ruling in 2020 allowed ballots received within three days of Election Day to be counted if they were postmarked by that date. Court filings say Weisenbach, a registered Republican, voted for Trump in 2020. But after being branded a ""Trump hater"" in the Project Veritas interview, he received death threats and was forced to temporarily flee his home, his lawyers said. The mail carrier who initiated the claims that Weisenbach manipulated ballots, Richard Hopkins, now concedes he ""only heard a fragment of the conversation and reached the conclusion that the conversation was related to nefarious behavior."" Trump has previously praised Hopkins as ""a brave patriot"" for speaking out, and his campaign had cited the mail carrier\'s erroneous allegations in litigation aiming to block Pennsylvania from certifying its results. Lawmaker Lindsey Graham, top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, also referenced the claims in a letter to the Justice Department calling for a federal investigation. ""As I have now learned, I was wrong,"" Hopkins said in a statement apologizing to Weisenbach, whom the US postal service inspector general cleared in a 2021 investigation. A lawyer representing Project Veritas and O\'Keefe did not respond to requests for comment. Weisenbach\'s attorney, David Houck, said the case was ""resolved in a manner acceptable to all parties."" The settlement comes after a jury in December ordered Giuliani, who spearheaded Trump\'s legal efforts to reverse the 2020 results, to pay $148 million in damages for defaming two Georgia poll workers with accusations of ballot tampering. Giuliani still faces lawsuits from companies including Dominion Voting Systems, which secured a $787.5 million settlement from Fox News after suing over the network\'s false claims that its machines altered votes. For Patrick, a former Arizona elections official, correcting the record is always important -- even years later. ""There are voters and members of the public who will only listen to -- will only believe -- the individuals who made these claims to begin with,"" she told AFP. ""The unfortunate reality of the situation is that the truth won\'t get the same airtime, the same distribution as the inflammatory statements."" Trump, who was indicted in August for his efforts to overturn Biden\'s 2020 victory, is already suggesting November\'s contest will be stolen. ""The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020,"" he said last month at a rally in Nevada.

Jonah Goldberg There\'s bad news and good news for those who want to see President Joe Biden win in 2024 (or who really just want to see former President Donald Trump lose). The bad news is that in the era of modern polling, no president has ever won reelection with approval ratings as low at this point in their first term. For fairly obvious reasons, incumbent presidents generally need to get at least close to 50% favorability by election day to win. Biden\'s approval has been stubbornly low -- around 40% in polling averages -- despite an improving economy. Getting to 50% looks daunting, though hardly impossible. The good news is that approval numbers may not matter. You may have noticed that a lot of the old rules of politics have passed their expiration dates. None of them were ever ""iron laws"" so much as rules of thumb. Still, it\'s been a bad time to rely on those rules of thumb. The truism ""As goes Ohio, so goes the nation"" -- i.e., Ohio always backs the winner -- didn\'t apply in 2020. The still widespread conviction that politics is all about raising money, and that donors have outsize influence to pick the winner, hasn\'t really been true for quite a while. Just ask Michael Bloomberg or Ron DeSantis. From 1888 to 1996, the Electoral College vote followed the popular vote. In 2000 and again in 2016 that didn\'t happen. For decades, winning presidential and congressional candidates followed the rule that you swing to the base in the primaries and then tack back to the center in the general election. Barack Obama largely ignored that rule, and Trump really ignored it, successfully. Most senatorial and congressional candidates ignore that rule entirely. That\'s because the electorate has sorted to the point where the real challenge to incumbency is in primaries, not general elections. Candidates increasingly rely on turning out their base rather than persuading voters in the middle. This points to one reason why approval ratings may not matter as much as they used to. In a polarized electorate, most voters vote against the other party more than they vote for their own. A recent Quinnipiac poll finds that among voters who dislike both candidates, Biden has a commanding 13-point lead. If that holds, it could be all Biden needs. A second reason why approval ratings might be unreliable: Trump is essentially running as a Republican incumbent. Normally, presidents who lose don\'t run again. And they certainly don\'t claim that they didn\'t actually lose. Presidential approval ratings have tended to be predictive because a reelection bid is a referendum on an incumbent\'s first term: Do voters want more of the same or change? But voters already know what a Trump presidency would be like -- or they can be reminded with a barrage of negative ads. Trump left office with an approval rating of 34%. This is why Nikki Haley tends to do better than Trump in hypothetical match-ups with Biden: She\'s a change candidate in a way Trump can\'t be. It\'s true that Trump is beating Biden in many hypothetical matchups in battleground states. That should worry Democrats and anyone else who doesn\'t want Trump in the White House. But Trump\'s unfavorable ratings are still higher than Biden\'s. Indeed, Trump has always had a high floor of support -- about 34% -- but also a very low ceiling, about 48%. Unlike Biden, Trump has never actually been popular. In a general election, when partisans reluctantly ""come home,"" basically to vote against the other party, Biden probably has a much larger pool of ""hold your nose"" voters to rely on. The expiration -- or temporary suspension -- of other rules is relevant too. Republicans in 2022 were expecting a ""Red Tsunami"" given Biden\'s unpopularity and the struggling economy. Democrats did shockingly well -- because they ran, in effect, against Trump and Trumpism and for abortion rights. Indeed, the old rule that the abortion issue helps Republicans got turned on its head after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. As recent state initiatives suggest, Biden could be carried by abortion rights voters alone. Biden is already opening a massive gender gap with Trump. Abortion surely explains much of it, though his trials for assaulting and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll, and for allegedly paying hush money to a porn-star mistress probably didn\'t help. Attacking Taylor Swift, as his most ardent supporters have done recently, won\'t fix that. All of that said, if you believe a second Trump presidency would be a disaster for the country, rerunning a very unpopular incumbent on the hunch that the old rules no longer apply seems like a risky bet.

Other parts of the company were also affected. ""we’re responsibly investing in our company\'s biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead,"" the company said in a statement.

JOHN HANNA The Associated Press BY JOHN WAWROW The Associated Press The Dubuque Fighting Saints acquired power forward Beckett Hendrickson from the Sioux Falls Stampede at Monday’s USHL trade deadline. Beckett Hendrickson certainly hit the ground running in his first 2½ days with the Dubuque Fighting Saints. The Saints acquired the 6-foot-2, 174-pound forward in a deal with the Sioux Falls Stampede at the United States Hockey League trade deadline Monday night, he arrived in Dubuque late Tuesday afternoon and hopped on a bus Wednesday morning for a two-game series this weekend in Youngstown, Ohio. Hendrickson practiced with the Saints for the first time Thursday and slotted on a line with USHL scoring leader Jake Sondreal and James Reeder. “The bus ride was actually really good, because it gave me a chance to get to know all the guys,” said Hendrickson, a University of Minnesota recruit and Boston Bruins prospect. “They’re all great guys, which has made it pretty easy for me. It’s the same with the coaches, as well. “It really helps that we play a lot of the same systems we played in Sioux Falls. We do the same neutral zone and we’re both offensive teams. Little things like that make it easier to transition. And the guys have done a great job of explaining the things we didn’t do in Sioux Falls.” Hendrickson, a Minnetonka, Minn., native, tallied 18 goals and 43 points in 43 games for the Stampede and scored a goal in each game against the Saints on Jan. 25-26, when the two teams split a pair of overtime games in the USHL Frosty Cup in Dallas. In December, he represented USA Hockey at the World Jr. A Challenge and won bronze with Reeder and associate head coach Evan Dixon. Sondreal shares the USHL scoring lead with Muskegon’s Matvei Gridin and has 23 goals and 59 points in 45 games. Reeder ranks 15th in the league with 19 goals and 47 points in 38 games. “They’re two great players, and, obviously, they’re having great years,” Hendrickson said. “I’m excited to play with the two of them. As good as they are as players, they’re even better people. I just want to do the best I can to help them any way I can.” Hendrickson won a World Under-18 championship last spring after a two-year run with USA Hockey’s National Team Development Program in Plymouth, Mich. He recorded 14 goals and 27 points across two USHL seasons with the national team. At the NHL Draft last summer, the Bruins selected Hendrickson in the fourth round, 124th overall. “We threw him into the fire right away today, and he looked really good,” Saints coach Kirk MacDonald said. “He has such a high hockey IQ that you can put him in any situation, and he’ll be fine. “He’s really good around the net, plays hard around the crease and has a great stick. He’ll be a great net-front presence for us. And the three of them on that line really complement each other well.” Hendrickson’s father, Darby, won the prestigious Minnesota Mr. Hockey Award as a high school senior in 1991, played for the Golden Gophers, represented the United States at the 1994 Olympics, played 10 seasons in the NHL and has served as an assistant coach for the Minnesota Wild for 12 seasons. Dubuque sent forward Chase LaPinta, a fifth-round draft pick and future considerations to the Stampede. The Saints acquired the same fifth-round pick from Sioux Falls in September for Swedish forward Marcus Limpar-Lantz. Phantom menace — Youngstown improved to 16-1-1-1 at the Covelli Centre this season with a 10-4 romp over Waterloo on Thursday morning. The Phantoms are just 10-11-3-2 away from home. This weekend will conclude the four-game regular-season series between Dubuque and Youngstown.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 3:35 pm One is a best-selling self-help writer, the other a US congressman -- and both are applying their rhetorical talents to pitch themselves to Democrats as better bets than President Joe Biden to beat Donald Trump in November. Short of a major upset, Americans are unlikely ever to find out. Biden is expected to cruise past Marianne Williamson and Dean Phillips as he kicks off his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in South Carolina\'s primary on Saturday. Williamson tried her luck once before, in the 2020 presidential race, but dropped out before a single vote had been cast. Known to Americans for her many books on love, the 71-year-old is trying again in 2024 but got off to an inauspicious start -- winning just four percent in New Hampshire\'s first-in-the-nation Democratic primary. Her failure looked all the more abject, since Biden scored 64 percent without even appearing on the ballot due to a row with local officials. Williamson\'s 5,000 votes barely kept her above non-credible contenders who have had almost no television time, with names like Paperboy Prince, President Boddie and even Vermin Supreme. But she tasted literary success before political disappointment, penning a debut book -- ""A Return to Love"" (1992) -- that became a bestseller. She went on to become a regular on television and has since published more than a dozen other works. For Williamson, love is the credo of her career but also the motivating force behind her presidential campaigns. In 2019, during her first Democratic primary, she said of Donald Trump: ""You have harnessed fear for political purposes and only love can cast that out."" The phrase gave her a second taste of stardom, albeit briefly, on social media. She has since tried to shed her ""spiritual guru"" image somewhat, arguing for tangible policy goals such as universal health coverage, free university tuition and parental leave. So why not pressure Biden to espouse these measures and get behind his campaign? ""We owe President Biden a debt of gratitude for defeating President Trump in 2020,"" she says in a campaign video. But she adds that Biden is not best equipped to handle everything the Republicans ""are going to be throwing at us in 2024."" Hands in pockets, leaning against a truck, Dean Phillips waits for the attendees who will never arrive for an empty campaign event. It\'s a familiar scene for the gelato magnate and Minnesota congressman who is also running against Biden, and whose campaign is struggling to generate much enthusiasm. And for a good reason: the vast majority of the Democratic Party has already rallied behind the president\'s candidacy. Phillips, one of the wealthiest members of the US Congress, has largely financed his campaign, which has focused on Biden\'s age. If Biden wins a second term, he will be 86 when he leaves the White House. The 50-year-old Phillips is urging the octogenarian president to ""pass the torch,"" believing that it will soon be ""impossible"" for him to carry out his duties. Phillips, too, had a disastrous start to his campaign -- coming second in New Hampshire but unable to stay within 40 points of Biden, even though there was no box on the ballot to tick for the president and his supporters had to write in his name. Aware of his enthusiasm deficit -- only a few days ago, he was forced repeatedly to ask an audience in South Carolina to pay attention as he spoke from the stage -- Phillips is seeing the funny side.

Veterans Memorial Hospital continues to encourage the public to learn the American Heart Association’s “Hands Only CPR.” This simple way of performing CPR is very easy to do and effective for the victim. According to the American Heart Association, sudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death with nearly 400,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occurring annually in the United States. The American Heart Association estimates that 89% of people who suffer an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest die because they don’t receive immediate CPR from someone on the scene. The American Heart Association has found Hands Only CPR to be as effective as conventional CPR for sudden cardiac arrest at home, at work, or in the public - doubling, or even tripling, a victim’s chance of survival. Since 80% of cardiac arrests happen in private or residential settings, learn these simple steps for performing Hands Only CPR to help save the life of someone you love: • Call 9-1-1 immediately. • Place your hands, one on top of the other, in the center of the person’s chest. • Begin compressions, pushing hard and fast in the center of the chest. • Keep doing compressions until help arrives. Visit the American Heart Association’s website at www.heart.org/handsonlycpr to watch their Hands Only CPR instructional video.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'President Joe Biden has declared that the fall election could well determine the fate of a democracy in the United States. According to the president, the election of Donald Trump will result in the installation of an autocracy in the U.S. The separation of powers will, for all practical purposes, be obliterated, Biden argues. Fair and free elections will be replaced by massive voter suppression; and one-man rule, the prime characteristic of an autocratic government, will become us, the good old U.S.A. Trump won’t become president as much as assume king-like power over the land of the free and home of the brave. Trump aside, let’s just say at this point, “maybe, maybe not.” Rather, we should try to understand how an independent country allows, permits, or is forced to turn into a totalitarian government. The examples of those forced to convert to a dictatorship come easily to mind. Fidel Castro militarily coming to power in Cuba, communism replacing a czar in Russia and any number of countries that simply maintain an existing government or lose freedom using force. (Noting that all those who obtain power in this manner immediately promise free and fair elections in the future, which just never come.) But countries with an existing democracy followed a different path. They simply voted to give up elective government. A military insurrection will not happen in America. It is not realistic to expect an army of tanks to travel down 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., pull up to the White House, and demand a president leave. But, if we choose to forego democracy for totalitarianism, it will be by our own hand. Here, history gives us a guide. I am reluctant to cite Germany and Adolph Hitler as an example, although it is one. But it is too pejorative to be regarded as fair since it implies that the former president is an adherent. A more acceptable example is Italy. The Italians did not join the Allied forces at the outbreak of the First World War. Although late to join the fray against Germany and Austria, they expected to be rewarded. While generous were the terms of the Paris Accord, it did not make the Italians happy. As Margret MacMillian reported in her epic work, “Peacemakers: The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and Its Attempt to End War,” Italy “did not do badly. . . but that was not the view in Italy.” The delegation returned home to the chaos of the 1920s. Italian factories had badly overproduced war armaments, which were no longer needed. Workers, private and public, were frequently on strike. Railroads were subject to interruptions of service. Inflation was so bad that a landlord collecting rent would see the payment decline in value even before they could return and deposit the sum in the bank. There was widespread dissatisfaction with a government seen as unfunctional. Enter Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini. Mussolini, who had served, and was wounded in the war, broke with the socialists and formed his own party. His rise in parliament was aided by armed squads of veterans, known as the Blackshirts, who engaged in intimidation, force, and even assassination of political rivals. When King Victor Emmanuel III asked him to form a new government, Mussolini quickly obtained ever-increasing power, culminating in the 1924 Christmas Eve Resolution that granted him absolute authority as Il Duce or The Leader. The bond between the rise of an autocrat and the willingness of the population to concede to it, in Germany, Italy or elsewhere, is based in deep dissatisfaction in the body politic within the conditions of their society. The additional factor is a legislative body willing to relinquish its authority. Since a parliament, congress, or chamber of deputies is most frequently made up of the supporters of the anointed leader, the step from freedom to totalitarian rule is a short one. As we work our way out of an inflationary period, where wages have risen but have been outpaced by rising prices of necessities, challenging times on the international front, and deep belief among a third of our population that only solution is to convert to a Christian nation as they perceive it, many feel deeply that existing conditions are unacceptable. We also must factor in that our Congress has within it many supporters of former President Trump. In fact, particularly in the House of Representatives, many members are almost lining up to kiss the ring Trump wears.

to the State Tournament after a 7-0 win over Cascade on Monday night. Full game stats were not available by Tuesday morning’s press deadline, but goal scorers for the TigerHawks included Anden Starkeather (2), Andre Fuentes (2), Brody Schupbach (2), and Lincoln Aeschliman. Starkweather, Fuentes, and Aeschliman also each tallied an assist in the win. By Zakary Kriener Brody Schupbach led the NFV boys’ soccer team to a victory in its regular season final last week with both of the team’s goals in a 2-0 win over Hudson. In a battle of two top-eight ranked teams in Class 1A, both of North Fayette Valley’s goals came in the second half to give the No. 3-ranked TigerHawks a final regular season record of 13-3. By Zakary Kriener North Fayette Valley’s Cole Moser wrapped up his impressive sophomore season last week at Districts, missing the cut to advance to State by just three shots. “Cole played another steady round of golf, marred by just a few three-putts on some challenging hole locations,” said coach Derek Heins after Tuesday’s (May 14) action at Fox Ridge Golf Course in Dike. “He had one birdie on the day and several nice par saves late in the round.” Moser placed 15th overall with a 78 on the day. By Zakary Kriener A breakthrough season for the North Fayette Valley girls’ soccer program came to an end on Wednesday night, May 15, with a 4-2 loss to Union in the semifinal round of the Class 1A Region 7 Tournament. The TigerHawks had a strong second half with goals by Kaelyn Elsbernd and Brielle Starkweather, but the 3-0 lead for the Knights at the half proved to be too big of a deficit to dig out of. By Zakary Kriener Quality over quantity was the story for North Fayette Valley at the 2024 State Track and Field Meet in Des Moines last week as the TigerHawks finished in the top nine in four of the six events they qualified in. Leading the way was sophomore Hannah Schroeder who continued to longstanding reputation of throwing success at North Fayette Valley. Schroeder earned the silver medal in Class 2A in the discus with a personal record throw of 136’9”. Schroeder also competed in the shot put, taking 20th with a distance of 34’7.25”. Continuing the success in throwing events, Cael Reichter came home with a ninth-place finish in the boys’ discus with his throw of 151’3”. The toss was a personal record for the TigerHawk junior. The top performance of the State Meet for the boys came from Ayden Burrow, who competed in three events throughout the week. The junior turned in a time of 14.51 in the 110-meter hurdles to take fourth place, and then went on to earn more placement points in the 400-meter hurdles with a seventh-place time of 55.45. By Zakary Kriener Thursday night started out rainy and drury, but the weather eventually turned around and helped the TigerHawk boys’ and girls’ track and field teams send a combined six events to this week’s State Track and Field Meet in Des Moines. “The night ended up being a pretty awesome night to run once the rain stopped,” said coach Micah Ruroden after the team competed at their State Qualifying Meet at Denver last week. “We ended the season with lots of personal records for our kids. It’s always great to end the season on a personal high note for those who are not able to qualify.” Boys The North Fayette Valley boys were led by Ayden Burrow who turned in the fastest time of the meet in the 110-meter hurdles, making the junior a three-time State qualifier in the event. Burrow finished the high hurdle event in 14.75. Burrow also qualified in the 400-meter hurdles as he took runner-up with a time of 57.36. “Ayden Burrow keeps getting better as he gets healthier, the nagging injury has slowed him some at the beginning of the year, but he is really starting to feel better and its showing in some of his times,” said Ruroden. “He also qualified in the 400h which is a race we have only run a few times this season, with another race under his belt he should run well down there.” Burrow wasn’t done with two State qualifying efforts, as he also qualified as a leg in the shuttle hurdle relay event. Burrow, along with running mates Jaxson Lundgren, Logan Boehm, and Ryan Griffith crossed the finish line third with a time of 1:04.02. The fourth boys’ event that will be heading to Des Moines will be junior Cael Reichter whose throw of 143’10” in the discus was runner-up at Denver. “Cael did what he needed to do to qualify in the discus, and also threw a personal best,” added Ruroden. “I think the biggest thing for him this year was the commitment to the weight room, it has shown in his performances in different sports this year but came full circle in this one.” Girls The NFV girls had a good night throughout and will be represented at State in two events as Hannah Schroeder earned bids in both throwing events. “Hannah was able to requalify in both the shot and discus for us, she earned herself another year of experience down in Des Moines,” said Ruroden. Schroeder’s throw of 124’3” in the discus was tops of the night, while her throw of 37’5” in the shot put was runner-up. Schroeder enters the State Meet as the No. 4 seed in the discus and the No. 11 seed in the shot put. The 2024 State Track and Field Meet gets underway Thursday morning with events spanning through Saturday afternoon. By Zakary Kriener For the third consecutive season, the TigerHawk boys’ soccer team are champions of the Indee Cup as they turned in a pair of dominating shutout wins in Independence over the weekend to improve to 12-3 on the season. Aplington-Parkersburg In a battle of ranked northeast Iowa squads, the No. 3-ranked (Class 1A) TigerHawks defeated the No. 8-ranked (Class 2A) Falcons of Aplington-Parkersburg by a score of 3-0. North Fayette Valley was able to carry a 1-0 lead into halftime before tacking on two additional goals in the second 40 minutes to secure the win. Brody Schupbach was responsible for a pair of goals, while Andre Fuentes had the third to go along with an assist. Lincoln Aeschliman also had an assist for the TigerHawks. On defense, NFV did not allow a single shot on goal by the Falcons as Trey Frieden secured the clean sheet shutout win.
