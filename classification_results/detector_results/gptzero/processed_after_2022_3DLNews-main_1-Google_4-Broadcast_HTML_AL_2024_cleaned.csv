One of the world\'s most prominent climate scientists is suing a right-wing author and a policy analyst for defamation. The case comes at a time when attacks on scientists are proliferating, says Peter Hotez, professor of Pediatrics and Molecular Virology at Baylor College of Medicine. Even as misinformation about scientists and their work keeps growing, Hotez says scientists haven\'t yet found a good way to respond. ""The reason we\'re sort of fumbling at this is it\'s unprecedented. And there is no roadmap,"" he says. The climate scientist at the center of this trial is Michael Mann. The professor of earth and environmental science at the University of Pennsylvania gained prominence for helping make one of the most accessible, consequential graphs in the history of climate science. First published in the late 1990s, the graph shows thousands of years of relatively stable global temperatures. Then, when humans start burning lots of coal and oil, it shows a spike upward. Mann\'s graph looks like a hockey stick lying on its side, with the blade sticking straight up. The so-called ""hockey stick graph"" was successful in helping the public understand the urgency of global warming, and that made it a target, says Kert Davies, director of special investigations at the Center for Climate Integrity, a climate accountability nonprofit. ""Because it became such a powerful image, it was under attack from the beginning,"" he says. The attacks came from groups that reject climate science, some funded by the fossil fuel industry. In the midst of these types of attacks — including the hacking of Mann\'s and other scientists\' emails by unknown hackers — Penn State, where Mann was then working, opened an investigation into his research. Penn State, as well as the National Science Foundation, found no evidence of scientific misconduct. But a policy analyst and an author wrote that they were not convinced. The trial in D.C. Superior Court involves posts from right-wing author Mark Steyn and policy analyst Rand Simberg. In an online post, Simberg compared Mann to former Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky, a convicted child sex abuser. Simberg wrote that Mann was the ""Sandusky of climate science,"" writing that Mann ""molested and tortured data."" Steyn called Mann\'s research fraudulent. Mann sued the two men for defamation. Mann also sued the publishers of the posts, National Review and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, but in 2021, the court ruled they couldn\'t be held liable. In court, Mann has argued that he lost funding and research opportunities. Steyn said in court that if Penn State\'s president, Graham Spanier, covered up child sexual assault, why wouldn\'t he cover up for Mann\'s science. The science in question used ice cores and tree rings to estimate Earth\'s past temperatures. ""If Graham Spanier is prepared to cover up child rape, week in, week out, year in, year out, why would he be the least bit squeamish about covering up a bit of hanky panky with the tree rings and the ice cores?"" Steyn asked the court. Mann and Steyn declined to speak to NPR during the ongoing trial. One of Simberg\'s lawyers, Victoria Weatherford, said ""inflammatory does not equal defamatory"" and that her client is allowed to express his opinion, even if it were wrong. ""No matter how offensive or distasteful or heated it is,"" Weatherford tells NPR, ""that speech is absolutely protected under the First Amendment when it\'s said against a public figure, if the person saying it believed that what they said was true."" Mann isn\'t the only climate scientist facing attacks, says Lauren Kurtz, executive director of the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund. ""We help more scientists every year than the year before,"" Kurtz says. ""We actually broke a record in 2023. We helped over 50 researchers."" Dozens of climate scientists from the federal government have contacted her group in recent years, many alleging that they were censored under the Trump administration. During his presidency Donald Trump denied the science of climate change and pulled the U.S. out of the U.N. Paris Climate Agreement addressing global warming. But while climate researchers were early targets of people rejecting peer-reviewed science, now those attacks have spread to biomedical scientists, supercharged by the COVID-19 pandemic. Kurtz says while they primarily provide legal defense for climate researchers, they\'ve recently heard from COVID-19 researchers, too. Hotez worries about the ramifications for the future of science and medicine. He says: ""Young people, looking at future careers, looking at how scientists are attacked are going to say, \'Well, why do I want to go into this profession?\'"" Hotez says he\'s glad Mann is fighting back in court. But he doesn\'t think a bunch of lawsuits is a sustainable solution. And he says he wants to keep working in the lab. ""We have a new human hookworm vaccine that\'ll come online soon,"" he says. ""That\'s how I want to spend my time. I don\'t want to spend my day making cold calls to plaintiff lawyers."" Imran Ahmed, chief executive at the Center for Countering Digital Hate, says any response has to include social media companies, as that\'s where attacks on scientists happen every day. Research finds that social media platforms can encourage the spread of scientific and medical misinformation. Hotez says he and Mann are working on an upcoming project, collaborating on what they see as overlap in attacks on climate science and biomedicine and how to counter it. Copyright 2024 NPR.

Taylor Swift was the first artist signed to the label. Keith died Monday night after a battle with stomach cancer. The Country Music Hall of Fame and stars like Luke Combs, Jason Aldean and Old Dominion weighed in on Keith’s death, calling him a “trailblazer” who “never backed down.” “Authentic and heartfelt but always with a wink ‘til the end,” Old Dominion wrote on X. “He was larger than life in so many ways and his music will live on forever! Raising our red solos tonight — you will be missed by so many. Peace.” Swift has not commented publicly on Keith’s death as of Tuesday morning. Copyright 2024 WSMV via Gray Media Group, Inc.

(WKRG) — For some, it’s a challenge to see how many beads they can catch at a Mardi Gras parade. “I’m out here, and I am going to go on hustle,” parade goer Aidan Warrner said. Taking months of preparation to satisfy the demand of throws before the Mardi Gras organizations let the good times roll. “Ya know, no one really wants to tell you how much they pay and spend on throws, especially they don’t want to tell their wives or husbands,” Port City Throw co-owner Sean Nicholas said. According to Port City Throws, that’s because the beads, moon pies, and stuffed animals quickly turn into a large price tag. That’s why their company introduced the rider package. “But with us, they usually spend about $500 to $700 on a rider package, and it does vary by person,” Nicholas said. But some riders end up spending up to $5,000 on throws. “They come in one week, and they’ll say I have a budget of this much this week,” Nicholas said. “Then they’ll come in the next week once they get another paycheck and spend more. It’s kind of interesting.” All to bring joy to parade goers like Lycinda Weaver, who sets up hours before the parade to ensure she catches all of the best beads. “Just hang our bags up on the barricade, and we let the kids get up there and enjoy it,” Weaver said. Not letting any of the beads go to waste. “We donate our beads and stuff like that to soccer teams that are in the floats,” Weaver said. While others give all of their Mardi Gras treasures to their grandchildren. “Give it to my grand young-ins. I got 10 grand young-ins!” David Brooker said. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

Please respect the privacy of his family at this time.” Keith leaves behind a wife and three children. Keith announced his cancer diagnosis on social media in June of 2022.

He was known for his overt patriotism on post 9/11 songs like “Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue,” and boisterous barroom tunes like “I Love This Bar” and “Red Solo Cup.” He had a powerful booming voice, a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor and range that carried love songs as well as drinking songs. Among his 20 No. 1 Billboard hits were “How Do You Like Me Now?!,” “Should’ve Been a Cowboy,” “As Good As I Once Was,” “My List” and “Beer for My Horses,” a duet with Willie Nelson. Keith worked as a roughneck in the oil fields of Oklahoma as a young man, then played semi-pro football before launching his career as a singer. “I write about life, and I sing about life, and I don’t overanalyze things,” Keith told The Associated Press in 2001, following the success of his song “I’m Just Talking About Tonight.” Keith learned good lessons in the booming oil fields, which toughened him up, but also showed him the value of money. “The money to be made was unbelievable,” Keith told the AP in 1996. “I came out of high school in 1980 and they gave me this job December of 1979, $50,000 a year. I was 18-years-old.” But the domestic oil field industry collapsed and Keith had not saved. “It about broke us,” he said. “So I just learned. I’ve taken care of my money this time.” He spent a couple seasons as a defensive end for the Oklahoma City Drillers, a farm team for the now-defunct United States Football League. But he found consistent money playing music with his band throughout the red dirt roadhouse circuit in Oklahoma and Texas. “All through this whole thing the only constant thing we had was music,” he said. “But it’s hard to sit back and say, ‘I’m going to go make my fortune singing music, or writing music. I had no contacts.”‘ Eventually his path took him to Nashville, where he attracted the interest of Mercury Records head Harold Shedd, who was best known as a producer for the hit group Alabama. Shedd brought him to Mercury, where he released his platinum debut record “Toby Keith,” in 1993. “Should’ve Been a Cowboy,” his breakout hit, was played 3 million times on radio stations, making it the most played country song of the 1990s. But label’s focus on global star Shania Twain overshadowed the rest of the roster and Keith felt that the executives were trying to push him in a pop direction. “They were trying to get me to compromise, and I was living a miserable existence,” Keith told the AP. “Everybody was trying to mold me into something I was not.” After a series of albums that produced hits like “Who’s That Man,” and cover of Sting’s “I’m So Happy I Can’t Stop Crying,” Keith moved to DreamWorks Records in 1999. That’s when his multi-week “How Do You Like Me Now?!” took off and became his first song to crossover to Top 40 charts. In 2001, he won the male vocalist of the year and album of the year at the Academy of Country Music Awards, exclaiming from the stage: “I’ve waited a long time for this. Nine years!” Songs like “I Wanna Talk About Me,” a spoken-word song written by Bobby Braddock about a man frustrated by a talkative partner, got him attention for its similarity to the cadence of rap, which Keith dismissed. “They’re going to call it a rap song, (although) there ain’t nobody doing rap who would call it rap,” he told “Billboard” magazine in 2001. Keith often wore his politics on his sleeve, especially after the terrorist attacks on U.S. soil in 2001, and early on he said was a conservative Democrat, but later claimed he was an independent. He’s played at events for Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump, the latter giving him a National Medal of the Arts in 2021. His songs and his blunt opinions sometimes caused him controversy, which he seemed to court. His 2002 song, “Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)” included a threat— “We’ll put a boot in your ass — It’s the American way” — to anyone who dared to mess with America. That song got pulled from a patriotic ABC Fourth of July special after producers deemed it too angry for the show. Singer-songwriter Steve Earle called Keith’s song “pandering to people’s worst instincts at a time they are hurt and scared.” Then there was the feud between Keith and The Chicks (formerly called the Dixie Chicks), who became a target of Keith’s ire when singer Natalie Maines told a crowd that they were ashamed of then President George W. Bush. Maines had also previously called Keith’s song “ignorant.” Keith, who had previously claimed that he supported any artist’s freedom to voice their opinion about politics, used a doctored photo of Maines with an image of Saddam Hussein at his concerts, further ramping up angry fans. Maines responded by wearing a shirt with the letters “FUTK” onstage at the 2003 ACM Awards, which many people believed was a vulgar message to Keith. He also publicly called out actor Ethan Hawke, who had written a story in “Rolling Stone” that described an argument between Kris Kristofferson and an unnamed country star that sounded a lot like Keith. During a backstage press conference during an awards show, Keith was furious at Hawke (and reporters for repeating the story) for what he called a “fictitious (expletive) lie.” Keith, who has acknowledged that he holds onto grudges, walked out of the ACM Awards in 2003 early because he had gotten snubbed in earlier categories, causing him to miss out when he was announced as entertainer of the year. Vince Gill accepted on his behalf. He came back the next year and won the top prize for a second year in a row, along with top male vocalist and album of the year for “Shock ’n Y’all.” His pro-military stance wasn’t just fodder for songs, however. He went on 11 USO tours to visit and play for troops serving overseas. He also helped to raised millions for charity over his career, including building a home in Oklahoma City for kids and their families who are battling cancer. After Universal Music Group acquired DreamWorks, Keith started anew again, starting his own record label, Show Dog, in 2005 with record executive Scott Borchetta, who launched his own label Big Machine at the same time. “Probably 75% of the people in this town think I’ll fail, and the other 25% hope I fail,” he said that year. Later the label became Show Dog-Universal Music and had Keith, Trace Adkins, Joe Nichols, Josh Thompson, Clay Walker and Phil Vassar on its roster. His later hits included “Love Me If You Can,” “She Never Cried In Front of Me,” and “Red Solo Cup.” He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2015. He was honored by the performance rights organization BMI in November 2022 with the BMI Icon award, a few months after announcing his stomach cancer diagnosis. “I always felt like that the songwriting was the most important part of this whole industry,” Keith told the crowd of fellow singers and writers.
