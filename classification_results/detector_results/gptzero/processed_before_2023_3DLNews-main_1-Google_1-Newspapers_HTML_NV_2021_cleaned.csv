Born amid an uplift of mountains millions of years ago, the Truckee River still flows 125 miles from Lake Tahoe to Pyramid Lake. It carries life from the Sierra Nevada to the Great Basin Desert, where all the rivers flow inland and never know the sea. The waterway has nurtured countless generations of indigenous people. The Wa She Shu (the Washoe Tribe of California and Nevada) lived on the shores of Lake Tahoe in the warm seasons and moved to villages in what is now Douglas County, Carson City and the Truckee Meadows in advance of winter’s wrath. The homeland of the Numu (Northern Paiutes) stretches across high desert of Northern Nevada, with the Newe (Western Shoshone) as eastern neighbors. The branch of the Numu known as the Cui-ui Tuccutta (cui-ui eaters) prospered at Pyramid Lake. Caretakers of the water The native people are, and have always been, stewards of the water of life. They maintained an ecological equilibrium that lasted from the late Ice Age until the late 18th century, when European-American newcomers flooded into their territories. In the 150 years of development that followed, the lives of the original inhabitants — and the health of the watershed – spun out of balance.

It is only in the last several decades that some of that damage has been reversed, but threats to the region’s water system remain. History attests that ignorance, arrogance and greed are the forces that have always worked to destroy the region’s vital watershed. WIKIMEDIA: Ancient Lake Lahontan. Pyramid and Walker lakes are its last remnants. An ancient lake During the glacial eras from 75,000 to 10,000 years ago, the Truckee entered the Basin at what is now Lockwood to feed ancient Lake Lahontan. That inland ocean waxed and waned with the rhythm of climate changes over millions of years. At its greatest depth, at what is now Pyramid Lake, Lahontan was 886 feet deep. What is now Fallon was beneath 420 feet of water. People fished in the great lake, perhaps as early as fifteen millennia ago. The oldest known petroglyphs in North America, carved in calcium carbonate rock on what is now the Pyramid Lake Paiute Reservation, have been dated at between 10,500 and 14,800 years before the present. The river was a highway Humans have been crossing the Sierra Nevada for thousands of years. Shells from the Pacific Ocean have been found at archaeological sites far to the east of what is now Reno. In the Truckee Meadows, fishing villages hugged the river. For more than 4,000 years, tribal people returned to a camp on the Truckee at what is now the Vista Boulevard/Interstate-80 interchange in Sparks. IMAGE/DETAIL OF AN ILLUSTRATION BY RON ODEN: Tribal people lived in a marsh near what is now Fallon as Lake Lahontan was drying up 10,600 years before the present. In wet cycles and dry, the site was a base for hunting, food preparation and winter camping. It was most used from A.D. 500 to 1400, according to archaeologists who investigated the site for Nevada’s Department of Transportation. The Indians ate antelope, mule deer, mountain sheep, cottontails and jackrabbits. Fish were plentiful: cutthroat trout, cui-ui, chub and Tahoe suckers were caught in gill nets. The greatest fishing activity came during the winter spawning runs, when the Truckee thrashed with fish; families ate their fill. Continuous occupation at Pyramid At Pyramid Lake, the Numu thrived; the cui-ui and Lahonthan cutthroat trout were staples of their diets. They began their day with a prayer to the Father of All People as they washed their faces in the lake or the river. “Give me a good day. Take away any sicknesses I may have and drop them on the other side of the mountains.” – Paiute prayer. Across the desert, the Numu lived in small bands. The family was the main unit of society. They had no word for cousins, who were addressed as brothers and sisters. Food was shared with visitors. For more than 300 years after 1492, the Great Basin was a blank space on maps of North America. Until the early 19th century, most Great Basin Indians never had seen a European-American. Once they did, changes came swiftly. NATIONAL ARCHIVES: Winnemucca the Younger, war chief of the Northern Paiutes in the 1860s.

the Nevada Highway Patrol, are reminding motorists to observe National Crash Responder Safety Week, which began on Monday Nov. 8, and runs through Nov. 14. With approximately 50,000 motor vehicle crashes in the Silver State each year, the Nevada Department of Transportation, (NDOT) and the Nevada Highway Patrol, are reminding motorists to observe National Crash Responder Safety Week, which began on Monday Nov. 8, and runs through Nov. 14. As such, officials urge motorists to drive attentively, slow down and move over for traffic response vehicles, according to an NDOT news release, which stated that traffic incidents are the primary cause of death for police officers and emergency medical responders nationwide. “To help keep drivers, incident victims and first responders safe, Nevada traffic incident response partners are reminding motorists that Nevada law has long required drivers to slow down, proceed with caution, and if possible, move to the far lane when passing a vehicle(s) pulled over on the side of the road with emergency lights on. Since 2017, an updated law requires drivers to do the same for NDOT and other road work vehicles with flashing amber or non-flashing blue lights on.” Keep roadways clear Additionally, NDOT officials noted that Nevada law also requires drivers involved in minor, non-injury fender-benders to safely move their vehicle out of the travel lanes when possible in an effort to help reduce the chance of secondary crashes for themselves and other drivers. “When you see flashing lights on our roadways, please slow down and move over,” Nevada Department of Public Safety Highway Patrol Colonel Anne Carpenter said. “Remember that first responders, NDOT workers, tow-truck drivers, and motorists with their hazards on, are all people who have loved ones who want to see them make it home safely. Be alert, be aware and slow down. Lives are on the line, and it might be your loved one who needs that courtesy one day. We are all in this together.” The release went on to say that national statistics show that for every minute a freeway lane is blocked, the resulting traffic congestion takes four minutes to clear, and the chance of a more severe secondary crash increases. “The Nevada Departments of Transportation and Public Safety, local law enforcement, fire departments, and numerous additional agencies train together, joining forces across the state in regional Traffic Incident Management (TIM), coalitions to improve road incident response and roadway safety while reducing travel delays,” according to the release. “Since Nevada’s first TIM Coalition was founded in Southern Nevada in 2008, coalitions statewide have trained 65 percent of all incident responders to implement consistent, safe, and quick clearance of traffic incidents. The collaborative, multi-agency training helps incident responders throughout the state seamlessly work together.” To keep updated on the current state of road and highway conditions, visit the state’s webpage at nvroads.com, or call 511 before driving.

The Nevada primary is meant to narrow down party selections ahead of the November general election, but for some local races, Nye County voters voiced their final decisions on Tuesday. The former Nevada Test Site may have changed its name but that can’t erase the legacy of concern left behind following decades of nuclear testing there. Nye County voters overwhelmingly rejected Question 1 on Tuesday, a ballot measure that would’ve added a 5-cent tax per gallon on diesel and certain special fuels to help build and maintain public highways. He cited major flood events on Labor Day 1968, and in February of 1969 or 1970, the first of which, according to Forsyth hit the town with an 8-foot wall of water, and the other with 15 feet of the same. Nye County voters are narrowing down their candidates ahead of this year’s general election. On Tuesday, voters cast ballots for a number of local races including the county commission and school board. Camaraderie. It’s something felt in all sorts of groups but undoubtedly one of the strongest senses of camaraderie can be found among those who have served their country. The Nye County Water District has secured its first ever grant, a fact that has officials feeling excited and optimistic about the momentum that the district is finally seeing. A stubborn structure fire, along with challenging conditions, severely damaged a home and destroyed property along Steptoe Street on Sunday afternoon, June 2. DEATH VALLEY, Calif. — A gofundme account has been established for the family of a Death Valley National Park employee who died following a vehicle crash there late last month.
