Several posters reminding students of the policy were taped to the door at least an hour before protestors arrived. Raymond Parker, a 25-year-old UF sustainable development master’s student and member of PSL, led the protest. “This should be a place for people to celebrate their cultures and heritages,” he said. “We don't want to create a space where some students feel very safe and some students feel as if their lives are being potentially threatened.” The last PSL protest Jan. 27 led GPD and UF Student Life to threaten student expulsions and arrests, according to PSL’s Instagram page.

A state budget for the year beginning in July is the only bill the Florida Constitution requires lawmakers to approve. Both the House and Senate are set to consider separate versions of a $115 billion-plus spending plan Wednesday, the 30th day of the scheduled 60-day session. But the homestretch of the session will involve settling an array of other proposals, including some like the Senate’s ethics legislation, which is drawing heightened focus. “This legislation would have a profound corrosive effect on transparency and accountability of government, in the form of precluding and preventing any ethics scrutiny on every level of both the state and local ethics commissions,” said Caroline Klancke, executive director of the nonprofit Florida Ethics Institute. Sen. Danny Burgess, R-Zephyrhills, last week unveiled new amendments to the ethics bill (SB 7014) that would prohibit both state and local ethics commissions from pursuing any investigation unless the complaint came from someone with ""personal knowledge"" of wrongdoing and willing to identify themselves by name and file under oath. Anything short of that would be considered hearsay, prohibiting commissioners from investigating potential ethical violations. The measure was approved 39-0 by the Senate. But critics say it is certain to undermine scores of complaints which often come from citizens who’ve read news stories about potential ethics violations or heard about them through second-hand sources. The idea of relying on a witness to wrongdoing stepping forward, swearing in and identifying themselves could eliminate much of the investigatory work of ethics panels, critics say. But Burgess defended his approach, saying it is “simply for fairness ... so somebody’s not just throwing (a complaint) out there. It has to be based on some form of merit.” Kirby Oberdorfer, director of Jacksonville’s Office of Ethics, Compliance and Oversight, told the Florida Times-Union that the legislation would make local ethics officials “lap dogs instead of watchdogs.” By raising the bar so high on complaints, ethics officials said most would likely never surface, shielding violators. While Senate President Kathleen Passidomo, R-Naples, said she saw no problem with the measure, House Speaker Paul Renner, R-Palm Coast, was less committal, saying only it’s “something we’re certainly going to look at.” In the session’s closing 30 days, the back-and-forth between the House and Senate will be critical to the fate of key priorities on both sides. After ignoring it for most of the session’s first half, the Senate added oomph to a Renner priority this week, with that chamber\'s Judiciary Committee approving a proposed ban on anyone under age 16 from having a social media account. The House bill (HB 1) already has won full approval there, but Monday’s Senate review was the first time that side had taken up Renner’s push. While Democrats have raised questions about the constitutionality of the measure – which many critics say violates the First Amendment right to speech – Renner and House Republicans are pressing for action. Last week’s appearance before Congress by Meta chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the impact of social media seems to have added loft to the Florida effort. But even Gov. Ron DeSantis, no stranger to promoting policies challenged on constitutional grounds, has questioned the “breadth” of the social media proposal. Similarly, in the session’s closing weeks, some level of agreement between the House and Senate also is needed on dueling approaches to proposed changes in child labor laws, education testing and standards, a big-ticket prison construction package and Passidomo’s priority, ""Live Healthy,"" a plan aimed at improving Florida’s health care workforce and access to care by patients. Renner has vowed that his side will approve Live Healthy, even though it is only beginning to see light in the House after being approved by the Senate early in the session. “The Senate president and I are working together very well,” Renner recently said of his exchanges with Passidomo. But some measures look doubtful. Budget rolling along – but smaller: 2024 Session: Florida Legislature rolling back state spending in \'austere\' budget plans Senate has some ideas on school de-regs: Legislative session: Education deregulation bills OK\'d by Florida Senate, head to House House and Senate leaders have rebuffed efforts to revisit gambling legislation and create a provision setting the stage for Miami Beach’s Fontainebleau Hotel to open a casino. Jeffrey Soffer, developer of the hotel, has poured money into Republican lawmakers political committees and flew Gov. Ron DeSantis on his jet. While DeSantis appeared behind an effort to re-address state gambling laws to let Soffer obtain a needed pari-mutuel license, leaders have ruled it out. “My priority, and I think we’re all kind of on the same page, is that we get the Seminole (gambling) compact up and running, get it functioning well, and not stub our toe on something that would breach that – and there are some bills out there that I think would breach that,” Renner said, referring to the 2021 agreement with the state\'s Seminole Tribe. The state is expected to draw $500 million annually from the tribe, in exchange for giving it exclusive control of sports betting in Florida. Another push that may be sidetracked is the House’s effort to rollback to age 18 a ban on anyone buying a rifle or shotgun. The Senate so far has shown no interest in changing the current, 21-year limit approved after the killings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018. “It’s a non-starter for me,” Passidomo said last week.

At their first meeting, held Feb. 2 in chambers at city hall, CRC members discussed the merits of a city manager, decreasing the number of elected commissioners and increasing term lengths for commissioners and the mayor. The city must review its charter every five years by appointing a board of volunteers to comb through the document and presenting a slate of potential amendments to city commissioners for approval. Charter amendments are added to general election ballots as initiatives, so final approval falls to the city’s electorate. The city’s last charter review was done in 2019. This year’s CRC consists of five residents appointed by the city commission: Chris Arendt, Stevie Coppin, Scott Isherwood, Pat Olesen and Chuck Wolfe. Deputy clerk Fransheska Berrios, who is facilitating the charter review process this year, swore the appointees onto the board. Berrios then provided forms for members to nominate a chair and vice chair. However, the CRC members agreed that they were unfamiliar with each other and unable to provide informed nominations for the positions. Instead, they asked for someone to volunteer to serve as chair. Arendt stepped up and the committee unanimously voted to approve his appointment. Olesen was then unanimously appointed to serve as vice chairperson. City Commission Chair Mark Short, who was a member of the 2019 review committee, helped introduce the members to the review process. City attorney Becky Vose, who attended via speakerphone, also helped explain the process. Vose said the goal of the committee was to review the city charter for substantive changes, not stylistic, which she said included wording alterations like changing “happy” to “glad.” The CRC then took things from the top, beginning with Article I, “Creation and Powers,” which establishes the municipal government and its structure. They also reviewed Article II, “Corporate Limits,” but much of the committee’s discussion revolved around other matters. Olesen brought up the possibility of implementing a city manager form of government, which is when a professional manager is the city administrator. She said she did not know if it was a good idea or not, but she wanted to “throw it out there.” CRC members agreed to visit the topic during their review of Article III, “Legislative,” which details city elections, powers and processes. Wolfe suggested discussion on lowering the number of commissioners from five to three as the city has struggled with maintaining a five-member board. “We seem to appoint more than we elect with five members of the commission. So it seems like a legitimate question to ask whether we should have three members of the commission because that’s all we ever elect. Then we appoint people to fill the other two (seats),” Wolfe said. Asked his opinion, Short said he preferred a five-member commission for a more diverse representation of the community. Olesen said that if fewer people were interested in running for elected office, they could make it easier for those who stick around by increasing term lengths. Wolfe supported the idea, stating that the two-year election cycle seemed “onerous.” Arendt said they needed to find a balance for term lengths since he knew two past officials who were only interested in serving two years. CRC members agreed to circle back and continue the discussions on potentially decreasing the number of elected officials and increasing term lengths at a future meeting. There was no public comment and no members of the public attended the meeting. The charter review will resume with Article III, section 3.01, “City Commission, powers; composition,” at 1 p.m. Friday, Feb. 23, at city hall, 10005 Gulf Drive.

D.-El jefe de la Policía Nacional de la República Dominicana, Lic. Ramón Antonio Guzmán Peralta. Mayor General, P.N. Director General de la Policía Nacional dijo hoy que están trabajando los ascensos de los miembros de su institución y que en los mismos serán tomados en cuentas todos los ascenso que están atrasados de acuerdo a la ley interna de ellos que los rige. De igual manera el jefe de la policial informo también que serán tomados en cuentas conforme su ley interna para ascender a todos sus miembros de la institución del orden que se hayan graduados en las diferentes universidades. El Lic. Ramón Antonio Guzmán Peralta. Mayor General, P.N. director general de la Policía Nacional dio la información al momento de cuestionársele tanto a las Fuerzas Armadas como la Policía Nacional. ¿De cuál es la razón del porque estas instituciones violan sus propias leyes internas al no ascender a sus profesionales tan pronto se gradúan en cualquier curso técnico y/o Universitario en perjuicio de todos sus miembros? Además de demorar también el derecho de los ascensos que deben de ser cada cuatro años y no 5, 6 y 7 años, ascendiendo a otros con menos tiempos produciéndose allí lo que en dominicana se llama un cuello de botellas por los ascensos. El mas alto oficial policial emitió esta información al momento en que se llevaba a cabo la rueda de prensa la cual es ofrecida momentos después del tradicional encuentro de seguridad la cual hoy fue encabezada por el Señor presidente de la Republica Luis Rodolfo Abinader Corona, el Ministro de Defensa de la Republica Dominicana Teniente General Carlos Luciano Diaz Morfa. También ministro de Interior y Policía Jesús (Chu) Vásquez, el Jefe de Estado Mayor de la Fuerza Aérea de la República Dominicana Ingeniero Carlos Rodríguez Febrillet quien además es también es el Comandante Conjunto Unificado de las Fuerzas armadas, así como entre otras autoridades Militares. El presidente de la República, Luis Abinader, encabeza este lunes la reunión del Plan de Seguridad Ciudadana, donde se analizan los resultados de las estrategias implementadas para reducir los índices de criminalidad y delincuencia. Abinader fue recibido a las 11:08 de la mañana en la explanada del Palacio de la Policía Nacional. El jefe del Estado retoma esta habitual mesa de trabajo, luego de que el pasado lunes, 29 de enero, no se realizara debido al día feriado por el natalicio de Juan Pablo Duarte, uno de los padres de la Patria dominicana. Nuevo Comisionado El pasado 26 de enero, el Poder Ejecutivo designó, a través del Decreto 52-24, a Luis Ernesto García Hernández como el nuevo comisionado ejecutivo para Reforma Policial. García Hernández tiene entre sus funciones la implementación de los planes, estrategias y políticas de transformación y profesionalización del cuerpo de orden ciudadano. También, el presidente de la Dirección Nacional de Control de Drogas (DNCD), vicealmirante José Cabrera Ulloa, está presente en la sede policial.

McKeel Academy boys soccer coach Tanner Adams said after last week’s district championship win that he felt this was the most complete his team has been all year. The Wildcats are backing their coach up at just the right time. McKeel controlled every aspect of Tuesday night’s 4-0 Class 4A, Region 2 quarterfinal victory over Mulberry at Lane Construction Field. The Wildcats (17-3-2) dominated from start to finish, as they kept the Panthers (13-7-1) away from the ball and off the scoreboard. This was the ninth consecutive win for McKeel, which has seven shutouts in those nine wins and has outscored its opponents 32-2 during that stretch. “We’re always happy to win a game especially at this stage of the season,” Adams said. “I thought Mulberry kind of sat back and let us have more possession than I expected. I expected more pressure from them. It threw us for a bit, because by the first water break, we hadn’t scored. All it takes is one mistake. I feel like we’re at a point where if we get a goal, then with our possession game it’s more difficult to get it back off us. We’re hitting our stride a little bit as well.” After the teams battled to a 0-0 tie at the first water stoppage, Anthony Lucio banged home a nice cross from Drew Snyder for the first goal with 16:48 remaining in the first half. A little more than a minute later Harrison Weitz smacked a shot off the post that would’ve doubled McKeel’s lead. Hunter Mendez eventually got it to 2-0 with 8:15 left and that’s where the two teams stood heading into halftime. The second half was full of close calls by McKeel as Alexander Alejo, Snyder and Rico Zuniga all missed solid chances. Finally, with 12:38 left, Alejo hammered home a free kick from 20 yards out to make it 3-0. Snyder finished the scoring with 5:50 left, on another free kick between two defenders and the keeper. “That’s been the story for us all year,” said Adams, who led the Wildcats to the state final four last year. “We’ve created a bunch of chances, but we haven’t been able to score as much as we would like. As long as we continue to be patient and keep scoring goals, there’s good things to come,” “We just have to take it one game at a time.” Ella Williams scored off an assist from Mari Carr, and KJ Straub scored with an assist from Allie Williams to give Lakeland Christian a victory over The Pine School.

in his office room, when a dented gray pickup stopped athwart the bow of his driveway. The bow is what Headwind calls the carport’s entrance. He calls the other end, at the garage door, the stern. He calls the sides port and starboard, all to remind visitors that in Biblical times he served in the Navy. “I think he does it mainly to remind himself,” Justin Casey says. “Headwind’s in that age bracket, y’know.” Speaking of Justin Casey, that was him in the dented pickup. He stepped down and shouted “Ahoy!” annoying Headwind. “Belay that. Speak plain English,” Headwind admonished him. “But you like using nautical argot,” Justin said. “I do,” Headwind said, “but I don’t like others using it.” Justin Casey’s known for being ready for anything. He always has at least two of everything, just in case he or somebody with him needs it. This makes him a popular member of the Fish or Cut Bait Society, well-known South Florida fishing club. You can test Justin in the real world: sneak a big rock aboard the boat and drop it over the side — splash! — when Justin isn’t looking. Shout something profane and say you just lost your rod and reel overboard in 300 feet of water. Justin will hand you a rod and reel. You’ll promise him you won’t drop them overboard. “If you do, I have another,” Justin will say. A lot of his spare fishing tackle is old stuff that still works, or that he thinks may work again in case he ever meets anyone who can repair it. Tiller, a modernist who is chairman of the steering committee, once took Justin Casey aside and tried to explain that there are no spare parts to fix his grandchildren's’ burned-out birthday candles that Justin saved. “I’m keeping them in case a friend needs them to wax his mustache” Justin asked. “Do you have a friend who waxes his mustache?” Tiller asked. Justin said not at the moment, but what if tomorrow? And what if he runs out of dubbing wax while tying flies? Justin is a child of the Great Depression, that time when the stock markets crashed. It was Oct. 24, 1929. People who woke up rich that morning went to bed poor that night. For the next five to 10 years, anyone who wasn’t starving or living in a refrigerator carton was made to feel guilty. “You had to salvage anything that broke or wore out,” Justin tells us. “It was a sin to throw stuff away because what if you or someone more needy, or more worthy, could use it? Not necessarily at that moment, but at any time in the next 100 years.” Headwind reminded us that he’s several years older than Justin. Of course he knows: “When my dad was a kid, his parents wouldn’t let him throw away rusted fish hooks because what if there was another world war? The metal might be needed to build military belt buckles.” Anyway, Justin is the reason for all those flies Headwind found in a drawer. Around 20 years ago, when he began tying his own, he made a lot of shaggy, ill-proportioned ones that he couldn’t have given away if he tried. Justin Casey persuaded him not to try, just in case there was another Great Depression and he couldn’t afford to buy flies. What if he caught arthritis and couldn’t tie his own any more? “Keep those flies for backups. They’re ugly but they’ll catch fish for you when you’re desperate,” he told Headwind. There’s hardly any space for Headwind in his own office. He bumps into and trips over stuff. He needs that drawer. Alone, it won’t solve his space and storage problem, but it’s part of a grander scheme. While re-disorganizing his garage, he discovered small amounts of space in several bins of flies. One bin contained several pocket boxes of trout flies from a trip to Patagonia in 2007. He knew then that he would return. He still doesn’t know when. Several more boxes contained landlocked salmon flies meant for Maine, where Headwind fished once or twice in the 1970s. Those flies, enticing streamers, might have served him well in Patagonia if he had remembered he had them — and where. I opened one of his baggies and found a lot of yellow and green freshwater streamers tied on saltwater hooks. “Great!” he cried. “Those are perfect for dolphin, also known as mahi mahi!” I asked when he last fished any of them. “I never did, because I forgot I had them,” he said. “Now that I remember, I will.” Another saltwater baggy contained a few flies tied on circle hooks. Headwind is pretty sure they are the first circle flies he ever tied. Now they’re in a box full of other circle flies that he uses a lot. Nobody else in the Fish or Cut Bait Society fishes circle flies, although Headwind has offered them around. He got the idea back when billfish tournaments started requiring contestants to use circle hooks with natural bait. Billfish don’t have teeth to bite their prey; they gulp it. A J-shaped hook is likely to snag harmfully in their gill rakers. A circle hook rolls back up to the mouth and snags in the jaw hinge. Headwind thought it might be a good idea for tarpon and snook, and he was right. Instead of yanking back on the fly line as soon as a fish bites, you simply press the line against the rod grip while the fish swims out the slack — usually about a second. It takes a while to get used to that, and most of us hate it because what is worse than losing a fish you’re going to release anyway? We’re trying to re-purpose as many of the trout and salmon flies as we can by adding weed guards. Headwind and I both like the full loop type. They’re easy to make when tying a fly, but a tedious pain in the rear to add to a fly already tied. Who do you guess taught us how to do that? Justin Casey did, and here he was. Headwind and I caught each other’s eyes, silently expressing the same idea. “This is a tedious pain in the rear,” I said, purposely adding a weed guard sloppily. “You’re embarrassing me. Give me that,” Justin said, and in the next couple of hours he turned a couple of dozen salmon flies into bass and peacock flies with full loop weed guards. Remember, all this work is part of the garage re-disorganization. You can’t tell at a glance, but Headwind has made a lot of progress. Without letting Justin Casey know, he got rid of a lot of old stuff he was never going to use again. Pretty soon, a lot of what’s crowding him out of his office will be moved to the garage. As you may guess, sorting flies is thirsty work. Headwind led us inside to the kitchen to collect three beers. With no malice aforethought, he set down a bin of flies that he’d forgotten he was carrying. “You will not stash that stuff in the kitchen!” his widow warned him. “Widow? I don’t have a widow,” Headwind said. “You will if you stash that stuff in the kitchen,” Mrs. Headwind said. Feedback: fishingdoer@gmail.com.

Chance of rain 50%. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 10:29 pm A Manhattan jury convicted former President Donald J. Trump on all 34 counts in his criminal hush money trial. Memorial Day just passed. It’s that special time of year when U.S. politicians, especially the right-wing, conservative ones draped in American flags, come out of the woodwork to spout their usual rhetoric: “We love, love our veterans, especially us Republicans who are America’s true patriot… Republican Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody wants the state agency in charge of investigating violations of the Florida Civil Rights Act to inspect Starbucks’ diversity, equity and inclusion practices. Josh Gibson became Major League Baseball’s career leader with a .372 batting average, surpassing Ty Cobb’s .367, when Negro Leagues records for more than 2,300 players were incorporated Tuesday after a three-year research project. A Florida bill proposes a three-day waiting period for firearm purchases, excluding weekends and holidays, with delivery allowed regardless of completed background checks, drawing support from gun rights advocates and criticism for potential risks from opponents. Among the provisions of a gun safety bill in 2018 – reforms from the Parkland shooting massacre – was allowing the state more than three days to complete a background check for a prospective firearm purchaser. But that law could change under a measure that gun supporters want but critics don’t, saying the bill is dangerous. The proposal (HB 17) is sponsored by Panhandle-area Republican Joel Rudman. Rudman’s bill states that “a mandatory 3-day waiting period, excluding weekends and legal holidays, is imposed between the purchase and delivery at retail of a firearm.” That means that the waiting period would be expired “regardless of whether a background check has been completed,” according to a staff analysis. In addition, the proposal says that if the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) is unable to determine whether a person is prohibited from purchasing a firearm from a licensed dealer within a three-day period, the FDLE must issue a conditional approval allowing a purchaser to be able to get the gun. “If FDLE subsequently determines that a purchaser is not authorized to possess a firearm, FDLE is required to notify ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) and a local law enforcement agency to retrieve the firearm,” according to the staff analysis. The bill is strongly supported by Gov. Ron DeSantis, who said earlier this month in Iowa before suspending his presidential campaign that “I think that the background checks should be instant.” Gun rights supporters came before the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee last week to complain that they know of gun purchasers who have had to wait for months to get a background check completed. However, the FDLE has said that 98% of such transactions are resolved within minutes. Critics called the proposal dangerous. “If passed, this [bill] could allow dangerous individuals such as those convicted of a felony or domestic violence, to gain access to firearms without passing a background check,” said Katherine Donovan, with Giffords Gun Owners for Safety. “The background check system works.” But Chris Smith, the owner of Gulf Coast Gun in Milton, Fla., said that since 2018 he has had more than 500 people – half of whom he said had concealed weapons permits – be held up three months or more with their background checks. “We’re holding up people’s Constitutional rights because an organization that doesn’t have the proper funding is setting these processes on their desks and not finishing them,” he said, referring to the FDLE. The measure passed 11-5 in the committee along party lines. An equivalent measure in the Senate (SB 1124) has yet to go before its committee.

It’s the award that means the most to John Rohan, director of The Villages Recreation and Parks. “There’s a lot of things that bring me much joy about what we’ve accomplished,” he said. “Achieving this national accreditation status provides additional validation to our agency and my 30 years of service to this profession. Our team is grateful for the support from the District administration, the Developer, our elected boards and residents during this process.” Providing first-class recreational opportunities to residents through an abundance of facilities and programming available in The Villages is what’s most important, Rohan said. “It’s mostly about being part of such a wonderful community of residents who embrace and support the vision of providing exceptional recreation and park services to help better their lives,” he said. Throughout 2023, the department went through an extensive review to show that it meets the highest level of standards and best practices in more than 150 categories such as mission, vision, relationships, planning, community involvement, organizational structure and fiscal responsibility. “Residents can be proud of the top-notch Recreation and Parks Department and team they have here in The Villages that is dedicated to providing lifestyle events and amazing facilities into the future,” said Kenny Blocker, District manager. The volume of recreation amenities and level of service provided by Recreation and Parks staff stood out to the accreditation committee, said Troy Houtman, director of Park and Recreation in Wichita, Kansas, who served as the leader of the review team. “The facilities were a standout, and the customer service is at the heart of the operations,” Houtman said. “This is a great accomplishment, and the community should be proud and supportive of the department.” Facilities What The Villages offers in recreation eclipses the number of amenities in most U.S. cities, according to data collected by the Trust for Public Land. With 253 pickleball courts, The Villages has 80 more courts than the top U.S. city — Honolulu, Hawaii, with 173 courts. There are more swimming pools in The Villages than any of the top 100 U.S. cities, according to the Trust for Public Land’s “City Park Facts” for 2023. The Villages has 113 swimming pools, of which 65 are adult pools, 36 are family pools and 12 are sports pools. In comparison, Chicago, the city with the next most, has 79 public pools followed by Philadelphia (72) and New York (66). Beyond pickleball courts and swimming pools, Rohan and his staff manage nearly 1,800 individual amenities at 116 recreation facilities including: • 15 softball fields at five complexes • 8 dog parks, with separate areas for small and large dogs • 7 fitness clubs at recreation centers, though membership fees apply. • More than 3,500 resident lifestyle clubs — with an equal number of residents serving as volunteer coordinators — meet at Villages recreation centers, and roughly 400 more residents coordinate outdoor sports activities. “The whole essence of this community is built on life and enjoyment and togetherness, and there is a synergy that exists where people want to engage and participate and interact,” Rohan said. Already in 2024, the department has welcomed the addition of the Hogeye Preserve Disc Golf Course, the first location for the sport in the community, and Cordoba Recreation, bringing a new resort-style family pool in addition to pickleball courts and corn toss to residents north of County Road 466. More new amenities are on the way to the northern area. A new game room is coming to La Hacienda Recreation, which will provide the first dedicated table tennis room in the community. Upcoming major renovations to Paradise Recreation will add 10,000 square feet of recreation space at the community’s original recreation center. Several recreation centers are in various stages of development in the Eastport area, south of Florida’s Turnpike. Olympia Recreation will bring four more softball fields and a new dog park. It also will be the first recreation center with an indoor gymnasium for pickleball, basketball, volleyball and a rock climbing wall. Other announced recreation centers on the way include Salukis, St. Tropez, Moultrie Creek, Shady Brooke, Oak Hollow, LaGrange, Lakeview and Waters Edge recreation centers. Programs Residents can enjoy and participate in a diverse list of recreation events offered by the department — including The Villages Senior Games, Camp Villages and The Enrichment Academy. The Villages Senior Games is an annual athletic event for individuals 50 and older that features sports including bowling, golf, pickleball, swimming, tennis, track and field and water volleyball. Camp Villages, another annual event, gives grandparents and their grandchildren the opportunity to participate in various activities together, such as arts and crafts, cooking classes, nature hunts, golf clinics and outdoor sports. Lisa Parkyn, lifestyles events manager for The Villages Recreation and Parks, said Camp Villages and The Villages Senior Games are two events that Villagers really embrace. “Camp Villages gives residents another reason to feel comfortable moving and living here, knowing that there are some options for when their grandchildren visit. I think most families and grandchildren are also impressed that there are all these opportunities,” Parkyn said. “When it comes to Senior Games, we have the facilities and the great area to host everything, where other communities do have to piecemeal together where they’re going to have some of their competitions.” The Enrichment Academy, which has been around since 2017, offers Villages residents a chance to expand their educational horizons. The adult education program is split into fall/winter and spring/summer semesters, with about 300 fee-based courses offered each semester for residents and the public in multiple subjects, including art, music, health and wellness, sports, language, travel, dance, writing, culinary, crafts, history and technology. “The Enrichment Academy is dedicated to offering innovative, quality programming,” said Melanie Sarakinis, recreation manager with the academy. “New instructors and courses are added each semester.” In addition to courses, residents can enjoy educational lectures each month through the program’s Speaker Series. “These cover different topics,” Sarakinis said. “We bring in global speakers about historical events, innovative technologies and experiences to share with the community.” Managing Editor Keith Pearlman can be reached at 352-753-1119, ext. 5347, or keith.pearlman@thevillagesmedia.com.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 8:18 pm The Supreme Court on Friday struck down a Trump-era ban on bump stocks, the rapid-fire gun accessories used in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, in a ruling that threw firearms back into the nation’s political spotlight. “Republicans are the party of Abraham Lincoln, but Black people are stuck on the Democratic plantation.” Red Lobster, which abruptly closed more than 50 restaurants last month, revealed in bankruptcy court that it could close at least 125 locations as it tries to recoup losses from its endless shrimp promotion. The nation's largest festival showcasing films by people of African descent returns this week for its 28th year with some of the country's hottest talents congregating here in South Florida. Among them: actor Denzel Washington, filmmaker Ava DuVernay and actress and writer Issa Rae. Florida faces an elevated risk of mosquito-borne illnesses due to early forecasts predicting a rainy year ahead, following historic outbreaks in the previous year, with officials emphasizing the crucial role of mosquito control efforts to mitigate health threats. Early forecasts warn of a rainy, wet year ahead, providing an ideal environment for mosquitoes to grow and thrive and creating increased risk for humans of contracting a mosquito-borne illness. This warning, shared at a recent press conference, comes after historic mosquito-borne illnesses last year, including Florida’s largest dengue fever outbreak in more than 75 years and the first locally transmitted case of malaria in the state in more than 20 years. “These public servants are unsung heroes,” said Brandon area Sen. Jim Boyd, referring to mosquito control workers. “The potential health threat to tens of millions of Floridians and visitors is dramatically reduced by mosquito control professionals who deploy high-tech tools, scientific research and 24/7 work in the air and on the ground.” He reiterated warnings of increased mosquito activity and associated health risks. “But I rest easy, and Floridians can too, knowing our state has the nation’s best mosquito-control teams working to protect our health and our economy,” Boyd added during last week’s remarks. The Florida Mosquito Control Association (FMCA) includes 15 independent mosquito control districts throughout the state, with elected boards that work with Florida’s 42 county and municipal mosquito control programs. Each year, representatives from the group travel to Tallahassee during the legislative session to advocate for their work, and for resources needed to complete it. “We are proud to work with so many partners including local health departments and local officials,” said Phil Goodman, FMCA board member and chair of the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District. “But one of the biggest reasons for our success in controlling mosquitoes is the constant collaboration between mosquito control programs and districts. Whether it’s Pensacola or Miami or anywhere in between, we work as one statewide unit when it comes to ensuring we are all doing our best work to keep our state healthy and our economy booming.” Mosquito-borne illness is nothing new in Florida – scientists have been educating the public about risks for more than a century – but the risks remain, including from Zika, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus and dengue fever. “As a practicing physician in the Florida Keys I have seen firsthand the detrimental effects of what a simple mosquito bite can do to the human body,” said Stan Zuba, a pediatrician and Florida Keys Mosquito Control District board member. “Due to Florida’s tropical and subtropical climates, we have to remain vigilant all year-round – using appropriate protections and repellants while outdoors, especially during the dawn and dusk hours when mosquitoes are most active.” Also present at the press conference were members of the Legislature and Bob Lotane, a Tallahassee resident who in 2014 contracted West Nile Virus after being bitten by a mosquito. He cautioned Floridians to remain vigilant, retelling his experience with the illness and urging others to protect themselves and their loved ones.

I didn’t anymore. The photo was at least 10 years old, when I was still dying my hair brown with blonde highlights. I’ve had white hair for seven years and avoiding Covid had nothing to do with it. I just wanted to save a pile of money and the time it took to dye it. I’m sure the state thought they were doing us all a favor when they used the same photo they had for years, and didn’t require a new license until 2028. And nobody minds looking younger than they are. But I’m 77 now, and the only thing still recognizable on my license photo was my smile. So, I kept the license as is, but then two things happened that changed my mind. I tried to update an online account that required me to take a selfie and an image of my driver’s license. The answer was something similar to phishing, faking who you are online. That company refused to believe the new me was me. And worse-case scenario, the next time I traveled, my first trip after Covid, I would probably be stopped and pulled aside at the airport for impersonating me. Who wants to risk that? So, I made an appointment to replace my driver’s license at the Palm Beach County Tax Collector’s facility on Congress Avenue in Delray Beach. You can’t just show up. You have to make an appointment and you can do that online at this link: My appointment was less than a week later, and I only had to wait about 20 minutes longer. When my number was called, I told the customer service rep I wanted to replace my license. He had me pose against a portable white screen at his station for the photo, and I handed him my old license. I got both back. The whole process took minutes and cost $38.10. Best photo I ever took and money I ever spent.

Clayton and other students said they think the removal of both LLCs could be related to legislation banning funding of diversity, equity and inclusion programs at state universities, which has left the future of diversity-related initiatives like LLCs and the Center for Multicultural Engagement unclear. As spring break kicked off, college students rushed to Florida beaches for a week of partying and relaxation. But the idyllic image of spring break fails to resonate with everyone. Beaches are left littered, crime spikes and excessive partying disrupts some students who are looking for a laid back beach day at home. If a poet, athlete, music enthusiast and novice ping pong player were gathered into a room, it may seem like they wouldn't have much in common. The UF cheerleading team currently has 13 men and 24 women, divided into a combination of male-female stunt pairs and all-girl groups. The athletes spent most of the two-hour practice preparing for next month’s cheer tryout, during which they’ll do their best to recruit talented newcomers — and show up themselves to re-earn their spots on the team. But tryouts will be less competitive for some than others. The winner of the Florida Invitational Step Show’s Stroll Off competition, Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, is focusing on its community and celebrating Black culture — despite an arrest that occurred at the event last weekend. The Divine Nine promote academic excellence for African American students on predominantly white campuses. It also provides them with a space to address pertinent issues within the Black community, said Ammir Thomas, vice president of Theta Sigma Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity. In 2023, the UF Police Department had 122 cases of registered bike theft. That’s 60% higher than the previous year, which saw 76 thefts. The numbers for registered cases in the preceding years were 76 in 2022, 84 in 2021, 130 in 2020 and 104 in 2019, even with the effects of COVID-19. Black UF students form strong bonds through diverse campus organizations at the predominantly white university. David Canton, UF director of African American studies, calls it the “eyeball test.” For vegan students like Maxine Sculthorpe, an 18-year-old UF biomedical engineering freshman, walking into a new dining hall can be intimidating because her food options are frequently limited to meager portions and subpar substitutes, she said. Every semester, a small group of students have the opportunity to play the Century Tower Carillon — an instrument made of bells — ranked among one of the largest university carillons out of the less than 200 nationwide. Since the carillon’s first recital in 1979, each student’s performance is an addition to the tower's historic legacy and unique sound, according to its website. With a prominent LGBTQ+ community at UF, including the UF Pride Student Union and the UF LGBTQ+ Alumni Association, gendered housing can be a difficult experience for many students on campus. Out of 26 residence halls on campus, UF only has one gender neutral housing option — the Lavender Living Learning Community, located in Springs Residential Complex, hopes to create a more inclusive and diverse housing experience. Students’ first impressions of the temporary dining hall included “eating in the trenches,” “an interesting experience” and “kind of cute” since its opening Jan. 6. The climate-controlled Norman Field structure will serve UF students while The Eatery at Broward Hall undergoes a full renovation. In the past two years, the areas surrounding Gainesville campuses saw both the Thanksgiving weekend shooting and the shootings at The Crossing. Both UF and Santa Fe College received hoax school shooting threat calls in 2023 as well. Both UF and Santa Fe College students have concerns about campus safety. The start of every semester brings about a new wave of academic goals and resolutions, with students scrambling to find the best tips and tricks for productivity. While there’s no doubt that building healthy study habits is important, finding the perfect space to implement those habits is just as important.""}]"

The burn’s purpose is to reduce hazardous fuel loads and maintain fire-dependent natural communities. Prescribed fire is the use of carefully planned fire purposefully set under stringent conditions to manage the fire's effects. Before conducting a burn, the District ensures that wind and other weather conditions are correct for managing the fire and minimizing the impacts of smoke to residents and traffic. Periodic prescribed fires on District lands enhance the land’s environmental quality and protect its neighbors from destructive wildfires, but not without the possibility of temporary nuisances, such as smoke and ash. Prescribed fires help prevent wildfires by burning off fuels that naturally build up over time, while also helping to manage the growth of woody shrubs. In fire-dependent ecosystems, fire is nearly as important as rainfall and sunshine. The benefits of prescribed fire include restoring and maintaining natural communities, reducing chances of destructive wildfires, perpetuating fire-adapted plants and animals, cycling nutrients, managing tree diseases and opening scenic vistas. Follow the District on social media to know when prescribed burns are taking place in your area.

Readers are encouraged to comment or submit a Letter to the Editor to share their opinions. To submit a Letter to the Editor, follow the instructions here. The conservative crusade against all things “woke” has claimed another victim. On Jan. 2, Claudine Gay, Harvard University’s first Black president, resigned due to the fallout from her statements on antisemitism and accusations of plagiarism. At six months and two days, her tenure as president was the shortest in the school’s almost 390-year history. The backlash from prominent conservatives helped fan the flames of her demise, but let’s linger on the two main issues for a moment. In the closing moments of the Dec. 5 congressional hearing, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) asked a question: “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Harvard’s rules on bullying and harassment?” To this inquiry, Gay responded, “It can be, depending on the context.” That’s it. This 10-second interaction is why Harvard’s 30th president is now unemployed. Gay is entirely correct here; any potential disciplinary outcome would rely solely on the context of the situation. What I find insidiously genius about Stefanik’s question is that it did two things—first, it framed an incredibly nuanced question as a simple yes-or-no, and second, it masked a question about free speech as one about antisemitism. If Gay were to say “yes,” she would be both lying and setting a broad precedent for how to apply Harvard’s code of conduct. If her answer were “no,” she would also be lying and framed as antisemitic and unsupportive of Jewish students. However, because the question addresses the issue of free speech on campus, she had to say that it depends on context because issues regarding speech have always depended on their contexts. This is the trap Stefanik laid out for Gay. Honestly, it’s a perfect way to audition herself as Trump’s potential running mate. As for the accusations of plagiarism, the evidence is about as structurally sound as a house of cards. A few “instances of inadequate citation” and “duplicative language without appropriate attribution” (both of which she later corrected) in a 1997 doctoral dissertation seem like another example of conservative critics grasping for straws. While Gay doesn’t have the most substantial academic catalog, these accusations should’ve been of no concern to anyone. The resignation of Gay is the Republican Party’s latest victory in their war against the education system. For nearly two years, conservatives have waged this war on our nation’s schools, colleges and universities. From Alabama to Wyoming, Republican politicians across the country are on a mission to eradicate all things “woke” (still don’t know what that means) from our learning institutions. Unfortunately, the Republicans are winning this battle. Our schools will no longer serve as bastions of learning or free speech and expression if conservatives continue to have their way.

The tax also funded schools, parks, fire stations, public safety investments, libraries and other community needs. “It was so important, not just for the stadium,” former Tampa Mayor Dick Greco, who knew Chillura since childhood, said Tuesday. “The schools were about to go on double sessions.” In a 2021 Tampa Bay Times interview, Chillura compared the tax to the old Sweet Tomatoes buffet restaurant on Dale Mabry Highway near the stadium, known for its vast array of food choices. “I said, ‘You know what, that concept could fly for a tax where everybody gets a little bit of something,’” he said, “even if they don’t like the other something.” The tax passed in 1996 with 53% of the vote. “He stuck his neck out,” said Tampa political consultant Victor DiMaio, a longtime friend. “He took a lot of heat for it at the time.” Through fiscal year 2022, the tax has generated $2.6 billion. As it reaches its 30-year sunset, the County Commission is considering whether to put its renewal on the November ballot for voters to decide. “But he never boasted about it, never said, ‘Oh, I did this, I did that,’” Greco said. “A very quiet, very nice person. Not what you see in politics today.” Subscribe to our free Stephinitely newsletter Want more of our free, weekly newsletters in your inbox? Let’s get started. Chillura also championed the Neighborhood Bill of Rights, advocated for the Landmarks Ordinance for Historic Preservation and helped establish the Hillsborough County Economic Development Department. In 1972, he helped draft an ordinance to make downtown Tampa greener. The Planning Commission gave him its Person of Vision Award. Chillura often encouraged others to get involved in community matters and politics. To the end, he remained deeply concerned about Tampa’s shrinking tree canopy. “Joe had a lot of perseverance. If he made up his mind to get something done, he made it happen,” said his wife Mary Helen Chillura in a news release. “He wanted to make Tampa a better place, and I think he did that.” Chillura ran for Congress in 1998 but lost to Jim Davis. The Chillura name endures in Tampa. A busy public park across from the downtown courthouse is named Joe Chillura Courthouse Square, site of gatherings, protests and work lunches. His family is involved in local banking, and his grandson Max Chillura owns five Chill Bros. ice cream shops around town. Known for his affability, Chillura regularly held court at the West Tampa Sandwich Shop at his same table to the right of the door. Regulars, Republicans and Democrats alike, would quietly read their newspapers over cafe con leche, and then the ribbing would begin, DiMaio said. Another regular was the late Jack Espinosa, a former comedian and sheriff’s office spokesperson with a slapstick style. Across the table, Chillura was the opposite, his barbs dryer and more subtle. “I miss some of that give and take,” DiMaio said. “Joe was from the old school.” He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Mary Helen, a teacher at Berkeley Preparatory School; five children: Tina, Joe, Conna, Paul, and Vincent; and grandchildren, Christopher, Avery, Patton, Max, Hadley, Nash, Audriana, Adaline, and Annalise. He is survived by his sister, Mary Diecidue. A Mass will be held Thursday, Feb. 8, at 2 p.m. at Christ the King Church, 821 S. Dale Mabry Highway, with the family receiving friends from 1-2 p.m. That will be followed by a celebration of life outside Armature Works near Oak & Ola restaurant. Instead of flowers, the family asked for donations to St. Peter Claver School or Villa Madonna School. “We’re going to miss him,” Greco said. “But at least he lived a wonderful life.” Sue Carlton is an urban affairs reporter, covering Tampa’s ongoing development.

Yoni Buckman Report: Less than 250,000 Holocaust survivors still live; 18% in North America Fewer than 250,000 Holocaust survivors remain alive today, according to an unprecedented new report by the organization that has sought to ensure that they are compensated for their suffering. The oldest known survivor, according to the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, is New Yorker Rose Girone, who turned 112 last month. She and her family fled Nazi Germany for Shanghai, where they endured terrible conditions before making their way to the United States. “My mother will be the first to tell you, we’re very lucky all around,” said her daughter Reha Bennicasa, who at 85 is just below the median age of survivors today (86). The Claims Conference has long shared basic information about who is receiving the aid it negotiates annually with Germany and offered a similar number of estimated survivors last year. But the new demographic overview is the first to break down the population of Jewish survivors by country of birth and current country of residence; age; gender; and the percentages receiving various compensations and services. It identifies survivors in more than 90 countries: 49 percent reside in Israel, 18 percent in North America, another 18 percent in Western Europe; and 12 percent in the former Soviet Union. The youngest are on the cusp of 80 – the war ended in 1945 – and 61 percent are women. The organization says the statistics show that the work of helping survivors is far from over. “Now is the time to double down on our attention on this waning population,” said Gideon Taylor, president of the Claims Conference. “Now is when they need us the most.” Your email address will not be published.

Drawing from lessons learned in the last two historical downturns, where we witnessed unprepared lenders face severe consequences, it is imperative for lenders and financial institutions to act now. February 06, 2024 at 09:08 AM 7 minute read Board of Contributors Loan defaults and workouts are on the rise again due to a confluence of factors causing headwinds including: the surge in interest rates and real estate owners inability to refinance maturing loans at affordable rates; the continued rise in the cost of certain materials needed for renovation and construction; the staggering cost of flood and windstorm coverage and the impossibility of even obtaining coverage; and the loan maturing in the near future without satisfactory options to refinance or be otherwise paid off on time. Anticipating the fallout from potentially billions of dollars in distressed loans, lenders must be on high alert. Drawing from lessons learned in the last two historical downturns, where we witnessed unprepared lenders face severe consequences, it is imperative for lenders and financial institutions to act now. Identifying distressed borrowers and projects is a critical first step, acknowledging the inevitability that many loans are already or may default in the near future. By taking proactive measures now, lenders can not only brace for the storm but also enhance and protect their available legal remedies in the event of a borrower’s default. The subsequent steps outlined in this article offer a strategic guide for lenders, empowering them to navigate the complexities of loan workouts and enforcement actions with resilience and foresight. If a default has occurred the lender may want to have counsel draft a form of reservation of rights or nonwaiver letter. The letter should identify the known breaches and should also include “nonwaiver” type language which generally states that notwithstanding the breach or default the lender is reserving all rights under the loan documents and is not waiving any right or remedy thereafter even though it may be taking no action at that time to enforce its remedies. Before discussing a potential loan workout with a borrower or proceeding to exercise the remedies available, lenders should first evaluate their legal position, which includes conducting a thorough review of all loan documents including all organizational documents, title insurance policies, surveys and other due diligence materials received at closing and thereafter. Taking inventory of all collateral is also important if possible. A careful review of the loan file should be conducted to identify any documents and correspondence that may adversely impact enforcement of remedies. You don’t want to go to war with defective loan documents or due diligence issues that should have been addressed before the loan closed or thereafter. We recommend that a new pair of eyes go through all relevant documents. Unfortunately, it is human nature that the counsel who handled the loan previously may have missed or overlooked something that will become critical during the workout, foreclosure or REO sale thereafter. Further, lenders should consider whether there are any technical issues with the loan documents and loan structure that could complicate enforcement. Lenders should pay particular attention to what constitutes an “event of default” under the loan documents, keeping in mind the borrower’s financial and non-financial covenants, as well as the remedies available to both parties when an event of default occurs, including, without limitation, any required notices and applicable cure periods. After the lender and its counsel have reviewed the loan documents and defects if any have been identified, it is also prudent to conduct an updated review of diligence items with respect to the collateral which secures its loan, the borrower and any guarantors, including, without limitation, updated searches, title, review of financial information with respect to the property, borrower and any guarantor and current organizational documents. The lender may also want to obtain an updated appraisal and environmental audit. By performing loan document review and analysis and the updated diligence, the lender will better understand its position and leverage before entering into negotiations with the borrower. Any existing liens or other title defects may complicate any foreclosure sale and further slowdown enforcement, which is already a lengthy process. Before beginning any substantive discussions with a borrower regarding a loan modification or forbearance agreement, we recommend that the lender require that the borrow and any guarantor execute a pre-negotiation letter agreement. A pre-negotiation letter agreement sets forth the parameters of the negotiations between borrower and lender prior to memorializing such negotiations in any written document. We recommend that the pre-negotiation letter agreement include a requirement that the borrower and any guarantors provide certain updated due diligence information described above to the extent that the lender’s file does not include this information. To the extent that a lender elects to withhold from enforcing its rights under the loan documents as a result of a borrower or lender default, the parties should enter into a loan modification or forbearance agreement. Generally speaking, it is best practice that the forbearance agreement include an acknowledgement by the borrower and any guarantors that a default has occurred under the loan documents and that the lender agrees to refrain from exercising its rights and remedies for a specific period of time, provided that the borrower and any guarantor comply with the conditions set out in the loan modification or forbearance agreement. The forbearance agreement at a minimum should include the following provisions: recitals, admission of outstanding loan balance, debt service payments during the period of forbearance, forbearance period, conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the forbearance agreement, forbearance events of default and remedies, retroactive default interest from the date of the initial default, release of lender, waiver of bankruptcy stay, consent to appointment of a receiver and foreclosure, agreement not to contest foreclosure and reaffirmation of guaranty. The process for enforcing a loan through foreclosure varies across jurisdictions, so lenders should understand the unique process in their jurisdiction. The loan documents may allow the lender to ask a court to appoint a receiver to take possession of and manage the property until the foreclosure is finalized and the property is sold through a foreclosure sale; provided, however, the applicable standard for the appointment of a receiver varies by jurisdiction. Lenders should also be aware that language in a loan document that allows a lender to “request” or “apply” for the appointment of a receiver does not necessarily entitle the lender to that appointment in most cases. Most states have recently adopted a model receivership law making it a bit easier to obtain a receiver in different venues around the country. In light of the current interest rate environment, borrowers are getting more desperate to hold onto their current financing and will employ various delay tactics to prevent lenders from enforcing their rights. These types of defensive tactics can significantly increase the time and expense associated with enforcement of the loan. Throughout the workout and/or enforcement process, lenders should be aware of their exposure to potential lender liability claims. Borrowers may bring claims based on a lenders’ failure to honor its obligations under the loan documents, unreasonably delay, or lack of good faith. These claims will open lenders up to discovery, which can be time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, lenders should keep in mind that all non-privileged communications may be discoverable and keep all internal and external communication professional. Lenders should ensure that all discussions with the borrower and any guarantor are well documented and subject to confidentiality requirements set forth in the pre-negotiation letter agreement and/or forbearance agreement. In conclusion, with loan defaults and workouts on the rise due to various challenges, lenders must act proactively to safeguard their interests. By taking measures now, lenders can enhance their readiness to navigate the challenges ahead, protecting both their assets and legal remedies. In the evolving financial landscape, foresight and preparedness are key to resilience. —Meagen E. Leary and Phillip Hudson, attorneys with the firm, assisted in the preparation of this article.

Since her son Staff Sgt. John A. Reiners was killed on duty in Afghanistan more than 14 years ago, she has honored his sacrifice each Memorial Day by serving veterans and their families. And her efforts have helped hundreds. Because Ronna Jackson not only keeps Memorial Day in honor of her son, but each and every day in tribute. “I’m a mom just trying to keep a promise made to my son — to take care of his troops and his men,” she said of a vow made when the young staff sergeant was sent on his second deployment. She reminded herself of that promise while at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, during the transfer ceremony of her son’s remains. It was Valentine’s Day, 2010. “For years, I couldn’t think of Valentine’s Day as I did before,” she said. “It kept reminding me of one of the saddest times in my life.” On Feb. 13, 2010, Reiners and two other soldiers of the 4th Infantry Division out of Fort Carson, Colorado, were killed after an insurgent on a motorcycle detonated an improvised explosive device near them. Several others were wounded. The action also widowed Reiners’ wife, Casey, and orphaned his son, Lex. In recognition of his bravery, Reiners was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. He had earned a previous Purple Heart while serving in Iraq. Reiners’ other awards and decorations include three awards of the Army Commendation Medal, two awards of the Army Achievement Medal, the Combat Infantry Badge, the Air Assault Badge and the Army Ranger Tab. His grandfather — Ronna Jackson’s father-in-law Jay Jackson of Haines City, Florida, – earned a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart while serving two tours in Vietnam. “The military and service were always part of our family,” said Jackson. As a VFW post auxiliary president, Jackson continues this tradition. Around the combat veterans in VFW Post 2811, she experiences the camaraderie shared by those who’ve fought to help preserve the freedom of others. Jackson’s responsibilities as post auxiliary president include organizing and managing dozens of fundraisers, dinners, breakfasts and outreach activities. By her own admission, she devotes approximately 20 hours each week above her full-time job. This past month, she helped with the Young Marines recruit graduation ceremony, a cookout for veterans living at Gainesville’s Sunshine Inn, a post steak night, several canteen dinners, a post clean-up, an outreach with Grow Gainesville, and the Florida4Warriors, Inc. Nick Tilliman Silkies Memorial Walk. She is quick to point out that none of this could be accomplished without her fellow auxiliary members. “From the first day that I joined, I was welcomed with open arms of love and support from the entire VFW auxiliary and all of Post 2811,” she said. “They were also very supportive of me as a Gold Star parent. Any events or service projects that we do, they are all there to help and support for the good of the cause.” In addition to her work with the VFW, the auxiliary president has volunteered with several other veterans service organizations, such as the American Legion, the American Gold Star Mothers, and the Military Order of the Purple Heart. She has also organized fundraisers and assembled gift packages for veterans and troops deployed overseas. Her efforts and that of the entire post, said Jackson, help fulfill the VFW’s motto — ‘to honor the dead by helping the living.’ “I feel that my service to our heroes here in the Gainesville community help keep my son’s legacy alive,” she said. “I would be honored to keep working with our auxiliary to help those veterans in the post and in our community.” Jackson said that her work with the VFW auxiliary is also helping heal her heart. During a Valentine’s Day outreach event for those living at the VFW Veterans Village in nearby Fort McCoy, she was struck by the happiness she brought to the former soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines. “Many of the residents there haven’t any family,” the auxiliary president said. “But they’ve all served in the military, and that bond they share brings them together. A kind word, a handshake or a small gift goes a long way. For the first time in many years, I was able to enjoy Valentine’s Day again.” Other Gold Star parents, Jackson said, could also benefit from meeting and working with veterans. “It helps you take one day at a time, because every day is an emotional roller coaster,” she said. “You will have good days and not so good days. But you can take comfort in knowing that the community is here to support you, and to get you through this difficult time.” Those interested in VFW Post 2811 and its Auxiliary can call 352-376-7660. * * * Editor’s Note: Michael P.

Seeking a partnership with the County, City Manager Mike DaRoza said the City embarked on the Pinkoson Spring project after completing the Mill Creek Wetland Park project behind Sonny’s near I-75. Assistant City Manager Rodolfo Valladares and Economic Development Manager David Wisener presented the joint commissions with the findings of a report by Water & Air Research, Inc. commissioned by the City of Alachua. Analysts reviewed several metrics in concluding that the site known as Pinkoson Spring is indeed a spring and not just stream from overland flows. The report contains an analysis of water temperature, depth of stream, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen and pH and compares those values to five other Florida spring runs. Analysts found the Pinkoson Spring measurements to be consistent with ranges of others. Water & Air Research, Inc. also measured several other downstream components of Pinkoson Spring’s water chemistry, including alkalinity, calcium, magnesium, nitrogen, sodium, and sulfates. While flowing an average of just 140 gallons per minute in recent months, analysts stated that the flow rate would fluctuate seasonally and was similar to those flow rates of Boulware Springs and Glen Springs, in Gainesville. The report states that both Boulware Springs and Glen Springs have experienced reductions in discharge rates. These discharge rates would classify Pinkoson Spring as a 4th magnitude spring in 2024 and 5th magnitude in Spring 2023,” the report states. Pinkoson Spring also shares with Boulware Springs and Glen Springs a history of being a swimming area. Pinkoson Spring was not always so obscure. In the 1920s, it appeared to be a popular picnic location. Historic photographs dated for Sept. 5, 1927, Labor Day, show hundreds of people gathered around a large swimming area for a “Trades-Union Picnic.” By the 1940s, the name of the site had been changed to Milwaukee Springs and was marketed as a “colored only” swimming area. According to Wisner, who is also a local history buff, in the 1940s, it had been hoped that the site would garner attention and be a rest and relaxation destination for African-American soldiers stationed at Camp Blanding.

Since her son Staff Sgt. John A. Reiners was killed on duty in Afghanistan more than 14 years ago, she has honored his sacrifice each Memorial Day by serving veterans and their families. And her efforts have helped hundreds. Because Ronna Jackson not only keeps Memorial Day in honor of her son, but each and every day in tribute. “I’m a mom just trying to keep a promise made to my son — to take care of his troops and his men,” she said of a vow made when the young staff sergeant was sent on his second deployment. She reminded herself of that promise while at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, during the transfer ceremony of her son’s remains. It was Valentine’s Day, 2010. “For years, I couldn’t think of Valentine’s Day as I did before,” she said. “It kept reminding me of one of the saddest times in my life.” On Feb. 13, 2010, Reiners and two other soldiers of the 4th Infantry Division out of Fort Carson, Colorado, were killed after an insurgent on a motorcycle detonated an improvised explosive device near them. Several others were wounded. The action also widowed Reiners’ wife, Casey, and orphaned his son, Lex. In recognition of his bravery, Reiners was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. He had earned a previous Purple Heart while serving in Iraq. Reiners’ other awards and decorations include three awards of the Army Commendation Medal, two awards of the Army Achievement Medal, the Combat Infantry Badge, the Air Assault Badge and the Army Ranger Tab. His grandfather — Ronna Jackson’s father-in-law Jay Jackson of Haines City, Florida, – earned a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart while serving two tours in Vietnam. “The military and service were always part of our family,” said Jackson. As a VFW post auxiliary president, Jackson continues this tradition. Around the combat veterans in VFW Post 2811, she experiences the camaraderie shared by those who’ve fought to help preserve the freedom of others. Jackson’s responsibilities as post auxiliary president include organizing and managing dozens of fundraisers, dinners, breakfasts and outreach activities. By her own admission, she devotes approximately 20 hours each week above her full-time job. This past month, she helped with the Young Marines recruit graduation ceremony, a cookout for veterans living at Gainesville’s Sunshine Inn, a post steak night, several canteen dinners, a post clean-up, an outreach with Grow Gainesville, and the Florida4Warriors, Inc. Nick Tilliman Silkies Memorial Walk. She is quick to point out that none of this could be accomplished without her fellow auxiliary members. “From the first day that I joined, I was welcomed with open arms of love and support from the entire VFW auxiliary and all of Post 2811,” she said. “They were also very supportive of me as a Gold Star parent. Any events or service projects that we do, they are all there to help and support for the good of the cause.” In addition to her work with the VFW, the auxiliary president has volunteered with several other veterans service organizations, such as the American Legion, the American Gold Star Mothers, and the Military Order of the Purple Heart. She has also organized fundraisers and assembled gift packages for veterans and troops deployed overseas. Her efforts and that of the entire post, said Jackson, help fulfill the VFW’s motto — ‘to honor the dead by helping the living.’ “I feel that my service to our heroes here in the Gainesville community help keep my son’s legacy alive,” she said. “I would be honored to keep working with our auxiliary to help those veterans in the post and in our community.” Jackson said that her work with the VFW auxiliary is also helping heal her heart. During a Valentine’s Day outreach event for those living at the VFW Veterans Village in nearby Fort McCoy, she was struck by the happiness she brought to the former soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines. “Many of the residents there haven’t any family,” the auxiliary president said. “But they’ve all served in the military, and that bond they share brings them together. A kind word, a handshake or a small gift goes a long way. For the first time in many years, I was able to enjoy Valentine’s Day again.” Other Gold Star parents, Jackson said, could also benefit from meeting and working with veterans. “It helps you take one day at a time, because every day is an emotional roller coaster,” she said. “You will have good days and not so good days. But you can take comfort in knowing that the community is here to support you, and to get you through this difficult time.” Those interested in VFW Post 2811 and its Auxiliary can call 352-376-7660. * * * Editor’s Note: Michael P.

Seeking a partnership with the County, City Manager Mike DaRoza said the City embarked on the Pinkoson Spring project after completing the Mill Creek Wetland Park project behind Sonny’s near I-75. Assistant City Manager Rodolfo Valladares and Economic Development Manager David Wisener presented the joint commissions with the findings of a report by Water & Air Research, Inc. commissioned by the City of Alachua. Analysts reviewed several metrics in concluding that the site known as Pinkoson Spring is indeed a spring and not just stream from overland flows. The report contains an analysis of water temperature, depth of stream, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen and pH and compares those values to five other Florida spring runs. Analysts found the Pinkoson Spring measurements to be consistent with ranges of others. Water & Air Research, Inc. also measured several other downstream components of Pinkoson Spring’s water chemistry, including alkalinity, calcium, magnesium, nitrogen, sodium, and sulfates. While flowing an average of just 140 gallons per minute in recent months, analysts stated that the flow rate would fluctuate seasonally and was similar to those flow rates of Boulware Springs and Glen Springs, in Gainesville. The report states that both Boulware Springs and Glen Springs have experienced reductions in discharge rates. These discharge rates would classify Pinkoson Spring as a 4th magnitude spring in 2024 and 5th magnitude in Spring 2023,” the report states. Pinkoson Spring also shares with Boulware Springs and Glen Springs a history of being a swimming area. Pinkoson Spring was not always so obscure. In the 1920s, it appeared to be a popular picnic location. Historic photographs dated for Sept. 5, 1927, Labor Day, show hundreds of people gathered around a large swimming area for a “Trades-Union Picnic.” By the 1940s, the name of the site had been changed to Milwaukee Springs and was marketed as a “colored only” swimming area. According to Wisner, who is also a local history buff, in the 1940s, it had been hoped that the site would garner attention and be a rest and relaxation destination for African-American soldiers stationed at Camp Blanding. That endeavor did not seem to have gained momentum, although at least one picture shows what appears to be a building with a ticket booth and possibly a restaurant.

A state budget for the year beginning in July is the only bill the Florida Constitution requires lawmakers to approve. Both the House and Senate are set to consider separate versions of a $115 billion-plus spending plan Wednesday, the 30th day of the scheduled 60-day session. But the homestretch of the session will involve settling an array of other proposals, including some like the Senate’s ethics legislation, which is drawing heightened focus. “This legislation would have a profound corrosive effect on transparency and accountability of government, in the form of precluding and preventing any ethics scrutiny on every level of both the state and local ethics commissions,” said Caroline Klancke, executive director of the nonprofit Florida Ethics Institute. Sen. Danny Burgess, R-Zephyrhills, last week unveiled new amendments to the ethics bill (SB 7014) that would prohibit both state and local ethics commissions from pursuing any investigation unless the complaint came from someone with ""personal knowledge"" of wrongdoing and willing to identify themselves by name and file under oath. Anything short of that would be considered hearsay, prohibiting commissioners from investigating potential ethical violations. The measure was approved 39-0 by the Senate. But critics say it is certain to undermine scores of complaints which often come from citizens who’ve read news stories about potential ethics violations or heard about them through second-hand sources. The idea of relying on a witness to wrongdoing stepping forward, swearing in and identifying themselves could eliminate much of the investigatory work of ethics panels, critics say. But Burgess defended his approach, saying it is “simply for fairness ... so somebody’s not just throwing (a complaint) out there. It has to be based on some form of merit.” Kirby Oberdorfer, director of Jacksonville’s Office of Ethics, Compliance and Oversight, told the Florida Times-Union that the legislation would make local ethics officials “lap dogs instead of watchdogs.” By raising the bar so high on complaints, ethics officials said most would likely never surface, shielding violators. While Senate President Kathleen Passidomo, R-Naples, said she saw no problem with the measure, House Speaker Paul Renner, R-Palm Coast, was less committal, saying only it’s “something we’re certainly going to look at.” In the session’s closing 30 days, the back-and-forth between the House and Senate will be critical to the fate of key priorities on both sides. After ignoring it for most of the session’s first half, the Senate added oomph to a Renner priority this week, with that chamber\'s Judiciary Committee approving a proposed ban on anyone under age 16 from having a social media account. The House bill (HB 1) already has won full approval there, but Monday’s Senate review was the first time that side had taken up Renner’s push. While Democrats have raised questions about the constitutionality of the measure – which many critics say violates the First Amendment right to speech – Renner and House Republicans are pressing for action. Last week’s appearance before Congress by Meta chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the impact of social media seems to have added loft to the Florida effort. But even Gov. Ron DeSantis, no stranger to promoting policies challenged on constitutional grounds, has questioned the “breadth” of the social media proposal. Similarly, in the session’s closing weeks, some level of agreement between the House and Senate also is needed on dueling approaches to proposed changes in child labor laws, education testing and standards, a big-ticket prison construction package and Passidomo’s priority, ""Live Healthy,"" a plan aimed at improving Florida’s health care workforce and access to care by patients. Renner has vowed that his side will approve Live Healthy, even though it is only beginning to see light in the House after being approved by the Senate early in the session. “The Senate president and I are working together very well,” Renner recently said of his exchanges with Passidomo. But some measures look doubtful. Budget rolling along – but smaller: 2024 Session: Florida Legislature rolling back state spending in \'austere\' budget plans Senate has some ideas on school de-regs: Legislative session: Education deregulation bills OK\'d by Florida Senate, head to House House and Senate leaders have rebuffed efforts to revisit gambling legislation and create a provision setting the stage for Miami Beach’s Fontainebleau Hotel to open a casino. Jeffrey Soffer, developer of the hotel, has poured money into Republican lawmakers political committees and flew Gov. Ron DeSantis on his jet. While DeSantis appeared behind an effort to re-address state gambling laws to let Soffer obtain a needed pari-mutuel license, leaders have ruled it out. “My priority, and I think we’re all kind of on the same page, is that we get the Seminole (gambling) compact up and running, get it functioning well, and not stub our toe on something that would breach that – and there are some bills out there that I think would breach that,” Renner said, referring to the 2021 agreement with the state\'s Seminole Tribe. The state is expected to draw $500 million annually from the tribe, in exchange for giving it exclusive control of sports betting in Florida. Another push that may be sidetracked is the House’s effort to rollback to age 18 a ban on anyone buying a rifle or shotgun. The Senate so far has shown no interest in changing the current, 21-year limit approved after the killings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018. “It’s a non-starter for me,” Passidomo said last week.

A Bachelor Nation post on Reddit titled ""One of Joey\'s girls is a Tr*mp aide"" generated a lot of engagement Wednesday night, less than a week before season 28 of ""The Bachelor"" with Joey Graziadei premieres. The post referred to 26-year-old Marlena Haddad of West Palm Beach, one of 32 women vying for Graziadei’s heart. Most fans of ”The Bachelor” get worked up when their favorite contestant doesn’t get a rose (or move forward) in the reality TV dating competition. In the “Bachelor”-related Reddit post, many got worked up because of Haddad’s connection to Trump. Some comments defended Haddad, with feedback about her time at the White House as “just a job” rather than a reflection of political views. A moderator eventually turned comments off once the feedback became more about politics and less about the show: “Locking this post because it’s become a magnet for people who have nothing to do with this sub.” According to her LinkedIn profile, Haddad worked in the presidential personnel office as director of correspondence and director of research from 2020-2021 during Trump’s time in office. Her Instagram includes a group photo standing next to him giving a thumb’s up, as well as photos in the Oval Office. Haddad graduated from the University of Connecticut and was a finance writer for SPAC Insider. The newest season of ABC\'s ""The Bachelor"" franchise premieres at 8 p.m. ET Monday, Jan. 22. New dad Jesse Palmer returns as host. Viewers will watch as Haddad and 31 other women — including five contestants from Florida — compete for Graziadei\'s final rose. Graziadei is a 28-year-old former tennis pro from Collegeville, Pennsylvania, who moved to Hawaii soon after graduating from West Chester University. After playing on the Division II Men\'s Tennis team in college, he served as the head tennis professional at Princeville Makai Golf Club for over a year before continuing his role in Kukuiʻula on the South Shore of Kauaʻi, according to his LinkedIn profile. He now works as a lifestyle and experience ambassador at the Kukui\'ula Development Club, teaching pro tennis. Bachelor Nation fell in love with Graziadei during Season 20 of ""The Bachelorette"" last year. He made it to the finale but fans were shocked when he was sent home by the bachelorette, Charity Lawson after professing his love for her. But now he\'s back and ready for his second shot at love. ""As the Bachelor, Graziadei is looking for a life partner who is outgoing, caring, and shares his love for adventure and exploring the outdoors,"" an ABC news release said. ""He loves hiking, surfing and ending his days watching the sunset but knows he has much more love to give, and the only thing missing is someone with whom to share his life."" “The Bachelor” won’t be Haddad’s first television appearance. In March 2018, the first-generation Arab American appeared on “Fox & Friends” to discuss a controversial college visit from activist Linda Sarsour. At the time, “Fox & Friends” tweeted: “University of Connecticut is under fire for welcoming Islamic activist Linda Sarsour. @campusreform\'s Marlena Haddad, a UConn student, is speaking out against the event.” Sarsour, a Palestinian-Muslim-American from Brooklyn, helped organize the Women’s March in Washington, D.C., and wrote “We are Not Here to be Bystanders: A Memoir of Love and Resistance.” She has followers on Twitter such as Parkland school shooting survivor David Hogg, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) and actor Mark Ruffalo. Haddad criticized the event, telling “Fox & Friends” she was “appalled” and “very disappointed with my university” about Sarsour’s visit: “(Linda Sarsour) is not the type of person you want to be leading anything with feminism, with civil rights, with racial justice, anything like that. She’s not the right person, and, quite frankly, she’s manipulating these people. There’s a lot of gullible people out there, and she’s taking advantage of that. She’s not the person to be advocating for female rights.” On the segment, Haddad called Sarsour “a very strong supporter in Sharia Law and what Sharia Law believes is that women should be beaten and that women should be married off at a very young age,” she said on the show. For her upcoming appearance on “The Bachelor” with Graziadei, Haddad told BachelorNation.com that the most romantic thing she’s ever done was get her and her ex’s names engraved on the bottle of wine they drank on their first date. Haddad’s official Bachelor bio says nothing makes her happier than puppies. “The Bachelor” will air at 8 p.m. ET Mondays on ABC and will be available for streaming the next day on Hulu.

There hasn’t been any recent movement on those bills, which means they are likely dead for the session.“It may not get passed this year … but we’re going to keep trying to get it next year,” Moore said.One final piece of the puzzle is making sure that efforts to prevent drowning consider children with autism.Children with autism spectrum disorder are at far higher risk of drowning than children without it: 12% of the kids who drowned in Florida last year were diagnosed with autism, even though only about 1-3% of the population has that diagnosis.People with autism have a heightened tendency to wander off without telling anyone and are often drawn to large bodies of water, including lakes and retention ponds, said Stacey Hoaglund, President of the Orlando-based Autism Society of Florida.“I don’t know a parent with a child with autism — whether it’s a young child, older child or adult — that hasn’t had that moment in their life where they turn and their child is gone,” Hoaglund said. “If they’re interested in water, which many of them are, they will go towards the water without understanding that they could die if they don’t know how to swim.”She praised the state’s proposed voucher program but said she hoped instructors would be given training in how to teach children with autism. These kids often need one-on-one instruction and may need more swim lessons than the average kid.“We definitely want to make sure that families know that it takes a little bit longer for a kid with autism to learn the skills,” Hoaglund said.Ccatherman@orlandosentinel.com; @CECatherman Twitter This continues a trend years in the making: 2022 saw 93 kids drown, 99 in 2021, 69 in 2020, 65 in 2019, 88 in 2018, and 82 in 2017. Four drowned in Orange County, one in Lake, four in Osceola and five in Seminole. Legislators have proposed many fixes to this crisis over the years. This year, the issue has renewed attention, and Central Florida experts on swim safety say they believe several bills could help cut down on drowning deaths in the state. “This year, for some reason, there’s some momentum,” said Brent Moore, executive director of the Children’s Safety Village and lead for the Central Florida Water Safety Task Force. One proposed bill that would be a “game changer” for Central Florida, Moore said, would give free swim lesson vouchers to kids 4 and under in families below 200% of the federal poverty level – about $60,000 for a family of four. The bill, SB 544, has unanimously passed several Senate committees already. The bill leaves much of the specifics of the program up to the Florida Department of Health and calls for the health department to try to secure at least one swim lesson vendor in each Florida county. Swim lessons may seem relatively inexpensive – the city of Orlando offers eight-session summer courses at $40 for residents, $50 for nonresidents, for instance – but that can still be a barrier to families who don’t have the spare cash, Moore said. The Children’s Safety Village offers scholarships to its survival swim classes for young kids, and many other Orlando-area organizations offer free or discounted lessons as well, but they aren’t able to meet demand, he added. “We would love for that bill to get passed,” Moore said. “We definitely want to be one of those locations that accept the vouchers.” Orlando child drownings outpace last year as summer begins About 72% of the children who drowned to death last year in Florida were 3 and under, according to DCF data. Swim lessons are just one factor in drowning prevention, however, and not every family lives near a public pool. In 2019, the American Academy of Pediatrics began recommending swim lessons for young kids, citing a study from 2009 that found the lessons provided at least a small amount of protection from drowning. But the group cautions that “swim lessons and swim skills alone cannot prevent drowning.” There are five “layers of protection” in drowning prevention: barriers, supervision, swim lessons, life jackets, and CPR training. Another proposed bill, SB 274, the Kareem Angel Green Act, would require organizations like summer camps or schools that take kids to bodies of water to get parents to attest, in writing, whether their children can swim. Kids at risk of drowning would be required to wear flotation devices. It’s named after the son of Osceola County resident Arkeisha Reese, Kareem, who drowned at age 5 on a school field trip to a swimming pool in 2006. Similar bills have been filed and failed before.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 10:31 pm District Attorney Fani Willis, center, confers with lead prosecutors, Donald Wakeford, left, and Nathan Wade, during a motion hearing at Fulton County Courthouse in Atlanta on July 1, 2022. ATLANTA — It’s been a week since a defendant brought forward explosive allegations that Fulton County’s district attorney had hired a romantic partner as a lead prosecutor in the Donald Trump election interference case and that she may have inappropriately benefited from it financially. The absence of a formal response from Fani Willis has left a vacuum that’s allowed her biggest critics, including Trump, to run wild with unchecked claims about the veteran prosecutor, her decision-making and the validity of the case. It’s given journalists new reason to scrutinize the employment records and divorce filings of Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor who is allegedly dating Willis, according to the filing on behalf of defendant Michael Roman. It’s even prompted paparazzi to stake out Wade’s office, selling grainy photos of the attorney gripping his handgun to a New York tabloid. Some of that would have undoubtedly been unavoidable in today’s simmering political climate. But perhaps more critically, Willis’ silence has provided an opening for Georgia’s most powerful Republicans, some of whom had previously offered a cautious defense of Willis’ conduct, to change their tune — and open the door to a more formal rebuke. Gov. Brian Kemp recently called the allegations against the DA “deeply troubling” and asked for evidence to be presented quickly so Georgians could have confidence in the probe. And House Speaker Jon Burns told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in an interview that an oversight board created by a Republican-backed law to sanction “rogue” prosecutors should have the final say. “If they decide to make that decision,” Burns said, “that’s fine with me.” Both Kemp and Burns had previously condemned efforts from within their own party to weaponize state law against Willis. A Willis spokesman previously said the DA would respond to Roman’s allegations – which did not include evidence but suggested that at least some proof was sealed in Wade’s ongoing divorce proceedings – in a formal court filing but offered no timetable for doing so. During a hearing on Friday, Jan. 12, Fulton Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who is overseeing the case, offered Wade and other members of the DA’s team the chance to respond, but they declined. McAfee said he would eventually schedule a hearing on the matter but that he’d wait for Willis to weigh in formally. Roman is seeking to have the charges against him dismissed and for Willis and the entire Fulton DA’s office to be removed from the case. Willis broke her silence about some of Roman’s claims during an impassioned speech at Atlanta’s Big Bethel AME Church on Sunday. Without naming Wade directly, the Democrat called him a legal “superstar” who was more than qualified to lead the case. She said the attacks were racially motivated because they targeted Wade, who is Black, but not two other white attorneys she hired as special prosecutors. “First thing they say, ‘Oh, she’s gonna play the race card now,’” Willis said. “But no God, isn’t it them that’s playing the race card when they only question one? Isn’t it them playing the race card when they constantly think I need someone from some other jurisdiction in some other state to tell me how to do a job I’ve been doing almost 30 years?” Willis did not confirm or deny the relationship allegations or address whether she inappropriately benefited financially. Her silence on those matters has fueled concerns among Democratic allies. “I think all Georgia political observers are awaiting DA Willis’ response to Mr. Roman’s motion with great interest,” said Democratic state Sen. Elena Parent, one of the chamber’s party leaders. Still, top Democrats also warn Republicans and others not to jump to conclusions about the claims. They note that the filing offers no concrete proof. State Rep. Billy Mitchell, one of the Georgia House’s top Democrats, drew a line between the frenzy of conspiracy theories and election fraud lies promoted by Trump and his allies during the 2020 race and the accusations this month against Willis. “The better course of action is to reserve judgment,” he said, “and let our judicial system do its work.” That hasn’t stopped many Republicans from capitalizing on the moment. GOP lawmakers are aiming to bolster the law governing the state’s newly formed Prosecuting Attorneys Qualifications Commission, which provides means to punish prosecutors whom critics believe aren’t doing their job. The U.S. House Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, launched a probe of Wade. And Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Rome, asked Kemp and Attorney General Chris Carr to “order the immediate and formal criminal investigation into the alleged criminal misconduct” by Willis and Wade. (Carr’s office said it has yet to receive Greene’s request, while Kemp indicated that Prosecuting Attorneys Qualifications Commission was set up to handle such complaints.)

Lilkerâ\x80\x99s Real news from Florida for working families since 2007 Mayor Witt did not add a discussion about the City Manager Search for Monday night\'s Council meeting. February 4, 2024 11:30 am | 3 min read Photo: Cottonbro Studio via Pexels | Columbia County Observer graphic By Stew Lilker LAKE CITY, FL â\x80\x93 The multiyear Lake City City Manager saga continues. Leveling out the over two years of former City Manager Paul Dyal\'s intrigue, turmoil, lawsuits, scandals, financial glad-handing, brain drain, and city management determined by loyalty rather than experience and qualifications will be a big job for Lake Cityâ\x80\x99s next City Manager. By the morning of January 22, 2024, thirteen applicants had applied for the City Manager Position. The minimum qualifications are in the City Manager job description and the City Charter (Â§ 401), which states: ""The city council shall appoint a city manager for an indefinite term. The compensation of the city manager shall be fixed by the council. The city manager shall hold a bachelor\'s degree from an accredited four (4) year college or university and have either ten (10) years of progressively responsible experience in municipal or corporate management in a senior management position or any equivalent combination of training and experience.â\x80\x9d A college degree is non-negotiable, something the Godfathers across the way who are running Columbia County pay attention to only when they feel like it. The City Manager job description states the nature of the work and the primary functions of the City Manager position. It is a big job. Lake City has 12,000 plus residents, over 200 employees, police and fire departments, and a waterâ\x80\x93wastewaterâ\x80\x93gas utility with over 8,000 customers. Lake Cityâ\x80\x99s budget is $75 million. Part II of the most recent applicants will provide information about the nine applicants who applied for the position after January 22. They dribbled in after January 20 at less than one a day over the thirteen days. According to HR, the last application was received at 11 am on February 2, six hours before the close of business on Friday. HR Director BillieJo Bible was unable to prepare the rest of the applications, only two on February 2, for distribution, and they won\'t be released until tomorrow. Had they been released on Friday, the City Council would have had the time to review them over the weekend. Some applicants did not provide the required three items of information: application, resume, and cover letter. These items were not discretionary. The job posting on the City HR web job description stated the following: â\x80\x9cInterested candidates must submit a cover letter, resume, and application by Friday, February 2, 2024 @ 4:30 pm.â\x80\x9d Only five candidates submitted the required cover letter in the first batch of applications (13), and three did not provide applications. In the second batch of candidates (9), only one candidate came up short and did not provide the required application. The Observer has requested the resumes, and they are expected to be provided on Monday, February 5. Advertising for the City Manager position was discussed and approved (4-1) during the Council meeting on December 4, 2023. Former City Councilman Todd Sampson moved that HR would decide where to advertise the open position. On Friday, February 2, 2024, the closing date of the application process, your reporter checked with the ICMA (International City Manager Association), Florida Association of Counties (FAC), and the Florida League of Cities. Not one of those websites listed the Lake City position. It is unknown where the position was advertised. The City employment applications do not ask where the applicants found the open position listed. Monday evening, the Council will carry on. Neither Mayor Witt nor Interim City Manager De Johnson added a discussion or update from HR on the vacant City Manager position. It is Lake City.

BEACH — There was a time when Kyle Kirkwood would tell folks he was from Jupiter, and they’d chuckle and assume he was attempting some form of interplanetary humor. Jupiter was always on the map of South Florida, but in recent years it’s also entered the consciousness of sports fans, not because of Kirkwood but due to a laundry list of golfing royalty (Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy among them) who began calling it home. Kirkwood, however, is an actual Jupiter native, and he’s on his way to proving golf carts aren’t the only form of four-wheeled transportation favored in that area of Palm Beach County. ROLEX SCHEDULE Mazda, Michelin Endurance races lead to 62nd running of Rolex 24 at Daytona ROLEX LINEUP Starting grid: Unofficial qualifying results and lineup for the 62nd Rolex 24 at Daytona “When you think about it, Florida in general is probably the best place to grow up for racing,” says Kirkwood, who makes his fourth Rolex 24 start this weekend at Daytona — all four with Vasser Sullivan Racing, all four in a GTD Lexus. “Growing up, I was in a go-kart for 40 weekends out of the year, racing in Florida,” he says. “There are so many karting tracks in the state — Palm Beach, Jacksonville, Orlando, Homestead, Ocala, Fort Myers. There are tracks all over Florida I was always traveling to when I was in karts.” And if you grow up racing karts in Florida — all of the U.S., actually — the ultimate goal is IndyCar racing, which Kirkwood reached two years ago at age 23. IndyCar is also where Kirkwood, driving for Andretti Autosport, is figuratively — and quickly — putting himself on the map. He did that with his first IndyCar win last April at the Long Beach Grand Prix, and his second four months later on the Nashville street course. But between those two wins is when Kirkwood gathered the most attention from the casual IndyCar followers, those whose collective focus generally centers on that mammoth spectacle each May in Indianapolis. Kirkwood finished his second Indy 500 upside-down on Lap 184, and once upright, he was suddenly dominating the conversation. Replays from the cockpit camera showed Kirkwood along for the ride on his open-air roof, reacting with relative calm, in spite of the wall of sparks outside the left side of his upended car.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 10:45 pm VALDOSTA — A tornado tore through northern Lowndes County Sunday, damaging and destroying buildings, though there were no reports of injuries or deaths, authorities said. The National Weather Service sounded a tornado warning for Lowndes County around 3:15 p.m. In fact, the weather service actually sounded three tornado warnings as the same storm cell moved up from northern Florida, said Jasmine Montgomery, a meteorologist with the service’s Tallahassee, Fla., office. “It seems there was only actually one tornado in Lowndes,” she said. Damage was in scattered areas, including a flattened home on Ezell Road, damaged structures on U.S. 84 and more damage around the Skipper Bridge Road area, Montgomery said. Passers-by said the home on Ezell Road was not being lived in at the time. Colquitt EMC repair crews could be seen responding in the north Lowndes County area; along Ezell Road, there were many power poles bent to the breaking point. A crew from the CSX railroad company could be seen clearing tracks of downed trees alongside U.S. 84 east of town. Lowndes County Sheriff Ashley Paulk said he had not heard of any deaths or injuries connected to the tornado. He said he was aware of a pair of damaged trailers and a destroyed home. The weather service doesn’t know how strong the twister was; a survey crew will be sent to Lowndes County Monday to figure that out, Montgomery said.

COLUMBIA COUNTY, FL â\x80\x93 Tonight, January 30, at 5:15 pm, the illegally constituted Gov. DeSantis Lake Shore Hospital Authority Board may once again try and decide to give the vacated Shands at Lake Shore Hospital to Meridian Behavioral Health Services of Gainesville. While the enabling legislation of the Authority specifically sets out that one Authority Board member ""shall [must] be a physician to engaged in the practice of medicine at the Lake Shore Hospital,"" Hospital Authority Manager Dale Williams, the Gov.\'s Board, and the two most recent Hospital Authority attorney\'s, Fred Koberlein, Jr. and Todd Kennon, have totally ignored the statutory requirement. Neither Attorney would talk about it. The Governor\'s Board has steadfastly refused to ask the Florida Atty. General for an opinion regarding the necessity of following the legislative mandate of a physician board member. The enabling legislation of the Authority authorizes the board to have seven members, including the physician practicing at the hospital. Beginning in September 2020, the Authority Board began operating with four members; there was a doctor on the Board until Dr. Mark Thompson resigned in mid-2021. Unable to appoint a physician â\x80\x9cpracticing at the hospitalâ\x80\x9d to the board, Governor DeSantis appointed republican operative Don Kennedy to the Authority. The Authority Board had been operating with four members until December 15, 2023, when the Governor appointed former democrat Jerry Bullard to the LSHA. Mr. Bullard converted to Republicanism in February 2017. During Mr. Bullard\'s first meeting on January 8, 2024, he wasn\'t asked to introduce himself, and he didn\'t. With long-time board member Lory Chancy opposing the transfer of the vacated hospital to Meridian, one need not have been a rocket scientist to understand why the Governor appointed Mr. Bullard to the Authority. While barely speaking a word, Mr. Bullard has been the neutralizing force against Trustee Chancy. One hold-up regarding the transfer of the hospital to Meridian has been the ownership of a parking lot owned by the Masons and donated to the Authority by them for the Authority\'s exclusive use while the hospital was in operation. The hospital ceased operation in October 2020; it could not find a tenant. Meridian agreed to take the hospital and operate a psychiatric hospital. That was not the type of hospital the Masons had in mind, and they advised the Authority that the parking lot was for sale for $500,000. On November 10, 2023, Representative Chuck Brannan sponsored a $3.5 mil legislative appropriation for Meridian to renovate the hospital building. The appropriation is absent from the Health Care Appropriation Sub-Committee appropriations list. Authority Manager Dale Williams said the Authority has no letters of support for Meridian to expand into the vacated hospital. In numerous appearances in front of the Authority Board, Meridian CEO Don Savoie has never presented any letters of support. For the past two years, your reporter has been searching for folks who would recommend Meridian for care. No one has stepped forward except CEO Savoie. Tonight, the Governorâ\x80\x99s Authority Board may decide what to do. This decision will affect peopleâ\x80\x99s lives. It will be interesting to see if political expediency will stand in the way of common sense, reason, and quality behavioral care.

A state budget for the year beginning in July is the only bill the Florida Constitution requires lawmakers to approve. Both the House and Senate are set to consider separate versions of a $115 billion-plus spending plan Wednesday, the 30th day of the scheduled 60-day session. But the homestretch of the session will involve settling an array of other proposals, including some like the Senate’s ethics legislation, which is drawing heightened focus. “This legislation would have a profound corrosive effect on transparency and accountability of government, in the form of precluding and preventing any ethics scrutiny on every level of both the state and local ethics commissions,” said Caroline Klancke, executive director of the nonprofit Florida Ethics Institute. Sen. Danny Burgess, R-Zephyrhills, last week unveiled new amendments to the ethics bill (SB 7014) that would prohibit both state and local ethics commissions from pursuing any investigation unless the complaint came from someone with ""personal knowledge"" of wrongdoing and willing to identify themselves by name and file under oath. Anything short of that would be considered hearsay, prohibiting commissioners from investigating potential ethical violations. The measure was approved 39-0 by the Senate. But critics say it is certain to undermine scores of complaints which often come from citizens who’ve read news stories about potential ethics violations or heard about them through second-hand sources. The idea of relying on a witness to wrongdoing stepping forward, swearing in and identifying themselves could eliminate much of the investigatory work of ethics panels, critics say. But Burgess defended his approach, saying it is “simply for fairness ... so somebody’s not just throwing (a complaint) out there. It has to be based on some form of merit.” Kirby Oberdorfer, director of Jacksonville’s Office of Ethics, Compliance and Oversight, told the Florida Times-Union that the legislation would make local ethics officials “lap dogs instead of watchdogs.” By raising the bar so high on complaints, ethics officials said most would likely never surface, shielding violators. While Senate President Kathleen Passidomo, R-Naples, said she saw no problem with the measure, House Speaker Paul Renner, R-Palm Coast, was less committal, saying only it’s “something we’re certainly going to look at.” In the session’s closing 30 days, the back-and-forth between the House and Senate will be critical to the fate of key priorities on both sides. After ignoring it for most of the session’s first half, the Senate added oomph to a Renner priority this week, with that chamber\'s Judiciary Committee approving a proposed ban on anyone under age 16 from having a social media account. The House bill (HB 1) already has won full approval there, but Monday’s Senate review was the first time that side had taken up Renner’s push. While Democrats have raised questions about the constitutionality of the measure – which many critics say violates the First Amendment right to speech – Renner and House Republicans are pressing for action. Last week’s appearance before Congress by Meta chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the impact of social media seems to have added loft to the Florida effort. But even Gov. Ron DeSantis, no stranger to promoting policies challenged on constitutional grounds, has questioned the “breadth” of the social media proposal. Similarly, in the session’s closing weeks, some level of agreement between the House and Senate also is needed on dueling approaches to proposed changes in child labor laws, education testing and standards, a big-ticket prison construction package and Passidomo’s priority, ""Live Healthy,"" a plan aimed at improving Florida’s health care workforce and access to care by patients. Renner has vowed that his side will approve Live Healthy, even though it is only beginning to see light in the House after being approved by the Senate early in the session. “The Senate president and I are working together very well,” Renner recently said of his exchanges with Passidomo. But some measures look doubtful. Budget rolling along – but smaller: 2024 Session: Florida Legislature rolling back state spending in \'austere\' budget plans Senate has some ideas on school de-regs: Legislative session: Education deregulation bills OK\'d by Florida Senate, head to House House and Senate leaders have rebuffed efforts to revisit gambling legislation and create a provision setting the stage for Miami Beach’s Fontainebleau Hotel to open a casino. Jeffrey Soffer, developer of the hotel, has poured money into Republican lawmakers political committees and flew Gov. Ron DeSantis on his jet. While DeSantis appeared behind an effort to re-address state gambling laws to let Soffer obtain a needed pari-mutuel license, leaders have ruled it out. “My priority, and I think we’re all kind of on the same page, is that we get the Seminole (gambling) compact up and running, get it functioning well, and not stub our toe on something that would breach that – and there are some bills out there that I think would breach that,” Renner said, referring to the 2021 agreement with the state\'s Seminole Tribe. The state is expected to draw $500 million annually from the tribe, in exchange for giving it exclusive control of sports betting in Florida. Another push that may be sidetracked is the House’s effort to rollback to age 18 a ban on anyone buying a rifle or shotgun. The Senate so far has shown no interest in changing the current, 21-year limit approved after the killings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018. “It’s a non-starter for me,” Passidomo said last week.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 10:45 pm VALDOSTA — A Valdosta man was charged with aggravated assault Sunday after a woman was shot, police said. Around 1:30 a.m., officers headed to the 1100 block of Old Statenville Road after 911 received calls about a shooting, a Valdosta Police Department statement said. Police found a 28-year-old woman with a gunshot to her torso; she was treated and later released from the hospital, the statement said. Police determined she had been involved in a car chase in which she was a passenger in the vehicle being chased. The driver of the other car fired at the vehicle she was in, hitting it several times, police said. The 28-year-old woman, sitting in the back seat, was hit by one bullet, police said. The car she was in hit a power pole. Two other people were in the car, but police did not indicate they were hurt. The car the offender was driving was found at an East Park Avenue home and a suspect was taken into custody without incident, police said. The suspect — described as a 35-year-old Valdosta man — was charged with three counts of aggravated assault, aggravated battery and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, the police statement said. “We are thankful that this incident did not result in more people being injured. This offender’s reckless disregard for human life endangered numerous citizens in this residential area, on top of the victims. I am proud of the quick work of our officers, with the assistance of the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Department, to ensure he was taken into custody quickly,” said Chief Leslie Manahan. Anyone with information on this case should contact the Valdosta Police Department Bureau of Investigative Services at 229-293-3145, or the crime tip line at 229-293-3091.

This spring, Katy Freels is rising to the occasion as their new head coach. The Panthers train early in the morning during their off-season. After working as a volunteer assistant coach for the women’s team for the last three years, Freels was named the new head coach earlier this month following the resignation of the previous head coach, Ryan Moon. Moon was recently hired at Jacksonville University as their women’s soccer head coach, according to Jacksonville Athletics. “We are ecstatic to appoint Katy Freels as our new coach, as she embodies our scholars, champions and leaders’ mission,” Athletic Director Jamie Joss said in a statement to Florida Tech News. Aside from her success at Florida Tech, Freel’s track record speaks for itself, both collegiately and professionally. Freels spent her college career at Auburn University, where she led Auburn to both an SEC Tournament Championship and four NCAA tournament appearances in 2008-2011. Additionally, Freels currently holds career records in both assists and points at Auburn, according to Florida Tech Sports. On top of her collegiate success, she played in the top division of women’s soccer in the United States, the Women’s Premier Soccer League Elite, in 2012. Freel’s also played for the United States at both the U-20 and U-23 levels, contributing to the U-23 team’s win of the Nordic Cup in Sweden, according to Florida Tech Sports. Along with her long list of accolades, Freels’ time as a volunteer assistant coach at Florida Tech has prepared her to take on the head coaching position. “I don’t think I’d be in this position without that time; it gave me an opportunity to form relationships with the girls and also to understand the school and the program. It’s a really cool transition,” Freels said. Being on the staff the last three years, Freels has made many memories, but her favorite was from this past fall when playing Lenoir-Rhyne University in the NCAA National Quarterfinals. “We went up 4-0 against them. They were undefeated - the best team in the country. It was an unbelievable start, and the girls were just playing so well,” Freels said. Freels and the team thought it seemed too good to be true. “At halftime, our forward got hurt and they came back to score four goals straight, which is unheard of in soccer. We got a goal, an ugly goal but a sheer-effort kind of goal, and everybody just went crazy. It was in the 80th minute, so it was right at the end of the game,” Freels said. That goal was what sent the Panthers into the Final Four for the first time since 2010. Freels has some big shoes to fill as Moon was named Sunshine State Conference Coach of the Year, United Soccer Coaches Regional Coach of the Year and led the women’s team to their most successful season yet this past fall. “I look forward to building on the tremendous work and foundations set by former head coach Ryan Moon, and I cannot thank him enough for his influence and impact on my coaching career these last few years,” Freels said in an interview with Florida Tech News. Reflecting on the legacy Moon was leaving behind, Freels is eager to channel the success from the fall season and continue to raise the bar for her players. “I’m most excited to get to be with the girls day in and day out. We had a really great fall, so I’m looking to build on the momentum we created. The girls are super eager to get to work, so the level across the board has really raised. It’s cool to get to keep pushing that higher and higher,” Freels said. Freels (right) keeping practice interesting by scrimmaging with her players. Despite losing 12 players after the fall season, Freels has her sights set on a national championship in 2024. “The goal from now is to win a national championship. We know we can do it. A lot of us still look back at the fall and are a little disappointed with how it went, but I think that kind of created a belief in the team that we are capable of playing at that level and competing for those championships,” Freels said. Savannah Oxley, a junior on the team, was initially worried about the sudden change, but since Freels has been named head coach, she is confident she’ll continue to raise the bar for the team and culture. “Her ultimate goal is for us to bring home a national championship. She expects us to grow and improve every day,” Oxley said. Freels explains the next drill to her players. Freels takes pride in the relationships with her players. She’s very focused on the individual development of players and wants to empower them to see the game and execute. “Katy’s role over the past years had primarily been to support us both tactically and personally. I think that’s something unique that she can offer as a coach because we all already have positive relationships with her. She is someone that knows each of us as players but also on a personal basis,” Oxley said. Daniela Tobon is a graduate student on the women’s team, now going through her third round of head coaching changes since her freshman year in 2019. “You never really expect anyone to leave, but after you put aside that feeling, you become more appreciative of the whole season. With the change also comes excitement for the new coach. We all love her very much,” Tobon said. The previous relationships Freels had developed with her players were a key part of the coaching turnover. The Panthers conditioning to stay in shape in the off-season. “There’s a lot of respect for her. We’re very fond of her, and when we heard she was the new coach, all of us were excited. We felt relief as a team,” Tobon said. “She’s a great coach in pushing us to our limits.” The opportunity to invest in her players, both on and off the field, is what makes coaching so special to Freels. The sky's the limit for Freels and the women’s soccer team as they continue to build off their success from the fall. Log In Keep it Clean.

The lockdown lasted more than an hour, they said. “We knew we had to do it,” Seeley said. “We were doing it even before we got that phone call.” “Shocked,” she said, when asked how she felt. “Shocked that this could happen here. In Lee County,” Minor echoed. Patron Marbel Casanova comes to Bell Tower every other day or so to get a boba tea. She normally comes around 4 p.m. but decided to switch it up Tuesday and went around noon. She arrived after the situation began, but she got a call from her mother, saying there was a man with a mask at the Bank of America in the Bell Tower Plaza. She immediately began wondering what was going on, she said. “I don’t know if that’s right, but that’s crazy. I wanted to find out what was going on.”Crime scene tape surrounded the bank, adjacent to Bell Tower Shops, and included a nearby Dave & Buster\'s.As authorities worked to contain the scene, authorities closed off one lane at U.S. 41, forcing a detour on Cypress Lake Drive.Scores of motorists were forced to use both lanes to make U-turns, producing a symphony of horns. Authorities quickly removed bystanders who pulled their cellphones out and approached the vicinity of the taped scene, saying it was a “very active scene.” As the area returned to normal, a Bank of America employee on a higher floor said a customer alerted him. Employee Louis Nagle stood beside the taped scene on his scooter, taking it all in. He recorded video on his cellphone as deputies continued to clear the scene, around 1:30 p.m. “We got a call from somebody trying to get into the parking lot and (they) said there were cop cars there, couldn\'t get inside,“ he said.

Seniors vs. Crime, a nonprofit organization that operates as a special project of the Florida Attorney General’s Office, offers tips to ensure consumers don’t fall into the scam trap. Steve Renico, regional director for Region 4 of Seniors vs. Crime, recommends being very careful about what you throw in the trash. Before throwing out financial documents or papers containing personal information, Renico recommends shredding them first. Renico also recommends taxpayers request a six-digit Identity Protection PIN from the IRS, which prevents anyone from filing someone else’s returns using a Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number. Each year, the taxpayer will get a new PIN known only to them that helps the IRS verify their identity. “It’s free. It doesn’t cost you anything,” Renico said. “It’s easy to do.

The IRS does not request personal information from taxpayers through texts, emails or social media, according to the irs.gov website. Never click any link that comes from an unknown source. Renico, of the Village of Hadley, hasn’t seen many people coming into Seniors vs. Crimes offices in the past year because of scams, but he still recommends taking safety precautions. “Just be extremely careful,” Renico said. “If you are not careful with that personal information or financial information, it will get stolen or ripped off somewhere.” Senior writer Summer Jarro can be reached at 352-753-1119, ext. 5404, or summer.jarro@thevillagesmedia.com. 8:30 a.m. to 2:15 p.m. Mondays through Fridays and 8:30 to 11:10 a.m. at Colony Cottage Recreation, starting Thursday 8:30 a.m. to 2:10 p.m. Mondays at Paradise Recreation 8:15 a.m. to 2:15 p.m. Mondays at Mulberry Grove Recreation 8 a.m. to 2:10 p.m. Tuesdays at La Hacienda Recreation 10:30 a.m. to 2:20 p.m. Wednesdays at Panasoffkee Community Library 9:15 a.m. to 1:35 p.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays at Lady Lake Library 9 a.m. to 2:20 p.m. Thursdays at Fruitland Park Library Villages Tax-Aide: villagestaxaide.com Internal Revenue Service: irs.gov Seniors vs. Crime: seniorsvscrime.com Clear to partly cloudy.

The long-awaited decision may not be the final word as the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to ultimately settle the question of presidential immunity. It is not clear if Tuesday\'s unanimous ruling by the three-judge D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals will restart the legal proceedings on the four felony counts Trump faces in the Jan. 6-related indictment. In its ruling, however, the panel flatly stated that Trump, after leaving the presidency, became ""citizen Trump"" and ""any executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as President no longer protects him against this prosecution."" Trump immediately disputed the finding by the appeals court and signaled that he would appeal. ""A President of the United States must have Full Immunity in order to properly function and do what has to be done for the good of our Country,"" Trump posted on his Truth Social site. ""A Nation-destroying ruling like this cannot be allowed to stand."" But a legal scholar said there is really no debating the issue. “It\'s a landmark decision, but in many ways an easy decision,” said Michael Waldman, CEO of the Brennan Center for Justice and a constitutional lawyer. “It makes clear that presidents are not above the law. It is bulletproof.” Trump and his legal team have until Monday to file an appeal to the high court. On Thursday, Trump\'s attorneys will be at the Supreme Court to argue a different case — a ruling by Colorado\'s highest court keeping the former president off the 2024 ballot in that state. Presidential race: This one poll may show why Taylor Swift\'s influence has MAGA world on edge in 2024 election The question of presidential immunity does not apply to two other criminal cases against Trump — the New York charges related to a purported hush money payment in 2016 and the federal case in Florida stemming from his possession, handling and storage of classified documents after leaving the presidency. The appeals court ruling marks a pivotal moment as the question of punishing wrongdoing by a former president is considered by the U.S. legal system for the first time in half a century. Not since the Watergate scandal in the early 1970s has a former president faced criminal charges. In Trump\'s case, he faces almost 100 felony counts in two federal cases plus the New York and Georgia proceedings. In Richard Nixon\'s case, a presidential pardon issued by his successor, President Gerald Ford, in September 1974 spared him from the ordeal of prosecution. That seemingly important historical footnote was noted in the appeals court decision. The judges wrote that ""recent historical evidence suggests that former Presidents, including President Trump, have not believed themselves to be wholly immune from criminal liability for official acts during their Presidency."" Then they raised the Nixon pardon as a precedent of sorts: ""President Gerald Ford issued a full pardon to former President Richard Nixon, which both former Presidents evidently believed was necessary to avoid Nixon\'s post-resignation indictment."" The man who negotiated the pardon, attorney Benton Becker, a former Boynton Beach resident, said in interviews before his death in 2015 that Nixon had to accept the pardon in order to avoid certain indictment. Becker said he told Nixon during their discussions in San Clemente that accepting the pardon was an admission of guilt. Nixon agreed and issued a statement after agreeing to the presidential forgiveness offering his regret for the decisions he made in the Watergate cover-up.

Keon Hardemon, a former Miami city commissioner, is expected to defend his seat on the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners. “I’m running because District 3 needs a voice for the voiceless and that’s a fact,” said Edmonson. “I’ve had calls from the residents in the community and they’re all saying they cannot reach their current commissioner, nor is he showing his face. I have been active in the community. I stayed engaged and connected … and I will continue to stay engaged and connected in the community.” In her news release, Edmonson listed community development, sea-level rise, public safety, affordable housing, economic growth and improving mass transit as her priorities. To The Miami Times she expressed her frustration about important matters she believes have gone unaddressed in her absence from the dais. “There’s a host of issues that I led when I was in [the seat] and nothing has happened, no improvements, such as traffic gridlock, community development, gun violence, affordable housing and workforce housing,” she said. “The only thing I can say is, District 3 is in urgent care.” While Commissioner Hardemon did not grant The Miami Times an interview, he sent a written statement disputing Edmonson’s assertions that he hasn’t been doing his job. “Our office has been steadfast in the development of affordable housing, the eradication of poverty, and the elimination of gun violence in our community. In three short years, we have provided and pledged substantial dollars to educate and employ at-risk youth, implemented plans to beautify our community to attract and maintain residents and businesses,” he wrote. This is not the first time these two have faced off. Hardemon initially challenged Edmonson in 2012 as a 27-year-old attorney and lost, though he performed better than most people predicted, and with far less cash than the incumbent. Then he went on to serve on the Miami City Commission before succeeding Edmonson at the County in 2020 when she was out of the picture. Now the incumbent himself, Hardemon is expected to run for reelection. He raised more than $1 million in campaign funds to get elected last time. Fundraising will be key as Edmonson, the former mayor of El Portal, learned in 2022 when she dropped out of a congressional race before qualifying, after failing to raise enough money to mount a real challenge against Rep. Frederica S. Wilson. Meanwhile, Edmonson is leaning into her record, emphasizing her brand as “the Commissioner who got things done.” The 71-year-old politician has clearly signaled that she’s back in the game. The community can expect a bare-knuckle race between these two old foes. “You have a commissioner who is very vindictive, and who actually punishes his own citizens or his own constituency, because they did not support him before … There’s too many good people who have been punished,” said Edmonson. “If someone decides they want to support the incumbent, then that’s fine. I’ll do my best to work to get their support after the campaign is over … I’m not here to be vindictive or mistreat my own constituency. I am here to be available and accessible, to return calls like I have a reputation of doing.” ecardenas@miamitimesonline.com Use the star ratings below to let us know what you thought about the article you just read.
