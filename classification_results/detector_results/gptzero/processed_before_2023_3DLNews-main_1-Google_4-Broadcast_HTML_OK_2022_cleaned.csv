But the raft of sanctions on oligarchs announced by President Joe Biden this week in response to the invasion of Ukraine may do little to dim the jet-setting lifestyles of Russia\'s ultra-rich and infamous – much less force a withdrawal of tanks and troops. U.S. sanctions target Russian President Vladmir Putin and a handful of individuals believed to be among his closest security advisers, including Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. But the list is just as notable for who isn\'t on it — most of the top names from Forbes\' list of the richest Russians whose multi-billion-dollar fortunes are now largely intertwined with the West, from investments in Silicon Valley start-ups to British Premier League soccer teams. Citing the concerns of European allies, the U.S. also didn\'t impose what was seen as the harshest punishment at its disposal, banning Russia from SWIFT, the international financial system that banks use to move money around the world. Biden said Thursday the new U.S. sanctions would nonetheless cripple Russia\'s financial system and stymie its economic growth by targeting Russia\'s biggest banks, which the Treasury Department said holds nearly 80% of all the country\'s banking assets. ""Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,"" Biden said, laying out measures that will ""impose severe cost on the Russian economy, both immediately and over time."" But much of the wealth of Russia\'s richest isn\'t held in the sanctioned Russian banks. Putin and the oligarchs aligned with him have had decades to stash assets overseas, much of it hidden in ways specifically designed to avoid sanctions. Though the Kremlin officially reports Putin\'s income at $131,900 annually, the Russian president is believed to benefit from many billions in cash and overseas assets held by trusted friends and relatives, many of whom are from his home city of St. Petersburg. A 2017 study of Russian oligarchs published by the U.S.-based National Economic Bureau estimated that as much as $800 billion is held by wealthy Russians in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Cyprus, and similar offshore banking centers. That vast fortune, held by a few hundred ultra-rich individuals, is roughly equal to the wealth of the entire rest of the Russian population of 144 million people. Some oligarchs have also obtained dual citizenship in Britain and other Western countries, adding legal complications to attempts to unilaterally seize their assets. An example is Roman Abramovich, a former Russian provincial governor and Putin ally who became a steel and metals magnate. Now a dual Israeli citizen with a net worth estimated at more than $13 billion, Abramovich has used his fortune to buy the British soccer club Chelsea and homes in London and New York. He and his now ex-wife frequently socialized with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the daughter and son-in-law of former President Donald Trump. Abramovich also owns what is purported to be the world\'s most expensive superyacht, the 455-foot-long Solaris, which features a helicopter hanger, tennis court, pool and berths for about 100 guests and crew. Also not on the sanctions list is Alisher Usmanov, another Russian metals tycoon who was an early investor in Facebook. His fortune is estimated at more than $14 billion. Usmanov recently sold his stake in the British soccer club Arsenal for a reported $700 million and, according to Forbes, owns two sprawling estates in London – the Beechwood House and Sutton Place –worth a combined $300 million. Usmanov\'s superyacht, Dilbar, measures 512 feet from bow to stern, even longer than Abramovich\'s. Daniel Fried, a former U.S. official under both Democratic and Republican administrations who helped craft U.S. sanctions against Moscow in the wake of Putin\'s 2014 invasion of the Crimean Peninsula, said he was surprised Abramovich and Usmanov weren\'t on the sanctions list announced Thursday, given their long ties to Putin and visible assets in the West. But, Fried warned, sanctioning Russian oligarchs would likely have limited impact on persuading Putin to change course in Ukraine. ""He owns them absolutely. He crushed them and they exist only by his sufferance,"" said Fried. ""He can jail them, or kill them, and the notion that the oligarchs can assert influence over Putin is foolish."" Still, he said the opinion of wealthy, educated elites carries some intangible weight that Putin defies at his own risk. While sanctions are unlikely to drive the oligarchs away from Putin, they do raise for them the cost of their continued support. ""They can\'t stop or vote him out of office. But he\'s only in total control until he isn\'t,"" said Fried, who is now a fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council. The family fortunes of many in Russia\'s billionaires date back to the 1990s, the turbulent decade after the fall of the Soviet Union. Under the notoriously corrupt presidency of Boris Yeltsin, such key state-controlled assets as oil refineries, steel mills, aluminum smelters and tractor factories were gobbled up by the politically influential, often purchased with the aid of government-backed loans. Then in 1999 Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned and the then-relatively unknown Putin was appointed as acting president. A former KGB agent, Putin had earlier been appointed by Yeltsin as the head of Russia\'s FSB, among the country\'s most powerful spying and security agencies. Putin has ruled Russia for the last 22 years, crushing those who have dared challenge him. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, an oil baron once believed to be the wealthiest man in Russia, ran afoul of Putin when he more fully embraced the free market and began criticizing the vestiges of Soviet central planning. Khodorkovsky was arrested by Russian authorities in 2003 and charged with fraud, money laundering and embezzlement. After spending a decade in jail, he was released in 2013 and fled to London, where he now leads a foundation, the Dossier Center, dedicated to exposing criminal activity by Kremlin insiders. Boris Berezovsky, a mathematician turned Mercedes dealer who amassed a fortune by acquiring the country\'s main television channel at the end of the Soviet era, was tried in absentia on charged of fraud and embezzlement after fleeing to London in 2000. He was found dead on the bathroom floor of his home in southern England in 2013. His daughter said he feared he had been poisoned after losing a major court battle against Abramovich, his former business partner. Originally believed to be a suicide, a coroner recorded the cause of death as inconclusive. ""Every oligarch owes the preservation of their wealth to the Kremlin,"" said Max Bergmann, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who also served at the State Department during the Obama administration. ""The oligarch class is an important pillar of the Putin regime and is heavily exposed because their assets are held in the West – in villas in the South of France, condos in Trump properties, and in sports teams."" Maria Shagina, a sanctions expert at the Helsinki-based Finnish Institute of International Affairs, said European countries are seeking to insulate their own economic interests from the effects of sanctions, whether that\'s natural gas piped to Germany, diamonds imported from Siberian mines or Italian luxury cars and designer handbags sold in Moscow or St. Petersburg.

But, the experts said, the sanctions announced this week will cause pain and eventually force the Kremlin to make hard budgetary choices by weakening the Russian economy. Most Russians are significantly poorer than their Western counterparts. The Russian Federation ranks 83rd in per capita gross domestic product, at a little under $11,000 per person, according to 2020 data compiled by The World Bank.

told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday, as U.S. officials continue to warn that a Russian invasion could happen any day. Tensions remain sky-high over the situation along Ukraine\'s borders, where the U.S. says that a buildup of Russian forces and equipment along the country\'s east, north and south has now reached a point where an attack could begin this week. On Sunday, Biden and Zelenskyy spoke by phone for about 50 minutes and ""agreed on the importance of continuing to pursue diplomacy and deterrence,"" according to a White House readout of the call. The conversation followed Biden\'s call on Saturday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which the two men spoke for over an hour. Afterward, a senior Biden administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the conversation with Putin as ""professional and substantive,"" but added that ""no fundamental change"" was made to the tense dynamic that has unfolded over the past month. French President Emmanuel Macron, who has taken a prominent role in the effort to find a diplomatic way out of the crisis, also spoke at length by phone with Putin on Saturday, according to Macron\'s office. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will visit both Kyiv and Moscow this coming week. The calls and visits come amid fears that the window to find a diplomatic way out of the crisis may be closing as Russia readies its forces for a possible invasion. ""An invasion, a major military action could begin by Russia in Ukraine any day now. That includes this coming week, before the end of the Olympics,"" said Jake Sullivan, the White House\'s National Security Adviser, in an interview Sunday with CNN. The Olympics, which are being held in Beijing, end on February 20. U.S. officials have cited an acceleration of the military buildup, along with the movement of troops closer to the border with Ukraine, as reasons for the heightened worries. Roughly a dozen countries have urged their citizens to leave Ukraine, including the U.S., U.K. and Germany. ""We have good sources of intelligence, and they\'re telling us that things are building now to some sort of crescendo opportunity for Mr. Putin,"" said John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesperson, speaking in an interview with Fox News Sunday. ""We recognize that the time component here seems to be shrinking, and that gives us all cause for concern."" Russia has stationed well over 100,000 troops around Ukraine\'s borders, including some 30,000 troops stationed in Belarus to Ukraine\'s north, where the border is just about a 100-mile drive from the Ukrainian capital. In the south, the Russian navy is conducting major exercises in the Black Sea. And to its east, more tanks and military equipment have headed to Russia\'s border in recent days. Russia has repeatedly characterized concerns about an invasion as Western ""hysteria."" Yuri Ushakov, an adviser to Putin, said the Biden-Putin call Saturday was ""businesslike,"" but he repeated previous statements by Putin that the U.S. has ignored key Russian demands – including that Ukraine be barred from ever joining NATO, and that NATO withdraw its forces from eastern European countries. Russia has also criticized what it calls a Western ""militarization"" of Ukraine. The U.S. and its allies have sent billions of dollars\' worth of military aid to Ukraine since 2014, including Javelin anti-tank missiles and counter-mortar radars. Russian officials have sought to paint a scenario in which those arms embolden Ukraine to forcibly retake the territories in the eastern Donbas region that have been held by Russia-backed separatists since 2014. That violence could kick off a larger conflict, Russia has suggested. Meanwhile, American officials have warned of the possibility of a Russian ""false flag"" operation meant to create a false pretext for an invasion of Russian troops. Despite the growing urgency in the warnings from American officials, officials and analysts continue to caution that a Russian invasion is still not a certainty. ""I think Moscow sees this as a long process. And we might be moving from stage one to stage two, and there might be a stage three, but they\'re not necessarily a full-scale invasion of Ukraine,"" said Harun Yilmaz, a Ukraine specialist and academic editor at Routledge, in an interview with NPR. In Ukraine, Zelenskyy has mixed gratitude for American support with occasional frustration over Washington\'s dire warnings. Speaking to reporters Saturday, Zelenskyy said that the West\'s pronouncements of imminent invasion were playing into Moscow\'s hands. ""The best friend of our enemies is panic in our country,"" said Zelenskyy. Copyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.'}]"

Beyond Magenta centers around six young adults, members of the trans/nonbinary community, who describe their struggles and their triumphs, their feelings and experiences when dealing with their personal identities. They speak of themselves and their community simply, introspectively — and with gravity, warmth and humor. I was surprised when the book appeared on the American Library Association (ALA) list of challenged books in 2015: I had been interviewing and photographing young adults for years, covering contemporary topics such as teen pregnancy, suicide, AIDS, prejudice, human rights, teens on death row, and immigration but — as far as I know — none of those books had been banned from library bookshelves or classrooms. My reasoning, evidently naïve, was that because these accounts were written from the point of view of people directly experiencing said issues (based on my extensive interviews with them), readers would respect the participants\' right to self-expression and that they would appreciate the informative value of their candor.

Cameron, who lives with a supportive family, deftly explains that ""gender is more fluid and more complex than society assumes.""

When the book first came out it received many positive, starred reviews, including including in publications for librarians and educators like Publishers Weekly and Kirkus. Young people and quite a few parents wrote thanking me for publishing it.

The discussion was always the same: I need to read your book, but my parents won\'t let me. It was heartbreaking. Six people sent emails that they were on the verge of suicide.

Flipping through the pages of the book, they found a first name in it that was their name too. It was a sign — they were not alone. I still get goosebumps thinking of that teen and hope they live a long, happy life. Those six emails alone are worth what followed next. It was a Saturday night a few years ago and I was lying on the couch reading on my iPad. Suddenly, a vulgar tweet about me popped up. It complained about a paragraph in Beyond Magenta, one that I didn\'t even remember. Then another tweet. And another. And another. Suddenly there were hundreds of them. ""I think I have a virus on the iPad,"" I told my husband. ""Turn it off now,"" he said, and I did.
