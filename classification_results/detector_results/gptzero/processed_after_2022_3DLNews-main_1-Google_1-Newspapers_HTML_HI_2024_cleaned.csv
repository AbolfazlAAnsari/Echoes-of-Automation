The measures aim to keep that effort going after the debris removal from the wildfires ends. Hawaii lawmakers have advanced measures that seek to address some of the potential long-term health impacts stemming from the Aug. 8 wildfires on Maui, part of a broader response during the 2024 session to the deadly and historic disaster. Two bills that cleared a pair of House committees on Tuesday would provide state funding to monitor the quality of Maui’s air and its coastal waters off Lahaina, helping to ensure those efforts continue after debris removal from the fires ends. Specifically, House Bills 1839 and 1840 combined would fund an environmental health specialist to monitor the air in fire-stricken areas as well as two aquatic biologists to monitor the water. The bills would also provide money to carry out that air and water testing. The bills would also provide for further research into the effects of such wildfires on urban settings. The Lahaina wildfire is estimated to have left some 400,000 tons of waste contaminated with chemicals, heavy metals and other pollutants. So far, no dollar amounts for those full-time positions or their monitoring work have been added to the bills’ language. The chairs of the House Energy and Environmental and Water and Land committees said Tuesday that the dollar values would be included in their committee reports, and those reports aren’t expected to be released publicly for at least several days.

She made a slashing motion across her neck. I told her absolutely not,” Kimoto told the jury, adding that he brought the request back to Miske. “I told Mike that they wanted to kill the accountant, he said ‘No, because other people might have to follow’.” Kimoto took that to mean he or others could be killed to cover up the crime. He said Miske later told him to ask for 10% of the amount they’d attempted to collect. The family agreed and Kimoto said he collected $90,000 in cash in four separate meetings that he placed in a drawer in Miske’s desk at the office…. He said from his observations, Miske’s Kamaaina termite business often fumigated homes without using chemicals meant to warn of the danger. He also said he was responsible for paying cash for controlled chemicals from the back of a pickup truck instead of from a licensed dealer. Kimoto was also involved in Miske’s used car business, which he said bought cheap cars at auction and then masqueraded as a private seller to move the cars on Craigslist. He said Miske used men he called “the dummies,” including his half-brother John Stancil, to assault and intimidate bidders who competed with him.

U.S. District Court Judge Michael Seabright filed a one-sentence order on Wednesday morning declaring his recusal from the case against former Honolulu prosecutor Keith Kaneshiro and local businessman Dennis Mitsunaga. Kaneshiro, Mitsunaga and several co-defendants have all pleaded not guilty, and the trial is slated to start on Feb. 27…. Seabright’s recusal comes amid a flurry of motions this week from prosecutors and defense attorneys about which evidence should and should not be presented to the jury…. read … Judge Backs Out Of Honolulu Corruption Case At Last Minute City Council approves federal agreement -- votes to build more Honolulu rail with mystery cost SA: … HART board member Natalie Iwasa, who testified as a private person at the meeting, remained concerned over this agreement. “The financial plan underlying the full funding grant agreement, in my opinion, has revenues that are just too aggressive,” Iwasa said, noting project costs could overtake what she believed were underwhelming rail revenues. “The costs are at a probability of 65% … when the recovery plan was in process we were looking at 90%, and I feel more comfortable with a 90% cost projection rather than 65%.” Moreover, she noted the contract for the Kakaako project — the City Center Guideway and Stations — “has not been let.” “So, that’s budgeted at $1.3 billion,” said Iwasa. “We do not know whether that will come in on cost or not. And we are paying for this project with general excise taxes — taxes on food, rent, medical services — and I am just so concerned about that. In my opinion, there are just too many open questions, too many areas of the financial plan we’re going to run into problems down the road. I hope I’m wrong, but we’ve seen in the past where that hasn’t been the case, so I’m very cautious about this.” And prior to casting his dissenting vote, Council member Augie Tulba offered his concerns over building more rail line. “By moving this forward we are still obligating ourselves to use $8.2 billion of the state and local taxpayer money to a rail project when we should be reevaluating … so that we can take care of the needs of our community and the things that are important for the people in this state,” Tulba said. “A ‘no’ vote, sorry.” After the meeting, the city Department of Transportation Services — tasked with operating Skyline — could not be immediately reached for comment over questions regarding rail-related farebox revenues or expectations of city rail operations into 2024.

More than 35 schools were represented, including traditional public, private, public charters, and others. The event coincided with the start of National School Choice Week (Jan. 21-27), a national effort to raise school choice awareness and promote a variety of education options. At the school fair, parents met with schools, learned about their unique programs, and explored which school might fit their child’s needs.

The IRS says it expects to collect hundreds of billions of dollars more in overdue and unpaid taxes than previously anticipated using funding provided to the agency by the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act. WASHINGTON >> The IRS is poised to take in hundreds of billions of dollars more in overdue and unpaid taxes than previously anticipated, according to new analysis released Tuesday by the Treasury Department and the IRS. Tax revenues are expected to rise by as much as $561 billion from 2024 to 2034, thanks to stepped-up enforcement made possible with money from the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act, which became law in August 2022. The Congressional Budget Office in 2022 estimated that the tens of billions of new IRS funding provided by the IRA would increase revenues by $180.4 billion from 2022 to 2031. The IRS now says that if IRA funding is restored, renewed and diversified, estimated revenues could reach as much as $851 billion from 2024 to 2034. Administration officials are using the report to promote President Joe Biden’s economic agenda as he campaigns for reelection — and as the IRS continually faces threats to its funding. “This analysis demonstrates that President Biden’s investment in rebuilding the IRS will reduce the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars by making the wealthy and big corporations pay the taxes they owe,” National Economic Adviser Lael Brainard said in a statement. “Congressional Republicans’ efforts to cut IRS funding show that they prioritize letting the wealthiest Americans and big corporations evade their taxes over cutting the deficit,” Brainard said. The Inflation Reduction Act gave the IRS an $80 billion infusion of funds. However, House Republicans built a $1.4 billion reduction to the IRS into the debt ceiling and budget cuts package passed by Congress last summer. A separate agreement took an additional $20 billion from the IRS over the next two years to divert to other non-defense programs. Since then, the agency has tried to show how it is spending the money it has left, in hopes of stemming the cuts. New customer service improvements rolled out as the tax season began Jan. 29, and earlier this month the IRS announced that it had recouped half a billion dollars in back taxes from rich tax cheats. Rep. Jason Smith, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement that the report “calls for even more IRS funding, uses pie-in-the-sky numbers, all without being straightforward about where the burdens of massive new enforcement efforts will fall.” He said increased funding will inevitably result in hundreds of thousands of additional audits for taxpayers making less than $75,000. After the IRA was signed into law, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen directed IRS leadership not to increase audit rates on people making less than $400,000 a year annually. Ensuring that people actually pay their taxes is one of the tax collection agency’s biggest challenges. The audit rate of millionaires fell by more than 70% from 2010 to 2019 and the audit rate on large corporations fell by more than 50%, Treasury’s Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax Analysis Greg Leiserson told reporters. IRA funding “is enabling the IRS to reverse this trend,” Leiserson said. The tax gap — which is the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid — has grown to more than $600 billion annually, according to the IRS. 500 Ala Moana Blvd. #7-500Honolulu, HI 96813(808) 529-4747 Our Company Subscribers More""}]"

The superlatives from giddy economists read like the promo blurbs on movie ads: “Just a perfect report” — Mark Zandi, Moody’s Analytics. “Stunning and spectacular” — Diane Swonk, KPMG. “Hard to imagine how things could look better” — UBS’ Brian Rose. “This year has been like Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots” — Dan North, Allianz Trade Americas. Responding to Biden’s celebratory statement — “Wages, wealth, and employment are higher now than they were before the pandemic” (read: when Trump was president) — even Trump’s former economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, conceded on his Fox Business show, “I would be bragging about it, too.” From most Americans, however, all you get is a Bronx cheer. Amid the good economic reports came poll results from the Pew Research Center and the headline said it all: “Americans More Upbeat on the Economy; Biden’s Job Rating Remains Low.” And “upbeat”? That’s relative. Yes, Pew found a 9-point increase since last April in the percentage of adults who rate the economy as excellent or good — up to a whopping 28%. The increase came among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. Still, less than half of Democrats, 44%, had positive views of the economy. And just 13% of Republicans said it was excellent or good. Many Americans’ views of the economy have long tended to be colored by whether the White House occupant is someone of their favored party. But that bias is more evident than ever in these more polarized times. It’s become so pronounced among Republicans, two Stanford University economists found in November, that traditional models to gauge consumers’ sentiment using fundamental economic data (inflation, stocks, unemployment, consumption) “have broken down” since 2020. Consumer sentiment should be about 13 points higher on the feel-good scale, economics professor Neale Mahoney and doctoral candidate Ryan Cummings concluded. With the oft-lying Trump calling the economy “so fragile,” and wishing for “a crash,” many in his party will never be convinced the economy is actually in good shape, no matter their own financial comfort. (“Things were better with [Trump] in office,” a Republican caucus-goer in Iowa told the New York Times, adding, “I have been pretty lucky, though.”) But demoralized Democrats and the swing voters who decide elections in battleground states can be swayed. Granted, you can’t convince voters that the economy is good if they aren’t feeling it, but to some degree most Americans are, polls and data show. The early signs of rosier — and more realistic — consumer sentiment, are reflected in this month’s double-digit rise tracked by the much-followed University of Michigan index. And the effect of Bidenomics’ long-term public investments, like the bridge-replacement project the president visited on the Wisconsin-Minnesota border Thursday, has yet to be realized. The president has to hope the gains stick, as many economists predict, and that voters give him props. President Barack Obama, facing reelection in 2012, told people privately that he was determined to win because “I’ll be damned” if someone else was going to take credit for the growth his administration had set in motion after the Great Recession. Surely Obama’s vice president remembers such talk. Maybe that helps explain why Biden is similarly driven to run again, even when many Democrats wish he’d retire: He’ll be damned if he’s going to let Trump, or anyone else, reap the rewards at all the ribbon-cuttings ahead. But first Biden and his fellow Democrats have to convince more voters that his policies actually are working — that the U.S. economy really is as good as the data show.

He said the location for this year’s tournament should have been in Ukraine, but because of the ongoing war, it was moved to Lake Powell, which is along the Utah and Arizona border. He said the change made it easier for them to visit the lake and practice beforehand. Darvil McBride said 13 countries joined the event, plus a team led by Justin Lee, a Hawaiian who was last year’s national freshwater spearfishing champion. He said the competition has different brackets for young and old participants, with all of the events happening in the same lake. Darvil McBride said Tanner and Hunter McBride were the deckhands, or boat captains, for the competition. He said they had the responsibility to lure the fish near their boat, scout the fish, make sure the gear and equipment were ready and get to the fish as fast as possible. He said they contributed a lot during the tournament. Having the correct team with skilled individuals helps a lot in tournaments, said Darvil McBride. He said each person greatly contributed to every aspect of preparation, from driving to a perfect spot to getting fish loaded up to scouting places to fish and more. Tanner McBride said besides taking a semester off to improve their skills, his team came early to the location of the tournament and continued with their preparations. He said they collaborated as a team to plan things out around the lake and familiarize themselves with the lake’s terrain. Besides preparing mentally and physically, Tanner said they also prepared themselves financially because taking competitions like this is expensive. He said it was a challenge because although they had sponsors, they still had to fundraise to keep up with their expenses, such as gas, food and a place to stay. In an article released by FreshWater World’s website, the crew says they were nervous and excited to compete against top-caliber participants from around the world. The article states, “Since the United States had never won the world championship, it weighed heavily on [the team’s] minds.” The article also says the crew arrived a few days early as a team to come up with “a master plan.” According to the article, the previous rain and melting snowpack contributed to a continual 1.5-foot water level rise every day. The condition of the weather and environment iss described in the article as a natural phenomenon, causing sporadic fish behavior, poor visibility, unpredictable changes in water temperatures and constant movement of the fish around the lake. Darvil McBride said their first day did not go as planned. He said the visibility became worse prior to their scouting days. Because of several factors like the sun and random moving particles, he said it became very murky for them to see fish. He said they tried relocating from cove to cove only to find little to no fish at all. Their spot on day one was completely barren, Darvil McBride said. After several attempts to find fish, he said only caught a couple, which put them in last place on the first day with an 82-point deficit from the leading team. He said they were all frustrated, tired and convinced they had zero chance of bouncing back. He said although the crew shared mixed emotions on day one, it did not stop them from thinking about making a comeback the next day. “We were all feeling discouraged, but we all decided to regroup and replan for the next day. As much as it was hard to stay focused and motivated for the next day, they all did their best to get their energies pumped up the second day,” Darvil McBride said.

But apparently the official view of Donald Trump\'s lawyers is that he, and he alone, should be exempt from the law. In the authoritarian future that he\'s clamoring for, he gets to do anything he wants, wielding unparalleled power in the presidency, and face zero repercussions. That\'s not a president – that\'s a dictator. That\'s not equal justice under the law – that\'s one law for Trump and another for everybody else.” Video of the remarks is available here and a full transcript follows. Mr. President, I get it. I understand that people are tired of hearing about whatever insane thing Donald Trump just said or did. I get that it\'s emotionally exhausting, it\'s intellectually exhausting, certainly politically exhausting to be panicked and outraged all the time. Frankly, it\'s not possible. We\'ve now been living in this reality of Trump\'s unending lies and chaos for almost a decade, and people understandably want to live their lives. Go to school, drop their kids off at school, make dinner, maybe get some exercise, or read a book, or watch a show. They want their life to continue. So you can\'t wake up every morning and be one of those people – one of those people who says, “Did you see what Trump said? Did you see how crazy it was? Aren\'t your worried?” You can\'t live life like that. I totally understand. But Trump\'s lawyers said something this week, in a courtroom just a few blocks from here, that is impossible to ignore. And it must cause alarm. Because it was the clearest indication that Trump and his team believe that he can commit any crime in the book – crimes as clear as day – and get away with it without any consequences whatsoever. When asked by a federal judge if a president could be criminally prosecuted for ordering SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political rival, Trump\'s lawyer responded, and I quote, “He would have to be, and would speedily be, impeached and convicted before the criminal prosecution could proceed.” What does that mean as a practical matter? It means that the president could commit any crime. It means that the president could commit any crime, up to and including ordering the United States military to murder a political rival, and there would be no way to hold him accountable, as long as 34 United States senators stood ready to vote to acquit. Do you think 34 United States senators stand ready to vote to acquit? I don\'t know. Honestly, I don\'t know. But I can tell you that way more than 34 United States senators voted to acquit former President Trump, who was impeached and then tried by the United States Senate – twice. So I guess what we\'re saying is this time, the Senate would stand up, because that crime would be more egregious than the other ones. Let\'s back up for a second. Because during the impeachment trial three years ago, Trump\'s legal team, and a majority of Senate Republicans, argued that it was the job of the criminal justice system to deal with statutory crimes – crimes that are in the law books, right? Not the Senate. They said that the question before Congress was whether or not Trump\'s actions rose to the level of crimes against the country, which are different from statutory crimes. A novel argument – and it worked. Right? It doesn\'t have to be a good argument; doesn\'t have to be a compelling argument; just has to work in this body. Because we\'ve got 100 jurors, all politicians, and however the chips fall is however the chips fall. But their argument was explicit, which is, “This is not the venue.” And now Trump\'s lawyers are arguing in the other venue, ‘I\'m sorry, what I meant was, this is the venue.’ So what they are really saying is, “Our guy gets to commit crimes.” And I want everybody who is right of center, far right of center, center right, right in the center – I don\'t care – I want everyone to think about the consequences of accepting this argument. Any president can commit any crime? Not only that, by the way, it\'s not a matter of just committing crime. It\'s a matter of commanding the United States military. It\'s a matter of being the most powerful individual on the planet. It\'s a matter of being the commander in chief and using those resources to assassinate a political rival. And you can\'t get a Trump lawyer to say that would probably be illegal and cause him to go to jail. They said that would depend on how the votes fell in the Congress. I\'m alarmed. Trump\'s team is in court arguing that it\'s up to Congress. That the political system, not the just system, should render justice even on statutory crimes. I say this as a senator and someone who believes deeply in the awesome responsibility of this institution: ‘If the senate says so’ is not a serious legal argument. “If the senate says so” is not a legal argument. What\'s being contemplated here – the ordering of a murder – is a crime. It\'s a violation of the criminal code and every other person in the land would be arrested and tried for it. But apparently the official view of Donald Trump\'s lawyers is that he, and he alone, should be exempt from the law. In the authoritarian future that he\'s clamoring for, he gets to do anything he wants, wielding unparalleled power in the presidency, and face zero repercussions. That\'s not a president – that\'s a dictator. That\'s not equal justice under the law – that\'s one law for Trump and another for everybody else. Think about what they\'re saying and ask yourselves: are you comfortable with that? Are you comfortable with a democratic president with those kinds of authorities? Is that the kind of country that you want to live in? To be clear, this can\'t be dismissed as “I don\'t read the tweets” or “That guy is crazy, he just says stuff” or “What a showman.” That was the kind of hand waving away at whatever Trump said or did. Now we have four years of a Trump presidency and two impeachments and many statutory and constitutional crimes to look straight at. The other thing is, again, this is not a tweet. This is not a comment in a town hall, right? What this is is the official position of the lawyers for the former president of the United States. Authoritarianism is no longer just a remote problem in foreign lands. I just joined the Foreign Relations Committee a couple of years ago. One of the things we do as members of the Foreign Relations Committee is go to other countries and encourage them to adopt democratic reforms. We encourage them to adopt democratic reforms. And now when we have our meetings, they are encouraging us to maintain our democracy. And make no mistake, this is not some nebulous movement that is difficult to decipher. This is because Donald J. Trump was president and does not believe in American-style democracy. He doesn\'t. He doesn\'t believe he should be accountable. He believes he should be immune. And he believes that when and if he becomes president again, that he will exact revenge, that he will be a dictator from day one, and that if he is held accountable for his crimes, there will be bedlam. Now, does that sound like a rhetorical flourish? It sure does, doesn\'t it? Except I\'m quoting him. Again, I want everybody to be able to live a life. I don\'t want everybody waking up every morning freaked out about what Donald Trump says. But today, this week, it is worth marking what his lawyers said because it is an official position of a presidential candidate and it is a position that is antithetical to everything that we all believe in.

(Natrice Miller/Atlanta Journal-Constitution/TNS) ATLANTA — District Attorney Fani Willis does not have any conflicts that warrant her disqualification from the Fulton County election interference case, according to a group of 17 ethics experts, former prosecutors and defense attorneys. The coalition — which includes former Georgia-based federal prosecutor Amy Lee Copeland, onetime DeKalb DA J. Tom Morgan and Richard Painter, the top White House ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration — filed a “friend of the court” brief late Monday laying out why Fulton Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee should dismiss multiple court motions alleging Wills acted improperly. “Disqualifying conflicts,” the group wrote, “occur when a prosecutor’s previous representation of a defendant gives the prosecutor forbidden access to confidential information about the defendant or a conflict otherwise directly impacts fairness and due process owed a defendant.” “That kind of conflict is not at issue here,” they said. Five defendants in recent weeks, led by former Donald Trump campaign official Michael Roman, have argued that Willis has an untenable conflict of interest created by a previously undisclosed romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, the outside attorney she hired to spearhead the racketeering probe. Trump and 14 other defendants currently remain in the case. Share this story""}]"
