of dollars from a Ukrainian energy company. Republicans on Capitol Hill pointed to it as evidence of criminal wrongdoing in their ongoing impeachment inquiry of President Biden. Turns out it was all a lie. That is according to an indictment against Smirnov brought yesterday by special counsel David Weiss. NPR political correspondent Susan Davis joins us now for more on this and what it means for a possible impeachment. Hi, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Juana. SUMMERS: So, Sue, tell us. Who exactly is Smirnov, and what's he charged with? DAVIS: So according to court papers, Smirnov has been a long-time FBI informant dating back to 2010. And he's charged on two counts - making false statements and creating a false and fictitious record. Now, Smirnov allegedly told the FBI back in 2020 that when Joe Biden was vice president, he and his son Hunter took millions of dollars from Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company and used their influence to shield this company from investigators. Prosecutors say Smirnov made that all up. They say he also suggested he had a political bias, that he had made repeated negative remarks to his FBI handler about Joe Biden, even saying at one point in a text message that Biden was going to end up in jail - important to note, as you noted, Juana, this indictment was brought by David Weiss. He was a Trump appointed attorney, and he's also been leading a years-long investigation into Hunter Biden that has separately resulted in criminal charges for tax and gun crimes against the president's son. SUMMERS: And so help us if you can understand how exactly Alexander Smirnov fit into the impeachment inquiry in the House. DAVIS: Yeah. So he's been involved in one of the more high-profile allegations in the inquiry. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer last year released a public letter to the FBI saying that they had received credible information from a whistleblower, which we now know to be Smirnov, that there was evidence of a criminal scheme involving Biden. The committee spent months publicly pressuring the FBI to release this information to the committee. At one point, Comer even threatened to hold FBI Director Christopher Wray in contempt over it. It was also cited by Speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall when he announced the House would move forward with its formal impeachment inquiry and why it was justified. SUMMERS: Right. So then how much does this indictment undermine Republicans' case for impeachment against President Biden? DAVIS: You know, it makes a weak case a bit weaker. Republicans have found a lot of damning things about the president's son, but they haven't offered clear evidence to date of impeachable offenses by the president. And you don't have to take my word for that, Juana. This is a point that has been raised by many Republican senators who would ultimately hold a trial if House Republicans were to pass articles of impeachment. But Republicans are under a lot of pressure. They're under pressure from Donald Trump. They're under pressure from their base to impeach Biden. And House Republicans didn't really seem to blink at this indictment. In a statement, Comer criticized the FBI's handling of the investigation and pointed out that their inquiry is not reliant on this piece of information alone. The committee has been looking at other bank records and have other witness testimony that have made allegations about the president. But, again, no exact official act or crime I could point you to. But Comer did reiterate today impeachment still on the table. SUMMERS: Sue, what have you heard from Democrats? How have they been responding? DAVIS: You know, President Biden was asked about this today at the White House. He said it was reason for the inquiry to end. He said it's been an outrageous effort from the start. In a statement, Hunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said it proves their longstanding defense that the impeachment inquiry has been built on a number of conspiracy theories. And there is some skepticism among House Republicans that the party hasn't made a strong enough case to sell impeachment to the public. This is clearly a setback in that regard.

'Updated February 16, 2024 at 10:03 AM ET It\'s been a busy week for news involving the U.S., Ukraine and Russia. It started with the Senate passing a bill that would send billions of dollars of aid to Ukraine, as well as Israel and Taiwan, despite warnings from House Republicans that they would not bring such legislation to their own floor. Then an unusual statement from the Republican chair of the House Intelligence Committee about a national security threat prompted the Biden administration to confirm that Russia is working on a weapon that has the potential to threaten satellites. National security adviser Jake Sullivan met with a group of lawmakers in the House of Representatives on Thursday to brief them on the issue. Moments before he dialed in to speak with NPR\'s Morning Edition about it on Friday, reports emerged from Russian authorities that opposition figure Alexei Navalny had died in prison after falling ill. NPR has since confirmed Navalny\'s death at age 47 in a remote Russian prison, where he was serving a decades-long sentence for charges including extremism. Sullivan described it as a ""terrible tragedy"" in an interview Morning Edition\'s Steve Inskeep. ""Given the Russian government\'s long and sordid history of doing harm to its opponents, it raises real and obvious questions about what happened here,"" he added. In his first one-on-one interview since briefing lawmakers, Sullivan spoke with Inskeep about Russia\'s anti-satellite weapon, the continued need for U.S. aid to Ukraine and the state of the Israel-Gaza war. Sullivan is fresh off briefing lawmakers on Capitol Hill about the Russian security threat, which the Biden administration has been referring to as an ""anti-satellite capability."" House Intelligence Committee Chair Mike Turner, R-Ohio, drew attention to it on Wednesday, when he publicly called on Biden to declassify information ""concerning a national security threat."" Sullivan previously said he was surprised by Turner\'s decision, which he reiterated in his interview with NPR. ""I had put on the books days ago a meeting with House leadership on this to be able to talk to them privately,"" he said. ""When we deal with serious threats like this that involve highly sensitive intelligence we like to do so behind closed doors."" Sullivan said that he would have liked the situation to play out differently. But he did not question Turner\'s motives for going public, as some of his fellow Republican lawmakers have, instead agreeing that this is an issue Congress should take seriously. The White House said Thursday that while the development of such a capability is troubling, there is no immediate safety risk, nor could the capability ""cause physical destruction here on Earth."" But it could threaten astronauts in low orbit, as well as interfere with systems used for communication, transportation, meteorology and financial transactions. What then is the difference between a capability and a weapon? Basically, Sullivan said, officials are trying to protect intelligence sources and methods by not saying too much publicly — and ""anti-satellite capability"" is the language that the intelligence community has approved. ""But an anti-satellite capability, of course, means something that the Russians could use to go against satellites,"" Sullivan added. ""So if people wanted to characterize it using a different word of course they could do so."" The U.S., Russia and China already have the capability to attack satellites, but the use of nuclear weapons in space is banned by the Outer Space Treaty of 1967. When asked if the deployment of this Russian capability would violate that treaty, Sullivan declined to say. ""It would violate long standing international obligations of Russia, but I can\'t go further than that today given the limitations on what I can share,"" he said. Sullivan described his meeting with lawmakers as ""deeply substantive,"" saying it covered the intelligence itself as well as what steps the Biden administration is taking to protect the American people. ""It was a bipartisan meeting,"" he said. ""People focused — both Democrats and Republicans — on the substance, not on the politics or the public Sturm und Drang [turmoil], and I think we emerged with a good understanding of the way forward.""

former President Donald Trump. One key case played out behind the scenes in filings to the U.S. Supreme Court from Trump's legal team and special counsel Jack Smith over Trump's claims of immunity. Barbara McQuade joins us. She's a former U.S. attorney and now a law professor at the University of Michigan. Barbara, welcome. BARBARA MCQUADE: Thanks, Don. Great to be with you. GONYEA: So remind us what's at stake in terms of these filings from Trump and from special counsel Jack Smith. MCQUADE: Well, they're all reacting to the decision of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that rejected Donald Trump's immunity defense in the federal election interference case. You may recall that the trial judge there, Tanya Chutkan, said presidential immunity is not a defense in this case. Donald Trump appealed that, and the appeals court agreed with the district court. And now Donald Trump is seeking review of that decision in the U.S. Supreme Court. So this week we saw a lot of filing about that. GONYEA: OK, that's what's at stake. What's your take on the strength of their respective legal arguments? MCQUADE: Well, at the moment, the issue is simply whether the Supreme Court ought to grant a stay while it figures out what's next in this case. And so Jack Smith has said no stay necessary. Let's get back to the trial court and get on with it. And Donald Trump says this is a matter of great import. We should take our time, and I should get a stay so that I can appeal my case not only to the Supreme Court, but in between to all of the judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. And so the merits of this say that to grant a stay requires a showing of a likelihood of success on this issue. I don't believe that there is a likelihood of success on this issue on Trump's part. I think there's no reason to suspect that the Supreme Court will rule differently than we have seen the other two lower courts. But I also can imagine that the court wants to make sure that this is a matter of significant import and wants to get it right. So I think there is a middle ground here for the court to take the case, but to do so on an expedited basis. GONYEA: And let me just ask specifically, what are the options for the U.S. Supreme Court? Is it just stay or no stay or what? MCQUADE: There are actually a number of different arguments. I'll tell you maybe the best case for Donald Trump, the best-case scenario for Jack Smith and what I think is the most likely outcome. So for Donald Trump, a stay - that would be best for him. It would mean everything is on a slow boat. He gets 90 days to file his petition for review, and then it would go on its normal course and probably doesn't get decided until after the election. That's one option. The best scenario for Jack Smith would be to either deny the stay and get the case rolling back in the trial court or grant the stay but summarily affirm the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, to just say they got it right and let's go back. That would really be the best-case scenario for Jack Smith. He wins, back to the trial court. I think it's more likely what we'll see is this middle ground, which is to grant the stay and set this case for an expedited review. And I think if they do it in the same way they did the 14th Amendment case, we could see the case briefed and argued within a month or two and a decision rendered by the end of this term, late spring, early summer, and on track for a trial sometime this summer. GONYEA: OK, that's the U.S. Supreme Court and the question of immunity. Let's step back and look at some of those other cases involving the former president. What stood out most for you this past week in those other venues? MCQUADE: Well, I think the hearing in Georgia got a lot of attention, certainly, because Fani Willis herself took the stand and was defending her own reputation about her relationship with a fellow prosecutor, Nathan Wade. There was an awful lot of hoopla there, but at the end of the day, the issue is really about not just any conflict of interest, but whether there is a conflict of interest as to the defendants that could prejudice them or harm their right to a fair trial. And so all of this testimony is really about determining whether she was receiving kickbacks from Nathan Wade. And I think there was an awful lot of distraction about when the relationship began and whether there were public displays of affection and other kinds of things. But at the end of the day, it's really whether she is financially benefiting from this prosecution, because that creates at least an appearance that she is filing charges or prolonging the case because she can keep the money spigot on. But I didn't hear a lot of testimony about that. It was mostly about who was dating whom and when. That may be an ethical issue for Fani Willis. That may be a bad judgment on her part, but I don't think it has anything to do with the guilt or innocence of Donald Trump and his co-defendants. So I think it was an awful lot of fanfare that is likely to have not much consequence on the trial. GONYEA: But what an unusual moment, a prosecutor on the stand. And there it is, live on television. MCQUADE: Yeah. And, you know, one thing I worry about in a case like this is, you know, no doubt when defendants are on trial, it is not an uncommon tactic for them to put the prosecution on trial, so to speak. But usually it is a theory like you rushed to judgment or you acted through confirmation bias and you just reached a conclusion that you decided earlier, about their conduct and not so much about their personal lives. And I do worry that this is crossing a line of - delving into, you know, the private finances and love life of an individual prosecutor is going to change the game for prosecutors going forward and make good people reluctant to become prosecutors. GONYEA: OK, that's former U.S. attorney and current University of Michigan law professor Barbara McQuade. Barbara, thank you. MCQUADE: Thank you, Don.

It actually has a much deeper meaning. Here\'s what it means when you see a green porch light in Tennessee, and why you might want to install one. Not only can color porch lights be used to decorate for your favorite holiday but they can also be used to show support for others. Red porch lights? American Heart Month. Pink porch lights? Breast Cancer Awareness Month. There is one color that can be used all year long. Have you ever seen a home with a green porch light and wondered what it means? A green porch light is used to display appreciation for our country\'s veterans. Green bulbs are often used around Veteran\'s Day and Memorial Day. However, they can be used all year to show our support. Green is a color known to represent hope and renewal. ""Greenlight"" is a phrase that suggests active, forward motion or movement. By changing a single light to green, and leaving it illuminated, you can send a clear and direct message of gratitude and support to our men and women of the United States Armed Forces. Green light bulbs can be purchased at most major retailers, home improvement stores, and online box stores.'}]"
