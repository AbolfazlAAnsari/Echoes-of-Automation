The overnight airstrikes came hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a cease-fire proposal from the Palestinian militant group Hamas and said he would expand the offensive into Rafah. The U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken, left Israel on Thursday as the divide grows between the two close allies on the way forward. More than half of Gaza’s 2.3 million population has been driven by Israel’s military offensive toward the border with Egypt. Unable to leave the tiny Palestinian territory, many are living in makeshift tent camps or overflowing U.N.-run shelters. The Palestinian death toll from the war has surpassed 27,000 people, the Health Ministry in Gaza said. A quarter of Gaza’s residents are starving. The war began with Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Hamas is still holding over 130 hostages, but around 30 of them are believed to be dead. Currently: — Israel and Hamas are far apart on a Gaza cease-fire and hostage deal.

Here’s the latest: UNITED NATIONS – The United Nations chief is calling for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza before “a gigantic tragedy” develops in Rafah, if Israel conducts military operations in the southern city with the same intensity as elsewhere in the territory. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a news conference Thursday that more than half of Gaza’s 2.3 million population were pushed into Rafah looking for safety from Israel’s military offensive. “They have nowhere to go. They have no homes and they have no hope,” he said. “They are living in overcrowded makeshift shelters in unsanitary conditions without running water, electricity and adequate food supplies.” Guterres condemned violations of international humanitarian law, which include protecting civilians and ensuring that their essential needs are met, by Israel. But he also condemned violations by Hamas during the militants’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and abducted 250. Asked if there was a contingency plan for civilians in Rafah to go somewhere else and whether he would push for opening the border to Egypt, Guterres replied: “I think that we should push to avoid the tragedy instead of pushing for things to facilitate the tragedy.” Since the war began, Egypt has pushed back hard against calls that it take in a mass exodus of Palestinians. It fears Israel won’t allow them to return to Gaza and says it doesn’t want to abet ethnic cleansing. It also warned that militants from Gaza could enter the Sinai with those fleeing. Beirut — An Israeli drone strike hit a car in the city of Nabatieh in south Lebanon on Thursday, wounding three people, Lebanese state media reported. The site is relatively far from the conflict area on the border, where Hezbollah and Israeli forces have clashed almost daily for the past four months. The Lebanese state-run National News Agency reported that an initial missile fired at the car missed, and two people got out before a second missile hit the vehicle. The two occupants of the car and a third person who was passing by were injured and transported to area hospitals, one of them in serious condition, it said. Israeli media reported that two Hezbollah members were killed in a strike on a car in Nabatieh, including a field commander of the militant group’s elite Radwan force in the Khiam area. The Israeli military did not publicly comment on the strike. A Hezbollah spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment, and the group has not published a death announcement, as it usually does when one of its members is killed. Hezbollah later announced that in response to the attack in Nabatieh, it had fired dozens of Katyusha rockets at the headquarters command of an Israeli infantry unit at the Ein Zeitim base. It was not immediately clear if there were casualties. About 230 people have been killed in Lebanon during four months of near-daily clashes between Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group and Israeli forces on the border — most of them fighters with Hezbollah and allied groups but also including more than 20 civilians, among them journalists, women and children. Outside of the border area, Israel has launched targeted strikes on some high-ranking Hezbollah and Hamas officials in Lebanon. Fears of an expansion of the conflict has driven a flurry of shuttle diplomacy by the U.S. and European countries in an attempt to deescalate the situation CAIRO — The leader of Yemen’s Houthi rebels said his forces will keep up their monthslong campaign of attacks on vessels in the Red Sea over Israel’s war in Gaza against Hamas. “Food, medicine and humanitarian air should reach all different parts of Gaza. If not, we will carry on our operations,” said Abdel Malek al-Houthi, a Yemeni politician who serves as the leader of the Iran-backed rebel movement, in a televised speech Thursday. The war in Gaza has caused a humanitarian catastrophe, and northern areas remain largely cut off from humanitarian aid. Al-Houthi said the U.S. and British militaries had launched a total of 86 air and naval strikes on Yemen this week. However, al-Houthi said the retaliatory strikes would not achieve their intended goal of disabling the group’s abilities, and said the attacks were Washington’s attempt to save face. “Carrying on with strikes won’t do the U.S., Britain or Israel any good,” al-Houthi said. In recent weeks, the U.S. and the U.K., backed by other allies, have launched airstrikes targeting Houthi missile arsenals and launch sites for its attacks. The barrage of U.S., coalition and militant attacks in the Middle East are compounding fears that Israel’s war in Gaza could escalate into a wider regional conflict. GENEVA — The head of a U.N.-backed panel focusing on children’s rights called Thursday for “massive psychosocial support” for kids and families in Gaza and for Israeli children who were victims of or witnessed the attacks by Palestinian militant fighters in Israel in October. Ann Skelton, chair of the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child, said the 18-member panel of independent rights experts regretted that the government of Israel — which was expected to come up for a regular review by the committee last month — opted to suspend its participation. The review has now been rescheduled for September. Speaking at a news briefing on the committee’s findings on six other countries, Skelton said the latest U.N. figures — largely based on statistics from the Health Ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza — showed more than 27,000 people have died in the Israel-Hamas war since Oct. 7, out of a total casualty count of more than 100,000. Many of those were children, she said. “No child should grow up in fear, pain and hunger. Yet today, no child in Gaza is free from fear, pain and hunger,” she said. “In fact, they’ll be considered lucky if they can even survive this war and have the chance to grow up.” Skelton cited the “colossal humanitarian needs” faced by more than 2 million people in Gaza. She echoed U.N. calls for the “immediate and unconditional release” of Israeli hostages held in Gaza and an immediate cease-fire, and appealed for key donors to resume funding for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, so that humanitarian aid can reach children. WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden will host Jordan’s king at the White House next week. The visit by King Abdullah II on Monday comes as tensions continue to rise over the Israel-Hamas war. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement Thursday that the two will discuss Gaza and “efforts to produce an enduring end to the crisis.” She said that they’ll also discuss humanitarian assistance to the region. Queen Rania Al Abdullah will also attend. TEL AVIV, Israel — An Israeli man who was believed to have been kidnapped by Palestinian militants during Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack has been confirmed as being dead.'}]"

Court in New York, on Oct. 2, 2023. (Stephanie Keith/Bloomberg via Getty Images) NEW YORK — Federal authorities are currently investigating a series of threats made online to a potential witness related to special counsel Jack Smith\'s classified documents case against former President Donald Trump, according to a new court filing from Smith\'s team. In the filing late Wednesday in federal court in Florida, Smith\'s team asked U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, the judge overseeing the case, to let them file an exhibit under seal because, they wrote, ""The exhibit describes in some detail threats that have been made over social media to a prospective Government witness and the surrounding circumstances, and the fact that those threats are the subject of an ongoing federal investigation being handled by a United States Attorney\'s Office."" ""Disclosure of the details and circumstances of the threats risks disrupting the investigation,"" the filing said. The targeted witness was not identified. The three-page filing discussing the probe was submitted as part of a dispute between Smith\'s team and Trump\'s lawyers over how much information should be redacted -- or totally withheld from public view -- in certain court filings. In their filing Wednesday, Smith\'s team urged Judge Cannon to let them file the exhibit completely under seal because, they said, simply redacting names or other parts of the document could still ""provide information to the suspect to which he/she may not otherwise be entitled."" Last year, Smith indicted Trump in Florida for allegedly defying a federal grand jury subpoena and trying to hide classified documents from both the FBI and his own attorney. Smith then indicted Trump in Washington, D.C., for allegedly trying to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Trump has pleaded not guilty in both cases and denied all wrongdoing. In October, Smith\'s team accused Trump of threatening his former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, after an ABC News report detailed some of what Meadows allegedly told investigators about Trump and the 2020 presidential election, including that he repeatedly told Trump in the weeks following the election that allegations of significant voting fraud coming to them were baseless. After the ABC News report, Trump posted to his social media platform, Truth Social, that he wouldn\'t expect Meadows to ""lie about the Rigged and Stolen"" election ""merely for getting IMMUNITY,"" but that ""Some people would make that deal."" ""[T]hey are weaklings and cowards, and so bad for the future of our Failing Nation,"" Trump wrote. In a subsequent court filing, Smith\'s team said Trump\'s ""harmful"" post on Truth Social was trying to ""send an unmistakable and threatening message to a foreseeable witness in this case."" Smith\'s team argued to U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan that the alleged threat was just one more example of why a limited gag order in the case was needed. Such a gag order now remains in place. A spokesperson for Smith did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Copyright © 2024, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.
