'2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'KTOO Environment | Search & Rescue | Southeast December 3, 2023 by Anna Canny, KTOO WRANGELL — By Nov. 20, rain had been pouring down on Wrangell for days. It grew even stronger in the late afternoon as Angie Flickinger drove to her house on Zimovia Highway, a road that follows the coast for 14 miles south from downtown. Around mile eight, she saw water cascading from the steep bluffs above the road. She raced through that stretch nervously, worried about the rockfalls that happen there. “That type of weather always gives me tons of anxiety,” Flickinger said. “There always seems to be this big storm at the end of November, where trees fall. There’s always carnage.” Later that night, the rain pounding on her roof sounded like white noise. Then it changed suddenly. “I heard this very loud sound. Like it had been amplified tenfold,” Flickinger said. “My brain was like, ‘That’s not right.’” Flickinger’s friend Jamie Roberts lives about a half-mile up the road. To her, the sound was like a jet rumbling overhead. She opened the door to look, and the sound got louder. “I yelled at my husband, and I was like ‘Alaska Airlines, something is wrong with the jet, it’s coming down,’” Roberts said. She braced herself for the sound of a crash, but it never came. Instead, the whole house started shaking. “And we just ran out the door,” she said. A few hundred feet away, Roberts’ neighbor Christina Florschutz was on the second floor of her house, just out of the shower. She knew what the sound was. She’d heard mudslides before. “Suddenly I’m like a piece of weightless popcorn being tossed around all over the place,” she said. “And then — I don’t remember anymore for a while.” That evening, a burst of heavy rain drenched the already sodden hillside around mile 11 of Zimovia Highway while 70 mph gusts battered the trees. Eventually, parts of the slope were more water than soil. The earth finally gave way at about 8:45 p.m. A viscous flow of mud roared down toward the road, carrying hundreds of fallen trees. It picked up the Florschutz house and carried it downhill until it slammed into the family’s workshed and fell to pieces. The slide crossed the highway, burying the house where Beth and Timothy Heller lived with their three children. Some of the debris reached the water. Beth and Timothy Heller were later found dead, as were their daughters, Mara and Kara. Their son Derek has not been found. Searchers found the body of Otto Florschutz, Christina’s husband, on Nov. 30. It was the deadliest landslide in recent Alaska history. For about 70 people who live beyond the slide zone, it blocked the road and knocked out power for a week. Now, some who live on the hillside wonder if they should leave their homes for good. KTOO spoke to a dozen people who were stranded beyond the slide zone that night. They described hours of fear and confusion as some fled their homes — and how that confusion gave way to an improvised evacuation where neighbors helped each other to safety. After the slide came down, Roberts ran to the beach with her husband and son. She could see the silhouette of a big pile of debris just up the coast. And she could smell it. “Like Christmas wreaths,” Roberts said. “It was a very overwhelming, you know, conifer smell.” Roberts was close with the Florschutzes and the Hellers. They’d celebrated holidays together, and Roberts had coached the younger Heller children at swimming. From what she could see, the slide had plowed right through their properties. She was shaken and didn’t know where to go. Her family stood in the rain wearing just the clothes they escaped in. Her husband was barefoot. The rain was soaking through their sweatshirts, but they were afraid to move. “We could still hear the hillside cracking,” Roberts said. “So we figured if we just stand in this one spot and are quiet, we’ll be able to know which way to go if more starts coming down the hill.” Angie Flickinger, Roberts’ neighbor to the south, didn’t know what had happened. The power had gone out, but she was still in her house. She stepped outside to investigate, thinking a small slide might have come down close by. That had happened two years ago, during a November storm that snapped utility poles and knocked down dozens of trees. She couldn’t see much of anything with her headlamp. The roaring had died down, but the two creeks that run through her property were raging, and the wind was shaking the trees. She tried to reach friends who might know more, but she couldn’t get through to anyone. She thought she might just go to bed, but as she was putting pajamas on, at 9:30 p.m., the phone rang. “It was a friend in town,” Flickinger said. “And she told me that there had been a big slide. Like a major slide.” Just then, something caught Flickinger’s eye out the window. A boat with piercing white lights was charging up the coast. Search and rescue teams arrived quickly, just after 9 p.m. by road on the north side of the slide, and soon after that by boat. In the pitch dark, they made a hasty search and recovered the body of the Heller’s 16-year-old daughter, Mara. But the mud was deep and soft — rescuers who tried to climb the debris sank to their chests. Like the Roberts family, they could hear the unstable hillside shifting in the dark. Before long, they called off the search for the night. About a mile away, Charlie and Mel Hazel saw the search boats, too. A retired couple, they live at mile 12.7 in a house they built 10 years ago. “Great big, huge sodium lights. And they were up here, kind of going around in circles,” Hazel said, pointing to the water north of his property. They watched the lights through the windows of their darkened living room. Then some of the lights started moving their way. “That boat came down here and landed on my dock,” Hazel said. “Then a search and rescue team got off.” They told the Hazels about the landslide. Charlie Hazel gave them the keys to his pickup truck, and they tore off down the road. Back in town, Eric Yancey was firing up his private ferry, the Rainforest Islander. He had learned about the slide from his brother-in-law, who took his fishing boat out to help light the search. Yancey wasn’t sure where he was going or how his ferry might be used — he just wanted to help somehow. Flickinger — and many others — also were not sure what to do or where to go. “I didn’t really know the full severity of it,” Flickinger said. “I didn’t know what I was doing.” Cell reception that far out of town is always unreliable, and the slide had taken out landlines and internet along with the electricity. At 9:36 pm, the city had sent out a text and email alert saying a landslide had happened between miles 10 and 12 — and they sent several more updates through the night. But it’s likely that most people never got them. According to the Wrangell’s interim borough manager, only 10% of residents are signed up for the city’s emergency alert system. Out the road, the houses are spread out, and many have long driveways through large, wooded yards. In the dark, it took hours for firefighters to spread the evacuation warning. Meanwhile, people wandered up and down the road, in cars and on foot. A few went to the slide with flashlights and hand shovels. Some even tried to climb over it, but they retreated once they realized just how far the debris stretched. Others went back to their houses, packed their bags and waited. Some listened for more slides, ready to make a quick escape. Flickinger started walking toward the slide, too, but her neighbors up the road pushed her back. They urged her to go to the school bus turnaround — a flat place near the toe of the mountain where many had already gathered. But Flickinger was worried about her neighbors. She knew the slide had come down near the Roberts’ house, and she hadn’t heard from them. She also thought of a young family down the road. She knocked on their door, but they didn’t answer. Thinking she might be overreacting, she started to head back home. That’s when a truck full of firefighters stopped her. They told her to leave the area and head to Charlie Hazel’s dock. For Flickinger, that’s when fear fully set in. “So I turned around, went back to my friend’s house,” she said. “I screamed and flashed my headlamp in all their windows and doors until they woke up.” The Roberts family finally ventured up from the beach.

'HUMAN_ONLY', 'version': '2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Select Page Posted by Shelby Herbert | Oct 12, 2023 The cast and crew of a reality television show will start filming in the second weekend of October in a popular hunting spot near Petersburg. They’ll stay there for the next 40 days. That means a longer season for some local transportation and hospitality businesses — but the project is also pushing aside hunters in the middle of deer and moose season. Some subsistence users in the area feel that the U.S. Forest Service didn’t consider their needs when they greenlit the project. Outlast is a survival show where contestants are dropped into the Alaskan wilderness to compete for a cash prize. It’s only had one season so far — filmed on Chichagof Island — and the competition is cutthroat. Acts of sabotage are commonplace between contestants — including, infamously, setting rival campsites on fire. The U.S. Forest Service authorized Netflix and the BBC to shoot the second season of Outlast in Little Duncan Bay, a popular fishing, hunting, and recreation area about 20 miles southeast of Petersburg. The show will bring in about 60 people to live and work on location through mid-November. But as the cast gets eliminated, crew numbers will decrease proportionally. Ray Born is Petersburg’s District Ranger. He said a few charter pilots, boat captains, caterers, and Borough officials told him that this would be an economic boon for Petersburg. “They’re bringing in about a million dollars into the community for this project,” said Born. “So, there’s economic value that way, as we look at it. And part of our mission is to help take care of the community.” In fact, one borough assembly member already has a contract to transport the film crew: Scott Newman. But not everybody in the community is happy — least of all, subsistence users. “[It] seems misguided,” said Lee Gilpin, a Petersburg subsistence hunter. “There’s going to be some grumpy people over this.” Gilpin was speaking from the exact location Outlast is set to take place. He was out hunting moose in late September and saw the film crew staking out the coast. He said he’s not thrilled about them setting up shop right in the middle of the Sitka blacktail season. He said it’s a high traffic hunting spot — especially for local kids. “My daughter grew up hunting in this area,” said Gilpin. “Every deer she’s ever killed has been inside the area that’s being discussed here. She’s not the only one. There’s a lot of kids in Petersburg that this is where they get to go deer hunting for the first time because the access is very, very easy.” The federal government usually prioritizes the interests of subsistence users over commercial in rural areas — but not in this case. In its decision memo, the Forest Service said the filming will affect access to subsistence resources within the proposed area. But the scale of the impact on subsistence is not significant within the overall traditional use area. Bob Lynn sits on the Petersburg Borough Assembly, and his house overlooks Little Duncan. For weeks, he’s watched the film crew’s charter boats and planes come and go from the area. At an assembly meeting in late September, he said he was concerned for local hunters — and for the safety of the contestants. “I can see a conflict really quick here, where somebody gets shot — not intentionally, but it could happen,” said Lynn. “I think you might want to take a look at a different time of the year. I think we’re asking for some problems we don’t need.” Bret Uppencamp oversees special use permits for the Petersburg Ranger District. He said the Outlast crew has to follow a long list of rules to use the area. “Essentially, like, if they can cut trees down, or if they can have fires, how they’re going to dispose of human waste,” said Uppencamp. “And for wildlife interactions, like — they need to ensure they’re not overly harassing wildlife.” Uppencamp said those federal stipulations amount to basic “leave no trace” principles, but there’s not much on the list that specifically pertains to safety. The Forest Service opened up a week-long comment period to gather feedback on the permit. They notified about 450 interested parties on an email chain, and addressed Petersburg’s Borough Assembly and the local tribe, Petersburg Indian Association. About 50 people responded, and feedback was fairly mixed. Subsistence users weren’t the only ones taking issue with the project. One commenter noted that the area is sacred to Indigenous people. Uppencamp said the district is looking into this claim, but he and Ranger Born believe the filming activities won’t compromise the physical integrity of the site. Altogether, Born said it was a tough call to make — but the land doesn’t just belong to Petersburg locals. “This is a relatively high-use area,” said Born. “A lot of people do go through there, but it’s not a closed area. Forest Service land belongs to all the American people. So, everybody has the right to be in there.” Gilpin said it all feels a little exploitative — and that even if the Outlast crew “leaves no trace” on the land, they’ll leave behind a lost season. “If you’re growing up […] in Petersburg, you have one season of deer hunting that you can’t get to during high school,” said Gilpin. “That’s a quarter of your easy access hunting area, gone. A quarter of the time you can hunt has been put away so somebody could make a few dollars.” And it’s not the first go around Petersburg residents have had with reality TV shows in their backyard. In recent years, some have opposed the Discovery series, Alaskan Bush People, which they say casts the region in a negative light. The Outlast cast and crew will film around Little Duncan until mid-November. By that time, one determined contestant will have won their million dollar prize — but some locals will have missed their chance to get a prize buck.

Alaska Air National Guard rescue personnel flew around the southwest corner of Denali National Park and Preserve Thursday morning after getting an alert Wednesday night about an overdue pilot. Park spokesperson Sharon Stiteler says the aircrew spotted the wreckage of a small airplane, but was unable to land in the steep terrain. “The Alaska Guard Rescue Coordination Center found aircraft wreckage in a narrow ravine,” Stiteler said. “And, at the time, it wasn’t safe to land.” Alaska National Guard spokesperson Alan Brown said Thursday the Rescue Coordination Center plans to fly into the area again this morning, weather permitting. “We launched a UH-60 Pavehawk helicopter with some para-rescuemen aboard to go search,” Brown said, “and that search is ongoing.” National Transportation Safety Board Alaska Region Chief Clint Johnson said the Guard rescuers flew into the area Thursday morning and got a look at the wreckage before having to leave because of bad weather. “They returned (Thursday) morning -- they reported back around mid-morning or so,” he said. “They were able to overfly the wreckage. It does not appear, from their estimation, that this was a survivable accident.” Johnson says another flight into the area was scheduled for later Thursday to try to get a second look at the wreckage from the air. And he says the NTSB official in charge of the investigation hopes to get back to the site this morning and take a closer look on the ground “as long as we can get in there safely, if terrain conditions allow, and weather conditions allow. Johnson says the crew aboard the second flight identified the aircraft as a Piper PA-18 Supercub. But he says the NTSB is withholding the plane’s tail number and victim’s name until next-of-kin is notified. He said the agency won’t know whether there was a passenger on board until the investigator can check out the site, on the ground. And he says it appears the flight was hunting-related. “This airplane was supporting a hunting group,” Johnson said, “and we don’t know if it was on the outbound trip or the inbound trip.” Stiteler said Thursday that the Park Service didn’t have any information to release on the aircraft or its pilot. But she says it makes sense that it could’ve been a hunter. “There are a number of reasons that someone could be going into that area of the park this time of year, up to and including for hunting,” she said. Johnson says NTSB should have more information Friday afternoon. He says the investigation is ongoing.""}]"

analyze the Manh Choh Mine ore haul route, and ended its public meeting process. A November 15th letter from DOT Commissioner Ryan Anderson to members of the Transportation Advisory Committee or “TAC” says QUOTE: “I have asked my staff to not engage in dialogue.” DOT communications director Shannon McCarthy says the letter was prompted by a lawsuit filed by a local citizen’s group against the agency last month, aimed at stopping the ore haul. “Several members of the TAC are involved with that litigation, so it complicated the department’s ability to participate and provide information.” Commissioner Anderson’s letter also asks that TAC members QUOTE: “limit feedback and discussions to the identified potential impacts and alternatives to address each impact.” The committee met Thursday for an in-person work session that the DOT initially limited to online participation. TAC and Advocates for Safe Alaska Highways member Jon Cook voiced general frustration with the agency’s recent actions. “First of all we had the meeting being held virtual, and going through that unnecessary drama. And I don’t know why you would want to dump gasoline on a dumpster fire, but the gasoline got dumped and then we had a big blow up on that, and now we’re told in this letter what we can and can’t talk about.” Fellow TAC member and Advocates for Safe Alaska Highways representative Jenny Campbell objected to DOT staff not answering questions. “Its clamping down on an independent analysis and us getting information.” The committee spent over 3 hours going through 59 alternatives addressing a wide range of issues related to safety, traffic, maintenance, and the environment along the 250-mile Alaska Richardson, Steese Highway ore haul corridor.

The trawl fishery association Groundfish Forum said their boats have reported a recent uptick in orca encounters.

Ray is a U.S. Army veteran who was wounded in Iraq. Since the 1940s, the federal government has helped veterans like him buy homes through its VA loan program, run by the Department of Veterans Affairs. But now the VA has put this family on the brink of losing their house. “I didn’t do anything wrong,” says Ray Queen. “The only thing I did was trust a company that I’m supposed to trust with my mortgage.” Like millions of other Americans, the Queens took advantage of what’s called a COVID mortgage forbearance, which allowed homeowners to skip mortgage payments. It was set up by Congress after the pandemic hit for people who lost income. But an NPR investigation has found that thousands of veterans who took a forbearance are now at risk of losing their homes through no fault of their own. And while the VA is working on a way to fix the problem, for many it could be too late. For the Queens, this all started in September of 2021, when Becky’s mother died of COVID-19. She had to take an extended leave from work and lost her job. So last year, with their savings dwindling, the couple says they called the company that manages their mortgage, Mr Cooper, and were told they could skip six months of payments. And once they got back on their feet and could start paying again, the couple says they were told, they wouldn’t owe the missed payments in a big lump sum. “I very specifically asked ‘how does this work?'” says Becky Queen. “They said we’re taking all of your payments, we’re bundling them, and we’re putting them at the end.” That is, the missed payments would be moved to the back end of their loan term so they could just start making their normal mortgage payment again. But that’s not how it worked out. In October 2022, the Department of Veterans Affairs ended the so-called Partial Claim Payment program, or PCP, that enabled homeowners to do that. This happened even though the mortgage industry, housing advocates and veterans groups all warned the VA not to end the program, saying thousands of homeowners needed to catch up on missed payments. Interest rates had risen so much that many couldn’t afford to refinance or get back on track any other way. Ray Queen says nobody told him about any of this. “How does that happen?” Queen asked. “This is supposed to be a program that you all have to help people in times of crisis, so you don’t take their house from them.” The Queens say they tried to come off their forbearance in February of this year and resume paying their mortgage. They were both working again. But they ran into delays with the mortgage company. Then, in September, the couple says they were told they needed to come up with more than $22,000, which they don’t have, or either sell their house or get foreclosed on. Their mortgage servicing company, Mr Cooper, said in a statement it “explored every possible avenue to work through a solution for this customer.” But it said the VA needs better loss-mitigation options and referred NPR to a letter from advocates, industry and veteran groups urging the VA to restart the PCP program. “The Department of Veterans Affairs has really let people down,” says Kristi Kelly, a consumer lawyer in Virginia who says she is hearing from a lot of other veterans in the same situation as Ray and Betsy Queen. “The homeowners entered into COVID forbearances, they were made certain promises, and there were certain representations that were made,” says Kelly. “And the VA essentially pulled the rug out from under everybody.” For some homeowners, ending the program may not mean foreclosure, but it still means a financial hardship. “Many of these people have 2 or 3% interest rate loans,” Kelly says. With the PCP program they could keep that interest rate. But now, she says, the only way they’ll be able to save their home is to enter into a loan modification where the interest rate will be around today’s market rate of 7.5%. “For most people, their payments will increase by $600 or $700 a month, because the VA has decided to end the partial claim program.” Many homeowners can’t afford such a huge increase in their monthly payment. According to the data firm ICE Mortgage Technology, 6,000 homeowners with VA loans who had COVID forbearances are currently in the foreclosure process. And 34,000 more are delinquent. Kelly says most other homeowners in America — people with FHA loans, for instance, or loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — still have ways to avoid foreclosure by moving missed payments to the back of the loan term. But homeowners with VA loans don’t, because the VA ended that program. So veterans are being treated worse than most other homeowners, Kelly said. “Service members are in a position where they’re going to lose their home,” she says. “And for most people, that’s everything they work for — and all their wealth is in their homes.” The Department of Veterans Affairs says it had no choice but to end the program. “We had a short-term authority for that specific program during COVID,” says John Bell, executive director of the Veterans Benefits Administration’s Loan Guaranty Service. “It wasn’t part of our normal authority.” Some in the industry think the VA did, in fact, have the authority to extend the program. But either way, it ended it. Now, though, the VA is taking the situation seriously. NPR has learned that the VA is working on a new program to replace the old one. It will work in a different way but to similar effect, to save people from foreclosure. Bell says it’s going to take four to five months to get it up and running. That’s too long for many of those 6,000 VA homeowners already in the foreclosure process. Not to mention the many more who are delinquent. Already, data shows that more VA homeowners have been heading into foreclosure since the VA ended its PCP program. The same is not true for FHA loans or loans backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. With so many homeowners at risk, there’s growing pressure on the VA to stop foreclosing on veterans until it gets its fix up and running. “There should be a pause on foreclosures,” says Steve Sharpe, a senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. “Veterans should really be able to have an ability to access this program when it comes online because it’s been so long since they’ve had something that will truly work. Sharpe says the VA could also restart the PCP program that it shut down. “They have the authority to do both,” he says. Pausing foreclosures sounds like a good idea to veteran Ray Queen in Oklahoma. “Let us keep paying towards our regular mortgage between now and then,” he says. “Then once the VA has that fixed we can come back and address the situation. That seems like the adult, mature thing to do, not put a family through hell.” NPR repeated Ray Queen’s plea to John Bell at the VA directly. Bell said the VA is “exploring all options at this point in time.” “We owe it to our veterans to make sure that we’re giving them every opportunity to be able to stay in the home,” Bell said. Ray and Becky Queen are hoping the VA does let people keep their homes until the new program can offer them a way to get current on their mortgages. Because if the firetruck shows up after the house has burned down, it’s not going to do much good for the thousands of veterans and service members who need help now.

And the big thing we're hearing is, it's really about the price secrecy that it's just not sustainable to go into the season, not knowing what you're going to be paid.

There's a few other boats that are rafted up too, but the rafting up is a little challenging with the wind and the tide right now. Corinne: What else have you been hearing from fishermen about how they're going to fare with this low price? If it stays at this 50 cents per pound (for sockey)?

It's not a base price that makes sense to get into the industry at you know, it's so much of it as an investment in boat and equipment.

The Borough hopes to change it from public recreation lands to reserved use lands to build Talkeetna’s fire station there. Talkeetna’s fire station is in the 500-year flood zone. The new site is outside the flood zone. Moving the facility also provides an insurance benefit to more Talkeetna residents because they would be within a five-mile radius of the new station. Planning and Land Use Director Alex Strawn says that the new facility will likely take about five years to go from planning to construction once the land is reclassified. Though funding has not been allocated for the new facility, it is likely to be at least partially funding through grants. The Borough notified the public of the proposal and only one comment was received. The neighboring landowner was concerned about traffic, siren noise, lighting, and well water levels. With an average of only one call per day, the traffic would be minimal. The Department of Emergency Services says in the backup materials that the lights and sirens would be turned on at the Spur Road, rather than at the station. The well at the Warm Storage Facility is 101 feet deep and produces 30 gallons per minute. The Borough Assembly will vote on the reclassification of the five acres at the January 2nd meeting.

According to a family member of survivor Aaron Elia, desperate attempts were made to save both of the women who died in the early Saturday morning fire. While authorities have not released their names, Elia’s uncle and Anchorage resident Glenn Westdahl said in an interview on Monday that one of the victims was Elia’s daughter, 19-year-old Autumn Beans of St. Mary’s. Westdahl said Beans and her 2-year-old daughter, Maggie, were visiting Anchorage to see Elia, who moved to Anchorage a year ago. According to Westdahl, Elia woke up early Saturday morning and realized the apartment was on fire. He managed to grab his granddaughter, Maggie, and knock on several neighbors’ doors to alert them to the flames. By the time he went back to his own apartment, he was already injured, and the unit was too hot to get inside. “He had burned his back, his arms, his neck and his face and he’s in surgery right now. And he tried to go back in to get his daughter and (his girlfriend). It was too hot and he had to leave,” Westdahl said. Elia’s girlfriend, Beverly Andrews, was also killed in the fire, according to family member Geraldine Woods. Andrews’ son, Keyaun, survived. Elia is being treated at Alaska Native Medical Center for burns to over 30% of his body. His recovery is expected to be a long one. Anchorage firefighters say it could be a week or more until they learn the cause of the fire that also sent five people to the hospital. The funeral for Beans will be in St. Mary’s and the funeral for Andrews will be in Mountain Village. Family members have started GoFundMe accounts to support Beans and Andrews. Correction: This article has been updated to correct the location of one victim’s home and future funeral. Aaron Elia’s girlfriend, Beverly Andrews, was living in Anchorage and her funeral will take place in her hometown of Mountain Village.

In a news release, the Coast Guard reports that the aircraft was removed from the shore of Read Island last week. Now, the M-60 Jayhawk is on its way to North Carolina for an inspection as part of a larger investigation into what caused the crash. On November 13, the Air Station Sitka crew was responding to a mayday from a fishing boat that was taking on water in Farragut Bay, about 20 miles northwest of Petersburg. The skipper of the boat had brought the flooding under control by the time the helicopter arrived. However, something went wrong and the helicopter crashed on nearby Read Island. The two men on the boat came to the aid of the helicopter crew, and supported them through the night with communications and supplies while awaiting emergency responders from Petersburg and a second helicopter from Air Station Sitka. All four crewmembers were medevaced to Seattle, two of them with serious injuries. The Coast Guard now says that all four crew members have returned home from the hospital and are recovering.Weather conditions were poor during the mission, with wind speeds up to 40 miles per hour in the area and low visibility. The Coast Guard established a security zone around the crash site and began an investigation. On December 8, with the help of the US Army’s Downed Aircraft Recovery team, the Forest Service, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, and Petersburg Fire and Rescue, among others, they were able to retrieve the helicopter. In an email to KCAW, Coast Guard Public Affairs officer Mike Salerno said the helicopter is being transported to Aviation Logistics Center in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, where investigators will further examine the airframe. Salerno told KCAW that aviation experts from across the service have been investigating the crash– from collecting and examining the wreckage to interviewing all parties involved with the accident and reviewing environmental factors. Salerno said the investigation can take up to eight months. Share: KCAW Prize Drawings: click on the links for rules and winner info.
