Gastineau Channel. The Lumberman was towed by a Coast Guard cutter, for her last trip out to sea. The black-and-yellow tugboat had long been a familiar sight in Juneau’s inland waters. She arrived in the late 1990s from Puget Sound. She’d change hands several times, decaying over the years to become a rustic liveaboard that skirted local laws. “We had a dispute with the owner at the time that he couldn’t be there, he claimed that he was on state lands and had the right to be there,” Juneau’s Port Director Carl Uchytil told CoastAlaska. Anchored on city-owned tidelands outside the harbor, she sat in a jurisdictional no man’s land that was out of reach of local officials. The Lumberman could often be seen from Juneau’s main highway with a collection of skiffs moored to her rusting hull. The vintage tug became a magnet for people unable to find shelter in a community that’s long struggled with a lack of affordable housing. “Of course, there was that unfortunate accident where two people perished going out to the Lumberman,” Uchytil said, referring to a December 2017 accident when a skiff carrying five people and a dog overturned while heading out to the tugboat. Two men were never found. The city later moved to condemn the 192-ton vessel. That’s after she broke her anchor chain and moved off state-owned tidelands. But then came the question of whose responsibility it was. The owner was long out of the picture. The state didn’t want her. The Coast Guard didn’t consider her a navigation hazard. And it cost too much to scrap it so she sat for more than a year — abandoned — tied to a city dock. “This is just the typical poster child of what a derelict vessel is,” Uchytil said, “where people aren’t responsible with their vessels, passing them from one person down to another.” To date, the city’s Docks and Harbors spent about $160,000 to clean and prep and ultimately scuttle the ship. The Coast Guard had also spent close to $70,000 to remove hazardous materials. Still, nobody really wanted to sink her. Juneau’s Docks & Harbors even appealed to the public for ideas for what could be done with the hulking beauty. Uchytil says the community had a range of pie-in-the-sky ideas from converting it into a beachfront fish and chips stand to a community flower garden. “There was never an organization that said, ‘I’ll take it over, I have some funding, I will do this,'” he said. That was three years ago. In all that time it would remain the city’s problem. Then last fall, federal regulators issued a permit green-lighting sinking the ship in about 8,400 feet of water. The plan called for her to be towed about 55 miles west of Cross Sound. Uchytil worked with a salvage firm to rig the tugboat with remotely opening valves that could flood the 107-foot tug at a flick of a switch. “We had consulted with a naval architect to make sure that the vessel would indeed flood and sink in that proposed spot,” he said.

UniSea closed its doors Jan. 5 after a handful of workers tested positive for the virus, following a New Year\'s gathering in company housing. Since then, 66 of UniSea\'s more than 900 workers tested positive for the virus, according to UniSea President Tom Enlow. Seventeen of those were during their two-week entry quarantine, and 49 were non-travel related cases, he said. ""The virus has not been eliminated just yet,"" Enlow said in an email. ""We have active cases in isolation that we are monitoring and close contacts in quarantine that we are continuing to test. But we feel very good about our response to the outbreak and containment thus far."" The reopening is a bright spot for the Bering Sea fishing industry, which has been hampered by COVID-19 outbreaks at multiple boats and onshore plants. UniSea\'s processing plant has a year-round workforce, and its facility handles multiple species, from cod to crab. The shutdown came just as it was gearing up for one of its busiest times of the year: the lucrative winter fishing season for pollock, which goes into products like fish sandwiches, fish sticks and sushi. The pollock season opened Jan. 20, but the 11 boats that typically deliver their catch to UniSea have been able to hold off, Enlow said. That\'s because the pollock fishery operates as a cooperative, where vessels have a fixed quota of fish they can catch and deliver to a specific plant. Crews that don\'t catch their quota now can still catch it later in the season, industry officials say. ""Our fleet have been extremely supportive of our situation and patient with our reopening schedule,"" Enlow said. ""But they, like UniSea, are anxious to get the season started."" Despite ""gaining ground on containment"" and restarting operations, UniSea will continue to test its workforce every three days until no one tests positive for the virus, Enlow said. It will also continue to limit access to the UniSea complex, which is ""challenging,"" according to Enlow. That\'s because UniSea is not a completely closed campus, like some other plants, and many employees have families who live or work in the community. ""The community risk level remains at \'high\' with community cases popping up every day,"" Enlow said. ""As much as we don\'t want to be responsible or the source of a spread into the community, we don\'t want the community impacting our workforce either."" While UniSea\'s ""hunker down order"" is in place, the company is helping with the delivery of homework packets to the 46 students who live in facility housing, Enlow said. Students living at UniSea will continue home-based schooling, despite local schools returning to a modified in-person learning platform Monday. ""The school district appreciates and supports UniSea\'s efforts to contain the spread of the virus through their hunker down orders,"" said Unalaska City School District Superintendent John Conwell. ""Once the hunker down is lifted, we will look forward to welcoming students from UniSea back at school."" The financial impact from the plant closure has been ""substantial,"" according to Enlow. Outside of the company\'s big hotel and restaurants in Unalaska, he said UniSea only makes money when it\'s processing fish. ""The costs related to COVID mitigation are substantial and are only exacerbated when trying to manage an outbreak,"" he said. Onshore processing plants in the Aleutians were largely successful in keeping COVID-19 out of their facilities last year. But this year appears to be posing more of a challenge, as companies contend with much higher rates of COVID-19 in Alaska and the Lower 48, where many workers come from. UniSea is one of three onshore plants in the Aleutians that COVID-19 outbreaks have shut down this year. Alyeska Seafoods in Unalaska shut down a week ago, after the city said that a ""cluster"" of workers tested positive for COVID-19. And Trident Seafoods\' huge plant on the remote island of Akutan, about 35 miles northeast of Unalaska, remains closed after more than a third of its workforce contracted the virus. Health officials said Monday that 302 of 701 workers had tested positive at the Akutan plant, and the company confirmed Tuesday that a worker died there over the weekend. The cause of death is under investigation. ""The pressure on processors to prevent or contain the virus is immense,"" Enlow said. ""There is so much at stake in our ability to open up to take and process deliveries of fish and crab."" While Alaska\'s seafood industry has lobbied for early vaccine access for workers, Alaska chose to vaccinate its elders before starting the process for essential workers outside of health care. Enlow said that it\'s ""nerve-racking"" to see the virus get into Aleutian processing plants despite strict mitigation measures. He said he thinks the state and federal government should prioritize vaccination of essential industry workers ""regardless of their state residency status,"" particularly in Unalaska, which is located 800 air miles from Anchorage and is the largest community in the state without a critical access hospital. Forty-two of UniSea\'s 930 workers have already received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, according to Enlow. They have been people 65 and over considered ""high risk"" or company medical personnel, he said. Another 10 high risk workers are slated to get their first dose in the next few days.'}]"

looking back on some of the defining stories in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta from 2021. January 2021 began with a tragedy. Two men drove into an unmarked open hole in the river ice near Tuluksak and drowned. The search for the missing men became atraining ground for a new generation of search and rescue volunteers. A fire destroyed Tuluksak’s only source of clean running water. Three and a half weeks later, Gov. Mike Dunleavy issued a disaster declaration. Another month later, the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation (YKHC) installed a potable water system for the community. YKHC opened COVID-19 vaccinations to everyone in the region age 16 and older. Aniak musher Richie Diehl won the Bogus Creek 150 Sled Dog Race. He made history as the first musher to also win the Kuskokwim 300 in the same year, and he set a new K300 record for fastest finish. For the first time, four of the top five K300 mushers to finish were from Kuskokwim River communities. February Two Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta school districts, the Kuspuk School District and the Lower Yukon School District, reopened schools in some of their communities as the number of COVID-19 cases fell. March The Lower Kuskokwim School District reopened in-person learning as well. Other school districts resumed basketball. April The region marked one year since its first confirmed COVID-19 case. Mekoryuk became the first Y-K Delta community to possibly have reached 100% vaccination against COVID-19, thanks to the work of a mother-daughter health aide team. The Hooper Bay girls basketball team won the 2A state basketball championship. Chevak declared a state of emergency after a fire destroyed its old school. Bethel City Council voted to hire an investigator to review how the city handles sexual assault cases. The action came after a Bethel resident alleged that the police department waited 34 days before picking up her sexual assault kit. May COVID-19 vaccinations opened to 12-to-15-year olds. As cases dropped, the Bethel City Council rescinded its mask mandate for vaccinated individuals in public places. Orthodox Christians in Bethel gathered for the first time in nearly a year and a half to celebrate Pascha, or Easter. On that high holiday, longtime KYUK colleague Lillian Atmak Michael died at the age of 64. She is remembered as a teacher, translator, reporter, storyteller, and friend. Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta State Rep. Tiffany Zulkosky introduced a bill to recognize Alaska Native tribes in state statue. The bill would eventually pass the House, but still awaits introduction in the Senate. Illegal Facebook gambling began surging across the region. NPR named KYUK interns as finalists in their student podcast challenge. June The city of Bethel began offering $100 gift cards as incentives for people to get vaccinated against COVID-19. YKHC ended its free COVID-19 testing at the airport and its drive-thru testing at the hospital after people largely stopped using them. Global supply chain challenges led to a national increase in lumber prices, exacerbating the housing shortage in the region. Later in the year, supply chain issues would lead to a shortage of Toyo stoves in the state. Napakiak created a comprehensive 50-year plan to relocate its community. “Retreat,” they called it. The plan is one of the first of its kind and could provide a blueprint for other communities threatened by climate change. July July 2021 marked the wettest July in Bethel in over 90 years with near record rainfall. The rain made drying what few salmon people caught difficult. This year’s Kuskokwim salmon run saw what has become an average number of king salmon in recent years, well below the historical average. And the chum salmon run crashed to record lows. Meanwhile, federal and tribal managers wrestled with state managers for control of the Kuskokwim salmon fishery. Local subsistence fishermen increased pressure on state and federal organizations to limit salmon bycatch in the Bering Sea. Runs were even worse on the Yukon River. The Yukon saw its worst summer and fall chum runs on record. It also saw its lowest coho run and its fourth lowest Chinook run. Bristol Bay processors shared salmon from their area with hungry river residents. Facing uncertainty that the runs would ever rebound, subsistence families and the whole commercial industry tried to pivot to new food sources. A federal judge sentenced former Bethel elementary school principal Chris Carmichael to 15 years in prison for enticement of a minor. A state judge sentenced him to 25 years with 10 years suspended. The Lower Kuskokwim School District agreed to pay $3.8 million to settle a sex abuse lawsuit in the Carmichael case. A second lawsuit is ongoing. A Korean cab driver in Bethel was shot in the face and survived. The attack marked the third Korean cab driver in Bethel to have been shot or violently assaulted in the last 15 years. As COVID-19 cases resurged across the state, hospital leaders warned of bed shortages in the state’s major hospitals. August The Bethel City Council reinstated its pandemic mask mandate for everyone in public spaces. YKHC mandated COVID-19 vaccinations for employees, and the region hit itshighest infection rate since January 2021. Alaska Native corporations received federal CARES Act funds, and tribes received American Rescue Plan Act funding, infusing millions of dollars into the region. The U.S. Census Bureau released data showing that the Y-K Delta population had grown about 9% in the past decade, making it one of the state’s fastest growing regions. A state judge ruled to protect the Power Cost Equalization Endowment Fund, preventing energy costs from spiking in rural areas. At the end of August, the Pfizer vaccine received full federal approval. September Hospital officials across Alaska warned that the health care system was collapsing. YKHC, along with other Alaska hospitals, reached capacity and activated crisis standards of care. YKHC warned people to avoid all physical risks, including riding ATVs. They could not guarantee adequate health care if someone got hurt. The health corporation had delays in flying critical care patients to urban hospitals because of hospital bed shortage. YKHC began offering COVID-19 booster shots. The Bethel courthouse suspended criminal jury trials due to rising COVID-19 cases. And LKSD encouraged parents to vaccinate their children. The City of Bethelmandated COVID-19 vaccinations for employees. All but six got vaccinated by the deadline. October Bethel elected new city council members, one of whom was Council member Mary “Beth” Hessler. Hessler is the only council member not vaccinated against COVID-19, and the only member to vote against the city mask and testing mandates. Her election marked a break in the council’s unanimous support of pandemic mitigation measures. COVID-19 cases in the region reached their highest levels in 10 months, and YKHC expanded monoclonal antibody treatments to villages. Former Y-K Delta state representative Tony Vaska died from cancer. He left a legacy of advocating for education and protecting subsistence. November Bethel recorded its coldest November in 80 years. The low temperatures triggered an early freeze-up, freezing barges in the river and stranding a group of hunters on the lower Yukon River for a week before a helicopter could reach them.
