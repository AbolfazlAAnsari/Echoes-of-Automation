passed House Bill 298, which would establish the Service Members and Veterans Suicide Prevention Program. This new program would aim to reduce suicide deaths among New Mexico’s service members and veterans by raising awareness of the issue and improving access to suicide prevention, behavioral health, and mental health resources. “New Mexico tragically has one of the highest veteran suicide rates in the nation and I am grateful to the New Mexico Department of Veterans Services for helping our state take action to save lives,” said lead sponsor Representative Eliseo Alcon (D-Milan), a Vietnam Veteran and Bronze Star recipient. “Our veterans have made great personal sacrifices to protect our freedoms and safety as Americans. We owe it to them to have their backs when they go through difficult times.” The Service Members and Veterans Suicide Prevention Program would promote evidence-based best practices to increase awareness among our veterans population about the root causes of suicide and improve the resources available to help them. HB 298 is also sponsored by Rep. Harry Garcia (D-Grants), a U.S. Marine Corps Vietnam Veteran, as well asReps. Tara Jaramillo (D-Socorro) and Alan Martinez (R-Bernalillo). It now heads to the Senate. The Roundhouse is open to the public for the 2024 session. Members of the public can also view floor sessions and committee meetings on the New Mexico Legislature’s Webcasts tab, and provide comment via phone or Zoom as directed on the daily schedule.

The budget bill for the upcoming fiscal year plans for how the state will spend more than $10.2 billion in anticipated revenue and covers nearly 300 pages. Senators on both sides of the aisle lauded the proposal during the floor hearing, with the measure passing 31-10 after less than two hours of debate. “If you ever want a sleepless night, talk about spending $10 billion,” said Senate Finance Committee Chairman George Muñoz, D-Gallup, just before the vote, noting the state has weathered budget deficits in recent decades to come out on the other side this year, with the “highest reserves, the most true reserves the state has ever had.” The proposed budget, which leans heavily on oil gas revenue, sets aside 30% in reserves and allocates $653 million more in recurring spending than the current year’s budget, or about 6.8% more.

It would also allocate $50 million to a new Indian Education Trust Fund, plus positions $19.7 million in services to combat homelessness as well as $22 million for housing; and calls for 3% raises for state employees as well as separate hikes to judicial and State Police pay.

He also noted the budget accounts for contingencies in the event of a drop in the price of oil or natural gas, with nearly $2 billion heading to endowments and expendible trusts. “There are trainloads, and cars and cars of contingency…a mile-long train of how we have set New Mexico up to fight off recessionary pressure and to fight off if there is a decline in those industries,” Muñoz said. Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth, D-Santa Fe, said lawmakers aimed to take “now money and turn it into future money,” adding he was proud that they had accomplished that goal, including $300 million for the Conservation Legacy Fund to create a steady recurring stream of funding for water, outdoor recreation and other projects. Several Democratic senators, including Sen. Gerald Ortiz y Pino, D-Bernalillo, voted in favor of the budget but noted the need for investments now rather than later. “I fully appreciate investing for the future needs in terms of finances, but I also agree that if we spent a little more investing in now, we may not have so many needs in the future,” Ortiz y Pino said. Sen. William Burt, R-Alamogordo, who said he had not voted in favor of a proposed budget in recent years, supported the proposal because, among other reasons, it supports rural hospitals and will “put a big dent” in sorely needed road projects. Albuquerque Sen. William Tallman was the sole Democrat to vote against the proposal. He read a list of ten reasons why, including: a lack of changes in alcohol excise taxes; no action to address GRT pyramidding; no reform to capital outlay processes; no money for an arena in Albuquerque; and too little money for food banks. Sen. Crystal Diamond Brantley, R-Elephant Butte, said she voted no largely because the budget cannot sustain “inevitable downturns,” and did not make “major investments in mental health” or “meaningful tax reductions” for business. Labor leaders lamented the Senate version’s overall salary plan for state workers, which reduced increases in the House version from 4% to 3%. Communications Workers of America 7076 “members are incredibly disappointed with the 1% reduction in the appropriation for State Employee salaries,” reads a statement the union issued immediately after the vote. The House will next consider the Senate’s amendments before the measure can move to the governor’s desk for possible action. The Senate vote comes with two and a half days remaining in the session, which ends Thursday March 15 at noon. Read Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s executive budget recommendations here.

It is also a place where patients can talk to physicians without the fear of any judgment, Bardack said. “The good news is that syphilis is easily treated. If you are caught in the early and secondary stages, it's very easily treated with a well-known antibiotic called penicillin,” Bardack said. In response to increasing rates of syphilis, the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) renewed and updated a public health order in October 2023. The order increases syphilis testing for all pregnant individuals and recommends that all adults aged 18-50 be tested at least once before October 2024. Janine Waters, the STD program manager for the NMDOH, leads a team that monitors syphilis reports and provides STD guidance. “We have a higher rate of syphilis than we've had, as does almost every other state in the country. But the biggest increase we've seen is in congenital syphilis,” Waters said. “Congenital syphilis is definitely impacting New Mexico pretty harshly in our opinion. We're working pretty hard to make sure we can help mitigate that.” Congenital syphilis can cause significant birth defects, miscarriages and infant mortality. 2022 saw a 660% increase in congenital syphilis cases over the past five years, according to the NMDOH. Congenital syphilis can be treated to greatly reduce problems with pregnancy. In 2022, a lack of timely testing and adequate treatment contributed to almost 90% of congenital syphilis cases within the US, according to a report by the CDC. “We just developed a protocol for Doxycycline … You can take that medication after an exposure that you're concerned about and that may help stave off the infection,” Waters said. Taking Doxycycline, an antibiotic, 72 hours after sex can reduce the likelihood of being infected with syphilis by two-thirds, according to a study on people assigned male at birth who have sex with men, funded by the National Institutes of Health. Nationally, 207,255 syphilis cases were reported in 2022 — the greatest number of reported cases since 1950, according to the CDC. The NMDOH has begun several initiatives, in addition to the public health order, that attempt to reduce syphilis cases in New Mexico. One initiative is a media campaign that encourages pregnant individuals to get tested for syphilis, Waters said. The NMDOH also partners with communities with higher syphilis rates. In these communities, rapid syphilis testing is offered at harm reduction sites, Waters said. “In public health, diseases and deficiencies affect minorities more harshly than they do others. So we try to focus on making sure everybody's got access to care,” Waters said. The results of these initiatives remain unclear due to the nature of syphilis. The infection’s discreet symptoms can delay results as many people do not know they have syphilis until they get tested, Waters said. While it is unclear why New Mexico has such an alarming syphilis rate, Waters identified one possible reason. “We are a rural state, and some people have to drive pretty far for health care. If they're not feeling bad, and they're not noticing anything wrong with them, they may not go to the doctor and get tested. It could have something to do with that,” Waters said. Expanding health care access to rural New Mexicans is a goal of the NMDOH, Waters said. “Our message is to get tested. We would like everyone to get a test at least once a year, regardless of what they think their risk is … If you don't test, you don't know,” Waters said.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:09 pm A woman was killed by two off-duty officers after police said she opened fire with an AR-15 rifle that had a sticker with the word ""Palestine"" on it inside celebrity pastor Joel Osteen\'s megachurch in Texas. The 36-year-old woman had on a trenchcoat and a backpack and was accompanied by a young boy when she entered the west side of Lakewood Church just before 2 p.m., Houston Police Chief Troy Finner said in a press conference later that day. The Montgomery County District Attorney\'s Office told Scripps News the suspect was identified as Genesse Ivonne Moreno. Police said the suspect has been known to use multiple names, including the name Jeffery Escalante, but that she has always identified as female. The suspect died at the scene after a shootout with a Houston police officer and an agent of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission who were off-duty at the church. Texas law does not prohibit firearms in religious places of worship. The 7-year-old boy who was with the woman and a 57-year-old man were both wounded, but its unclear whose gunfire struck the two victims. Police said the boy was shot in the head and is in critical condition at a local childrens hospital, but they did not say what relationship the boy had with the shooter. During a separate press conference Monday afternoon, Finner said the 57-year-old victim had been released from the hospital. At some point after she was shot, the woman threatened that she had a bomb, but officers did not find any explosives in her backpack or her vehicle. Finner said the woman was also spraying some type of substance on the ground when she entered the church but they did not specify what it was determined to be. Houston Fire Chief Sam Pena said preliminary testing done at the scene indicated there was no chemical exposure risk to the church attendees at the scene. Its unclear what the shooters motivation was and authorities said they can\'t speculate. However, police later said investigators found ""anti-semitic writings"" in the suspect\'s possessions. Police also said the shooter acted alone and is not believed to be a part of a bigger group. In addition to the AR-15 the suspect fired inside the church, another .22-caliber rifle was recovered from the shooter\'s bag at the scene, police said. Investigators also said there had been an ongoing dispute between the suspect and her ex-husband and ex-husband\'s family, who are Jewish. Criminal records show the suspect had faced several charges in the past, including assault of a public servant, assault causing bodily injury, forgery, evading arrest and unlawful carrying of a weapon. Police said she also has a history of mental health issues, according to her family. The FBI is assisting with the ongoing investigation, but the Houston Police Department is the lead on the case. During Sunday\'s news conference, Osteen said his congregation was devastated and that he would pray for the victims, suspect and their families. It was not clear where he was at the time of the shooting or how many attendees were in the church at the time.Were going to stay strong and were going to continue to move forward, he said. There are forces of evil, but the forces that are for us the forces of God are stronger than that. So were going to keep going strong and just, you know, doing what Gods called us to do: lift people up and give hope to the world.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a statement saying our hearts are with those impacted by todays tragic shooting and the entire Lakewood Church community in Houston. Places of worship are sacred.Osteens church is the third-largest megachurch in the U.S. with 45,000 regular attendees each week, according to the Hartford Institute for Religion Research. The enormous building was previously an arena for the NBAs Houston Rockets and has a 16,000-person capacity. Log In Post a comment as Guest Keep it Clean.

For the latest news on the conflict in the Middle East, view our live updates file for Thursday, Feb. 9. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken offered contrasting reactions Wednesday to Hamas\' counter after the latest proposal for a cease-fire in Gaza, reflecting their divergent approaches. At a nationally televised news conference after the two met, Netanyahu emphasized Israel\'s battleground successes and said, ""We are on the way to an absolute victory” over Hamas in a matter of months. “There is no other solution.” He also said of the militant group\'s proposal: “Surrendering to Hamas’ delusional demands that we heard now not only won’t lead to freeing the captives, it will just invite another massacre.” In a separate news briefing as he concluded his fifth Middle East visit since October, Blinken said a deal could still be worked out. ""While there are some clear non-starters in Hamas\' response, we do think it creates space for agreement to be reached, and we will work at that relentlessly until we get there,\'\' he said. Hamas proposed a 135-day cease-fire plan that would include the release of the remaining hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and an end to a war that has killed tens of thousands and left the enclave in ruins. The Hamas offer would not require a permanent cease-fire at the outset of the deal but calls for one before the last batch of hostages are released. Female hostages, males under 19, the elderly and sick would be freed during the first 45-day phase, along with Palestinian women and children. Hamas response to cease-fire plan: Seen as \'positive\' and \'over the top\' Developments: ∎ Hamas wants the deal guaranteed and overseen by Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, Russia and the United Nations − but not the U.S. Hamas official Osama Hamdan said a delegation will travel to Cairo for more talks. ∎ Former hostages expressed concern that Netanyahu\'s hard-line stance would doom the 100-plus living captives still held in Gaza. “If you continue in this approach of seeking the collapse of Hamas, there won’t be any hostages to free,” said Adina Moshe, who was freed during a November truce. ∎ Israel announced the death of two more of its soldiers in Gaza, raising the total of slain troops in the ground offensive to 227. The U.S. military killed a senior militia commander it says was responsible for planning and participating in attacks on American service members in the Middle East. The strike in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, which killed a Kata’ib Hezbollah leader, came after the U.S. struck 85 sites in Iraq and Syria last week in retaliation for an attack that killed three U.S. soldiers on Jan. 28. Iraqi leaders formally protested those strikes and said they resulted in some civilian casualties. Wednesday’s strike is the latest in what the Pentagon and White House have said will be a continuing effort to deter Iranian-backed militias from attacking U.S. troops in the region, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly. The Associated Press reported the commander, whom it identified as Wissam Muhammad Sabir Al-Saadi − known as Abu Baqir Al-Saadi − may have been one of three people killed in the strike. A statement from U.S. Central Command only mentioned one fatality and said no civilians were harmed. − Tom Vanden Brook Blinken met with Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog Wednesday, four months to the day after a Hamas-led assault on Israeli border communities ignited the conflict. Blinken acknowledged ""a lot of work"" must be done to close the gap between the demands of each side, including Netanyahu\'s insistence that Israeli forces oversee security in Gaza after the war. Israel\'s Channel 13 reported there\'s a debate within the government over whether to reject the Hamas plan outright or enter into negotiations. “There are so many innocent men, women and children who are suffering as a result of the attacks perpetrated by Hamas, and now being caught in a crossfire of Hamas’s making,” Blinken said. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Wednesday he is ""especially alarmed"" by reports the Israeli military is planning a full-scale invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah, which has seen its population swell as refugees flee the fighting in northern Gaza. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said this week that Rafah, months ago a city of 280,000 that now houses more than 1 million Palestinians, is the last remaining Hamas stronghold. The Israeli military is reportedly considering an evacuation order that would send residents to northern Gaza, which has been devastated by Israeli military actions there, ahead of a major assault on Rafah. ""Such an action would exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare with untold regional consequences,"" Guterres said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly. President Joe Biden’s campaign events in New York City on Wednesday were expected to draw protests over his handling of the war in Gaza. Although his schedule didn’t provide locations, streets are reportedly expected to close in parts of Manhattan’s Upper East and Upper West sides for his visit. Several organizations opposed to Israel’s months-long war have announced protest plans. “We know that New Yorkers do NOT want our tax dollars bankrolling Israel’s war crimes,” said a social media post from the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. “Let’s make sure he hears it.” New York has seen numerous high-profile demonstrations at venues from Grand Central Terminal to the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. − Eduardo Cuevas The Hamas plan comes in response to the latest round of talks brokered by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt. The militant group issued a statement thanking Egypt, Qatar and ""all countries that seek to stop the brutal aggression"" against Palestinians but did not name the U.S., Israel\'s strongest ally. The response came after consultation among the Hamas leadership and other ""resistance factions"" in the region, the statement said. ""The movement dealt with the proposal in a positive spirit to ensure a comprehensive and complete cease-fire, end the aggression against our people, in a manner that guarantees relief, accommodation, reconstruction, lifting the siege on the Gaza Strip and completing an exchange of prisoners,"" the statement said. Avi Melamed, former Israeli intelligence official and author of “Inside The Middle East: Entering A New Era,” said the proposal is ""unsignable"" for Israel but does indicate Hamas is willing to negotiate. The goal of the offer, he said in an email to USA TODAY, is to ""deepen the crisis in Israeli public opinion on hostage negotiations"" and to halt the Israeli military\'s momentum in Gaza. Melamed said Hamas leaders still plan to regain the level of control they had in Gaza before the war began, despite Netanyahu\'s pledge to crush them. Israel and the U.S. will continue ""fighting the war as if there are no negotiations, and negotiating as if there is no war, which has been a hallmark of the Israeli response to Oct. 7,"" Melamed wrote. The first phase of the Hamas plan would require a pause in fighting, with Israel repositioning its military forces away from high-population areas in Gaza. In exchange for the release of some hostages, Israel would free 1,500 Palestinians, including 500 selected by Hamas that may be serving life sentences for terror-related activities. The flow of humanitarian aid to the enclave would be drastically increased, and reconstruction of hospitals, homes and other crucial buildings would begin. Gazans ordered out of their homes by Israeli forces ahead of military assaults would be allowed to return. Talks aimed at a permanent end to the war also would begin. Some details of the second phase of the Hamas plan would be negotiated during the first phase. But the second phase would require a completion of talks resulting in an end to the war and the release of the rest of the hostages in exchange for a ""certain number"" of Palestinians held in Israeli jails. That likely would mean freeing thousands of Palestinians. Israel would remove all its troops from Gaza and reconstruction of the enclave would be stepped up. In the third stage, the two sides would exchange the bodies of those killed in the war, and the influx of humanitarian aid into Gaza and its reconstruction would continue. Events marking four months since the war began were held Wednesday in Jerusalem, London, Paris and elsewhere. The conflict started Oct. 7, when Hamas-led militants crashed across the border on a killing spree that left 1,200 people dead in Israeli border communities.
