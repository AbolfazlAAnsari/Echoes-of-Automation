The latest innovation from a local smart traffic technology firm is looking to make these maneuvers safer and more sensible. They have deployed intelligent left turn technology in Peachtree Corners and the results, so far, have been sizable. “You pull into a pocket, which is that little place on the side of the road where you wait for the opposing traffic. You see a gap in the opposing traffic coming 70 miles per hour towards you, you move across and drive into the subdivision or parking lot or wherever it is. If all goes well, great stuff. If all goes badly - a huge crash - because of the high speeds of the approaching vehicles,” Applied Information president Bryan Mulligan explained to the AJC and 95.5 WSB. “[The intelligent left turn] uses a detector to pick up the trajectory of the cars that are approaching and provides you information - flashing lights - when it is unsafe to go across.” Mulligan’s mantra is relatable: traffic systems have remained largely unchanged for a century and simple nudges and tweaks can make the roads much safer and more efficient. Mulligan’s Applied Information and tech incubator iATL, based in Alpharetta, partner with the public and private sectors to implement these systems. In Marietta, for example, smart traffic technology turns traffic lights green for firetrucks. This has decreased firetruck crashes to zero in the six years since installing it, Mulligan said. Applied Information also has helped outfit buses in some school systems that communicate with smart cars, to tell the cars when they are planning to stop. The beacons help warn drivers to slow down or prompt autonomous cars to do that on their own. Intelligent left turns work in the same manner, Brandon Branham, Peachtree Corners Assistant City Manager, said. The Gwinnett County suburb has been one of the more forward-leaning, tech-friendly cities in Metro Atlanta, given its Curiosity Lab off of Peachtree Industrial Boulevard. The city installed this system on the Peachtree Industrial/southbound left turn into the NAPA Auto Parts store on Business Park Drive. This is fittingly just north of the Curiosity Lab’s home on Technology Parkway, which has its own smart signal at a blind, three-way stop at Engineering Drive. “It’ll tell you that it is unsafe, based on the algorithm, to turn left. You can still turn left, if you want to. But we are just giving you some notification that it may not be the safest time to turn left,” Branham said in promotional material about the technology. Does that not speak to human nature? Sometimes a driver is on the fence about whether to risk that left turn. Maybe their decision is simply influenced by how long they have waited and not how safe turning is. They need a better prompt from something objective. The Peachtree Industrial signal, Branham said, “Saw upwards of six car crashes annually. Since piloting this technology, police reports have shown a 25% decrease.” Preventing a crash or two per year does not sound like much, but that certainly matters to the people in those crashes and the countless others inconvenienced by them. And that is in just one intersection. Imagine if one crash per year was prevented at a city’s ten worst intersections. Extrapolate that over ten cities. And these are just small changes.

Give today! Jacob Fischler | Georgia Recorder December 8th, 2023 Former members of Congress are deeply concerned about political violence ahead of the 2024 presidential election, former Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama and former Rep. Barbara Comstock of Virginia said at a Thursday joint appearance sponsored by the liberal Center for American Progress and the nonpartisan McCain Institute. Jones, a moderate Democrat who lost reelection in 2020, and Comstock, a moderate Republican who was defeated in 2018, said increased acceptance of political violence is seen across the political spectrum. But they laid much of the blame on former President Donald Trump and his supporters. An October poll from the Public Religion Research Institute, a Washington-based independent research organization, found that 23% of respondents believe that “because things have gotten so far off track, true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country.” That represented an increase from 15% in 2021 and was the first poll in the eight times the group has asked that question in which support has risen above 20%. One-third of Republicans and 46% of people who believe the 2020 election was stolen from Trump agreed with the statement. Comstock noted that antisemitism on some elite college campuses also represented a disturbing trend and Jones described a growing acceptance of violence “across the board.” The country “seems to be splitting down the middle” politically, with each side believing the other is a threat to democracy, Jones said. “They’re willing to accept some violence to protect” democracy, he said. “Trying to bridge that, between those two camps who would take up arms against each other for vastly different reasons but all in the name of saving democracy, really is, I think, a road to disaster, potentially.” But they suggested the most direct and intentional threats appear to be coming from Trump and the movement he leads. Jones, who was a U.S. attorney who prosecuted cases involving anti-Black violence before his election to the Senate, said there are politicians who continue to use “dog whistles,” or coded language their supporters understand as endorsements of violence. Some leaders who use passionate rhetoric don’t necessarily mean to inspire violence, he said. But others do so intentionally, he added, making an indirect but unmistakable reference to Trump. “Look, I believe there are some in this — who will go unnamed, but initials are D.T. — (who) have an intent,” Jones said. “I think they’ve had it before. They know exactly what they’re saying. “How do we look at that?” he continued. “How do we talk when you’ve got political leaders that are out there who are literally calling for the execution of a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who are calling their political opponents vermin that needs to be exterminated? That is a clear signal to folks.” Trump used that language at a New Hampshire rally last month. “We pledge to you that we will root out the communists, Marxists, fascists, and the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country,” he said. Trump’s unfounded claims of election fraud, which inspired the attempt to stop the peaceful transition of presidential power in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, were a major driver of political division, Comstock, who opposed Trump in 2016, said. Close legislative elections in Virginia this year did not inspire the same backlash as Trump’s 2020 reelection loss, she said, crediting Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and the chairs of each state party for publicly accepting the election results and “not feeding into that paranoia.” “Surprise: When Donald Trump’s not on the ballot, the voting all goes really securely and safely,” she said. Jones and Comstock cited a recent survey conducted by the University of Massachusetts for the U.S. Association of Former Members of Congress showing that 84% of former members surveyed are concerned about the possibility of violence related to the presidential election. Nearly half of the almost 300 respondents in the poll said they or their families received threats at least somewhat frequently while they were in office. Women and lawmakers of color reported higher instances, with 69% saying they’d experienced threats at least somewhat frequently. And the problem may be worse for local government officials who lack the security available to members of Congress, Jones and Comstock said. Comstock praised Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Gov. Brian Kemp, both Republicans, for “standing up” for frontline elections workers who received threats and abuse from Trump supporters after the 2020 election. Maricopa County, Arizona, Supervisor Bill Gates did not receive the same support from Republicans in his state as he faced abuse in the wake of election losses by Trump and Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake, Comstock said. “He’s just this local supervisor who doesn’t have the protections that we had in Congress and the Capitol Police,” she said. “So this was just a very abusive process.” Gates and Raffensperger should be considered “heroes who are on the front lines” of defending democracy, Comstock said. State and local elections officials have said they are having difficulty retaining and recruiting workers, as the people in those nonpolitical jobs have faced increased abuse from partisans.

unite. Give today! Associated Press | AP October 17th, 2023 They range from babies to the elderly. Most are civilians. Israel says at least 199 people taken during the Hamas attack are being held captive in Gaza. Some of their families received frantic phone calls or texts during the attack. Others heard nothing and later saw video evidence their loved ones were taken. For now, they wait, desperate to find out whether the hostages are even alive. And they tell their stories. Here are some of them. Judith and Natalie Raanan Judith Raanan and her teenage daughter, Natalie Raanan, were excited to travel to Israel to celebrate a relative’s 85th birthday and the Jewish holiday season, according to their rabbi. The pair had been sending updates as the trip progressed and were enjoying “this really special mom and daughter time together,” Meir Hecht said. The family hasn’t heard from either mother or daughter since a week ago, after Hamas launched an unprecedented surprise attack. The community in their suburb north of Chicago fears they are among roughly 150 people abducted by Hamas militants. “We received this terrible news that Judith and her daughter Natalie are missing and apparently were most likely taken as hostages to Gaza,” Hecht said. “It feels like our community has been violated.” They had been celebrating Simchat Torah, a festive Jewish holiday that marks the conclusion of the annual reading of the Torah. They were in Nahal Oz, a kibbutz in Israel about a mile (1.61 kilometers) from the Gaza border. Natalie Raanan, 17, recently graduated from high school and was looking forward to taking a break and visiting family overseas, her uncle, Avi Zamir, said at a community event for the Raanans in Evanston on Thursday evening. “Kind person. She’s a sweetheart. She loves animals,” Zamir said. “We fear for her. We pray for her. We hope she’s together with her mom.” Through tears, Natalie Raanan’s aunt, Sigal Zamir, said: “I pray for them to come back alive. They’re innocent and loving, and they didn’t do anything.” Just before she left for Israel, Judith Raanan dropped off a pink prayer book for the Hechts’ 7-year-old daughter, who loves the color, said Yehudis Hecht, the rabbi’s wife and Judith’s friend. “Judith, we’re thinking of you. Of your resilience, your hope, your love, your generosity, your faith and strength,” Yehudis Hecht said. “We know you’re a strong woman and we pray that we see you safely very soon with your dear Natalie.” —Melissa Perez Winder and Claire SavageYAFFA ADAR Yaffa Adar loved reading, writing and keeping connected. Even at 85 she often sent her family messages and GIFs on WhatsApp. She was active on Facebook, her granddaughter recalls. Keeping in close touch online became especially important in recent years as she found it harder to walk beyond her home in Nir Oz, a kibbutz near the Gaza Strip. Amid that physical struggle, she kept her mind busy and knew what she wanted, her granddaughter said. “She loved reading,” Adva Adar recalled. “So we were like, ”We’re going to get you a Kindle.” What did her grandmother say? “‘No, I like the smell of the paper in books.’” So when Hamas’ Oct. 7 massacre at Nir Oz ended and no one could find Adar, her family worried. That concern turned to horror when video surfaced showing her being driven in a golf cart in Gaza, wrapped in a pink-flowered blanket. The footage was among the first evidence that Hamas fighters had not only killed Israelis — more than 1,400, the vast majority civilians — but had dragged dozens back to Gaza regardless of age in the most complex hostage crisis the country has ever faced. Some people speculated that Yaffa Adar’s unflinching demeanor in the video perhaps meant she didn’t understand what was happening. Not her family, which includes three children, eight grandchildren and seven great-grandkids. “She absolutely knew what was going on around her. She wasn’t going to panic,” her granddaughter said. What’s frightening now is that her grandmother doesn’t have her medication for blood pressure and chronic pain. “She was really the glue of our family. She loved her life,” Adva Adar recalls. “She liked good food and she liked good wine. She was very young-minded.” – Laurie Kellman Roni Eshel Roni Eshel, a 19-year-old Israel Defense Forces soldier, was stationed at a military base near the Gaza border when Hamas attacked last Saturday. Although she didn’t answer her phone when her mother called to check on her that morning, she later texted to say that she was busy but OK. “I love you so much,” Eschel told her mother, Sharon, about three hours after the attack started. Her parents haven’t heard from her since. More than a week later, Eshel’s family is desperate to know happened to their daughter. Her father, Eyal Eshel, describes the wait for news as “hell.” “I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to think, actually. Where is she? What is she eating? If it’s cold for her? If it’s hot? I don’t know nothing,” Eyal Eshel said. The IDF hasn’t publicly released any names of hostages. Her father says IDF has told them she is considered missing; he believes she has been kidnapped. “Otherwise, where is she?” he asked. Eshel grew up in a small village north of Tel Aviv. She reported for military service two weeks after finishing school. She was three months into her second year of mandatory military service. “It’s part of our life here in Israel,” her father says. Roni Eshel was in a communications unit at a base near Nahal Oz. She had returned to the base from a brief vacation on the Wednesday before the attack. Eshel was proud to be a third generation of her family to join the Israeli military. Her father, uncle and grandfather also served. “She was very happy to serve the country,” her father said. Her father said she has planned to travel and enroll in a university after completing her two years of service. But he can’t think about her future while she’s missing. Eyal Eschel says he isn’t sleeping, eating or working while he waits. “I’m not ashamed to ask (for) help. Please help us,” he said. —Michael Kunzelman Maya and Itay Regav “Mom, I’ll unpack my suitcase when I get back,” Maya Regev told her mother that Friday night, in a rush to get going. “See you tomorrow.” And within a half-hour of returning to Israel from a family trip overseas, 21-year-old Maya and her brother Itay, 18, were on their way to the Tribe of Nova music festival, planning to dance the night away.

Maya had already bought her ticket for an extended trip to South America in December. But early the next morning, Ilan Regev’s phone rang. It was a frantic Maya. “Dad, they shot me, they shot me!” she screamed in a recording the family has released. “He is killing us, Dad, he is killing us.” Her father begged her to send her location, to find a place to hide. “I’m coming,” he said. Ilan Regev jumped in his car from his home in Herzliya, near Tel Aviv, and sped south to the festival site, where he was barred from entering. Soon, the Regev family discovered a Hamas video that showed Itay in captivity in Gaza. Maya was not pictured, but the army has told the family both were hostages in Gaza. Officials gave no further information. “I want to know that my kids are alive,” said Ilan Regev Added their mother: “We don’t know if they are eating. We don’t know if they are drinking. If they are hurt.” — Jocelyn Noveck Hersh Goldberg-Polin His mother describes Hersh Goldberg-Polin as like a lot of other young people. The 23-year-old from Jerusalem loves music, wants to see the world and, now that he’s finished his military service, has plans to go to university, his family says. But first he has to come home. Goldberg-Polin was last seen on Oct. 7, when Hamas militants loaded him into the back of a pickup with other hostages abducted from the music festival where at least 260 people were killed.
