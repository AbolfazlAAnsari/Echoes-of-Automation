Even by public health standards, expecting people to abstain from sex during a global pandemic is a big ask. Two weeks after Gov. Kate Brown issued a statewide stay-at-home order in March 2020, the Oregon Health Authority took to Twitter, offering guidance on “sex in the time of COVID-19.” OHA’s tips were as follows — masturbate, use toys and connect with others using virtual platforms. Use protection, and wash hands with soap and water before and after sex for at least 20 seconds. No kissing or rimming. Tim Menza, medical director for OHA’s HIV/STD/TB section, says much of the initial guidance is still relevant. “We think that sexual health is indeed a part of health, and things like touch and intimacy are important parts of our wellbeing, and a lot of people are missing the physical and emotional benefits of sex,” he says. “We’ve encouraged ways for Oregonians to connect sexually with themselves, right, with the understanding that we are our safest sex partners as individuals.” In addition to consent, personal preferences, boundaries and STIs, Menza says pre-sex conversations expanded to COVID precautions and social bubbles, and it’s best to err on the side of being open and honest. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) become sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) when they become symptomatic.

He attached a cellphone picture of three cougar cubs—dead. Police investigators believe Hollings, a stocky, full-bearded 36-year-old, shot the cubs in Oregon’s Central Coast Range, driving back from his job with a Philomath logging company. It wasn’t his first time killing cougars, which Oregonians can legally hunt under specific circumstances. It wasn’t even his first that month. Oregon is home to some of North America’s most magnificent wildlife, including wolves, black bears, and Roosevelt elk, named after the 26th president. In his 1893 book, The Wilderness Hunter, Theodore Roosevelt described elk as “lordly, antlered beasts” that are “perhaps the most majestic-looking of all the animal creation.” More than a century later, conservationists and outdoors enthusiasts agree that the large mammals that roam Oregon’s mountains and forests are the state’s treasure—one of our last connections to wilderness. For Hollings, they were dinner. But the meals weren’t always tasty. “This cougar is bland as fuck,” he texted a hunting buddy and co-defendant in January 2019. “Should have had it with taters.” Last year, Willy Hollings—born William Huet Hollings IV—was snared in what may be Oregon’s largest poaching bust since state lawmakers passed a package of laws in 2019 that changed the crime of poaching from a misdemeanor to a felony. To Portlanders, this might seem an obscure problem. Hollings and friends weren’t doing what a layperson might more commonly associate with poaching, like selling bear gallbladders on the black market, importing exotic animal parts from overseas, or leaving kills to rot in the woods. But they weren’t playing by the rules. For at least a year, prosecutors allege, Hollings and his friends Nicholas Lisenby and Eric Hamilton went on a poaching spree through the forests of at least four Oregon counties, killing more than 30 big game animals, including elk, cougars, mule deer, bears and bobcats. Investigators say the trio exceeded their tag limits, hunted animals that were too young, killed others when they were out of season and, in some instances, hunted in the dark using spotlights. The scope of their alleged activities spanned hundreds of miles. So far, prosecutors in Lincoln, Benton, Linn and Polk counties have filed more than 40 counts of poaching-related charges against the crew collectively. So far, the defendants have pleaded guilty to or been convicted on 13 counts. Two more cases, one each for Lisenby and Hamilton, remain open. Sgt. Jim Andrews of the Oregon State Police Fish & Wildlife Division, who led the state’s investigation, says Hamilton and Lisenby grew up hunting and, to some extent, viewed their poaching as a means to feed their families. “But then it morphed into something more with Hollings to the point where it almost seemed like he was feeding an addiction,” Andrews says. The seeds of Hollings’ obsession sprouted in text messages with his buddies. Those digital missives would become the central evidence in the state’s cases against him and the two others. From at least December 2018 to March 2019, search warrant affidavits show, Hollings and his pals exchanged hunting advice via text messages. They discussed which guns and scopes worked best for long-range shooting, sought contact information for an “under the radar” taxidermist, and made appointments for elk hunts. They shared so many photos of kills that Hollings’ girlfriend later told police she lost track of which man had bagged what. On Jan. 19, 2019, Hollings and Lisenby exchanged approximately 100 messages. Near the end of the string, Lisenby asked Hollings if he planned to go hunting in Alsea, Ore. Hollings replied: “Yep. Probably next week. Then black rock”—a mountainous area near Falls City. Seconds later, Hollings added one final thought: “Things will die.” To understand why Hollings’ actions so trouble Oregon law enforcement, you have to go back 109 years. The snow was nearly 4 feet deep in the Wallowa Valley on March 14, 1912. It was Thursday—a school day—but class was not in session. Businesses had shut down for the day. An estimated 10,000 spectators gathered at train stations across the region, hoping to catch a glimpse of history passing by: the arrival of 15 elk being shipped by train from Jackson Hole, Wyo., to restore Oregon’s elk population. The elks’ arrival signaled the revival of Oregon’s ecosystem. By 1900, “America’s elk teetered on the brink of extinction” because of lax hunting regulations and the commercial sale of elk parts, namely teeth and tongues, writes author Mark Highberger in The Elk Killers. (Elk tongues were considered a delicacy. Roosevelt, in his 1885 book, Hunting Trips of a Ranchman, called them the “most delicious eating, being juicy, tender, and well flavored.”) News of the decimated population sparked public outrage. It prompted an outright ban on elk hunting in Oregon, which lasted for decades until the population recovered. The Jackson Hole elks’ arrival in 1912 may seem eons ago. But poaching is an ongoing problem today. It’s also a crime that’s uniquely difficult to detect, often occurring in very rural areas with few witnesses. “The victims obviously cannot speak up for themselves,” says Sristi Kamal of Defenders of Wildlife. “And then evidence—including the victim—is easy to hide or dispose [of].” Without the ability to enforce poaching regulations, the state’s wildlife populations risk a repeat of the early 20th century. “We’ve seen what could happen,” says Curt Melcher, director of the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, “and that happened back in the late 1800s and early 1900s, when essentially elk were all but extirpated from Oregon. And the same is true and would be true with other species.” Anti-poaching officials will tell you the state’s wildlife belongs to everyone who resides here, meaning poachers are stealing from even the least outdoorsy among us. And poaching affects the Portland metro area, too, particularly birds, including bald eagles and red-tailed hawks. In 2019, Oregon State Police tallied 324 instances of illegal killing of big game animals. In 2020, as many Oregonians found themselves with idle hands amid a pandemic, that number increased to 417. Those are the illegal animal killings that OSP can confirm. State researchers and police say the actual figures are likely much higher. Investigators and lobbyists say compulsion to kill big game animals—with no financial incentive—is an increasingly common motive for poachers. “In the past five years, we’re starting to see a lot more illegal take that is, to be blunt, more of a thrill-kill model where the animal is just shot and left—almost like people are doing live target shooting,” says Steve Hagan, vice president of the Oregon Hunters Association, a lobbying group. “For them, this criminal activity is their version of a drug.” The Oregon State Police’s recipe for catching poachers often starts with hauling a taxidermied deer into the woods, then waiting for somebody to shoot at it. During a tour of the agency’s Astoria office, OSP Fish & Wildlife Sgt. Joe Warwick unlocks an exterior door to reveal a windowless room. Inside: one massive taxidermied elk on the floor to the left of the door, and four taxidermied black tail deer hanging on the wall two by two, like a macabre display of Santa’s reindeer. These mounted “decoys,” as OSP calls them, are illegally slain animals the agency recovered during poaching investigations. They’re taxidermied for the specific purpose of catching poachers. (Oregon law does not distinguish between shooting at a live animal versus a decoy.) Warwick says the decoys are stuffed with foam, and the bigger ones—like the elk—weigh about 80 pounds. When it rains? Add another 30. “It’s kind of a pain. You gotta carry this thing out into a clear-cut during the day,” Warwick says. “In fact, we had a trooper get a compound fracture last year carrying the elk decoy through a clear-cut. I guess that’s one of the dangers of the job.” Poaching was classified as a class A misdemeanor in Oregon, which is punishable by up to 364 days in jail and a $6,250 fine. But in 2019, authorities busted a father-son duo from Longview, Wash., who led a poaching ring that killed dozens of big game animals and led to nearly 200 counts of poaching-related charges in Oregon and Washington courts. “This was an organized killing spree,” testified Paul Donheffner, legislative committee chair for the Oregon Hunters Association, during the 2019 session. “They weren’t hunting. They were out to destroy our wildlife.” That case was part of the reason the Legislature in 2019 passed a pair of anti-poaching bills. House Bills 3035 and 3087, co-sponsored by Reps. Ken Helm (D-Washington County) and Brad Witt (D-Clatskanie), changed poaching from a misdemeanor to a felony if the poacher is found to have a “culpable mental state” or if the acts were committed “intentionally, knowingly or recklessly.” That means a maximum five-year prison sentence and a $125,000 fine.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:27 pm Neah-Kah-Nie School District Neah-Kah-Nie School District was one of 11 school districts to receive an Oregon School-Based Health Center Grant. This the second year of the grant. The school district hopes for the center to be open by the beginning of next school year. According to Oregon Health Authority, School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) are a unique health care model for comprehensive physical, mental and preventative health services provided to youth and adolescents either within a school or on school property. Each health center is staffed by a primary care professional who may be a doctor, nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant, other medical or mental health professionals and support staff, such as a receptionist. The future site of the health center would be Neah-Kah-Nie High School, which is co-located with Neah-Kah-Nie Middle School on a shared campus. The center would be available for all five schools in the district and would be centrally located. There is space available in the high school, part of which is near the entrance to the school, allowing easy access to families and community members for community health events. Neah-Kah-Nie School District Superintendent Paul Erlebach said the school district received the competitive grant last year. Gail Nelson, CEO of Rinehart Clinic, had experience with a health-based center in a previous job and helped write the grant. Last year was Phase 1 of the project, this year is Phase 2, and Phase 3 will be completed next year. The school district had to complete a needs assessment the first year of the grant, during Phase 1, Erlebach said. “We talked with students, parents and staff and determined there was a need,” Erlebach said. “We looked at all locations throughout the district to find out where the best locations would be and where we could serve the most students.” Erlebach said he has been to three School-Based Health Centers, which helped him understand the purpose of what the center does: improve access to health for all students. Not every student’s parents can take students to the doctor. The School-Based Health Center needs a medical sponsor. This sponsor provides the health service, while the school district provides the location. The sponsor also develops specific billing policies and practices, said Jonathan Modie, lead communications officer for Oregon Health Authority. “No student will be turned away for lack of ability to pay,” Modie said. “Oregon-certified SBHCs are required to bill Medicaid, and most will also bill private insurers if the student has insurance.” Types of services provided by SBHCs include well-child exams; sick visits; minor injury treatment; vision, dental and other health screenings; immunizations; substance use disorder screening and assessment; mental health counseling; reproductive health services; prevention and wellness messaging; and health-related classroom presentations. Phase 2 of the project is a grant used for renovation purposes and construction projects. Some office space will be renovated at the high school. “Primarily, we need a reception area, an exam room, a lab and a bathroom, and an office,” Erlebach said. “We’re working with an architect to design this phase.” Neah-Kah-Nie School District is looking to put together a School-Based Health Center Advisory Committee, who would help make decisions in the construction planning process. The committee includes students, staff, school board members and others. The advisory committee would also develop a mission statement, a timeline, and make necessary decisions. They may also seek additional funding. Those interested in joining the committee should contact Paul Erlebach at paule@nksd.org or call 503-355-3501 for more information and for an application.

You might think it’s pistol-packing, Trump-loving talk radio host Lars Larson. Or Baker City Mayor Kerry McQuisten, whose opposition to mask and vaccine mandates is stoking her run for governor. You’d be wrong. Instead, the loudest voice may be that of a Toyota-driving Bernie Bro who lives near Lewis & Clark College, an evolutionary biologist with a Ph.D. who studied and taught at two of the nation’s most liberal universities and participated in Occupy Wall Street. His name is Bret Weinstein, and he makes his living preaching the dangers of COVID-19 vaccines while extolling ivermectin, the controversial drug often used to deworm horses. Weinstein, 52, is one of the foremost proponents of ivermectin. He’s appeared on Tucker Carlson’s show to flog the drug. He and his wife, Heather Heying, also a Ph.D. biologist, went on Real Time With Bill Maher in January, an appearance that boosted interest in their DarkHorse Podcast, which has 382,000 subscribers on YouTube alone. Weinstein’s biggest fan is probably Joe Rogan, host of the most popular podcast in the U.S. Weinstein appeared with Rogan four times, including a June 2020 show that’s gotten almost 8 million views on YouTube. In June 2021, it turned into a lovefest. “Your podcast is one of my very favorites,” Rogan said. “I listen to it or watch it all the time. It’s an amazing source of rational thinking by educated people who talk about things they understand, which is exactly the opposite of what I do!” Now, because of people like Weinstein, a drug meant for 1,000-pound animals is flying off the shelves in feed stores not just in red states, but even in Multnomah County, where the vaccination rate is approaching 80%. Tyler Blach, a sales associate at Linnton Feed & Seed just west of the St. Johns Bridge, says the store has no more of the paste form—flavored with apple—that’s used for horses and has proven popular with vaccine-skeptical humans. “Before this, I can’t recall a time when we were out,” Blach says. Weinstein, 52, is no dummy. He has a Ph.D. in biology from the University of Michigan and, until recently, held a tenured professorship. Weinstein declined to be interviewed for this story, saying he would not be treated fairly. But Weinstein and Heying reveal much in their prolific writing and podcasting, where talk about minutiae goes hand in hand with postulating megatrends. Weinstein, for example, would fit in well with much of Portland. He is gluten intolerant and a keen cyclist. He has a bike helmet that plays music. Heying loves paddle-boarding on the Willamette and watching wildlife. In an April piece for the online outlet called UnHerd, Weinstein said he and Heying considered cities around the world before choosing Portland for its “proximity to nature and its world-class food culture.” But unlike most of their fellow residents in Multnomah County, both say they are not vaccinated. Instead, they protect themselves from COVID by eating whole foods from farmers markets and by taking weekly doses of ivermectin, along with vitamins C and D, and zinc. Interviews with Weinstein’s former colleagues and a review of his work—starting with an explosive op-ed in his college newspaper—draw a picture of Weinstein as a tilter at windmills, someone who for much of his career has challenged authority and is now trafficking in what many medical experts and scientists say are false and dangerous theories about COVID. “Bret Weinstein is one of the foremost purveyors of COVID-19 disinformation out there,” says Dr. David Gorski, a surgical oncologist and professor at Wayne State University who also debunks quack remedies as managing editor at a website called Science-Based Medicine. “Weinstein can be ‘credited’ with playing a large role in popularizing the belief that ivermectin is a miracle cure or preventative for COVID-19, that the vaccines are dangerous, and that the disease itself is not. Why are Rogan and Maher attracted to his messages? Contrarians and conspiracy theorists tend to be attracted to each other.” Gorski says ivermectin is the new hydroxychloroquine, a malaria treatment pushed by former President Donald Trump and later proven worthless. Nancy Koppelman, a former colleague of his at the Evergreen State College in Olympia, thinks Weinstein hasn’t done the work required to make broad claims about COVID and ivermectin but is instead just raising doubts based on dubious information—and monetizing the fear and ignorance of his audience. Koppelman says he’s a modern-day P.T. Barnum. “What Barnum did was fool people into thinking that they were making sound judgments,” Koppelman says. “Bret is pandering to a principle of skepticism, but the substance is not there.” Weinstein is correct that ivermectin is a miracle drug, just not for COVID. In 1970, a microbiologist named Satoshi Omura took a soil sample near a golf course in Japan and coaxed a previously unknown species of bacteria from it. After a decade of research, Merck & Co. marketed ivermectin as a treatment for roundworm in animals. It was approved for use in humans in 1988 and became the go-to treatment for onchocerciasis, or river blindness, a terrible disease caused by a parasitic worm commonly found in the rivers of Africa. Ivermectin became a blockbuster. Omura and a Merck scientist shared a Nobel Prize for their discovery in 2015. The idea that ivermectin might be used to prevent or cure COVID-19 appears to have started with a 2020 study in Australia, where researchers exposed the coronavirus to ivermectin in a petri dish and stopped it from multiplying. Seeing that study and others, Weinstein, who had been following COVID closely on his podcast, went all in. “I am unvaccinated, but I am on prophylactic ivermectin,” Weinstein said on his podcast in June. “And the data—shocking as this will be to some people—suggest that prophylactic ivermectin is something like 100% effective at preventing people from contracting COVID when taken properly.” Weinstein likes ivermectin, he says, because it has a stellar safety record (it does) and it’s cheap (it is, at about $5 a pill). Vaccines, meantime, are the opposite. They aren’t proven to be safe yet, Weinstein says, and they’re more expensive (for the governments who purchase them). Weinstein prides himself on being an iconoclast. He calls DarkHorse “a show for curious minds and freethinkers.” On COVID and ivermectin, he is definitely bucking the establishment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization have endorsed use of the COVID-19 vaccines. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Aug. 23. For ivermectin, it’s the opposite. The FDA has warned people not to take the drug because there is scant evidence it works against COVID-19. One promising Egyptian study was pulled amid charges of plagiarism and flawed data. Critics of the Australian study say the concentrations of ivermectin used in the petri dishes would be toxic in humans, and, indeed, people are poisoning themselves with the stuff. In humans, ivermectin cream is used to treat head lice and the skin condition rosacea. Tablets are used for intestinal worms. The human formulation requires a prescription, but formulations for horses are widely available in farm stores and on Amazon, and people are taking them. Poisonings are on the rise across the country, including in Oregon, as people ingest ivermectin in amounts intended for 1,000-pound animals. On Aug. 24, Oregon Health & Science University warned people not to use ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID. The Oregon Poison Center managed 21 ivermectin cases in August after handling just three in all of 2020, OHSU said. Nationally, ivermectin exposure cases jumped 163% to 1,143 in the first eight months of this year, according to the American Association of Poison Control Centers. People who take horse-sized doses of ivermectin can be in for a wild ride. One patient, for example, drank an injectable form of ivermectin for cows and ended up in the hospital for nine days, dazed and confused with hallucinations, rapid breathing, and body tremors, according to the CDC. More mundane symptoms include nausea, diarrhea, low blood pressure, and hives. The FDA tweeted an unusually blunt warning on Aug. 21: “You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, y’all. Stop it.” Weinstein appeared unmoved. His response on Twitter: “Just say neigh.” Weinstein is 5-foot-9 and fit, with a thick head of graying hair. He often sports a cowboy hat on his podcast. On a visit to Rogan’s studio, he wore a black bandanna he “can pull up at a moment’s notice” to protect himself from COVID. Koppelman, his former colleague at Evergreen, says Weinstein loves the Northwest. Years ago, they led a trip together to Dry Falls in eastern Washington, where Weinstein wowed students with his explanation of the Missoula Floods. “He just did an amazing job,” she says. Weinstein was born and raised in Los Angeles. He became interested in biology as a kid when his grandparents took him on a hike in Griffith Park and told him about Charles'}]"

But in the past 80 years, it has been an important center of Portland’s Black community, inhabited by union members, community activists, and the first Black woman ever elected to the Oregon Senate. Now, sisters Avel Gordly and Faye Burch are transforming their family home into a Black leadership academy and a neighborhood archive. “My sister Faye and Lakeitha Elliot and I have had layers of conversations over time about wanting the Gordly family home to be preserved as a meaningful part of Black history in Portland,” Gordly told The Skanner. “When you look at the makeup of families that lived on that block during the years I was growing up, in the late 40s, 50s, into the 60s, there were a number of Black families -- intact families, mom and dad and children. And we had community and we looked out after each other. When I think about what’s now left and what the ownership looks like now, say from Going Street going south to Skidmore on Williams Avenue, you still have Black home ownership, or Black property owners. And again, each of those homes has its own story of community, what made Black community, and now what’s left of Black community.” With the support of Self Enhancement Inc., Burch and Gordly have conceived of the Gordly Burch Center for Black Leadership and Civic Engagement. ""We are applying for several grants with Meyer, PCEF and other organizations,"" Burch said. ""We are working on more future opportunities as we go along, and will have a family contribution as well to work with grant writing."" “There aren’t any local programs specifically focused on getting Black folks elected to office” Lakeitha Elliott, a community organizer who is actively involved in development efforts, told The Skanner. “It’s a unique opportunity, in the context of community and having the support of the Gordly family -- tapping into the current and previous leadership while we still have their knowledge and information.” When longtime railroad worker Fay Gordly set out to buy his young family a home in the late 1940s, he found himself unable to secure a bank loan. Burch described how a Jewish friend of the family was able to get financing and purchase the house, with Fay repaying him. Burch now feels the Black community should be more engaged with banks and corporate America, an opportunity she hopes to share with burgeoning leaders through the Gordly Burch Center for Black Leadership and Civic Engagement. “In this way we can share with (banks) some of the priorities for people in the communities, because red-lining and bonding insurance and those kinds of things are clearly still a problem,” Burch said. “I hear a lot of people asking, ‘Why aren’t people in your community buying (available property)?’ Well, they can’t get loans. It’s still the same criteria, the same boards, the same people deciding.” The Gordly family home at 4511 N. Williams Ave. Nor have Burch and Gordly forgotten the discomfort of growing up with a coal furnace. Part of the center’s fundraising goal includes financing to work with the neighborhood to improve energy efficiency, code compliance and heating and cooling systems in nearby homes. Burch estimates it’s been nearly 20 years since anyone resided in the house full-time. Instead, they have upgraded to hardwood floors and gas heating and opened the residence as a meeting space for Albina Vision and Imagine Black, formerly Portland African American Leadership Forum. “The house is a place where PAALF was anchored, and its academy produced three or four cohorts,” Gordly said. “I look now at where some of the folks who graduated, if I may use that word, from the program, which I was able to make a contribution to by appearing as a speaker and mentor: Rukaiyah Adams, (Chief Investment Officer) at the Meyer Memorial Trust. I look at Cameron Whitten, the young man who started Brown Hope. I look at Justice Rajee (executive director of the Reimagine Oregon Project), and the work that he’s been doing of late. There’s so many others when you look at the roster,” she said. “When you look now, where is intentional leadership development happening in our community? Leadership training that guides young people and emerging leaders toward public service as a noble calling and profession, which I believe it is. That guides our young people and emerging leaders toward servant leadership. There’s not really any identifiable training going on that’s specifically dedicated to Black leadership, including the study of Black leadership, the growth of Black leadership, and when you look back in time at what leadership has looked at in the city of Portland from the 1940s and forward.” Even before the sisters decided how to dedicate their family home, they were reluctant to sell -- especially at a time when they were inundated by notices from real estate spectators interested in purchasing the property and likely razing the house. “We used to kind of laugh at their letters,” Burch said. “They’d say, ‘We’re not speculators, we’re friends of the community’” accompanied by personal touches like pet photos or assurances they regularly attended Blazers’ games. “Both my sister and I are too active in the community to allow something like that to happen to our parents’ house,” she said. And her family had already had its fill of such practices, Burch recalled. “(Speculators) walked and drove up and down the avenue, they had inside information of where the city’s going to be developing,” she said. “Even city planners, former city employees, because they know to buy land while it’s cheap because the city’s coming to develop. So when somebody’s missing from their home, their lights are out, their grass isn’t cut, they start looking for them. They would look at Emanuel Hospital, they would ask friends. They would know when you were gone.” Burch and Gordly recall getting a phone call from a nurse at Legacy Emanuel, where their elderly father was convalescing. The nurse warned that her father had visitors who had brought papers they were urging him to sign. “We went over there, we tried to talk to my dad, said don’t sign anything -- there were people at that time blindly selling their homes for $10,000 and moving out,” Burch said. “You’d receive letters -- you still receive letters -- and they know your name, they send it to you directly.” “Anger surfaces, for one thing,” Gordly said. “These predatory folks went to my father’s hospital bedroom to ask about property, and that taught us something about how the predatory soul works, and has worked, in our community. But it also assigns that urgency around not losing our history, not losing our stories, certainly hanging onto the property that is left. And helping families understand what their options are out there today to hang on, to hold on, to maybe develop something else in place of what was. But my sister and I, Fay and Beatrice’s daughters, are not going to allow our history to be erased, and we’re not going to allow it to be misinterpreted, or let it become a story that’s told by someone else. We’re still here. We still have breath. And our commitment is to raise up the stories and the legacy not only of our family, but all the other families too along that artery."" ""That artery gave us life.” Gordly described how her father worked for the railroad for more than 40 years as a Pullman porter and became active in the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, founded by A. Philip Randolph. Her mother was a committed member of Mt. Olivet Baptist Church, as well as many women’s groups. “The name Gordly stands for something,” Gordly said. “I guess what I’m saying is, they were somebodies. I think about them. I think about the Maxey family. They had the grocery store, the barbershop; when we were walking home from school back when we were kids, coming back from what was then Highland Grade School, we would stop into the grocery store of course, and Mr. or Mrs. Maxey would always ask, ‘How are you doing today? What did you do at school today?’ And they did not entertain one-word answers. They were community parents.” She added, “I think the street should be renamed from Williams Avenue to Maxey Avenue.” Gordly recalls neighbors like her maternal grandmother, Alberta Louise Randolph, who lived up the street; or Manly Baltzegar, a photographer whose work could be found in most family albums in the neighborhood. “These are stories we can lift up and keep alive through a center like ours that will focus on reclaiming Williams Avenue in that way, but also training young people and emerging leaders to focus on civic engagement and leadership,” Gordly said. “This will definitely be an archive, some museum of sorts.

Déterminer l’objectif et la demande Une entreprise peut être difficile à remarquer dans la pléthore d’offres sur son marché, surtout lorsqu’il s’agit d’entreprises émergentes ou de start-up. Mais il y a un moyen d’attaquer son lancement de manière pertinente et optimisée, qui est de se concentrer sur votre objectif. A lire aussi : Comment concevoir un site web qui reflète fidèlement votre marque ? En effet, votre produit peut être le plus ingénieux au monde, s’il ne répond pas aux besoins réels et pratiques devos clients ne seront tout simplement pas en mesure de réussir. Avant toute autre chose, et même avant d’entrer dans la phase de développement, il y a une étape clé dont vous ne pourrez pas échapper : la phase de recherche. Qui sont vos cibles ? Quels sont leurs problèmes ? Existe-t-il une réelle demande pour l’idée d’un produit ou d’un service ? Les gens sont-ils prêts à payer pour ce produit spécifique ? Il s’agit de questions pour trouver des réponses, que ce soit en consultant des études de marché déjà menées par des sociétés de marketing ou en dialoguant avec vos objectifs potentiels. Si votre entreprise compte déjà un certain nombre de clients ou d’abonnés, vous pouvez faciliter le démarrage de conversations avec des contacts existants. Parce qu’ils ont non seulement des réponses à vos questions, mais ils représentent également une partie de votre futur objectif de clients potentiels sur le produit ou le service que vous souhaitez mettre sur le marché.

Quels produits etles services offerts par vos concurrents ? Quelles sont leurs stratégies de communication ? Et surtout, comment votre nouveau produit peut-il se démarquer de la série par des fonctionnalités spécifiques et innovantes ou une communication originale sortant des sentiers battus ? Toutes ces réflexions fourniront les bases du succès de votre lancement. Ils vous permettront d’établir le bon message et de créer un plan d’action adapté à votre objectif et au positionnement souhaité. 2. Les tests sont toujours antérieurs Le lancement efficace ne peut pas se passer de tests antérieurs. Il faut reconnaître que le nouveau produit sera assez difficile à voir parfaitement pour la première fois. En passant, la communication autour d’un tel produit ne sera pas nécessairement la plus optimale tout de suite. Pour vous aider, les bêta-testeurs sont nécessaires pour réussir. Il vous permettra de recueillir les réactions initiales à vos produits et services, mais également d’identifier les moyens d’améliorer ou de préciser la précision qui pourraient être suivies pour optimiser votre startup. En plus de tester vos produits, vous pourrez également organiser un test de vos médias en général pour vous assurer que votre communication, votre site Web et votre image de marque sont facilement compris et assimilés à vos objectifs. Le test de vos produits est un processus qui doit être continu, même pendant ou après le lancement. S’il est vraiment difficile d’atteindre la perfection dès le premier coup, les tests vous permettront d’améliorer différentes variables et d’identifier les clés du succès du retour sur investissement. Gardez également à l’esprit que proposer vos produits ou services, ou tout au moins leur démonstration gratuite, peut également vous permettre d’accumuler des recommandations et des témoignages précieux pour développer une image de votre marque. Dans ce contexte, les influenceurs Web sont une cible particulièrement appréciée par les annonceurs : non seulement ils sont habitués à rechercher et à effectuer ce type de tests, mais ils peuvent également jouer un rôle inégalé dans le succès de votre plan de lancement en créant un buzz.sur les réseaux sociaux. 3. Planifiez son lancement La plupart des échecs de lancement sont dus à une mauvaise planification ou à une mauvaise organisation de l’entreprise. Comme il ne suffit pas d’envoyer des informations à vos clients ou de payer des bannières publicitaires pour obtenir des résultats, la planification est l’une des clés d’un lancement réussi. Plus vous avez la possibilité de planifier vos actions en amont, plus votre lancement sera probablement couronné de succès. N’oubliez pas qu’ils se prépareront beaucoup pour le jour J et qu’il est préférable d’être réaliste quant à la durée réelle de ce déploiement. Définition de cibles et d’outils de suivi La première chose que vous devez faire lorsque vous souhaitez établir votre plan d’action est d’examiner avec précision ses objectifs. Qu’est-ce qui ferait de votre lancement un succès ? Combien de ventes rendraient vos efforts marketing rentables ? Combien de contacts avez-vous dans votre base de données ? Ces questions vous guideront sur votre plan d’action, mais aussi critères à suivre pour mesurer vos résultats pendant la phase de lancement. Choisir le bon moment Certains vous diront qu’il n’y a pas de « bon moment » pour lancer un produit sur le marché, car la première chose à faire pour s’assurer lorsque vous lancez un lancement est qu’un produit ou un service est réellement prêt pour le marketing. Bien que cela puisse être vrai dans certaines situations, certains événements peuvent être plus propices au lancement de produits, et à l’inverse, certaines périodes peuvent être vraiment catastrophiques dans ce contexte. Par exemple, il ne serait pas bon de faire fonctionner votre produit en même temps qu’un concurrent ou lorsque la saison n’est pas appropriée si un produit est proposé pour lequel la saisonnalité est importante. Mais au contraire, vous avez peut-être identifié certains événements (foires, foires, etc.) Ce qui serait tout à fait approprié pour la communication de votre lancement et qui serait utile dans votre promotion. Préparer une organisation interne Les petites entreprises ont souvent tendance à avoir du mal à ce stade avant la préparation, et pourtant il est crucial de bien fonctionner. Non seulement il sera nécessaire de s’assurer que les ressources humaines sont suffisantes pour prédire les ventes que vous souhaitez, mais que toutes vos équipes sont bien informées du rôle de chacun dans le processus de lancement. La communication avec vos équipes est sans aucun doute la clé du succès : des mises à jour régulières créeront un réel enthousiasme et identifieront les sources de problèmes ou de difficultés potentielles en amont. D’un autre côté, une bonne organisation est le seul moyen d’assurer un service fluide et la meilleure expérience d’achat pour vos clients potentiels. Publication d’un budget solide Enfin, une dernière information qui doit être évaluée, notamment, est qu’il s’agit d’un budget. De nombreux échecs de démarrage sont associés à des calculs insuffisants ou mal optimisés. À moins que vous n’ayez un budget publicitaire illimité, nous vous conseillons de fixer un budget réaliste conforme à vos objectifs afin de mettre toutes les chances sur votre côté. 4. Avoir la bonne stratégie de contenu Que vous ayez l’intention de lancer un produit exclusivement avec des outils de marketing Web ou non, votre contenu sera au cœur de votre stratégie de lancement. En effet, c’est la pierre angulaire de la compréhension et de l’exposition de vos objectifs à votre produit ou service. De la stratégie de communication à la création de contenu Après plusieurs mois de recherche et développement, il peut être compliqué de proposer un message clair pour vos objectifs et sans jargon technique. Néanmoins, c’est là que réside le principal défi et, en même temps, le principal facteur du succès de votre communication au démarrage : fournir un message clair, facile à mémoriser et attrayant. L’objectif est d’informer les clients potentiels sur leur nouveau produit ou service, alors demandez-vous quels types de médias et de contenus conviennent le mieux à cette tâche. Et le Web regorge de possibilités de communication ! Vous pouvez écrire des articles spécialisés, proposer des vidéos pour expliqueravantages de vos produits, diffuser des photos qui placent leurs produits dans la vie des utilisateurs, tout est possible ! L’essentiel est de s’efforcer de maintenir une communication cohérente par rapport à l’ensemble de vos médias, car c’est la communication qui jettera les bases de votre image de marque, surtout si votre entreprise n’a pas sa réputation ancrée sur son marché. N’hésitez pas à considérer tous les contenus""}]"

David Gathu and Moses Kinyua are inventors from Kenya. While both of them dropped out of college due to financial constraints, it has not stopped them from learning or inventing. Recently, the duo came up with the idea for an electronic prosthetic during the pandemic to assist Kenya with battling the coronavirus. Initially, they thought the prosthetic could be used solely for sanitization efforts. ""When the virus hit our country, we decided to create a machine that could help us decontaminate surfaces. It can also be used in schools, restaurants, [or] hospitals,"" Kinyua told reporters. But with their country successfully thwarting the spread of the coronavirus, Gathu and Kinyua decided to repurpose their invention, focusing on helping those who are disabled in Kenya. ""The reason why we designed this bio-robotic hand is because we wanted to help those people who have lost the use of their limbs, the disabled people. Our aim is to give them something that will help them or will aid them to go into their daily activities to move from a dependent person to an independent person,"" Gathu said. Photo Courtesy of Shoppe Black According to the Associated Press, more than one million people live with disabilities in Kenya, many losing their limbs to polio or accidents. Gathu and Kinyua\'s invention can help those residents, making a bio-robotic arm that could change the lives of people who are disabled. Currently, most prosthetic technology is controlled by a person\'s muscles. However, this new invention from Gathu and Kinyua is powered solely by brain signals, converting the brain\'s messaging into an electric current via a ""NeuroNode"" biopotential headset receiver. The Neuronode technology was initially invented to support those who have paralysis and/or speech loss. The Kenyan inventors have repurposed the innovation, allowing the electric current to drive into the robot\'s circuitry, giving it mobility. The arm also has several vital materials which enables it to move vertically and horizontally. This innovation could make it possible for those who are disabled to drive cars, operate computers and phones, or switch lights on and off, simply by using their brain. Photo Courtesy of Shoppe Black While the invention is a technological supernova, it is still in its prototype phase; Gathu and Kinyua created the bio-robotic prosthetic from salvaged, second-hand electronics. Funding will be a challenge for mass production, and the two are hoping to receive support to launch this one-of-a-kind invention. ""At the moment, we use raw materials from other discarded appliances because we do not have neither the place nor the resources to obtain the necessary materials to mass-produce,"" said Kinyua. Nonetheless, if this is done with old garbage, imagine what\'s possible if the pair were given the proper materials and support to distribute the technology. Congratulations, David and Moses!

Low 54F. Winds light and variable. Chance of rain 70%. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:27 pm The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is warning consumers to be vigilant about fire and carbon monoxide (CO) hazards in the colder winter months ahead. The dangers, although present across all populations, disproportionally affect certain communities. According to CPSC’s Residential Fire Loss Estimates report, African Americans have the highest rate of fire deaths, nearly twice the overall rate across the population. In addition, African Americans represent 22 percent of portable generator-related CO deaths, nearly 170 from 2010-2020. Space Heaters This is the time of year when consumers may get out the space heaters for extra warmth. Make sure to keep flammable materials at least three feet away. Always plug space heaters directly into a wall outlet and never into a power strip, to prevent overloading and causing a fire. CPSC estimates that portable heaters are involved in about 1,700 fires per year, resulting in about 80 deaths and 160 injuries annually. A CPSC staff report found that space heaters can also present a hyperthermia (overheating) hazard to consumers, particularly children, people with disabilities and senior citizens, who may be more susceptible because of their limited ability to act or react to the elevated ambient temperature. Hyperthermia can result in death. DO NOT leave space heaters running unattended in a confined space around infants, or individuals with reduced physical, sensory or mental capabilities. Smoke and CO Alarms Working smoke and CO alarms save lives! Install smoke alarms on every level of the home and inside each bedroom. CO alarms should be placed on every level of home outside sleeping areas. Test the alarms every month to make sure they are working. Replace batteries at least once every year, or install smoke and CO alarms with sealed, 10-year batteries. Furnaces, Fireplaces and Chimneys Start by having fireplace flues and chimneys and other fuel-burning appliances, such as furnaces, inspected by a professional before the heating season. Generators Most CO deaths associated with portable generators occur in the colder months of the year, between November and February. The exhaust contains poisonous carbon monoxide, which can kill in minutes. Use portable generators outside only and place them at least 20 feet from the home. Never use a generator inside a home, basement, shed or garage. From 2010-2020, CPSC estimates that more than 700 people died from CO poisoning associated with generators, over 50 in 2020. Use flashlights instead of candles If you experience a power outage, use battery-powered flashlights or lanterns, rather than candles, to light the home. If using candles, never leave burning candles unattended. Check for recalled products Recalls are year-round too. Before using household products as the colder weather arrives, check to see if the products have been recalled at www.cpsc.gov/recalls. If a product has been recalled, stop using it immediately and contact the recalling company.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:24 pm “Blue-robed class forms focal point,” reads the caption. Full disclosure: I graduated from Hood River Valley High School in 1990, my husband in 1989 and our oldest daughter in 2017. Our youngest begins her junior year this fall and yes, she’ll be an HRVHS grad too. So when I took a phone call recently regarding the HRVHS class of 1971’s 50th reunion Aug. 6-7 — the school’s first graduating class — that piqued my interest. Since Yesteryears has been one of my pet projects dating back to my Hood River News days, I decided to take a dip into the archives and see what I could uncover about the beginnings of my alma mater. Hood River and Wy’east high schools were converted to junior high schools in the fall of 1970, when Hood River Valley High School combined the two at its Indian Creek location. But before that happened, students from the two schools began meeting in 1969 to come up with what were referred to as “traditions” for the new school — including its mascot. The first Hood River News article I found, dated Sept. 18, 1969, literally made me gasp: “Citizenship recognition for outstanding service wasn’t announced until it was presented here. Receiving the VFW-sponsored award for a boy is Jon Crossland, standing at left, student body president. He’s receiving the honor from Ora Sal of the Hood River VFW post. Receiving the award for a girl is Helen Hanel, whose certificate is held by Larry Holsman of the Parkdale VFW post. At left is Assistant Principal Earl Fowler.” “They’ll call it Hood River Valley High School, and they’ll call the teams ‘The Rams,’ if present plans of the Traditions Task Force gain final approval. The Task Force, working on the theme ‘The Hood River Valley — Its Heritage,’ is continuing a project to select manes within the theme to apply in the school. Through the school’s history, its traditions will be based on the theme as developed by the committee and have a bearing on it.” I gasped, Reader, because everyone knows that HRVHS is Home of the Eagles. The Rams? What is this nonsense? The nonsense continued, though, into the next paragraph: “Originally, the mascot selection was narrowed down to ‘Trailblazers’ or ‘Mountaineers,’ with the latter drawing more favor. But when problems cropped up concerning application of the name to the cheerleader’s sweaters, to warm up jackets and others, ‘The Rams’ moved into the picture. The high mountains rimming the valley — the type of terrine which is the home for the mountain sheep — fits the mascot theme.” I mean, okay, I guess I can see why The Rams sort of make sense? Actually, no, never mind, I really can’t. “A big moment for the Hood River Valley High School class of 1971 came when Jan Magnusen, class president, made the class gift presentation to the school, then led the graduates in a traditional tassel switching ceremony signifying completion of their school year.” Equally as surprising: The school name could have been Mt. Hood High; that name lost in a poll. The Nov. 20, 1969, Hood River News announced that Hood River Valley High was the official name for the school then under construction. But Trisha, you may well be asking, what happened to The Rams? I have no idea. In that same Nov. 20 issue, the newspaper announced that the mascot was The Golden Eagle, “a carryover from the present Wy’east High School.” I can find no mention of how the Task Force arrived at this (obviously correct) decision. The school colors of royal blue, gold and white were also selected at that time. And that was the last mention of the Task Force and its work. On May 28, 1970, the News reported, “A landmark in Hood River school history arrives next week. On June 4-5, two high schools will end their history as senior classes as Wy’east and Hood River go through graduation exercises.” On June 11, the News reported, “More than 200 high school seniors went through rituals at valley high schools last week to close the history of graduation at Wy’east and Hood River high schools. For Hood River, it was the 65th annual commencement … Wy’east High was relatively young. It’s outdoor ceremony of Friday evening, June 5 was only the 19th.” In honor of the HRVHS class of 1971’s upcoming 50th reunion, I also looked into that first graduation ceremony. From the May 27, 1971, Hood River News: “Day by day, machinery has gradually been grinding toward a landmark for Hood River Valley High School — graduation of its first class. Last day of school for graduating seniors was last Thursday, the class went through Baccalaureate on Sunday, then they prepared for commencement Thursday, May 27 at 8 p.m. in the high school gymnasium. About a thousand seats will be reserved for families of the graduates in the class of 1971 and the rest will be open to the public on a first come, first served basis.” The June 3, 1971, issue contained a photo page of graduation (some reproduced here; photo credit is identified by slightly enlarged text that reads, “All photos on this page by Kollas.”) Happy 50th reunion, HRVHS class of 1971!

The cliché has made its way into popular culture and has long been considered just a part of college; some may go as far to say it is a rite of passage. The reality is, many college students struggle to cover basic needs. Those who don’t have family support are more likely to face challenges affording food. Prior to the pandemic, food insecurity was a common issue among college students, but now the COVID pandemic has exacerbated the problem. According to a 2020 study conducted jointly by Chegg, Swipe Out Hunger, and the Born This Way Foundation, 29% of college students have missed a meal at least once a week since the beginning of the pandemic. At least 49% of students who also are parents have experienced food insecurity, compared to 27% of students who are not parents. And overall, 51% of all students have reached out to family for food support, while 24% say they had to take out loans to cover the cost of food. It’s not easy to concentrate on an empty stomach. Students who experience food insecurity have decreased academic achievement, earning lower grades than other students. Hunger can also cause a delay in graduating from college by forcing students to start and stop school. Consuming cheap food such as instant ramen can affect academic performance, as well. According to Healthline, most instant ramen noodles lack important nutrients the body needs to function properly – including protein, fiber, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin B-12, calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Not to mention, the packaged noodle meals are also packed with sodium, around 1,150 mg or more per serving (U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that adults consume no more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day). What’s more, students facing hunger have increased symptoms of depression, such as feeling sad, tired, and lack of interest – and these symptoms impact their schooling. There is also the added stigma for people having difficulty affording food. Embarrassment and shame can prevent students from seeking help. Students who are wanting to ask for help may not know where to find it. A study conducted by The Hope Center found that 52% of students who faced food or housing insecurity in 2020 didn’t apply for any support programs because they didn’t know how. All this paints a rather bleak picture. But for Mt. Hood students, there’s good news: MHCC Student Basic Needs is here to help, dedicated to connecting students with resources they need to support their academic goals. Students can utilize these resources to help overcome barriers that get in the way of their success. Barney’s Pantry is an on-campus food bank that was created for MHCC students by students, currently available by appointment only inside the Student Union on the main Gresham campus. Fill out a pantry request form online, and a staff member will get in touch with you to schedule a pickup time for a food box. The Pantry staff can also help challenged students with WinCo Grocery Cards, SNAP Benefits, loaner laptops, WiFi hotspots, emergency bus passes, gas cards, and housing. MHCC Student Basic Needs also connects students with no-cost professional counseling services and referrals for support services related to depression, stress management, anxiety, and suicide.

Please give us a call at 541-889-5387 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy Fruitland High School FRUITLAND — Two students who play football on Fruitland High School’s junior varsity team allege that on Oct. 14 they and another student were victims of a hazing incident. According to a news release from the Payette County Sheriff’s Office, which is currently investigating the complaint, states that no charges have been filed at this time. Superintendent Lyle Bayley would not comment on whether any students are suspended due to the incident, however said “rest assured” the district was “aware” of the complaint and “is following up on that.” He said that anytime there is something that goes against the district policy, they follow discipline policies. “This incident is no different than that,” Bayley said. As far as what he could elaborate on? “Nothing,” the superintendent said. According to the complaint, details of which were provided in the news release, 11 members of the varsity football team were involved in the hazing of three students, two who are 14 and one who is 15. The investigation is ongoing and the sheriff said he believes all the suspects are juveniles, however added that with all of them being seniors at Fruitland High School, some of them could be 18 years old. The incident was reported to the Payette County Sheriff’s Office by two of the students the night that it allegedly occurred. According to the complaint, after a junior varsity game on Oct. 14, the varsity players took the younger players to McDonalds. After eating there, the older players allegedly drove the victims to Birding Island South, outside of New Plymouth and tied the younger players to a fence, shocking one of them with a dog collar. The complaint states that the varsity players then removed the restraints and returned the younger football players to the high school. According to the Fruitland High School student handbook, “hazing of any kind to other students may be cause or reason for disciplinary action.” Furthermore it states that “any act of bullying, threatening, hazing, harassment, intimidation or menacing will not be tolerated,” and that “all complaints will be promptly investigated,” in accordance with District Policy No. 512.2. The policy defines hazing as any act that includes, but is not limited to “recklessly or intentionally” endangering the mental or physical health or safety of a student for the purpose of initiation, precondition or conditional membership or affiliation with “any district-sponsored activity or grade level attainment.” Those actions include forcing someone to do something, such as consuming any drink, drug or controlled substance, being exposed to the elements, prolonged exclusion from social contact, sleep deprivation or other activities. Hazing is also defined as actions that require, encourage, authorize or permit another person “to be subject to wearing or carrying any obscene or physically burdensome article, assignment of pranks to be performed or other such activities intended to degrade or humiliate.” that could adversely affect the mental or physical health or safety of a student. According to that policy’s complaint procedures, the building principal and superintendent are responsible for investigations concerning such incidents. Log In Keep it Clean.

ongoing into possibly neglected cattle — many of which had young calves — in deep snows on U.S. Forest Service land in the Upper Imnaha area, Wallowa County Sheriff Joel Fish confirmed Friday, Dec. 31. Fish stated in an email the investigation was started after learning the magnitude of the situation Dec. 19. “Wallowa County is moving toward seizing the Dean Oregon Ranch cattle for neglect, and we are investigating possible criminal charges,” Fish said in the email. Fish said the sheriff’s office is “assisting with the retrieval of the cattle on the Forest Service grazing permits on the Marr Flat C&H Allotment. We have had deputies on snowmobiles assisting since that date.” There have been numerous volunteers helping in the rescue efforts, as confirmed by county Commission Chairman Todd Nash and volunteers with the Wallowa County Humane Society. One of the first widespread alerts came in a Facebook post by Craig Stockdale, who was one of the first to discover the cattle on the 200 Road south of Salt Creek. “I just came upon them snowmobiling,” Stockdale said Jan. 1. He said the post mobilized rescuers — both those out finding the cattle and those with facilities to care for the rescued livestock — and he has since taken it down. Kathy Gisler Reynolds, a volunteer with the Humane Society, shared a post of the cattle Dec. 29. Photos posted on Facebook showed a cow up to its neck in snow and unable to move. “I was alerted to it yesterday by the ranchers who have been out there trying to save them,” Reynolds said Dec. 30. She listed several people who were involved in rescuing and caring for the cattle and their calves, calling some of them “heroes.” “Some were too weak to even move,” she said of the cattle, adding that although rescuers were able to retrieve calves, a number of the adult cows had to be euthanized. Stockdale and Anna Butterfield, who with her husband, Mark, ranches northeast of Joseph, confirmed the cattle are on the Bob Dean Oregon Ranch managed by B.J. Warnock. Dean lives in the Deep South and Warnock was not at liberty to provide contact information. Warnock issued a statement on the situation by email Jan. 2. “I am not aware of any plans or attempts to seize any assets,” he said. He also described the situation. “Dean Oregon Ranches cows were all purchased in Oregon and Washington and began arriving on Dean Oregon Ranches property October of 2020 and continued arriving through July of 2021. The cows were a mixture of spring and fall calvers,” Warnock said. “They were all acclimated to this climate, but not all acclimated to this specific terrain. Some do not know how to navigate canyons, so they have wandered in the wrong direction as we searched for them and brought in other groups. New cows are more difficult to gather than cows that have run on the same range for several consecutive years and know the way home. These cows are not calving in the snow; the ranch’s fall calving season was October through November. When we began gathering in September, there were 1,613 mother cows on summer range. He acknowledged bovine casualties in the recovery efforts. “Despite the efforts of our crew and the community, 10 cows have been found unrecoverable,” he said, adding that “1,548 Dean Oregon Ranches mother cows were successfully gathered by Dean Oregon Ranches crew before the snow. After the snow, 34 mother cows have been gathered through the joint efforts of our crew and the community. Of those, 26 were Dean Oregon Ranches cattle; the others were owned by neighboring ranches.” Warnock expressed his gratitude to fellow ranchers assisting in the recovery. “We truly appreciate the effort the community has shown in this final push to gather the remaining cows,” he said. “We plan to continue aerial searches and hope to bring in the majority of the remaining 29 mother cows.” At an emergency meeting of the Wallowa County Board of Commissioners on an unrelated matter Dec. 30, Nash — who is a rancher and president of the Oregon Cattlemen’s Association — said information on the situation at present was limited. “The things we do know is that this was a Forest Service permit for the Upper Big Sheep Creek and the Upper Imnaha,” Nash said after the meeting. “It takes in a large area — 72,000 acres — known as the Marr Flat Grazing Allotment. They had a viable permit to go on sometime in the spring. They were supposed to have all cattle removed according to the Forest Service permit. By the 15th of October, there were still cattle that remained out there and are in very deep snow, some of them have expired. There is a rescue effort being made right now to try and rescue as many as possible. We’ve committed county resources to it. There’ve been a number of people who have volunteered or have contributed time. There’s been helicopters that have flown feed into some that were extremely isolated and the rescue continues. Those are the basic facts that I do know.” Nash went on to specify the county resources. “The Road Department cleared about 10 miles of road in a heavy snowfall area on the Upper Imnaha,” he said. “They cleared about 90 trees out of the road. Compounding the heavy snowfall that came all at once, we had an event where we had rain and heavy snowfall afterword. There are trees across a lot of the access roads that they’re trying to get down right now that has exasperated those efforts to try to extricate the cattle from their situation.” He was unsure how many cattle were involved, but was aware some had young calves.

Warnock added his take on Stein’s assistance. “I contacted Adam Stein to fly for the ranch and flew with him to look for cows multiple times,” Warnock said. “I am very thankful we reached out to Adam — he has been awesome through all this and his expertise in the snow and in the air has been an invaluable resource.” Nash said various agencies have been apprised of the situation, ready to lend what aid they could.

To be sure, read Keizertimes. Zander Rhoades is expected to be one of the leaders for the McNary swim team this season (File). With more than 70 student-athletes on the roster, the McNary swim program was beginning to build on a solid foundation after the 2020 season. But when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, head coach Casey Lewin felt that the squad lost some of their momentum. “That was definitely hard to swallow. We were really making strides as a program. Our girls relay team could have been a district champion, top five in state, type of team. But that’s the way it shook out. It wasn’t just us that was affected by it. We’re all in the boat together,” Lewin said. With the entire 2021 spring shortened season featuring just exhibition races, several McNary upperclassmen elected to not participate last season. Although the swim team has about 30 less athletes in the program, Lewin thinks having a smaller crew will help his kids develop faster in the 2021-22 campaign. “When you have that big of a team practicing on six lanes, it can be hard to get things done. It’s much more manageable having seven or eight per lane. In a way, I think a smaller team will help us rebuild what we lost,” Lewin said. “We’re excited to get back in the water.” After making some noise at the Mountain Valley Conference (MVC) district meet two years ago, senior Paris Boyd looks to be the Celtics top hope for qualifying for the state meet in her final season with the Celtics. She reached the podium in both the 50-yard freestyle and 100-free, along with helping two of McNary’s relay teams to top-six finishes. “(Boyd’s) freestyle has been getting stronger and faster. She could have a really special season,” Lewin said. Keiran Montague is expected to be the girls’ best butterfly swimmer while Kyra Nordstrom should take the top spot in the backstroke. “Both of them have a ton of potential,” Lewin said. The backstroke is expected to be one of Kyra Nordstrom’s top events for the Celtics (File). The McNary boys’ team, on the other hand, has a slew of experienced swimmers returning to the team, none more talented than junior Zach Kilby. As a freshman, Kilby took second in the 50-free at the district meet, and placed third in the 100-free. He also swam the anchor on the 200-free and 400-free relay teams that finished in the top four. “I think he will be our best kid for sure. If last year hadn’t been a short season, I think he would have been sub-23 seconds,” Lewin said. From a leadership perspective, Lewin will be relying on seniors Zander Rhoades, Ben Standley and Tyshin Nguyen. “They have been doing a great job as leaders of this team. It is nice having those kids,” Lewin said. Lewin also says he will be counting on the versatility of sophomore swimmer Caleb Skipper. “He is super talented. I can put him in any race,” Lewin said. Lewin says that he doesn’t have concrete goals for the team, he just wants all of his swimmers to show improvement over the course of the season. “I try to not get them caught up if they win the race. I just want them to get faster,” Lewin said. “Our kids that have been around for four years have bought in and really understand if you come every day and work on what you need to work on, then the success will take care of itself.” Matt Rawlings: [email protected]'}]"

PILOT ROCK — Pilot Rock, which lost 11% of its population in the last census, also is the hottest market for dollar stores in Umatilla County. On Tuesday, Oct. 26, local officials and other people associated with the project gripped their shovels and grinned for the camera during a groundbreaking ceremony near 241 S.W. Fourth St. Eyes North Corp. of Chicago will build the store and then lease it to the Family Dollar chain of dollar stores. At a reception at the old Pilot Rock schoolhouse next door, Eyes North President Randy Coakley said national dollar store chains realized Oregon was an untapped market and began expanding accordingly. Coakley said his company is working on dollar stores in Oregon locations as far flung as Lakeview and Port Orford. Dollar store chains seemed to have taken a special interest in Umatilla and Morrow counties. When the Family Dollar in Pilot Rock is completed next year, it will complement its other location in Boardman. Family Dollar’s competitor, Dollar General, has been even more aggressive in the area. Dollar General intends to replace Pilot Rock’s old hardware store with a dollar store on top of the stores its already built or in the process of developing in Hermiston, Umatilla, Milton-Freewater, Irrigon and Heppner. With the exception of Hermiston, all of the new dollar stores are going in towns with less than 10,000 people. Despite only having 1,328 people, the smallest population in the bunch, Pilot Rock is getting both dollar store chains. While dollar stores are relatively new to the region, their decision to heavily populate Eastern Oregon is well within their previous expansion patterns. According to a 2019 CNN Business article, Dollar General and Family Dollar usually target low-income areas across the population density spectrum. Dollar General especially focuses on rural America: about three in four Dollar General stores are in towns with 20,000 people or fewer. Although dollar stores can bring new jobs and more shopping choices, critics told CNN the chains unfairly compete with locally owned retailers and grocers while failing to offer essential products like fresh produce. Some cities, including Birmingham, Alabama, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, passed laws restricting dollar store growth. In a response to a request for an interview, Dollar General spokesperson Emma Hall touted the chain’s charitable efforts and its focus on convenience and affordability when choosing new locations. “We also take demographic trends, competitive factors and traffic patterns into consideration,” she wrote in an email. “We know convenience is a major factor in our customers’ shopping decisions as we generally serve customers within a 3-5 mile radius, or 10 minute drive. We further strive to provide convenience for customers who may not have affordable nearby retail option.These locations were a great fit for Dollar General.” Family Dollar is owned by Dollar Tree, another chain of dollar stores that has locations in Pendleton and Hermiston. A statement from Family Dollar and Dollar Tree also highlighted the stores’ charitable efforts while adding its stores work in concert with local grocers and vendors to help cover “food deserts” where fresh produce and protein are scarce. In some areas, Family Dollar is piloting frozen meat and produce sections. “We understand deeply the concerns of many local officials regarding the changing nature of our shared communities across the country, and — as part of those communities — we are always looking for ways to help our neighborhoods be healthier, stronger, and safer,” the store states. For all the national contention, Local business and government officials aren’t sounding the alarm. Dave Meade, the manager at Columbia Harvest Foods in Umatilla, said he thinks his store can find a niche and co-exist with Dollar General. Walmart is only a few minutes away by car in Hermiston, and it remains Columbia Harvest Foods’ main competitor, Meade said. “Walmart is still the 800-pound gorilla,” he said. Some Heppner residents were concerned enough about Dollar General to began circulating a petition before the store bought any property in town. But Heppner City Manager Kraig Cutsforth said protests died down as the store came to fruition. In his view, Dollar General is easy to work with while providing jobs and replacing a recreational vehicle park that drew community complaints. Back in Pilot Rock, city recorder Teri Bacus said the only local retailer the dollar stores might affect is the Pilot Rock Market, the local grocery store. Bacus said she thinks the market still can thrive by focusing on what the dollar stores don’t have: liquor and fresh meat. Meade, Cutsforth and Bacus all said they hoped the dollar stores would allow residents to spend more money in the community and spend less time shopping in Pendleton, Hermiston or elsewhere. While the dollar stores are in development, local business has picked up. A new bar called The Vault Tavern has opened up in the old Archie’s Restaurant space and a new hunting store has opened right next door on Main Street. Bacus said Pilot Rock is working on an economic development plan with Eastern Oregon Business Source and expects all of these businesses to be a part of the revitalization effort. Janelle Hampton and her family bought the old schoolhouse several years ago and are in the process of turning it into a venue and gathering space. She was the one who sold the neighboring space to Eyes North to make way for Family Dollar. Much in the same way pioneers on the Oregon Trail used the Pilot Rock geological formation as a landmark on their journey, Hampton said the city of Pilot Rock could use the schoolhouse, local attractions and a couple of dollar stores to bring in visitors on their way to the Blue Mountains or California.

La place de l’homme est désormais multiforme. Passons à la fin d’un homme virile, un mythe qui vient de l’antiquité. Plan de l'article Le mot masculinité a été construit sur le terme latin Vire qui signifiait héros. C’est l’idée de l’excellence humaine, de la supériorité, de la hiérarchie des genres. La masculinité est souvent définie comme la puissance, la robustesse. Nous avons un modèle normatif dont les canons étaient définis dans l’antiquité gréco-romaine sur des critères, des marqueurs de toute puissance financière et économique, indexés sur la puissance sexuelle. La masculinité est un ensemble d’attributs des caractéristiques physiques, mentales et sexuelles d’un homme. Ce culte de la masculinité s’est formé dans une véritable idéologie, c’est-à-dire toutes les disciplines, tous les arguments d’autorité, toutes les représentations symboliques sont appelées à justifier la domination d’un sexe sur un autre. Mais nous pouvons également supposercette masculinité ne peut être définie uniquement par l’exercice du pouvoir, mais nous pourrions dire par la terreur de l’impuissance. L’idée de puissance est indexée sur la puissance sexuelle. Un homme a peur de la faillite, cette peur le pousse à des comportements dominants. Un homme confiant dans sa posture n’aura pas à confirmer excessivement sa masculinité dans le comportement et les attitudes d’hyper virilité.

Un corps a l’air à la fois physique, anatomique (ils ont les cheveux, la barbe, la coupe de cheveux d’une façon ou d’une autre) mais aussi des comportements moraux, c’est-à-dire une attitude face à la peur et des choses plus hybrides (façon de sourire, croiser les jambes, s’habiller. Être masculin serait autre chose. La masculinité est un mythe, une construction culturelle, généralement incarnée par des personnages masculins. Il y a une idée qu’il est nécessaire de faire un homme et que l’homme se fait par l’endurance,Avec mépris de la souffrance et de la douleur, ces garçons doivent apprendre le pouvoir et le refoulement de l’impuissance. La masculinité n’a jamais été acquise et est constamment menacée. Elle a beaucoup de difficultés à se réaliser et à unir tout le sexe masculin. Nous pouvons créer de la confusion et nous commettrons une erreur d’identifier ces deux concepts. Il y a un malaise masculin, une détresse morale chez l’homme occidental. Mais il serait peut-être plus juste de parler de faiblesse plutôt que de « crise » de masculinité. L’utilisation du mot crise peut suggérer qu’il y a un réel danger, la peur de la dislocation masculine, masculine. Les musculinistes expriment cette nostalgie du pouvoir, d’une forme de domination d’un sexe à l’autre. Ce sont les militants les plus extrêmes qui considèrent les droits des femmes comme une menace pour l’identité masculine. Certains affirment que la société est féminisante. On peut entendre « Plus de vrais hommes », cela exclut évidemment ceux qui sont accusés d’être féminisés. Et nous pouvons même une forme d’idéologie de la supériorité d’un genre d’homme par rapport à un autre, et nous devons êtreprudent. Cela peut être à l’origine de la xénophobie, du mépris pour la classe, du racisme. Il y a des symptômes qui mettent l’accent sur cet inconfort, ce burnout, dépression, suicide, dépendance, alcoolisme chez les jeunes, anxiété sexuelle, anxiété de performance… La crise de la masculinité est un concept sociologique qui décrit un ensemble de doutes, questionnant et questionnant qu’un homme de notre société devrait traverser, entre autres, de la libération des femmes et de la libération sexuelle. Les hommes doivent apprendre à changer l’image qu’ils ont d’eux-mêmes. Les femmes ne se masculinisent pas lorsqu’elles ont des positions de pouvoir, les hommes ne se féminisent pas quand ils sont doux, compatissants, sensibles, restent nombreux hommes lorsqu’ils chérissent et s’adonnent à des tâches ménagères. Ils réadaptent le fait qu’ils sont l’Homme d’aujourd’hui. La virilité, en revanche, est au pluriel, il y atant de façons d’être un homme qu’il y a des hommes, et ce qui est un peu honteux, c’est que tous les hommes sont enfermés dans un seul modèle normatif, qui est un modèle de masculinité.

Le féminisme a apporté beaucoup plus aux hommes qu’il ne leur a été enlevé. Les hommes aujourd’hui qui manifestent une partie de sensibilité, de fragilité, qui savent reconnaître leurs défauts, sont une réelle amélioration, pas une perte. Mais la masculinité modèle est complexe, sous la pression d’autres facteurs. La crise de la masculinité est inhérente à l’évolution des sociétés. Il est nécessaire que la masculinité évolue pour se reconstruire et s’adapter au monde actuel. Pendant des décennies, la place de son père a changé en particulier dans la « prise en charge deenfants ». Dans les jeunes générations, la grande majorité des pères se livrent à la grossesse et à l’accouchement, parfois non sans rivalité, dans les soins prodigués à leurs enfants. Mais ce n’est pas seulement le féminisme qui a fait bouger la masculinité. C’est la masculinité qui est également tombée dans son propre piège par l’effondrement de la corruption des guerriers, la métamorphose des conditions de travail, l’incertitude du travail, le chômage. Tous ces facteurs ont également rejeté l’homme dans son rôle de fournisseur de ressources. À partir de ce moment, un homme se sent affaibli, déstabilisé, introuvable dans les critères de masculinité. Les femmes ont changé au fil des siècles de libération, maintenant essentiellement autonomes financièrement, émancipées. Et cette émancipation les a amenés à modifier leurs attentes et leurs besoins dans une vie personnelle et torride. Peut-on dire que les hommes ont subi une telle transformation de leur identité au cours des dernières décennies ? ont probablement moins changé dans leur position et sont confrontés à des attentes très différentes etexigences. Parfois, ils sont très pauvres. Les femmes savent aujourd’hui comment définir ce qu’elles ne veulent plus. Il est peut-être plus difficile pour certaines d’entre elles d’exprimer ce qu’elles veulent et les attentes de leur compagnon dans la vie. Dans la pratique, nous rencontrons des personnes quelque peu perdues qui essaient de s’en tenir au modèle ou à la recherche d’un nouveau modèle : Certains hommes sont parfois déstabilisés dans leur identité masculine et leur sexualité. Ils ont parfois le sentiment de « ne plus être utiles » dans la vie de leur partenaire. Certains d’entre eux, par expérience douloureuse, peur de la dépendance, affirmation féministe, ne se permettent pas de demander du soutien, des conseils, des conseils, de l’aide. La peur de l’adhérence reste très présente. Les femmes travaillent parfois trop fort seules et il est difficile pour les hommes de trouver leur place. La peur d’une mauvaise posture, le bon endroit, les affaiblit parfois dans leur confiance en eux-mêmes. Les hommes aujourd’hui ont mené à un investissement dans un univers émotionnel qui n’était pas le leur. Ce sont toutes les difficultés du couple. Les hommes ne savent pas très bien ce que veulent les femmes. Certains expriment parfois des difficultés qui doivent comprendre les attentes de leurs compagnons parfois romantiques ou RAMBO, tous deux à la fois ? Aucune ? Cela va être un travail long. Françoise HERITIER, anthropologue, a déclaré que nous avons vu quelque chose se produire depuis la naissance, simplement dans le système d’alimentation des enfants. Dans la plupart des civilisations, le garçon se nourrit dès qu’il pleure, dès qu’il prétend et que la fille apprend la patience, on le fait attendre.

Faisons en sorte qu’un homme devienne comme nous le faisons une femme pour devenir un système très simple.
