5 Example video title will go here for this video PORTLAND, Ore. — A man died Tuesday night while he was being transported to a medical facility by Milwaukie police officers, law enforcement officials reported Wednesday morning. The officers — Bradley Walther, who\'d worked as an officer for the department for 12 years, and Timothy Cleary, who worked for one year — were removed from administrative leave as of Dec. 22. They have returned to their patrol officer duties, according to the Milwaukie Police Department. The Milwaukie Police Department added in a press release that the investigation is ongoing. The man, identified as 26-year-old Jean M. Descamps, had been discharged from a local hospital and was being transported to Unity Center for Behavioral Health when he died shortly after 11 p.m., according to the Portland Police Bureau (PPB) and Milwaukie Police Department (MPD). Milwaukie police said officers were dispatched to a hospital around 9:45 p.m. because a man was refusing to leave after he\'d been discharged from the emergency room. MPD said officers decided Descamps, who had active arrest warrants from Clackamas County and Multnomah County, couldn\'t care for himself. Believing he was a danger to himself or others and needed mental health treatment, officers took him into custody on a police officer hold and drove him to a mental health facility. ""There is a statute that allows us to put a police officer hold on someone in that situation, and so, the officers put a POH on him and drove him to Unity,"" explained Sgt. Kevin Allen with the Portland Police Bureau. When the officers arrived at Unity Center for Behavioral Health in Portland, they noticed Descamps was unresponsive, MPD said. Officers started CPR and called for medical help. Emergency medical personnel arrived and took over CPR, but the man couldn\'t be revived and was pronounced dead at the scene. ""This is a little bit of a unique circumstance where somebody is already in the hospital and there’s an effort to try to figure out what is the most appropriate place to put this person in,"" Sgt. Allen said, ""So that will be a big part of this investigation: How did that process happen? How did the officers problem-solve the situation? Is there anything that we can learn from the situation?"" Milwaukie police told KGW that ""there was no struggle with the man by officers."" They said other factors are part of the ongoing investigation and directed KGW to PPB for details about those other factors. Portland police told KGW the officers in this case wore body worn cameras, so that footage will give investigators a clearer timeline of the events. The footage has not been made public at this time. Portland police said North Precinct officers responded to the medical center to help and PPB homicide detectives responded to investigate the death. Milwaukie police said the investigation by PPB is standard practice when a person dies while in the custody of law enforcement. Two Milwaukie police officers were placed on administrative leave. An update Friday from the Portland Police Bureau said that Descamps\' death ""was likely related to a drug overdose"" and contributing natural causes, citing initial findings from the county medical examiner. A final determination awaits the results of a toxicology report. PPB said Descamps family has been notified of his death.

Biden said he has repeatedly pressured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to better consider the lives and well-being of Gazan civilians. “I’ve encouraged the Prime Minister to focus on trying to reduce the number of casualties while he is attempting to eliminate Hamas, which is the legitimate objective use,” Biden said. “That’s a difficult task.” “And I don’t know how long it will take,” he continued. “My expectation and hope is that as we move forward, the rest of the Arab world and the region is also putting pressure on all sides to slow this down to bring this to an end as quickly as possible.” Progressive Democrats have pushed the Biden administration to call for a long-term cease-fire in the conflict, arguing that the Israeli military strategy puts too many Palestinian civilians at risk. They have been joined by hundreds of former Biden campaign staffers and have sparked division in the State Department. In his op-ed this week, Sanders described the Israeli strategy as one of “indiscriminate bombing.” “The Netanyahu government, or hopefully a new Israeli government, must understand that not one penny will be coming to Israel from the U.S. unless there is a fundamental change in their military and political positions,” Sanders said in the statement. The U.S. already requires that all counties that receive military aid, by law, abide by international law. The progressives argue that the measure has entirely been ignored in the case of Israel. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said the U.S. applies conditions for “virtually all other … allies,” and doing so for Israel is “the responsible course.” “The United States has a legal and moral responsibility to ensure that public resources do not facilitate gross violations of human rights and international law,” she wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

(WAVY) — For the first time, the family of the 6-year-old accused of shooting his first-grade teacher at an elementary school in Virginia has issued a statement. A spokesperson for local attorney James Ellenson confirmed to Nexstar’s WAVY the legitimacy of a letter written on behalf of the 6-year-old’s family. She also confirmed that Ellenson is currently representing the family. In the letter, the family began the statement by saying that they are praying for the healing of Abby Zwerner, the teacher who was shot on Jan. 6 at Richneck Elementary in Newport News. “She has worked diligently and compassionately to support our family as we sought the best education and learning environment for our son,” said the family. “We thank her for her courage, grace and sacrifice.” WAVY reached out to Newport News Police about the letter Thursday. A spokesperson replied, “Unfortunately we are not able to verify whether this statement came from the child’s family.” In the letter, the family stated that they have been cooperating with local and federal law enforcement. Additionally, the family says that the firearm the 6-year-old accessed was secured. “Our family has always been committed to responsible gun ownership and keeping firearms out of the reach of children,” reads an excerpt from the letter. Days after the shooting, Newport News Police Chief Steve Drew confirmed the gun was legally purchased by the child’s mother, but he did not provide details on how the student ended up with the gun at school. The family’s letter does not elaborate further. The commonwealth’s attorney’s office will determine if the child’s mother will face charges, Chief Drew added. At this time, no one has been charged. Per the family’s letter, the student is currently under hospital care and “receiving the treatment he needs.” The family stated that the 6-year-old suffers from an “acute disability and was under a care plan at the school that included his mother or father attending school with him and accompanying him to class every day.” On the week of the shooting, the family stated that it was the first week they were not with the child. Richneck Elementary has been closed for nearly two weeks following the shooting. Zwerner has since been hailed a hero by Newport News police after officials say she made sure her students were out of the classroom even after suffering a gunshot wound. Zwerner’s twin sister has set up a GoFundMe account to help with her recovery. The family’s full statement can be viewed below: Our heart goes out to our son’s teacher and we pray for her healing in the aftermath of such an unimaginable tragedy as she selflessly served our son and the children in the school.
