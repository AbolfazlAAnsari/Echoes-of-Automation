NPR\'s current ethics policy was first drafted in the early 2000s, and then given an overhaul in 2010-2011. The new NPR policy reads, ""NPR editorial staff may express support for democratic, civic values that are core to NPR\'s work, such as, but not limited to: the freedom and dignity of human beings, the rights of a free and independent press, the right to thrive in society without facing discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual identity, disability, or religion."" Is it OK to march in a demonstration and say, \'Black lives matter\'? What about a Pride parade? In theory, the answer today is, ""Yes."" But in practice, NPR journalists will have to discuss specific decisions with their bosses, who in turn will have to ask a lot of questions. The carve-out is somewhat narrow. Protests organized with the purpose of demanding equal and fair treatment of people are now permitted, as long as the journalist asking is not covering the event. However, rallies organized to support a specific piece of legislation would be off-limits. Other events featuring a slate of political candidates from one party are also out of bounds. Even when NPR journalists can legitimately participate in a civic event, the new policy asks them to consider how their participation will impact their colleagues. When taking a public stance makes it harder for other NPR journalists to do their jobs, there is an expectation that the journalism will take precedence. This policy confronts the generations-old question in newsrooms: Where does the journalist end and the citizen begin? This pressure on news companies to allow their journalists a wider berth to participate in civic activities has been building over the years, particularly as social media has made direct engagement with audiences — sometimes rich, sometimes messy — part of the day-to-day workflow. As social justice causes took to the platforms, journalists were often caught in a new gray area between longtime professional practices and mores around personal communication. In the wake of George Floyd\'s murder, a younger generation of journalists pushed NPR to modify its traditional prohibitions. ""Our goal was to make NPR a place that employees felt they could be themselves at work, and they wouldn\'t have to be one version of themselves outside of work and another version at work,"" said Alex Goldmark, senior supervising producer for Planet Money and co-chair of the 22-member committee that handled the revision. While the country was experiencing widespread calls for institutions of all kinds to reckon with systemic racism, newsrooms were facing internal pressure. Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native American journalists have argued that they have been disproportionately confined by — even disciplined over — policies that limit personal expression. In Pittsburgh, newspaper editorsrestricted a Black reporter from covering the George Floyd demonstrations after she tweeted a joke about the damage caused by white Kenny Chesney fans outside a concert being vastly worse than that caused by multi-ethnic protesters speaking against racism. The Associated Press recently fired a new reporter for violations of their social media policies while employed there. Critics had initially called attention to her tweets supporting Palestinians. CBS News Correspondent and former Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery has been vocal about the impact traditional policies have had on Black journalists and ultimately Black audiences. NPR didn\'t have high-profile conflicts with its journalists in recent years, and that may have made the news organization more prepared to usher in a new policy. But that doesn\'t mean it was easy to get the members of the committee to agree on what the new policy should say. When the group first convened to revise the ethics code in the summer of 2020, their opinions were far apart. That was by design. Members of the committee were chosen by senior leaders for their viewpoints and their willingness to be vocal. ""Across the board senior leadership was initially resistant to any change, because these are the rules that have worked for us for decades. There are reasons for them. This is the pledge we take when we sign up for journalism,"" said Nancy Barnes, NPR\'s senior vice president for news. ""I will say that we would be in a bad spot if we just said hard no, we can\'t change at all. I mean, so where can we find some common ground?"" Keith Woods, NPR\'s chief diversity officer and co-chair of the committee, describes the two sides of a wide spectrum. On one end were ""people who would go so far as to use the word \'objectivity,\' "" and at the other end were the ""burn-it-all-down kinds of folks."" Meeting at first once or twice a week and then less frequently, all the members of the committee found some agreement on a core set of values. They examined dozens of hypothetical and not-so-hypothetical scenarios, looking for common threads. (Can a political reporter serve on the PTA of his son\'s school? What about an education reporter? Can a host be a Girl Scouts leader? What happens if there is a controversial story involving the Girl Scouts?) While the committee arrived at a general consensus, not everyone who worked on the revisions agrees with the final product, Woods said. Some people think it goes too far. Others believe it doesn\'t go far enough. Leah Donnella, a supervising editor at Code Switch, was one of the committee members who walked away dissatisfied. She\'s been at NPR since 2015 and she went into the conversations last year accepting as a truism that journalists must sacrifice some political speech in order to do their jobs.
