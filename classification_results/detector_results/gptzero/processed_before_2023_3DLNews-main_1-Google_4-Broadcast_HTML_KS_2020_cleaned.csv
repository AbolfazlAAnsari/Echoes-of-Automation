In fact, she was known to wear her K-State gear around campus while attending KU. This isn’t Becky’s first rodeo with KSNT, either. She first joined the Storm Track team in May of 2015, but took some time off to raise her two daughters. She’s very happy to be helping out again on the weekends, and has been back on-air since July 2019. During her free time, Becky helps to run a small farm with her husband.
