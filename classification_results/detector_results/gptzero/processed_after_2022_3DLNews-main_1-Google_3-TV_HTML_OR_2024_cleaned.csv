Under Michigan law, parents have a reasonable obligation to prevent their child from harming or being a risk to others, McDonald told the jury at the close of seven days of testimony. “It’s going to take unique, egregious, incomprehensible facts — and that’s what we have here,” she said. “Just the smallest — the smallest — of things could have saved Hana and Tate and Madisyn and Justin,” McDonald said, referring to the four victims by their first names. “And not only did she not do it, she doesn’t even regret it.” During the trial, prosecutors focused on two key events: the purchase of a 9 mm Sig Sauer handgun on Black Friday, four days before the school attack, and a crucial meeting at the school on the morning of the shooting when a teacher discovered a violent drawing on Ethan’s math assignment. There’s no dispute that James Crumbley, accompanied by Ethan, bought a firearm, and Jennifer Crumbley subsequently purchased 100 rounds of ammunition during a visit to a shooting range. She and her son took turns firing the gun and returned home with 50 rounds during the long Thanksgiving weekend. “She posted on social media it was (Ethan’s) Christmas gift. ... It was gifted to him and not only was it gifted to him, she bragged about it,” McDonald said. The prosecutor pointed out that Jennifer Crumbley texted her husband with the words “emergency” and “I’m very concerned” after the school shared their son’s disturbing drawing and summoned them for a meeting. The drawing depicted a gun that resembled the Sig Sauer, a bullet, a wounded person and the lines, “The thoughts won’t stop. Help me. The world is dead. My life is useless.” Yet the Crumbleys didn’t take Ethan home from school and never informed staff about the new gun or hallucinations months earlier when he told his mom about “demons” at the house and clothes “flying off the shelf.” Jennifer Crumbley downplayed it, telling the jury it was “just Ethan messing around.” “I have asked myself if I would have done anything differently. I wouldn’t have. I wish he would have killed us instead,” she testified Thursday. A counselor and school administrator both said they urged the parents to get him into mental health care as soon as possible. Ethan returned to class and began shooting later that day. No one had checked his backpack for a gun. “I’m not going to say it’s OK they didn’t look in the backpack,” McDonald said of school staff. “But this is Jennifer Crumbley’s actions. ... (Staff) did not have any of the information that was so jarring. It’s about what she knew and what she didn’t say.” Defense attorney Shannon Smith began her closing argument in an unusual way. She talked about her own family and wondered aloud what her criminal liability would be if one of her kids grabbed a kitchen knife and attacked a friend. “This case is a very dangerous one for parents out there. ... Can every parent really be responsible for everything their children do?” Smith said. “This was not foreseeable to Mrs. Crumbley.” Smith accused prosecutors of giving “cherry-picked” evidence to the jury. “When you get cherry-picked bits of evidence, it’s easy to reach wrong conclusions,” the attorney said. Smith said no one buys a gun for a child who has a mental illness. “The Crumbleys’ son was a skilled manipulator, and they didn’t realize it,” she said. “He’s not sick. He doesn’t have a mental illness.” Yet portions of his journal, displayed to the jury, revealed desperation. “I have zero help for my mental problems and it’s causing me to shoot up the ... school,” Ethan wrote. “My parents won’t listen to me about help or therapist,” the boy said. McDonald’s last remark to the jury Friday was a reference to Jennifer Crumbley agreeing with her lawyer that she had “lost everything” because of the extraordinary violence and criminal cases. “She hasn’t lost everything, ladies and gentlemen. Her son is still alive,” the prosecutor said. The Crumbley parents were found in a Detroit art studio four days after the shooting and 12 hours after charges were filed against them. They had more than $6,000 and plastic bins filled with clothes and other possessions. They denied they were trying to flee. Ten students and a teacher were shot at Oxford High School, about 40 miles (60 kilometers) north of Detroit. The four students who died were Hana St. Juliana, Tate Myre, Justin Shilling and Madisyn Baldwin. ___ Follow Ed White at https://twitter.com/edwritez Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

5 Example video title will go here for this video PORTLAND, Ore. — The Oregon Supreme Court has ruled against a group of Republican state senators who challenged Measure 113 in court after Secretary of State LaVonne Griffin-Valade invoked the law to bar them from running for reelection this year. Measure 113 disqualifies state senators and representatives from holding office in the next term if they rack up more than 10 unexcused absences in a single legislative session. The constitutional amendment was intended to curb the increasingly frequent problem of legislative walkouts in Salem, and Oregon voters overwhelmingly approved it in 2022. But Senate Republicans quickly defied the measure and staged a record-breaking six-week walkout during the 2023 session, primarily aimed at blocking a bill to strengthen protections for abortion and gender-affirming health care. Nine Republicans and one independent hit the limit for unexcused absences by the time the Senate reconvened at the end of the session. Griffin-Valade announced in August that she intended to enforce Measure 113 and disqualify any senators who hit the limit during the walkout. Republicans vowed to continue running their campaigns for 2024 and pledged to fight the decision in court, including by contesting the meaning of the language of the law. The group argued that the measure\'s exact wording — 10 or more unexcused absences ""shall disqualify the member from holding office as a Senator or Representative for the term following the election after the member\'s current term is completed"" — technically meant that the disqualification should happen in 2028, not 2024, because the 2024 election itself will be held before the end of the senators\' current terms. Griffin-Valade argued that Oregon courts have traditionally held that voter-approved ballot measures must be interpreted in a way that is consistent with the intent of the voters, and that based on the description in the voters\' pamphlet and media coverage leading up to the 2022 election, voters would have understood the measure to apply to the immediate next term. The parties sought to fast-track the case to the Oregon Supreme Court in order to provide clarity before the March 12 deadline for candidates to file to appear on the 2024 ballot. The court agreed to take up the case in October. In a media release Thursday morning, the court announced that it had unanimously upheld Griffin-Valade\'s decision. The court concluded that the exact wording of the measure was ambiguous enough to support both sides\' interpretations of the meaning, but Griffin-Valade\'s judgement won out because of the intent of the voters. ""If we were required to choose between petitioners\' and the secretary\'s interpretations based on the text alone, petitioners would have a strong argument that their reading is the better one,"" the court wrote in its opinion. ""But we do not review the text in a void. We instead seek to understand how voters would have understood the text in the light of the other materials that accompanied it. And those other materials expressly and uniformly informed voters that the amendment would apply to a legislator\'s immediate next terms of office, indicating that the voters so understood and intended that meaning."" Griffin-Valade repeated her argument about voter intent in a statement released Thursday morning acknowledging the ruling. ""I\'ve said from the beginning my intention was to support the will of the voters,"" she said. ""It was clear to me that voters intended for legislators with a certain number of absences in a legislative session to be immediately disqualified from seeking reelection. I’m thankful to the Oregon Supreme Court for providing clarity on how to implement Measure 113."" Senate Republican Leader Tim Knopp and Republican senators Suzanne Weber and Daniel Bonham, all of whom were among the group that challenged Griffin-Valade\'s decision, issued a news release Thursday acknowledging the ruling and asserting that the court ""sided with Democrats."" ""We obviously disagree with the Supreme Court’s ruling. But more importantly, we are deeply disturbed by the chilling impact this decision will have to crush dissent,"" Knopp said. In an interview with KGW, Knopp said the walkouts were worth it as they got Democrats to negotiate. ""We think it was a victory on principle and most of our members if you talk to them say they would do it again, I think they all would, quite frankly,"" he said. Knopp said he doesn\'t plan on appealing the ruling, but walkouts are still possible and the court\'s decision doesn\'t take that political tool away. ""The public does want some check and balance as it relates to a party’s ability to do whatever they want, I think Republicans are a principled bunch and if something comes up in the future, I think there’s a strong possibility [a walkout] could happen again,"" He said. The ruling has no immediate impact in terms of the lawmakers seated for the upcoming 2024 legislative session, because all 10 of the senators who walked out for at least 10 days last year are serving terms that run through either the end of 2024 or the end of 2026. However, it does mean that all 10 of those senators are disqualified from running for a new term either this year or in 2026, depending on when their current term ends. The impacted senators are: Boquist, Linthicum, Knopp, Findley, Hansel and Robinson would all have been up for reelection this year. Hansell and Findley have both announced that they will retire at the end of their current terms, but Knopp, Linthicum and Robinson all filed to run in 2024 on the first possible day last year. Boquist does not appear to have filed as of Feb. 1, according to Secretary of State records. In effect, Republicans are now forced to replace most Senate members within the next three years. Tung Yin, a Lewis & Clark law professor, told KGW that an appeal of the Oregon Supreme Court\'s ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court feels like a tall task, all things considered, and the court\'s decision adds more legal weight to items like the voters\' pamphlet and ballot title for future cases. ""The idea that you might look outside the actual language [of the ballot measure] is not controversial, some justices support that,"" Yin said. ""It\'s probably a pretty good argument to say the voters weren\'t tricked. Let\'s face it, what are voters really reading more, the actual [text] of the ballot measure itself, or the handy explanation that\'s put out.""
