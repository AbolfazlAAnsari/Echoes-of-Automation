KELLY GERLACH Street reconstruction, housing developments, hirings and firings, the new jail, taxation — I knew we’d talk about them all inside this final Sentinel-Press of 2021. It’s the edition in which we revisit 2021 happenings. I never thought that as we embarked on New Year 2022 — a fresh year with exciting changes ahead for the city of Maquoketa and Jackson County — that a black cloud would continue to loom. COVID-19. We’re still living with it. And we’re still reporting on it — even though we wish we weren’t. In last week’s Sentinel-Press, we reported on local hospitals’ public appeals for everyone to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Public health officials said the situation is “worse than it’s ever been.” And barely half of Jackson County’s residents — about 54% — have started or completed the vaccination process as hospitals report being overrun with COVID-19 patients and medical staff say they’re exhausted by the never-ending onslaught of patients. So please, get vaccinated and take precautions in public. If not for yourself, then for family, friends, the public, a return to quasi-normalcy, to free up hospital beds, to give medical staff some clean breathing space and a little time. Consider it a gift to yourself and the world. But this year-end column isn’t all doom and gloom. Big changes have come or are coming to Maquoketa and Jackson County, attempts to grow, improve, achieve, and succeed in the new year. Here are some of the highlights, in no particular order: • New Maquoketa leadership takes over: City manager Josh Boldt begins his duties Jan. 11. Tom Messerli resumes his role as mayor. Richard Rickerl started in his elected role as 4th Ward councilman. The Maquoketa Police Department starts a new regime under Chief Brendan Zeimet. • The Maquoketa Community School Board searches for new leadership. Superintendent Chris Hoover resigned effective June 30. • Kelley Brown has been leading the Jackson County Economic Alliance for about three months, trying to assist and grow business and industry countywide. Various infrastructure projects also will get underway or resume in the new year. • Tschiggfrie Excavating will resume the Platt Street reconstruction project, this time focusing on the east half of the city. • Brian Kraus of BSM2 Development LLC purchased 8 acres of city-owned property at Western Avenue and Summit Street, with plans to convert it into 28 dwellings. • Jackson County and Maquoketa will partner to construct a new bridge on South Main Street for motorists and pedestrians. • Also, construction of the new Jackson County Jail should begin sometime in the new year at Jacobsen Drive and East Maple Street in Maquoketa. Voters passed the jail bond referendum on the third try last March. New businesses pop up and existing ones expand. Look for more coverage of those in the new year, as well. Despite rocky times, incivilities, atrocities, and an ongoing pandemic that only seems to worsen with ignorance, I’m excited to see how all these changes advance our community. Despite doom and gloom, maintain your optimism for great things to come in the new year. KELLY GERLACH Overcast. Slight chance of a rain shower. High 68F. Winds NE at 5 to 10 mph. Partly cloudy.

Times Herald as editor and general assignment reporter, respectively. Two Iowa journalists are joining the Carroll Times Herald staff, bringing their ability to work as a team to the Carroll-area news landscape. One’s an Iowa State University alum, the other a University of Iowa graduate. The two 24-year-old journalists now work for different papers in Iowa. But on Nov. 1, Trevor Babcock, a writer with the Marshalltown Times Republican, and Sarah Stortz, a reporter with the Oskaloosa Herald, will start in the Carroll Times Herald newsroom — Babcock as editor, and Stortz as a general-assignment reporter. Stortz will be the first reporter at the Times Herald to bring television experience as she previously worked as the social-media content producer for KWWL-TV in Waterloo-Cedar Falls. “I have always heard about the Carroll Times Herald being one of the better newspapers in Iowa,” Babcock said. “The other part of that is that it is not only one of the better newspapers, but it is also one of the better newspapers in a small town in Iowa. I think that’s super rare that a smaller town in Iowa has a paper with such a good reputation. It is the perfect match.” Rebecca McKinsey Babcock and Stortz succeed former Times Herald crime and courts reporter Jared Strong and editor Rebecca McKinsey, whose last day at the Times Herald will be Nov. 5. McKinsey is leaving to work as the project manager and editor of the “INvisible Project,” a magazine produced by the U.S. Pain Foundation, a national nonprofit organization that works with people with chronic pain. Strong now is the agriculture/environment reporter for Iowa Capital Dispatch. Under an arrangement with Iowa newspapers, Strong’s byline and work will still appear regularly in the Times Herald — just on different subjects. “Over the last two decades, the Times Herald has earned a reputation as an incubator for some of the more talented young journalists in Iowa,” said Douglas Burns, co-owner of the newspaper. “Sarah and Trevor are eager to work here, want to be in Carroll at this newspaper, and I have no doubt they will carry on a tradition of excellence while bringing a greater focus on feature and education stories to complement our strong government, business and courts coverage.” Longtime Carroll newspaperman Larry Devine remains as executive editor, as does sports editor Mark Schafer. Burns is a regular contributor to the news pages as well. Trevor Babcock Babcock, who grew up in Panora and graduated from Panorama High School, went on to major in journalism and mass communication at Iowa State University before joining the Marshalltown newspaper. At Iowa State, Babcock served as the arts and entertainment editor for the school newspaper. Stortz, a Cedar Falls native, graduated with a bachelor’s degree in journalism and mass communication from the University of Iowa. She served as the arts editor for the Daily Iowan in addition to being a digital media producer. She is a general assignment reporter covering a wide range of subjects in Oskaloosa. The couple have dated for two years — they met on Twitter as the arts editors at their respective college newspapers and went on their first date in Des Moines after getting to know each other for several months. They will arrive in Carroll as a journalism team. Sarah Stortz “I’m really excited about this,” Stortz said. “I think we both have really good news judgment, and so I am confident we will work well together to break a story or write a really great feature. We already work in small towns, so we are enthusiastic about meeting all the people and fostering a bunch of relationships, too.” Babcock said he enjoys community journalism and wants to make it his career. “One of my favorite parts of working in Marshalltown was how I got to know the community over time,” Babcock said. “And that is what I am really looking forward to when I get to Carroll is just introducing myself to people and figuring out the character behind Carroll and seeing what the town’s personality is like.” Stortz said that in addition to writing, she enjoys photography and drawing. “I also really like traveling, and I have been to a few countries and different cities in the United States,” she said. “We are both kind of nerdy people,” Babcock added. “Sarah likes to read. We like to hang out and watch movies and play video games, stuff like that.” They also have two cats, Julius and Mordecai. McKinsey, 31, has worked at the Times Herald for eight years, starting in 2013 as a journalism fellow and then returning in 2014 as a reporter. She was named the Times Herald’s editor in 2018. During her years at the Times Herald, she has covered education, local government, general features and more, in addition to bolstering the newspaper’s online presence. She has been recognized with numerous statewide and national writing awards, including twice being named a top young journalist in Iowa. “More than anyone with whom I have worked, Rebecca and I share the same journalism worldview and approach to a newspaper’s role in the community,” Burns said. “I 100 percent trust her news judgment, especially on really, really hard calls about when to publish and when to pass. She’s made my stories stronger and is the best confidant I have in the business. I will miss her in the newsroom. She’s made me a better, more thoughtful journalist — and person, for that matter — through her editing guidance and her own example of always leading with empathy, of seeing things from the perspectives of others — which is, after all, what makes Rebecca a superior journalist.” McKinsey will remain in Carroll with her partner Steve Ballou and their three cats, as her new position is remote. “I’m very grateful for my years with the Times Herald and the stories I’ve had a chance to tell here,” McKinsey said. “I’ve worked alongside some incredible journalists here over the years, and I’ll miss being a part of this newsroom.” Log In Keep it Clean.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS (September 24, 2021) — The unemployment rate decreased over-the-year in all fourteen Illinois metropolitan areas in August for the fifth straight month according to preliminary data were released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES). Jobs were up in all metro areas, with the exception of the Bloomington Metropolitan Statistical Area. “As reopening and recovery efforts continue to impact metro areas across the state, IDES is committed to continuing to assist both claimants and jobseekers who are still looking to reenter the workforce,” said Deputy Governor Andy Manar. “Claimants are encouraged to utilize IllinoisJobLink.com to search for work opportunities and take advantage of assistance the Department can provide with workforce development, including job trainings and résumé building.” Over-the-year, total non-farm jobs increased in thirteen metropolitan areas and decreased in one (Bloomington MSA, -0.6%, -500). The metro areas which had the largest over-the-year percentage increases in total nonfarm jobs were the Springfield MSA (+3.5%, +3,600); the Davenport-Moline-Rock Island IA-IL MSA (+3.1%, +5,400), the Chicago Metro Division (+2.9%, +102,200), and the Peoria MSA (+2.9%, +4,700). The industries that saw job growth in a majority of metro areas included: Leisure and Hospitality (fourteen areas); Transportation, Warehousing, and Public Utilities (eleven areas); Other Services and Government (ten areas each); Manufacturing and Educational and Health Services (nine areas each). Over-the-year, the unemployment rate decreased in all fourteen metropolitan areas; the metro areas with the largest unemployment rate-decreases were the Chicago-Naperville-Arlington Heights Metropolitan Division (-5.5 points to 7.5%), the Elgin Metropolitan Division (-3.2 points to 6.1%), and the Lake County-Kenosha County, IL-WI Metropolitan Division (-2.7 points to 5.3%). The unemployment rate also decreased over-the-year in all 102 counties for the fifth consecutive month. Not Seasonally Adjusted Unemployment Rates, Davenport-Moline-Rock Island, IA-IL MSA The not seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 percent in August 2021 from 7.5 percent in August 2020. The last time the August rate was equal to or lower was in 2019 when it was 3.9 percent. Total non-farm employment increased +5,400 compared to August 2020. The Financial Activities (-100) and Information (-100) sectors recorded employment declines compared to one year ago. The Government (+1,200), Manufacturing (+1,100), Construction (+900), Educational-Health Services (+800), and Leisure-Hospitality (+800) sectors reported the largest payroll gains. The unemployment rate identifies those who are out of work and seeking employment. A person who exhausts benefits, or is ineligible, still will be reflected in the unemployment rate if they actively seek work. Note: Monthly 2020 unemployment rates and total nonfarm jobs for Illinois metro areas were revised in February and March 2021, as required by the US BLS. Comments and tables distributed for prior metro-area news-releases should be discarded as any records or historical analysis previously cited may no longer be valid. The official monthly unemployment rate series for metro areas, counties, and most cities begins in 1990. The official monthly non-farm jobs series for metro areas begins in 1990 and for non-metropolitan counties it begins in 1999.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 4:39 pm Clinton’s Joe Simpson poses May 13 at Brady Street Stadium. Simpson is using a new glide technique in his discus throws to great results, and is the top shot put thrower in the area. DAVENPORT — Joe Simpson has a special recipe for getting fired up before a throw. “I don’t know, maybe make weird noises, just grunt and have people slap me in the back,” Simpson said, laughing. “Just weird stuff.” He said perfecting an ideal grunt is an art form. “You just can’t hold back,” Simpson said. “You can’t be nervous or scared that people are going to judge you.” Simpson, a senior at Clinton, qualified for the IHSAA State Track and Field Meet in the discus and shot put after placing first in both events at a Class 4A State Qualifying Meet at Brady Street Stadium Thursday at Davenport. Clinton throws coach Mike Griswold said Simpson’s success come as no surprise. “He’s not a big DI offensive lineman, but he’s one of the strongest kids at Clinton High,” Griswold said. “People don’t see that just because he’s kind of smaller in stature. Joe is the most confident kid I’ve ever met. He’s had to tell me a couple times, ‘Coach, I got this.’ His confidence is just amazing. “When we went out to (the Drake Relays), the goal was to get a 48 footer, then he threw 50. He was like, ‘Hey man, I got this.’ And then he throws 51, then 52 — he just builds on his own confidence and he’s so easy to work with because I can tell him something and then he just goes and does it.” Simpson’s PR in the discus (158-00) comes after he and Griswold made a major change to his form. Simpson has been battling tendonitis in his foot, which has limited his spin. After the Mississippi Athletic Conference meet last week, he and Griswold developed a glide technique that has helped Simpson overcome the foot issue. “No one does it, it’s weird,” Griswold said. “He did it and threw a bomb, and we were like, ‘Hey, let’s do it.’ We practiced it all week and he came out and threw it awesome. People were kind of making fun of him, but we don’t care — he’s throwing it far.” In the shot put, Simpson won with a 54-05.5 after his four previous throws were 52-05.5. Even so, that wasn’t good enough for him. “Not really,” Simpson said.”I wanted a lot more just because I’m trying to win that state championship and those guys are good, so I’ve got to chase those big numbers. My form was just a little bit off today. I’m missing a few feet, but I was happy my last throw was a lot further than my first five.” Simpson’s PR is a 55-08, but he wants to hit a 57 or 58 at state. Griswold and Simpson both think the atmosphere at state — and the fact that the discus and shot put are on separate days — will help hype him up. At the state qualifying meet, a Pleasant Valley thrower had a big throw, causing an eruption of applause. Simpson’s best throw of the day was directly after that. “He feeds on the competition,” Griswold said. “Even today, the PV kid threw a really good throw and that jacked Joe up. He just loves the competition. He just gets it. Fine tuning those things, we tell him, ‘All it takes is one,’ and if he puts everything together, we’re definitely in the 57, 58 range for sure.” Simpson didn’t mince words — he has his eyes set on No. 1. The way things have been going, he might just be a few good grunts away from the top. “I want to be No. 1 for sure,” Simpson said. “People say it’s hard to reach, but obviously it’s going to be. I’m not going to count myself out. You’ve got to set those big goals and then work to achieve them, and so far, it’s going well.” Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.

A speed camera is shown on the 2300 block of South Cody Road in LeClaire in July 2021. In just over four months, LeClaire has issued more than 39,000 citations to motorists caught on the city\'s two speed-enforcement cameras. In January, offenders were issued warnings, but the system went live on March 6. From that date until July 16, 39,015 fines have been levied, totaling $2,749,775. As a comparison, Davenport\'s eight automated-enforcement locations generated about $1.5 million in citation revenue during the 2019-2020 fiscal year. One of LeClaire\'s cameras is on Interstate 80, just before the I-80 bridge. The other is in the 2300 block of Highway 67, or South Cody Road. They measure the speed of vehicles traveling in both directions. LeClaire\'s city clerk, Tracy Northcutt, said the traffic-safety impact of the system had not yet been analyzed. While automated enforcement often is unpopular among the motoring public and some criticize the cameras as mere money grabs, the number of violations suggest a credible speeding problem. LeClaire police say they already knew that. When the cameras were introduced in January, Police Chief Shane Themas said the city was targeting high-risk areas where crash numbers were attributed to speeding. ""In the last 10 years, there have been a total of 334 vehicular accidents on I-80 and Highway 67, just within our corporate city limits,"" Themas said. ""These have included a total of 552 vehicles, three fatalities and over 115 injuries."" Citations are issued in five categories for speed over the posted limit: 6 to 10 mph; 11 to 20 mph; 21 to 25 mph; 26 to 30 mph and over 30 mph above the posted speed. While speeds exceeding the posted limit by 1 to 5 mph is included in the list of infractions, no citations were issued for that category. The highest number of citations, by far, is for speeds between 11 and 20 mph over the limit, with 30,951 tickets for $75 each. That\'s more than $2.3 million in fines. Northcutt said it was too soon to say what percentage of the fines had or would be paid. The revenue will go into LeClaire\'s general fund, she said, adding that the city council has not yet decided how the money will be spent. In many cities in Iowa, all or most of the enforcement-camera revenue is used for public safety costs. Subscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.

The other is third-generation law enforcement. Both received promotions to the new position of sergeant with the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office. Deputies Brandon Beck and Chad Gruver earned advancements to sergeant, Sheriff Brent Kilburg announced during the Jackson County Board of Supervisors meeting last week. “This is a new position within our department,” Kilburg said. “We felt it would help to add structure to the organization, delegate responsibilities, and provide professional growth throughout the department.” The sheriff said the sergeant ranking comes with greater expectations and responsibilities. Beck began his law enforcement career as a reserve officer with the Sabula Police Department. The city made it a full-time position, to patrol officer, in 2001; Beck also worked part-time as an officer with the Preston Police Department. Two years later, Beck joined the sheriff’s office in the jail division, then became a deputy in 2004. He attended the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy, where he graduated as vice president of his class. Beck currently works as investigator for the sheriff’s office as well as an evidence technician. During his tenure with the county, Beck obtained numerous certifications, including becoming a certified mobile forensics analyst and a data recovery specialist. He most recently completed training for supervision and management of investigative units. Gruver’s law enforcement career began a decade before Beck but in the same place. Gruver was an officer with the Sabula PD in 1991 and graduated from the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy the following year. He worked for police departments in Sabula and Preston, where he was chief, and the Maquoketa PD. Gruver devoted three years to the Clinton County Sheriff’s Office in the jail division and earned his associate’s degree in criminal justice before being hired by the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office in 2008. Gruver’s law enforcement career includes being the county’s K-9 handler from 2008-10 and 2012-18. He also served as mayor of Preston from 2013-16.

successfully ends despite concerns. This past week, students across campus participated in FSL fall Panhellenic recruitment week, where fraternities and sororities sought to increase their numbers with a new class of members. FSL expressed excitement for being able to host in-person events for the first time since 2019. However, with the excitement came caution as new COVID-19 cases remain a prevalent factor in the turnout for sorority recruitment both at Drake and around the U.S. “Nationally, sorority recruitment participation has been low, and I believe that is because of the hybrid aspects of restrictions and leniency plus the fact COVID-19 is still present in our lives,” said Anna Sutterer, VP of recruitment on the Panhellenic Council. Sorority life on campus saw 136 potential new members (PNM) participate in recruitment events with 115 signing bids to join a house at the end of the week. “Overall, I was upset by the numbers the night the application closed,” Sutterer said. “However, taking a closer look at sorority recruitment at a national level, our campus was right on track, which makes me feel a lot better.” Each sorority at Drake has a limit on the number of new members who can join each semester. Despite this limit, reports from Sutterer showed that 95% of PNM’s were matched with their first choice. Fraternity life on campus was able to get a total of 67 bids signed. In addition to the COVID challenges faced by sororities, recent news added another concern for fraternities in finding new members. Last month, reports of sexual assault came to light among fraternities in the United States, most notably from Phi Gamma Delta at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. With the backlash that followed, Drake fraternities began to worry about being grouped in with these chapters. “I was kind of worried about bringing people into this community when there are stories like this that give the whole fraternity system a bad name,” Sam Rothbardt, a member of Theta Chi Fraternity, said. The concern about fraternities and their image was also in the minds of some first-year students. “Even though I have not heard anything of a similar nature come to light at Drake, I think when a fraternity has a scandal like this anywhere, it makes people reevaluate any involvement with these houses,” first-year student and new Sigma Alpha Epsilon member Will Schultz said. Despite the backlash of fraternity life in the news and fears of COVID-19 breakouts, 67 students became new members of Drake fraternities. Sigma Phi Epsilon received the highest number of new members, with 21 students joining the fraternity. “Loosening restrictions definitely helped us get a larger number than last year, but I would say that our recruiting team and executive council were the ones who deserve the credit. They did an awesome job,” Sigma Phi Epsilon member Vince Carioti said. Despite the negative stories about fraternities and fears of a COVID-19 outbreak, fall Panhellenic recruitment returned to campus as a traditional in-person event, and tradition remains alive for the FSL community.

Saturday, June 1, 2024 — Auditor’s Office Open from 7am to 3pm for absentee voting at Memorial Building Saturday CHICAGO (70) Buffalo Bisons catcher Payton Henry was hospitalized overnight after he was struck by a batter’s backswing and carted off the field on a stretcher. Henry was hit in the back of the head by the swing from Syracuse Mets third baseman Pablo Reyes in the seventh inning Friday night. He immediately went to the ground upon contact and athletic trainers tended to him. Officials decided not to continue the game after the injury. The Bisons said in a statement Saturday that Henry was discharged from the hospital and “doing well as he continues to rest and recover.” Retired quarterback and Super Bowl champion Drew Brees made it clear he wants a second chance to be on the call of NFL games. After retiring following the 2020 season, Brees immediately went to work for NBC. He largely split his time as an analyst for Notre Dame football and as a voice on the network\'s ""Sunday Night Football"" studio show. He was in the booth during two NFL games. He spent one year with the network, which announced before the 2022 season that Brees wouldn\'t be back for family considerations. A New York Post report at the time said Brees wanted to be in the booth for NFL games and out of the studio, adding that NBC didn\'t see a future for Brees as a backup for, or heir apparent to, Cris Collinsworth. But in a post to social media on Saturday, Brees, 45, said he would welcome a return to ""SNF"" or one of its primetime competitors. ""SNF, MNF or Thursday Night Football. Come get me when you\'re ready! Until then I\'m coaching ball,"" the father of four wrote on X, formerly Twitter. He accompanied his post with a clip from a news conference earlier this week in which he addressed his broadcasting aspirations. ""The thing that I wanted to do most that I felt like I could bring the most value at was broadcasting NFL games,"" Brees said. ""And it was the thing I had the least opportunity to do, right? I was able to do a little bit of college at Notre Dame. Just two NFL games broadcasting that were eight weeks apart and then the studio stuff, right? But, man, I love the game and I would love to broadcast NFL games, you know, at some point again. I think I could be the best at it."" With the NFL spreading the rights to broadcast games beyond the traditional networks -- Netflix has the Christmas Day package in its first foray into the NFL, for example -- Brees could have a chance to get back in the booth. But the primetime jobs Brees said he covets are taken. Collinsworth is entrenched at NBC and at ""SNF."" Troy Aikman provides the commentary for longtime partner Joe Buck for ESPN\'s ""Monday Night Football."" And Kirk Herbstreit handles the Thursday night duties on Amazon Prime. No. 1 jobs at CBS and Fox Sports are taken, too. Tony Romo is a fixture at CBS alongside partner Jim Nantz. And Tom Brady is scheduled to make his much-anticipated debut as the top analyst for Fox Sports this fall, bumping Greg Olsen to the No. 2 team. Brees has something to look forward to down the road, however. He is likely to be elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on the first ballot when he becomes eligible in 2026. Brees spent his career with the San Diego Chargers (2001-05) and New Orleans Saints (2006-20). A 13-time Pro Bowl selection and a 2006 All-Pro, Brees was the MVP of Super Bowl XLIV in 2010. He is second to Tom Brady in a number of career statistical categories, including passing yards (80,358), touchdown passes (571) and completions (7,142). --Field Level Media PARIS (AP) — Grand Slam winners Elena Rybakina and Aryna Sabalenka reached the fourth round of the French Open in straight sets on Saturday.

The gloves will be used as a tool at the Webster County Jail and were purchased with funds donated by the Webster County Crime Stoppers. Jailers at the Webster County Jail now have a new tool to help subdue unruly and violent inmates, thanks to a donation from Webster County Crime Stoppers. The jail recently obtained a pair of electric shock gloves known as Generated Low Output Voltage Emitter, or GLOVE, which is a safer and more sustainable alternative to using a Taser in close quarters like a jail cell, Jail Administrator Shawna Dencklau told the Crime Stoppers board on Friday morning. Dencklau and Jailer Anthony Valenti attended Friday’s meeting to give the Crime Stoppers board a demonstration of the new device. “No facility in Iowa utilizes these, so we’re actually one of the very first ones to have them,” Dencklau said, noting that she believes the Humboldt County Jail also recently purchased a set. “Anything we do in the jail has to be approved by the Iowa Jail Inspector, and he is behind these wholeheartedly after I’ve trained him and zapped him with them on Tuesday.” During its October meeting, Webster County Crime Stoppers approved a $2,300 donation to the jail for the purchase of the electric shock gloves from Compliant Technologies of Lexington, Kentucky. The donation also funded the purchase of an E-Band Restrictor made by the same company. -Messenger photo by Kelby Wingert Webster County Jail Administrator Shawna Dencklau shows off the new electric shock gloves the jail purchased with a donation from Webster County Crime Stoppers. Dencklau gave the Crime Stoppers board a demonstration of the gloves on Friday morning. “These are going to be a deterrent, basically a distraction,” Dencklau said.. She said one of the biggest concerns with using a Taser in a small jail cell is the inmate falling and “cracking his head” or injuring themselves in other ways. “So we’re hesitant to use Tasers most of the time, because we have to outweigh the risks of using them,” she said. The GLOVE, when touched to human skin, will generate an output of 210 volts of electricity, intensifying up to 320 volts, depending on how long it is held to the skin. Dencklau said the effect of the device is to subdue the inmate, not to completely disable them like a Taser would. “Unlike the Taser, this only going onto the nerves and the body part,” she said. “It does not go into the tissue or the muscle … there’s no need to take (the inmate) out to the emergency room to have them checked out or anything like that.” -Messenger photo by Kelby Wingert Webster County Jail Administrator Shawna Dencklau and Jailer Anthony Valenti demonstrate the new electric shock gloves purchased by the jail with funds donated by the Webster County Crime Stoppers. The gloves will be used as a compliance tool with inmates who are behaving unruly or violent toward staff or other inmates. Once the glove is released from the skin, the shock stops and the recipient is left with a tingling sensation. All of the correctional officers at the Webster County Jail have been trained and certified in using the GLOVE, which includes experiencing being “zapped” by it, Dencklau said. The gloves will begin being carried by correctional officers on duty starting on Monday. Because the set does not need to be together to be used, two officers will be able to carry a GLOVE on each shift. “Hopefully it’s not something we use everyday, but it’s something we can use to better protect ourselves,” Dencklau said. Dencklau said the E-Band Restrictor, which goes around the ankle, will be useful for when officers have to take inmates out of the jail for trials and doctors appointments, when the inmate cannot be shackled. She said it will also be useful for inmates who cannot be shackled because they may have a prosthetic limb. In the case of the E-Band, the inmate would wear it around their ankle and the correctional officer would have a remote and would push a button on the remote to set off a zap the same intensity as the gloves, in the event the inmate attempted to escape or became violent. Dencklau shared her gratitude to the Webster County Crime Stoppers board for donating the funds to purchase the new devices. -Messenger photo by Kelby Wingert Webster County Jail Administrator Shawna Dencklau and Jailer Anthony Valenti demonstrated the new electric shock gloves and ankle band at Friday's Webster County Crime Stoppers Meeting.

Jackson was a state placewinner at MHS and a national junior college champion at Ellsworth prior to being a national qualifier at Iowa State. Jackson also coached 25 years between Ballard and Des Moines East. In a pre-meet ceremony to honor former Bobcat standout Larry Jackson, Marshalltown High School head wrestling coach Mike Mann hoped his squad would get all the motivation it needed to knock off seventh-ranked Ankeny. The inspiration only worked so much for a Bobcat starting lineup so shorthanded. Marshalltown surrendered five forfeits to the Class 3A No. 7 Hawks, and Ankeny left the Roundhouse with a 55-20 victory in Thursday’s CIML wrestling match. Ankeny won five of the eight contested matches — four by bonus points — in spite of wrestling without three of its six ranked competitors in the lineup. The Hawks were ahead 22-0 by the time MHS sophomore Luke Hageman got the Bobcats on the scoreboard with his 8-0 major decision of Porter Drost at 132 pounds, but Marshalltown didn’t strike again until Dylano Castellanos started the team’s strong finish with his major decision at 170. T-R PHOTO BY ROSS THEDE - Marshalltown sophomore Luke Hageman, top, has the upper hand against Ankeny’s Porter Drost during their 132-pound match in Thursday’s CIML wrestling dual at the Roundhouse. Hageman won by major decision, 8-0. “We went over to huddle before we came out for the introductions, and I didn’t need to say much more,” Mann said, recognizing his former Bobcat teammate Jackson. “If you don’t get inspired by a story of a Marshalltown Bobcat coming back here and all the great things he did and all the teachers that helped him — more important even than the wrestling part — I can’t help you.” Marshalltown honored Jackson, a 1981 graduate, for his November induction into the Iowa Chapter of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame while also inducting him into the MHS Hall of Pride. Jackson was a team captain for head coach Phil Henning and voted the team’s Most Outstanding Wrestler in 1981 at 155 pounds. Jackson finished fifth in the state tournament that year, before continuing his academic and athletic career at Ellsworth Community College in Iowa Falls. “This award means so, so much to me,” Jackson said. “The people here at Marshalltown High School made a big difference in my life, and I can never, never thank them enough. Thank you all for celebrating this with me.” Jackson was a NJCAA National runner-up in 1982, going 33-2 in helping the Panthers place third as a team. The following season he was named the Outstanding Wrestler of the District Tournament and he went 37-0 on his way to an NJCAA National championship. Jackson was selected to the All-Iowa Team in 1982 and won the 1983 Pan-American Games in Cali, Colombia. T-R PHOTO BY ROSS THEDE - Marshalltown junior Dylano Castellanos, right, moves in for a takedown against Ankeny’s Gage Ouverson during their 170-pound match in Thursday’s dual meet at the Roundhouse. Castellanos scored a 16-6 major decision. Jackson, who was enshrined into the Ellsworth CC Hall of Fame in 1997, went on to wrestle at Iowa State from 1983-1986. He placed third in the Big 8 Conference Tournament in 1985 and qualified for the NCAA Championships. During his 25-year head coaching career, Jackson spent nine seasons at Ballard and 16 at Des Moines East, helping to guide 54 state qualifiers, 12 placewinners and one state champion while compiling 150 career dual-meet victories. Jackson also donated his time, energy and knowledge to the Hammer Time Wrestling Academy in Des Moines for the last 12 years. “He’s always been a great inspiration, a great success story,” said Mann, a 1978 MHS graduate. “If that didn’t fire up the kids, I don’t know what to say.” Three of Marshalltown’s four wins came in the final five weights, as Castellanos delivered a 16-6 major decision over Gage Ouverson at 170. The Bobcats forfeited at 182, and Ankeny’s William Hinrichs edged out Gannon Williams for a 5-3 decision at 195. T-R PHOTO BY ROSS THEDE Marshalltown’s fifth-ranked Carson Williams accepted Ankeny’s only forfeit at 195, and Julian Gomez closed out the dual with a second-period pin of Zach Pelinski. “There were some good things Dylano did, Luke Hageman did, but some of the other guys are still not adjusting to what the other guy is doing and they’re not taking the tie-ups that they need to be taking,” Mann said. “We’re getting a little better on our defense. We’re still working on trying to get guys to adjust to the things that we’re showing them and we’re a little bit perplexed why they’re not making those connections. “We just keep drilling the same things and trying to get them to go through that and hopefully they’re going to connect the dots and put their technique together and finish a move. You saw some moves tonight that we executed and then we didn’t finish. We’ve got to put a couple moves together offensively on our feet and from underneath and on top.” Marshalltown moves on to visit Des Moines Lincoln on Saturday for a 9 a.m. tournament.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 2:47 pm There were no injuries after a Union Pacific Railroad train crashed Sunday afternoon in Sibley. The wreck derailed 47 cars, caused no environmental damage and inspired first responders and city of 2,600 to pull together in the crisis. SIBLEY—Everyone is safe after a Union Pacific Railroad train derailed, resulting in a fiery pileup of train cars on Sunday — an incident that rocked the town of Sibley and galvanized first responders and volunteers across N’West Iowa as well as state and federal authorities. The 47-car crash happened a few minutes after 2 p.m. in the southwestern part of the Osceola County seat community of about 2,600. The cause of the derailment is yet to be determined. The Federal Railroad Administration is “actively investigating” the incident, an administration spokesperson told The REVIEW. The main event in Sibley on that Sunday was supposed to be commencement. Fifty-eight seniors received their diplomas from Sibley-Ocheyedan High School in a ceremony that started at 2 p.m. Among them was Logan Huls, the fire chief’s son. The elder Huls recalled those last quiet minutes before the crash. “We had our seats, nice seats, and a gentleman behind me said ‘Wouldn’t it suck if you got a page right now?’ and I said ‘Yeah, it would,’” Ken Huls said. And that’s exactly what happened. “It was about two minutes into it — and sure, you know what — my pager goes off. Now, I’m looking for my son, and hope it ain’t nothing major so I can let my guys do it and I can stay.” The chief stepped out of the gym to get the message, and he immediately knew he had to go. He scanned the processional line but could not pick out Logan in the homogeneous mix of caps and gowns. It wouldn’t be until Monday night when the Hulses reunited. “He just came up, wrapped his arms around me and ‘Oh God, I’m glad you’re OK, Dad,’ and I said ‘Logan, I am so sorry,’ and he goes ‘Shoot, Dad, who cares? I got my diploma.’” Brandon Honkomp also got his diploma. The graduate said he noticed some stirrings during commencement but did not find out until after walking the stage. After leaving campus and learning what happened, he zipped out of town with classmates Abbie Bos and Bert Ortiz. Sibley-Ocheyedan High School graduates Abbie Bos, Bert Ortiz and Brandon Honkomp watch the fire from a safe distance after commencement was held earlier that day. Bos called the commotion “crazy” while Ortiz remembered the burgeoning tension during the ceremony. “People got phone calls then they were out, so I knew something was going on,” Ortiz said. The mood softened once the trio put some distance between them and the ablaze railcars, parking on the corner of 170th Street and Oak Hill Avenue. Honkomp put a positive spin on the scare. “Hey, now I have a story,” he said. The teens were not the only ones who took refuge on the country roads. “We grabbed the dogs and ran,” Elisha Agena said. She and her 23-year-old son, Jacob, got leashes on pups Murphy and Shaggy before taking off in their pickup. They parked next to fellow Sibley resident Clifford Pearson and his own canine, Markee. “I heard it rambling through town, but it didn’t sound good,” Pearson said of the train. He added he had some experience with dangerous cargo while working 30 years at JBS pork plant in Worthington, MN. He said the situation instantly felt like “bad news.” Clifford Pearson — with his dog Markee — discusses the fiery derailment with Elisha and Jacob Agena — with Murphy and Shaggy — while they wait outside their hometown of Sibley. The citizens said they could smell the burning wreckage long before a public HAZMAT alert was sent to phones in the area at 3:10 p.m. The warning was sent out after Huls, acting as emergency command, learned one of the derailed cars was carrying ammonium nitrate. Later that afternoon, workers determined the car that Union Pacific designated for the highly explosive fertilizer was empty. Only small traces of residue might have remained. Huls said that was fortunate since he did not have the manpower to enforce the five-mile radius the U.S. Department of Transportation recommends for potential ammonium fires. The fire still burned through large amounts of toxic material, including hydrochloric acid and potassium hydroxide. The former substance being an environmental hazard and latter exploding when mixed with water. Huls said that combination led to him not trying to extinguish the fire immediately. “If we chose to put water on that fire, now we have a chemical that reacts to water,” the chief said. “So we decided if it’s burning itself, let it burn. We’ll just safe it up and get everybody out.” The blaze produced billowing black clouds of smoke that could be seen 25 miles away. The highlighted area shows the parts of Sibley that were evacuated during the aftermath of the Union Pacific derailment. The residential Broadmoor Addition was the most effected area. At least 80 Sibley residents were evacuated, mostly from the Broadmoor Addition neighborhood. First responders went door to door in the small subdivision that contains almost all residences on the west side of the tracks. A few commercial blocks on the east side also were shut down. Until Monday morning, anyone leaving the city limits was not allowed back. The Ashton Legion Community Center was made available to accommodate those temporarily displaced, and Union Pacific paid for food at McDonald’s and Hy-Vee in Sheldon. The flames were put out by 3 a.m. on Tuesday when fire departments assisted the Union Pacific response team in hosing down the inferno after it was determined to be safe to extinguish. A probe into what caused the wreck is still ongoing. Union Pacific spokesperson Kristen South said “every derailment is different” and she could not speculate on anything not already known. “I’ve seen it take weeks and I’ve seen it take months,” South said of incident investigations. The railroad bridge in Sibley was ruled out as a cause after incorrect reports said that it had collapsed or “destroyed,” as state Rep. John Wills (R-Spirit Lake) said on Monday morning in a Facebook post. That same morning, Huls told The REVIEW that the bridge “was not related and is still intact.” On Wednesday, trains resumed using the track without complications. Union Pacific paid for damages at the crash site. South said the company does not disclose payment information. The Sibley incident was the second Union Pacific derailment in as many days. A company train went off the rails in Albert Lea, MN, on Saturday, May 15, and spilled 40,000 gallons of hydrochloric acid. The ecological cost in N’West Iowa was less drastic. The Environmental Protection Agency said in a Thursday statement that “the chemicals were captured on-site and secured before any damage could be done.” The Iowa Department of Natural Resources — which said Monday it would be “determining any appropriate enforcement” — directed questions about the cleanup to South’s office. South said her company’s team deployed spill-containment equipment known as “boom” in Otter Creek — a stream that runs next to the tracks — as soon as it got to the scene Sunday evening. “That boom is a precaution to keep anything that might get into the water out and to prevent it from spreading,” South said. “Basically, if you think of a sponge, it sucks up anything that would be in the water other than the water itself.” Concerning the federal government’s role of “actively investigating,” the Federal Railroad Administration spokesperson who spoke to The REVIEW said the administration does not have day-to-day control, but is working directly with Union Pacific “on several safety issues to provide oversight and maintain communication.” Flames flick into the Monday night sky in Sibley. The blaze at Union Pacific crash site was extinuished a few hours later at about 3 a.m. Tuesday. The train had been heading south from South St. Paul, MN, to North Platte, NE. In the roughly 72 hours the tracks were closed, trains that would have traveled through Sibley had to be rerouted. Detours for southbound trains went to Mason City while northbound trains had to divert more than 400 miles east to Chicago. According to estimates from a U.S. DOT database, three trains pass through the rail line in Sibley on an average day. Exact count is not kept for the tracks as they are part of a private line, and approximations can fluctuate greatly depending on seasonality and market demand.

divisive concepts on race in Iowa schools Gov. Kim Reynolds stood on the shores of Black Hawk Lake, a popular Lake View recreation destination named after a Sauk warrior who lost his birthplace, endured prison and brutality at the hands of white settlers and even had his final remains stolen in a morbid exhibition scheme. Black Hawk is not only the face of the lake, he’s a face of a state and nation’s history fraught with broken treaties and genocide. But can school teachers — say in the nearby East Sac County or Carroll Community school districts— teach those facts about the life of Black Hawk under the Reynolds-backed legislation? Or are they off limits because of the critical, albeit factual, portrayal of white people in 19th-century Iowa? Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds Speaking after an agriculture-and-recreation event at the lake earlier this month, Reynolds, in response to a question from The Times Herald, said Black Hawk’s story still should be included in educational discourse, but under certain conditions. The governor says teachers should offer “both sides” of the destruction of Native American life in Iowa, a genocide by the hands of European settlers. “As long as it is balanced and we are giving both sides, I think it is part of history and they should be able to teach that,” Reynolds said. “It has to be balanced and (we have to) make sure we are having a conversation, and we are educating children, not indoctrinating, and actually giving them the chance to learn and to make their own decisions.” If that involves letting Black Hawk, through history, make his own case, in his own words, this is what those students would read — if educators included his 1832 surrender speech, one of the more notable orations from a Native American — one whose statue is a landmark in Lake View. “An Indian who is as bad as the white men could not live in our nation — he would be put to death, and eaten up by the wolves,” Black Hawk said. “The white men are bad school-masters; they carry false looks, and deal in false actions; they smile in the face of the poor Indian to cheat him; they shake them by the hand to gain their confidence, to make them drunk, to deceive them, and ruin our wives. We told them to let us alone; but they followed on and beset our paths, and they coiled themselves among us like the snake.” Sebastian Braun, director of American Indian Studies at Iowa State University, said Native Americans join Black, Latino and Asian Americans in being often excluded or misrepresented in American history. When asked if there are any misconceptions in Iowa schools about Black Hawk, Braun laughed. “Is anything even taught in the American education system? That would be my first question,” he said. What often has been taught about racial issues — or is believed to be taught — caught the attention of the Iowa Legislature. Republican legislators said they have received calls, emails and texts from concerned parents about the “indoctrination” of their children into certain racial theories in the K-12 public school system. In response, Reynolds, with GOP legislative support, signed a bill prohibiting specific divisive concepts from diversity training and school curriculum like saying America and Iowa are systemically racist. The bill does not specifically list concepts like Critical Race Theory or the 1619 Project, but both have been subjected to criticism. Reynolds said Critical Race Theory would fall under the ban. “Critical Race Theory is about labels and stereotypes, not education. It teaches kids that we should judge others based on race, gender or sexual identity, rather than the content of someone’s character,” Reynolds said in a statement. “I am proud to have worked with the Legislature to promote learning, not discriminatory indoctrination.” The 1619 Project places the consequences of slavery and the contributions of Black Americans at the core of American history, according to the 1619 Project’s website. Critical Race Theory is decades old and grew out of critical legal studies. It involves critically examining and questioning the roles race and racism play in society and how they affect legal systems. It emerged in the legal academy and has spread to other fields of academic study, according to the American Bar Association. Attorney Monic Behnken, a member of the Ames School Board and an associate professor of sociology at Iowa State University, said Critical Race Theory centers around the idea that racial inequalities have not improved since the theory emerged. Iowa joins a handful of other states in creating legislation to combat what many see as “anti-American” rhetoric in workforce trainings and public education, mirroring an executive order that passed at the end of the Trump administration. Behnken said it is difficult to have conversations about the impacts of these laws because they are inaccurate in portraying Critical Race Theory. “I look at these laws in total and am just confused,” Behnken said. “I am not quite sure what has been outlawed or why it is being called Critical Race Theory, because I don’t see Critical Race Theory reflected in the specific things that are now illegal.” Behnken said there are some components of Critical Race Theory that may be taught at the undergraduate level, but Critical Race Theory is a high-level and complex area of academic study that mainly exists at the graduate level. In February, the Ames Community School District received criticism from Republican legislators about the district’s “Black Lives Matter at School” week curriculum. House File 802 doesn’t limit a specific curriculum but instead prohibits assigning status and privileges to a specific race or sex and assigning bias based on race or sex, referred to this as “race or sex scapegoating.” The bill also prohibits academic concepts that present America and the state of Iowa as systemically racist or sexist. “Critical Race Theory has been around for decades; it is not new, but this conversation is,” Behnken said. “This conversation exists in a context that our country has lived through this socio-political uprising over the past summer, that has been rolling for decades, and what I am seeing across the country are really attempts to ban conversations that people want to have about how our world looks.” Specifically related to Black Hawk, Braun said few students come to his class informed about Black Hawk’s story or with any prior knowledge about indigenous people and cultures at all. “If anything is taught, it is definitely the case that students don’t have a good understanding of what happened,” Braun said. “I take great care, if you want, to balance things out.” In the course Americans of Iowa, Braun kicks off his class by asking his students what they know about Iowa’s history, which tends to be very little. “What the American education system is doing right now is, it is presenting American history, and American history is defined as basically white, Anglo-Saxon Protestant,” Braun said. Braun said he is hired to not present opinion, and he calls for balanced discussion. “When I teach something like that, I think students should understand both the positive and negative consequences,” he said. “What I try to teach students is not what I feel about it. What I try to teach students is how they can then look at that data and make up their own mind.” Braun has received an array of feedback from students of different backgrounds. Some accuse him of being an apologist of the treatment of native people, while others come to him and defend the reasoning behind assimilation. Braun said these perspectives comes from political assessments people already have done. When teaching Iowa’s history, Braun said the foundation of the state flows from treaties. Every square inch of Iowa is treaty land, and the native Iowa people were annihilated shortly after Euro-American settlement. In the 1830s, tribes ceded their land through treaty and purchase. Now the Mesquaki Settlement is the only remaining settlement in Iowa, home to the Fox and Sauk tribe. “We cannot get a true understanding of Iowa history if we don’t understand those processes, what they meant and mean today, and that is what’s not being taught,” Braun said. Braun visits schools to try and infuse native history into curriculum. “I was hired to teach factual accounts of history, of cultures, of societies,” he said. “Now if somebody asks me to do this in a balanced manner, I honestly don’t quite know what that means, because what they would be asking is to teach from a political perspective. And this is exactly what I am hired to not do — I am not hired to bring politics into the classroom.” We’re all farming on Native land in Iowa. There’s nothing to fear from Critical Race Theory but knowledge and perspective.Iowa is almost unique in the United States. It’s a state with startling little racial diversity and yet'}]"

ROME — The Vatican on Thursday abruptly canceled the planned live broadcast of U.S. President Joe Biden meeting Pope Francis, the latest restriction to media coverage of the Holy See that sparked complaints from White House- and Vatican-accredited journalists. The live broadcast of Biden’s Friday visit was trimmed to cover just the arrival of the president’s motorcade in the courtyard of the Apostolic Palace. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the revised plan reflected the “normal procedure” established during the coronavirus pandemic for all visiting heads of state or government. That protocol also has meant an 18-month ban on any independent media being in the room for the beginning and end of the audience, as would normally be the case for a visiting head of state. Cancelled was the live coverage of Biden actually greeting Francis in the palace Throne Room, as well as the live footage of the two men sitting down to begin their private talks in Francis’ library, at which time the cameras would have stopped running. The Vatican said it would provide edited footage of the encounter after the fact to accredited media. Bruni didn’t say why the Vatican had originally announced fuller live coverage only to dial it back on the eve of the visit. Biden, the second Catholic U.S. president, has met Francis three previous times, but this will be his first as president. The audience was being closely monitored since U.S. bishops are due to meet in a few weeks for their annual fall convention, with one of the agenda items inspired by conservatives who contend that Biden’s support for abortion rights should disqualify him from receiving Communion. Though any document that emerges from the bishops’ conference is not expected to mention Biden by name, it’s possible there could be a clear message of rebuke. Francis has strongly upheld the church’s opposition to abortion, calling it “murder.” But he has said bishops should be pastors, not politicians. As a result, the Biden-Francis body language could have given a clue about their mindsets going into the meeting. The Vatican has provided live television coverage for the visits of major heads of state for years, including President Donald Trump, and had scheduled such coverage Friday for Biden and for South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who is also in Rome for a Group of 20 meeting.

A live broadcast was particularly important because the Vatican has barred independent photographers and journalists from papal audiences with leaders since early 2020, even though external news media are allowed into other papal events. It is during those moments in the pope’s library that reporters can view the gifts that are exchanged, watch as the formal photograph is taken and overhear remarks as the leaders arrive and depart to get a sense of how visit is going.

has a new physical therapist on staff: Taylor Nelson, PT, DPT. Nelson is an Iowa native and said he is excited to be back working close to home. Taylor Nelson, PT, DPT, the new physical therapist at Manning Regional Healthcare Center. “My wife and I are originally from Exira,” Nelson said. “We moved to Maine for about two years and then just recently made our transition back to the area. So I’m looking forward to starting our family here, getting to know the community and taking the hospital to a new level with PT services.” Nelson is a vestibular rehabilitation specialist, which uses an exercise-based program to improve balance and reduce dizziness-related problems. He also specializes in orthopedic-type conditions, implementing a multifaceted approach, including hands-on and exercise treatments to help patients achieve their rehab goals. After graduating from Central College in 2015 with a degree in Health and Exercise Science, Nelson obtained his doctor of physical therapy degree from the University of New England in 2019. He then worked as a physical therapist at Proactive Physical Therapy in Lewiston, Maine, for two years. A knee injury in high school requiring extensive rehab inspired Nelson to pursue a career in physical therapy. “The whole rehab process and having a good experience is what led me to this field,” he said. “Especially in small towns, we’re kind of limited on how many healthcare professionals we have here. We didn’t really have the option of driving to Omaha or Des Moines for everything, so that’s what made me interested in coming back to this area — just having a place for everyone to receive high-quality, evidence-based care here.” Evidence-based practice includes the integration of best-available evidence, clinical expertise, and patient values and circumstances related to patient and client management, practice management and health policy decision-making, according to the American Physical Therapy Association. Physical therapy can help those with back, neck, muscle and joint pain, headaches, carpal tunnel syndrome, stroke, sprains and strains, orthopedic or sports related injuries, weakness or loss of motion, body misalignments and more. MRHC also offers additional rehabilitative services such as occupational, speech and respiratory therapy. Occupational therapy provides services for people of all ages who, because of illness, injury, developmental or psychological impairment, need specialized assistance to lead independent, productive and satisfying lives. Respiratory therapy addresses COPD, acute respiratory distress syndrome, bronchitis, sleep apnea and more. Speech therapy can addresses issues with speaking, reading, listening, writing, thinking and swallowing.

After Shelby finished his military career, the family moved to a farm near Pleasanton, Iowa, where Francis attended country school until starting high school at Leon High School. He accepted the Lord as his savior at 14 years old at Bethel Church. He graduated from high school in 1960 then attended junior college in Trenton, Missouri for a couple of years. Francis met Elaine in 1962 and they married on December 21, 1963, moving to Mt. Ayr in 1964. To this union were born 4 children: Craig, Kim, Cory, and Cole. Francis was a worker, always doing what he had to do to provide for his family. He had numerous different jobs, but finally found one of his callings as an A.I. technician, artificially inseminating cows for customers all over southern Iowa and northern Missouri for almost 50 years. Since that wasn’t enough to keep him busy, he started working in the carpentry field and started Willis Construction 30 years ago. Francis and his crews, including all of his sons at different times, built or updated several buildings and homes throughout the area. Throughout his life, Francis had several hobbies. He raced cars at the Ringgold County Speedway in the 60’s and 70’s and met so many friends and made some enemies! He loved nothing more than to work and tinker on cars. He passed on his love for motor sports to all of his kids, helping them demolition derby for years and providing a place for them to work on cars. In his later years, he loved to take his grandkids to demos around the area as well. Along with racing and motor sports, Francis helped all of his kids show cattle. Even though the family lived in town in the early years, he always made sure they had a place in the country to keep calves. This hobby spread across almost 30 years by the time all the kids finished their show careers. His love of the stock show world continued as he watched his grandkids show whenever and wherever he could travel. His love for cattle continued after showing was done as he and Elaine moved to the country in 2000 where they had cows, hay and farm ground. Francis was able to work and tinker around on the farm until his passing. Francis served his community in various ways throughout his time in Mt. Ayr. He served as a J.C., and was a member of the Mt. Ayr Volunteer Fire Department, Mt. Ayr Community School Board and Ringgold County Fair Board. His kids and grandkids were his world. Francis enjoyed nothing better than attending their sporting events, concerts, recitals, and stock shows. He would stop everything if any of them needed something fixed or built. Francis never met a stranger…would strike up a conversation with anyone, anywhere and loved his time hanging out and visiting at Southwest Builder’s Supply, the Co-op and with his neighbors. Francis passed away on Wednesday, June 23, 2021, at the Clearview Home in Mt. Ayr. He was preceded in death by his parents and parents-in-law Larkin and Mabel Seymour. Left to mourn his passing are his wife of 57 years, Elaine; sons, Craig (Brenda), Diagonal; Cory, Pleasantville; Cole (Casey), Mt. Ayr; and daughter Kim Arnold (Tony), Corydon. Grandchildren: Hagan, Drew, and Birk Willis; Troy and Molly Arnold; and Keye, Kamryn, and Kerigan Willis; several cousins and numerous friends .'}]"
