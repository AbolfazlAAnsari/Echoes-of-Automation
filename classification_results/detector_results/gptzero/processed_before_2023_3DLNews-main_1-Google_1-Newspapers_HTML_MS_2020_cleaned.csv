22, 2016 By DC Tribune For many men and women, the battle to lose weight, gain muscle, stay fit, and have incredible energy is an uphill battle, and one they often lose. Let’s face it, it’s not easy to stick to a diet, keep to a daily running schedule, and lift weights all the time. Life often can and does get in the way. This is why you need supplements that can help keep your metabolism revved while you’re unable to hit the gym or keep to your diet. One of these is the popular and widely acclaimed Forskolin, that’s supposedly helped thousands of people all over the globe lose weight, stay fit and achieve their target body size… all without necessarily killing themselves in the gym every day. Also known as Coleus forskolii, this particular plant ingredient is gotten from the roots of the Plectranthus barbatus plant, a member of the mint plant family that has been long used in herbal medicine and Ayurveda. It’s also an important part of some Asian and indian delicacies. Of particular importance in the plant is the cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) compound. It does this by activating and regulating an enzyme in the body called adenylate cyclase. This enzyme plays key roles in lipid metabolism and glycogen functions in the body. In summary, this compound is known for its effectiveness and triggering the burning of stored fat in the body. Combined with other activities that increase your body’s metabolic rates, users are bound to get excellent results from their weight loss regimens and dieting. This is what makes Forskolin very special. After Dr. Oz talked about this awesome compound and its attendant benefits, it’s gone on to become one of the most popular weight loss supplements in the last three years with thousands of individuals recording great success in melting belly fat, reducing overall body fat and improving their general sense of well being. Bodybuilding enthusiasts swear by its effectiveness at giving them the extra energy boost required to keep them going in their workout sessions. The internet is awash with testimonials of individuals who attribute significant weight loss and muscle tone to just taking Forskolin and staying moderately active without watching their diet per se. For many, life gets in the way of staying healthy and fit. When you consider that the average individual spends at least 8 hours a day sitting down and less than 1 hour moving, it is easy to see how they can gain weight, particularly around their mid-section. Even though many organizations are increasingly encouraging their staff to move around, the fact is that when you get in the zone or have a looming deadline, the last thing you’ll want to do is “stretch your legs” or walk around. You will agree with me that if you lose that job because you were trying to stay “healthy” on your employer’s time, you would only have yourself to blame. So, instead of worrying about this, you might want to consider taking forskolin to help burn that fat whilst you’re sedentary. Its appetite suppressing component also means that you get to feel less hungry, which would also contribute to your weight loss. These claims are backed by a very rigorous study carried out by the University of Kansas in 2005. Obese and overweight individuals who took part in the study were only required to take 250mg of a coleus supplement containing 10 percent forskolin extract twice a day for the duration of the study. This was the only alteration they made to their diets and lifestyle habits for 12 weeks. At the end of the study, it was observed that they shed their body fat at almost 8 times their normal rate, experienced an increase in serum free testosterone and increased their bone mass. So, if you have been on the sidelines about forskolin, now might be the right to time to rethink those objections. Apart from the obvious benefits of weight loss and weight control, the ingredient is capable of accelerating your metabolism so that you get to store less fat and burn off more carbs. This is how you can stay slim and meet your weight loss goals. Its medicinal purposes have also been well documented. Ayurvedic and herbal medicine practitioners frequently add it to herbal tonics that are helpful in the treatment of medical conditions such as rheumatism, gastrointestinal disorders, and cardiovascular conditions. Men who suffer from very mild forms of testosterone deficiency might find it useful as an effective testosterone booster, designed to naturally increase testosterone production in your body. Forskolin has no major side effects apart from diarrhea which is induced by the rapid metabolism actions of the cAMP. This happens because foods in your stomach are broken down faster, thus increasing the speed with which food moves through your digestive tracts and the faster absorption of nutrients into the blood. Also, forskolin has been known to lower blood pressure. So, if you’re hypotensive, you may want to skip it. Based on everything you have read, the choice is yours. Admittedly, there isn’t enough concrete and clinical evidence -apart from those presented here- that it’s as effective as portrayed, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t work. All we’ll suggest is try the exact same dosage used by the participants in the University of Kansas study -250mg of 10 percent forskolin extract per day- for 12 weeks, get some physical activity and adopt a healthy diet, and see how it works.

The apostles answered: “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge, for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard.” The civil magistrate (government), whether the Jewish state or Roman, stands accountable to God ultimately. The Lord Jesus had commissioned the apostles to spread his name and gospel, so they were bound to do so, despite the command of the Jewish authorities. In other places Scripture requires Christians to be submissive to the government, and honor state authorities; for example, 1st Peter 2 and Romans 13. It isn’t always a clear matter as to when a Christian or church is to practice civil disobedience, but here it was. Peter and John were responding to the authorities forbidding something God had required of them. Whatever the Christian does toward the state, giving honor or practicing civil disobedience, it is to be in submission to Christ. So the church that seeks conflict unnecessarily is not following the Lord, but neither if she doesn’t proclaim the gospel. Knowing our accountability to the Lord helps us be careful on both fronts, examine our motives, and to seek to honor the Lord. We may reach a point where the church in our land in persecuted for preaching Christ; for being faithful as the apostles were. If the church suffers persecution while being obedient to Christ, it can be a challenge to our faith. We know the Lord is Sovereign, so we can wonder why he allows suffering from enemies in power when the church is being faithful. In the book of Acts we see the church suffering while doing what Christ had commanded her to do. But we should look at the broader picture. First, we see that enemies have power, but no more than is given them of God, as Peter will say in verses 27-28, and as Jesus answered Pilate (John 19:11). They might prevail, but it is for a time, a limited time, and it is a short one. The time will come when there will be no more time for them. When they do prevail over the church, it is but part only, not over the whole. They prevail over the persons, but not over the cause; that stands impregnable. They may prevail over men’s lives but not over their spirits, which we see in the case of Stephen (Chapter 7). He prevailed over his enemies when they seemed to prevail over him. God’s glory was upon him, and his eyes upon Christ, praying for his enemies even as he was being stoned to death. The church’s enemies may prevail in some way, but they lose in another. We see in the early church, the more it was pressed, the more it multiplied. As Pharaoh sought to diminish the Israelites, yet they increased all the more, so the church has often spread in persecution. If we could lay the beginning and the end together we would see that enemies of Christ and his church never prevailed, but their victories only hastened their own ruin. In the Day of the righteous judgment of God we shall see all promises performed, and all threats executed. So that all opposition to Christ and his people are uncovered in the end for how futile their works were. The history of Cain, Pharaoh, Haman, Herod, and many others testify that all their plots were under a curse and tended toward destruction. There is no future in opposing Christ. God has two things he highly regards in this world; his truth and his church, which is a product of his truth. All those in Christ are to rest in the fact that our present lives are not in our own hands, or Satan’s, or our enemies, but in God’s. God is the length of our days. So we are to focus on being faithful, and let providence fall out as it may. When we view the faithfulness of the apostles in the midst of so much opposition, it provides stability in the seeming confusion of things in this world. The Lord is working out harmony in all this discord. He is fitting his people for a better condition even as they are suffering at their worst here; and preparing the unbelievers for destruction, even while they are at their best here. So Peter and John, full of the Holy Spirit and love to Christ, chose to be obedient to him, rather than yield to the threats of men. And in doing so, they did their own and many other souls good.

Chance of rain 30%. Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 4:34 pm Photos by MSU Extension/Gary Bachman Although Rudbeckias such as this Denver Daisy are drought-tolerant, they require consistent moisture to continue blooming from summer through fall. Over the last several months, I’ve been spending even more time in my home garden and landscape, and many of you may have done the same. But the pesky, hot summer temperatures have finally settled in, and now I’m looking for plants that look good in the heat without needing much supervision. A fantastic group of plants for the Mississippi summer landscape is the Rudbeckia. You might call them black-eyed Susans. Many Rudbeckias have been recognized regionally and nationally for their garden resilience and easy care. Let’s take a look at five of my favorite Rudbeckias. Rudbeckia Indian Summer was selected as a Mississippi Medallion winner in 1999 and has been a reliable performer in my landscape every year. The upright stems are sturdy enough to display the huge flowers, which can be up to a whopping 9 inches across. The petal colors are bright and cheery, ranging from sunshine yellow to warm oranges at the petal bases. Each flower has a delicious-looking, rich, chocolate-brown center cone. Cherokee Sunset, an All-America Selection in 2002, is a fantastic choice that blends the warm colors of yellow, orange and mahogany bronze. The flowers, up to 4 inches in diameter, are a mix of singles and doubles. They will reach about 24 inches tall, and the sturdy stems don’t need staking. I consider Irish Eyes a novel variety of Rudbeckia because of the emerald-green center cone highlighted by clear-yellow petals. This flower adds interest to your landscape. The blooms are up to 5 inches in diameter, and they can be enjoyed from summer through fall on plants that can reach up to 3 feet tall. The Irish Eyes Rudbeckia is unique because of its emerald green center cone highlighted by clear yellow petals. One selection I think should be in every landscape is Rudbeckia Denver Daisy. The flower petals are a pure, bright yellow with variable splotches of dark red at the center. Denver Daisy should be considered a tender perennial or treated as an annual most years in our Mississippi landscapes. Another of my landscape favorites is Tiger Eye Gold, a Rudbeckia selection that can reach up to 3 feet tall. The size of these 5-inch, golden-yellow flowers with brown buttons in the center makes it hard not to notice wherever they are grown in the landscape. These beautiful flowers have long-lasting blooms that are produced throughout the entire summer. Plant all Rudbeckia in full sun for best flowering and color. These plants grow best in compost-amended, well-drained soils, but they tolerate poor, clay soils. While these are known and grown for their tolerance of droughty conditions, this tolerance sometimes comes at the expense of flowering. For best landscape performance, consistent soil moisture is a must. If you can water during dry times, you will be rewarded with continued flowering. Rudbeckia such as this Indian Summer with its huge flowers is ideal in Mississippi gardens as it thrives without much maintenance in the summer heat. Rudbeckias are all considered lower-maintenance plants, but they need deadheading. Remove fading flowers to keep the plants blooming all summer long. The home gardener should take advantage of these plants’ summer-long blooming by bringing the landscape inside with gorgeous cut Rudbeckia stems. • Dr. Gary Bachman is an Extension and research professor of horticulture at the Mississippi State University Coastal Research and Extension Center in Biloxi.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 8:01 pm Four people were hurt but only one was transported by ambulance after a pickup and passenger car collided on Highway 84 East at Holifield Road on Thursday morning. Bruce Blackwell, 57, of Laurel was driving a Dodge pickup east toward Waynesboro when a Chevrolet Impala driven by 52-year-old Allen Sellers of Laurel tried to cross the highway in front of him toward the Dollar General on Holifield Road, according to the Mississippi Highway Patrol accident report. Each vehicle had a teenage passenger, but only one was transported by EMServ, which was “a miracle,” rescue workers said after seeing the damage and considering the speed at the time of impact. The injuries weren’t believed to be serious. Volunteers from Rustin, M&M and Powers responded along with the Jones County Sheriff’s Department and MHP. (Photo by Mark Thornton) Log In Keep it Clean.

At 10 a.m. Sunday, police responded to a report of a man tied to a tree. Cox said evidence indicated the death was a suicide and that no foul play is suspected. “We are positive this is self-inflicted, and the coroner came out and agreed,” he said. Victims of suicide are typically not identified or reported in the Laurel Leader-Call. The death occurred in a public area and had witnesses, however. The victim was reportedly a black man in his early 20s. “We would hope that someone would reach out to friends, close family, someone who could help them get through that time when they were thinking about suicide,” Cox said. It isn’t likely that many people saw the body since the park was mostly empty that morning. But for those who may have seen the unidentified man, Cox gives similar advice for seeking help. “Reach out to friends, family, clergy or counseling,” he said. “Anybody, especially someone contemplating this — everyone’s got a friend or pastor. Go to the hospital. Go to the emergency room. Come here. Let’s see if we can get you somebody to talk to.” Police are trained to responsibly intervene in potential suicide situations, Cox said, but that doesn’t make the work easier. “We don’t want it to happen to the person,” he said. “We don’t want our citizens to see it. We’d prefer our officers didn’t have to see it. Regardless, we’d rather help someone than find someone like that.” The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention suggests suicide is the 10th-leading cause of death in the U.S. In 2018, a total of 48,344 Americans died by suicide while there were 1.4 million suicide attempts.

She worked tirelessly throughout the church but her first love was always singing in the choir where she served as president for over 40 years until her health began to fail. Her favorite gospel song that she loved to sing and continually lived her life by was “This Little Light of Mine”. Mae was united in holy matrimony to Earl Newman, Sr. on December 25, 1948. Ten children were born to this union. She also welcomed one bonus son, Willie James Newman, into this union. Earl, Sr. preceded her in death on May 28, 1984. Her daughter, Daisy Mae Brown; Willie James Newman; along with six brothers, one sister, one granddaughter, two grandsons, and two great grandchildren preceded her in death. Mae worked as a cook at Ebenezer Head Start Center and Lexington Elementary School until her retirement. It made her happy to help provide students with healthy and nutritious meals. She enjoyed watching the students grow and gain educational opportunities that she was not given as a youth in the Yazoo County School System. However, she was always a woman that would rise up to a challenge as she studied and gained her High School GED at the age of 50 and got her driver’s license at the age of 55. She enjoyed the simple things in life as she focused on her family. She loved beautiful colorful flowers, stylish clothes and hats, jewelry, visiting churches throughout the community, talking on the phone, traveling, watching The Price is Right and Wheel of Fortune on television, visiting with her friends and playing bingo at the Senior Citizen Center. Mae lived a full and blessed life. She was known throughout the community as someone who would willingly help others. She served as an advocate and friend to so many by regularly visiting the sick and shut in, providing rides to those without transportation, and cooking for those in need of a meal. Mae met each person with a smile and actively displayed love and compassion for all. She was like a “second mom” to many. She constantly shared words of encouragement and provided inspirational insights to all. She allowed her heart to be her compass and guide in her life. Mae departed this life on September 8, 2020.

This year, EMCC had linebacker DeShawn Page (Knoxville, TN) and offensive lineman Nick Jones (Byhalia) both sign with Mississippi State, while defensive lineman Jamond Gordon (Meridian) inked with the Ole Miss Rebels. The EMCC Lions have now had a total of 15 football players head to Ole Miss since 2008 and 13 others play for the Bulldogs. EMCC’s other SEC signee this season was defensive back Khyree Jackson, who transferred to East Mississippi from Fort Scott (Kansas) Community College before signing with the Alabama Crimson Tide on Wednesday. Also staying in-state is former EMCC and Yazoo County High School defensive lineman Tredarius Carr, who was part of Coach Deion Sanders’ initial Jackson State recruiting class. Leaving the Magnolia State to continue their college football playing careers are defensive back Kel Williams (Starkville) and offensive lineman Ethan Anderson (St. Martin), who signed with Northwestern State (La.) and UVA Wise, respectively. In addition, former NJCAA All-American defensive lineman Everitt Cunningham signed with Southern Miss this week as a graduate transfer after spending the past two seasons at the University of Memphis.
