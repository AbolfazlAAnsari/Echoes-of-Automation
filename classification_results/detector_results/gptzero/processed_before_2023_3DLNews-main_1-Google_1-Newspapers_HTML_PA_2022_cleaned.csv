In the background, Police Chief Joe Dougherty speaks with local McDonald\'s owner Emmett Patterson. (Jim Hale/Gettysburg Times) Coffee with a Cop serves up a weekly opportunity for the public to meet informally with Gettysburg Borough Police Department officers. This week\'s event came with a twist. Coffee with a Cop normally takes place Tuesdays at 9 a.m. at McDonald\'s, 517 Steinwehr Ave., but this week\'s event was delayed until Wednesday to coincide with National Coffee with a Cop Day. Genny Reaver, a resident of the borough for 52 years, said she attended the event in order to thank officers for their work. ""They\'re worth it. They protect us every day,"" she said. Most people never interact with a police officer except when there is ""a crisis or problem,"" and citizens may feel reluctant to interrupt officers who are on duty, Police Chief Joe Dougherty said. By contrast, he said, Coffee with a Cop offers an opportunity to meet in a ""non-stressful"" atmosphere. The events help the public ""know what we do"" and provide a ""direct connection"" that ""lets us see each other as human beings,"" Dougherty said. A core group of four or five citizens have attended many of the sessions, which also draw in other patrons of the restaurant, he said. Local McDonald\'s owner Emmett Patterson approached Dougherty with the idea for the events, which began about 16 months ago, Dougherty said. ""The community needs to have contact with the police in a less stressful situation, and this is perfect,"" Patterson said Wednesday at the event. ""It\'s also a way to say thank you to our police officers,"" he said. ""Community involvement"" is an important goal for McDonald\'s, just as it is for police officers, McDonald\'s Area Supervisor Rance Strasbaugh said. Borough resident Michael Gelner said he attended because of a general interest in government and ""to get to know the officers more."" Coffee with a Cop offers a chance to do the latter in ""a little more relaxed atmosphere,"" he said. Officers\' participation in the events show the department is ""not defensive, and open to meeting people and hearing their concerns,"" Gelner said. ""It\'s important to have a dialogue"" other than ""during a tense time,"" Michael\'s wife Kathy Gelner said. ""The more you know each other, the better it is,"" she said. Coffee with a Cop has been popular with officers as well as citizens, Dougherty said. The relaxed setting lets citizens ask questions and raise neighborhood issues they would be reluctant to call 911 about, said Sgt. Harald Pruy, one of several officers present Wednesday. Officer Chris Evans presented a coloring book and crayons to a young restaurant patron. ""I like to color hard,"" said Jebb Cain, 3, who was visiting Gettysburg with his parents, Deanna and Matt Cain of New Martinsville, W. Va. ""I\'m an art teacher. We color a lot,"" Deanna said. Jebb nodded when asked whether he liked meeting the officer. Evans said Wednesday\'s event was his third Coffee with a Cop. The events provide a chance ""to get the know the community a little bit,"" which is especially valuable for someone like himself who joined the department only recently, he said. It\'s also valuable for the public to see that the department is ""approachable,"" Evans said. Bev Frey, a field representative for state Sen. Richard Alloway, R-33, also attended the event.

The Times worked tirelessly to tell those stories. Here’s our list of most influential Beaver County-centered stories in 2022, and what non-subscribers may have missed this year. The oil and gas giant hit a number of salient milestones throughout 2022, ending the year with news that operators at the multi-billion-dollar petrochemical complex had finally started producing plastic pellets after more than a decade of lobbying, planning, building and commissioning. Full story:Shell begins cracker plant operations in Beaver County The complex will convert natural gas into polyethylene used in plastics manufacturing. It’s expected to produce up to 1.6 million tons of polyethylene each year to make products like flexible food packaging, toys, crates, shampoo bottles and milk cartons. Construction of what was among the largest building projects in the nation wrapped up in early September, with operations beginning by mid-November. Construction began in November 2017 and stopped only briefly for a COVID-related pause. While nearby residents become accustomed to a change in scenery — the plant’s gas flares routinely lace the horizon with an eerie ginger glow — other lifelong homeowners have fled, fearing more industrialization. Many patiently await the economic gains promised by lawmakers who supported the company’s move to Beaver County. More:With Pa. plastics plant poised to open, residents decide: Stay or go? The Fern Hollow Bridge collapse near Pittsburgh\'s Frick Park in January highlighted Pennsylvania’s 3,300 other structurally deficient bridges. President Joe Biden visited the site alongside lawmakers and figureheads, stressing the role his $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill will play in preventing similar disasters. In the aftermath of the collapse, The Times found dozens of Beaver County bridges listed in poor condition like the ill-fated Pittsburgh bridge. More than 11% of Beaver County’s 398 state and locally owned bridges were considered to be in poor condition by Pennsylvania’s Department of Transportation. Full story:Dozens of Beaver County bridges are in poor condition. Here\'s how to check yours Among those considered structurally deficient in Beaver County is the Route 18 bridge over Raccoon Creek in Potter Township, first built in 1932 and rehabilitated in 1977. Just down the street from Shell’s ethane cracker plant, the structure sits in the midst of a major industrial hub ― expected to facilitate as many as 9,000 vehicles daily in the coming decades. PennDOT plans to begin replacing the steel truss bridge in 2023. An ongoing dispute between Rochester Mayor Keith Jackson and borough officials came to a head in September when Jackson was charged with assault after an altercation at a council meeting allegedly turned physical. Jackson for years has maintained that his role as an elected official has been impeded by his colleagues, with council members and law enforcement claiming Jackson aims to overstep his authority. Rochester Council in 2021 passed a resolution requiring a third person to be present at meetings between Jackson and other borough officials, adding a roadblock to his daily duties. Jackson in September was charged with two counts each of simple assault, disorderly conduct and harassment with physical contact after Beaver County detectives said he physically threatened and ""bumped his chest"" against Rochester Manager John Barrett during a heated argument. Council members were debating the role of retired police chief Frank Mercier, who plans to remain on staff as a borough code enforcement officer. Full story:Rochester mayor charged with assault after \'physical altercation\' at council meeting Mired in a yearslong leadership and money dispute, members of the now-splintered San Rocco Foundation and San Rocco Cultural Committee held dueling festivals in August. The competing Italian events took place on the same dates with similar attractions, but in different locations. Story:2 San Rocco festivals ... and a guide to help you pick The Cultural Committee’s event was held near the Beaver Valley Mall, while the Foundation’s was held at St. Frances Cabrini Campus of Mary, Queen of Saints Parish. Members of the San Rocco Foundation filed a motion in Beaver County Court asking a judge to give the Foundation access to financial records and festival-related equipment ahead of the group’s planned San Rocco Festa, but the judge ultimately denied the motion. Story:Festival clash: San Rocco Festa dispute goes to court Both the San Rocco Cultural Committee and San Rocco Foundation events planned a traditional procession through the streets of Aliquippa following that weekend\'s Sunday Mass at St. Titus Church in Aliquippa, although Committee members canceled their participation in the procession last minute, citing safety concerns. Wanda Solomon, the Beaver Falls woman released and quickly sent back to prison in 2019 due to a Bureau of Prisons oversight, was released this year. Just a month after qualifying for a Trump-era early release program, Solomon was sent back to prison for years-old incidents unrelated to her original sentencing charge. Advocates said Solomon’s situation is evidence of larger systemic problems that demand prison reform. For more than two years, Solomon had appealed the Bureau of Prisons\' decision to send her back into custody. It wasn\'t until February 2022 that Solomon learned she was eligible for early release due to her FSA Time Credits, which, under the First Step Act, allow nonviolent inmates who complete specific programming while incarcerated to have time knocked off their sentence. After more than 16 years of incarceration, she was sent home earlier this year. Now, she faces new challenges not unfamiliar to other formerly incarcerated people, including post-traumatic stress disorder. She’s terrified a minor slip-up, like arriving late to an appointment due to traffic or a misunderstanding at a grocery store, may strip her of her newfound freedom. Full story:Beaver Falls woman released from prison again due to federal program clarification Hundreds of protesters, including Beaver Countians, stood on the steps of Pittsburgh’s City-County Building in June to publicly mourn and lambaste the U.S. Supreme Court\'s decision to reverse 1973’s landmark Roe v. Wade and dismantle federally protected abortion rights. The rally included remarks from western Pennsylvania leaders who shared both anger and calls to action. Full story:Western Pa. reacts to Roe v. Wade decision Also in June. and just weeks after an 18-year-old man slaughtered 19 children and two teachers with an AR-15-style rifle at a Texas elementary school, local residents, politicians and activists honored the victims and demanded stricter gun laws at a March For Our Lives rally in Beaver. Among the demonstrators were local students who shared the trauma of enduring regular active shooter drills and questioning their safety in the classroom. Full story: Students, teachers call for stricter gun laws at Beaver\'s March For Our Lives rally A Center Township police officer was placed on administrative leave as Pennsylvania State Police investigated his role in the November death of 48-year-old Ken Vinyard. More:DA: Beaver County officer placed on leave following Industry man\'s death Witnesses say Vinyard was killed by an off-duty police officer while helping a shooting victim in the parking lot of Center Township\'s Walmart Plaza. Attorney Joel Sansone, the lawyer representing Vinyard\'s family, said Vinyard was killed after the plainclothes officer forced him to the ground unprompted, causing him to hit his head. More:Good Samaritan\'s death prompts investigation after witnesses say he was forced to ground He died at a Beaver County hospital shortly after. Sansone said witnesses have identified the officer as John Hawk of the Center Township Police Department. No formal charges have yet been filed under this name. More:Family remembers Industry man allegedly killed by off-duty police officer The PIAA in January approved Aliquippa High School’s second appeal regarding the PIAA moving the Quips’ football program up from Class 4A to 5A. Aliquippa remained in Class 4A this fall. The PIAA\'s competitive-balance rule was the basis behind the PIAA\'s attempt to force Aliquippa up one classification. Beginning a few years ago, the PIAA implemented the rule to prevent teams from dominating their respective classifications with several transfer students. If a team accumulates six or more “success points” — making a PIAA title game appearance earns a team four such points — and has at least three transfer students over a two-year span, it will be moved up one classification. Aliquippa’s leadership said the move would have created legitimate safety threats to the Quips’ players. Full story:Aliquippa wins PIAA appeal, will remain in Class 4A in football In movies, a film crew for ""The Pale Blue Eye"" spent parts of January at Old Economy Village in Ambridge capturing footage for the 1830s-set Netflix film starring Oscar-winner Christian Bale and Gillian Anderson. The makers of ""The Deliverance,"" a thriller directed by Lee Daniels, shot a dialogue-heavy scene with actress Aunjanue Ellis at the McDonald\'s off the Center exit of Interstate 376 in August. Crews for “A Man Called Otto,” starring Tom Hanks, filmed scenes along Merchant Street in Ambridge in March.

After months of examination, effective Friday, April 1, The Bradford Era will move from its current carrier and motor route distribution to daily delivery by the U.S. Postal Service.

The timing and logistics involved with the transition are the reasons for such short notice to subscribers.” Meanwhile, The Era also delivers news and sports stories and photos via its website — www.bradfordera.com — and the print pages are available each morning in digital format via the E-edition. The print edition will also be available, as ever, on racks in various convenience store locations throughout the circulation area. “Our entire staff thanks our dedicated readers, advertisers and delivery contractors,” Satterwhite said. “Without your dedication in wanting to receive your local news and sports, the institution that is The Bradford Era could not exist.

Weaver said about 60 people work at the center.Federal officials did not immediately respond to messages Wednesday seeking comment on the planned closure.The center, which opened in 2001, had at one time been one of three in the U.S. where families seeking asylum were held. Early this year it was converted into a facility that holds only women.Berks County manages the facility and is reimbursed by the federal government. In return, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency leases office space and provides about $1 million in annual revenue to the county. For much of its early days, the center operated quietly and anonymously along County Welfare Read.It opened in 2001 at the former site of the Berks Heim nursing home housing 32 people — 15 adults and 17 children — from Colombia. It was billed as a short-term option for families seeking asylum or awaiting deportation.Over the last decade the facility has become a magnet for protests, with a variety of advocacy groups calling for it to be shut down. They contend the detainment of children is inhumane and made accusations about mistreatment of detainees and poor living conditions in the center. Federal and county officials have consistently denied those claims.The center did sit empty for most of last year after President Joe Biden’s administration decided it was no longer interested in detaining families.Instead, ICE and county officials forged a new contract for the site that turned it into a facility that holds migrant women.

It was the same day as his scheduled visit to the city to talk about infrastructure. The collapse happened on Forbes Avenue over Frick Park, a major thoroughfare for the area that nearly 14,500 vehicles cross each day. Ten people, including first responders, sustained minor injuries, according to a news release. Of the three taken to the hospital, none have life-threatening injuries. Check this out: Pennsylvania has 3,353 bridges in poor condition. Search our county-by-county bridge database Five vehicles and one Port Authority bus were on the span at the time, the release states. Emergency responders rushed to the scene at 6:39 a.m. Rescuers rappelled nearly 150 feet to help rescue those on the bridge. Others formed a human chain to reach the victims. An urban search and rescue team was called in, and emergency responders worked to make sure no one was under it, Fire Chief Darryl Jones said. A massive gas leak caused by the collapse forced some nearby residents to evacuate. The gas company later restored service, and the families were allowed back into their homes, he said. The cause of the collapse is under investigation. Infrastructure needs: A fee for each mile driven? Hot lanes?

Turnpike:How to get E-ZPass, use the new app and save money - even on toll-by-plate Biden ended up visiting the bridge before his scheduled event. Live updates: Biden visits Pittsburgh to talk infrastructure Flanked by Sen. Bob Casey, Gov. Tom Wolf, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb, Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey and other officials, Biden could be seen in press pool video walking to the edge of the bridge to survey the damage. Police officers told him there were a few joggers underneath the bridge at the time of the collapse, but they were unhurt and actually helped remove victims. Biden said he did not know that Pittsburgh had more bridges than any city in the world and that many are in poor condition. ""I had no idea,"" Biden said, ""and we\'re going to fix them all."" Wolf signed a disaster declaration to allow a quick response for reconstructing the bridge. .@POTUS has been told of the bridge collapse in Pittsburgh. Our team is in touch with state and local officials on the ground as they continue to gather information about the cause of the collapse. The National Transportation Safety Board sent a team to the scene. Closely monitoring the situation at Frick Park Bridge in Pittsburgh, and grateful for the first responders on scene. Our Department is in touch with @PennDOTNews and local authorities to offer our support. @USDOT stands ready to assist. Gov. Tom Wolf said in a tweet: ""We are monitoring the situation in Pittsburgh and prepared to provide support as needed."" The American Red Cross is setting up a victim assistance unit to help. An operator and two passengers were on a 60-foot articulated bus when the bridge fell down, Port Authority of Allegheny County spokesman Adam Brandolph said. All three were taken off the bus safely. Native perspective: Patrick O\'Shea: Pittsburgh bridge collapse shows deficient infrastructure needs to be addressed One of the passengers later reported injuries and was taken to the hospital, he said. The 22-ton bus slid backward when the bridge fell, the back of it twisting to a 45-degree angle, Brandolph said It came to rest at the bottom of the hollow, and the Port Authority is determining the best way to remove it. The bus was heading outbound at the time of the collapse. If it would have been heading in the other direction, more riders likely would have been on it, he said. The Port Authority thanked the emergency responders. ""This absolutely could have been much worse this morning, and we\'re thankful for their quick action,"" he said. UPDATE 3:PIO is on scene. Will advise on when there will be a news conference. https://t.co/l8tQryZwIW pic.twitter.com/OEHkAPJy6N The bridge is owned by the City of Pittsburgh, according to a spokeswoman with the state Department of Transportation. The Forbes Avenue bridge, built in 1970, is listed in poor condition and needs to be repaired, according to the National Bridge Inventory. The deck is listed as ""basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action."" Frick Park is closed to the public, Pittsburgh Public Safety said. The collapse of the bridge forced the closure of a nearby school. Saint Bede Catholic School in Point Breeze had called for a two-hour delay on Friday because of the weather, according to a news release. The school later announced it would close because of the bridge collapse. “Many teachers and parents of Saint Bede use that bridge every day. We are so blessed to have been on a 2-hour delay. We thank God no injuries have been reported and pray for all involved,” Sister Daniela Bronka, principal, said in the release. Bridge collapses are rare, and when it does happen, it makes national news, said Kevin Heaslip, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech. The Forbes Avenue bridge is 52 years old, and the useful life of a span is 50. Records show the weight limit on the bridge had been lowered because of the poor rating on the deck and superstructure, Heaslip said. Officials take that step when an inspection shows wear and tear, and the span needs to be put on a list for rehabilitation or replacement. The bridge was inspected in September, said Sam Wasserman, a spokesperson for Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey. No further details were provided. A forensic analysis will be done to determine where the failure occurred and piece together how that could have happened, Heaslip said. That effort will take time. “We don\'t know what could have happened to this bridge,” he said. ""It could have been something that happened recently that put the bridge in a more precarious position than it was at the last inspection."" Pennsylvania has twice the percentage of deficient bridges than the nationwide average, he said. Some states have deferred maintenance on bridges because the funds aren’t available to do it. The bipartisan infrastructure bill will help to repair or replace bridges that need to be repaired or replaced, he said Pennsylvania is set to receive $1.63 billion from the infrastructure bill to fix its deficient bridges and could receive more in the coming year. The state has the second-most bridges in poor conditions. The bridge that collapsed is typically traveled by 15,000 cars a day and is a detour to get around rush-hour traffic.

She said her daughter called her after learning of the fire, as Flaherty had organized donation drives in the past. “I said I already started a drive for them,” Flaherty said. “I think that’s our purpose here. Just to help other people out.” A GoFundMe campaign is also collecting money for the Jacobson family. As of Dec. 7, the fundraiser had collected more than $8,300. Jennifer Wright, Diane’s sister, described the community support for her family as “overwhelming.” “I’ve seen the community do it for others. We aren’t quite as in need as others have been in the past, and we didn’t expect to see the same outpouring. We’re very grateful for it,” Wright said. Wright said that while the whole experience has been stressful, her sister and father are holding up well and staying with family. “They’re still shook up. The fire itself was one thing, but losing the pup was another,” Wright said. “They’re kind of in the throes of dealing with insurance and fire marshals. It’s a little overwhelming. They’re doing OK.” While one dog died, another dog and cat were able to make it out safely. Wright described Bella as a mutt who they believed to be about 10 years old. “My sister has had her since she was a puppy … It was my sister’s first owned dog. Her and my father kind of raised her together,” Wright said. Firefighters attempted to revive Bella, and were assisted by a neighbor who happens to be a veterinarian. “She was trying to do CPR on her.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 5:24 am ALI MORTENSEN SHOWS some of the chocolate bark that she made during the four-day Chocolate Boot Camp she attended last week in Connecticut. Mortensen is a third-generation chocolatier at Char-Val Candies in New Bethlehem. NEW BETHLEHEM – The words “boot camp” aren’t usually associated with something very pleasant, but when you add the word “chocolate” to the mix, it makes for one sweet phrase. Local chocolatier Ali Mortensen, the third generation at New Bethlehem’s landmark Char-Val Candies, spent last week in Connecticut learning all sorts of new and time-tested techniques at the Retail Confectioners International’s Chocolate Boot Camp. “It was basically Chocolate 101,” Mortensen said from her home base of Char-Val along Route 66 just north of New Bethlehem. She said that after she, her mother, Greta Edmonds, and aunt, Jill Johnston, joined her grandfather Howard Shreckengost at Char-Val in 2019, she wanted to learn more about the chocolate-making process. But then the pandemic hit, forcing the business to adapt to the new normal. But this year, she said she received a scholarship to attend the four-day boot camp, which consisted of classroom learning each morning, and chocolate-making labs in the afternoons. “They covered a lot in a few days,” she said, holding up a huge binder of course work from the program that was held at Fascia’s Chocolates, a small family business located for years in Waterbury, Conn. Mortensen said approximately 25 people took part in the boot camp, traveling from all across the country for the learning experience. The goal for her, Mortensen said, was to “come back to Char-Val and feel confident. And take my family’s business to the next level that I know it’s capable of.” During the boot camp, she said students were tight about tempering chocolate, a process of brining the chocolate to a high heat, and back down again so it can be worked with property. When temperated properly, the chocolate will display a shiny coating. “There’s a whole science behind it,” Mortensen said, noting that the course helped build on what she has learned over the past few years at Char-Val. “We’ve been doing it an old-fashioned way, so it was neat to learn a newer way.” She said she also learned techniques to fine-tune peanut butter meltaways, and how to trouble-shoot other issues. The course showed ways to make chocolate bark, as well as how to make chocolate ganache, a mixture of chocolate and warm cream. The four-day course culminated in a big test at the end, with Mortensen earning a certificate of completion. “It wasn’t just going up there to play with chocolate,” she said, adding that the instructors for the boot camp are some of the best chocolatiers in the industry. The boot camp lessons ranged from the process of growing and harvesting cocoa beans, to the artistry involved in chocolate making. “I saw the whole range from beginning to advanced,” she said. Mortensen said that what was learned at the program will help continue to take Char-Val in new directions, and continue the process of adding new product’s to the local candy company’s line. “I want to be prepared for growth because we are definitely headed in that direction,” she said. Back at Char-Val, Mortensen said she serves in a managerial and ownership roll, enjoying the time she has to work with her grandfather, mother and aunt. “It’s very special to have us all together here,” she said. Especially right now, one of the busiest times of year as the candy maker gears up for the Easter season, which traditionally marks the seasonal closing of the local business. “It’s really all-hands-on-deck right now,” she said, noting that the holiday rush culminates with a three-day Easter sale Thursday through Saturday, April 14-16, that will see crowds of chocolate-lovers pour in to get all the holiday goodies and other candies to stock up until Char-Val reopens at the end of summer. “We’re still very much seasonal,” she said, adding that there still is plenty of work to be done during the summer. However, she said, one of her goals is to continue to grow the business so that it can be open all year. “I’m just excited to see where this all will go,” she said.

decision-making, and that in her political beliefs, she is ""pro-choice"": ""It is not my place to judge or force what another’s decisions should be."" At 6:30 a.m. on August 2, nearly 18 weeks into her pregnancy, Mylissa Farmer experienced what doctors call a preterm premature rupture of membranes — her water broke before labor, followed by vaginal bleeding, abdominal pressure and cramping. She went to Freeman Hospital in Joplin, where she\'d been just the day before. Everything had been normal then. She and her boyfriend, Matthew McNeill, had already picked out a name for their daughter: Maeve. But the doctors had devastating news for them on Aug. 2. If Maeve was delivered right then, chances of survival at 17 weeks and 5 days were zero, according to the assessment and plan section of Farmer\'s medical records outlining the visit. And the outcome wasn\'t much better if they tried to hold off on delivery. The doctors recommended terminating the pregnancy, but 39 days after the state of Missouri banned abortions, that wasn\'t an option, at least not in Missouri. A year ago, the hospital could have offered a chance for the couple to say goodbye and hold their daughter, even though they knew she wouldn\'t survive outside the womb. Instead, Farmer and McNeill were left to make a series of trips across three states and countless phone calls. The couple wanted to be able to grieve the loss of their daughter, not sit at home or in a hospital ""with a baby dying inside me,"" Farmer said. ""I know it sounds horrible, but we just wanted to finish the process,"" she said. In the end, Farmer didn\'t just lose Maeve; she lost her friends and her trust that Missouri would allow medical professionals to do their jobs. ""It was hard. You could tell the doctors were trying to tell us what we needed to do, but at the same time, trying to protect themselves. We’re not angry with them,"" Farmer said. More:GoFundMe set up for Art Hains\' family as broadcaster continues to battle West Nile Virus If her vitals plummeted or infection set in, or the fetus\' cardiac activity stopped, the doctors could intervene, but not before then. ""We discussed that the current Missouri law supercedes (sic) our medical judgement and the MO law language states that we cannot intervene in the setting of a pregnancy with a positive fetal heart motion unless there is a \'medical emergency,\'"" reads Farmer\'s medical record from that Aug. 2 visit. But the language outlining ""medical emergencies"" in Missouri Revised Statute 188.017 is vague, which continues to cause concern as the Missouri government fails to issue any meaningful clarification that carries the full force of the law. At 41, Farmer worried that by the time there was an emergency, it would be too late for both her and Maeve. And even if Farmer did live through it, she worried about what her recovery would be like. She was already at ""risks of maternal thrombosis given her history of (deep vein thrombosis during a COVID-19 infection), infection/sepsis, severe blood loss, hysterotomy, hysterectomy and even mortality,"" according to the medical record. Even if Farmer could carry Maeve another six weeks and deliver her, the complete loss of amniotic fluid meant stunted development. ""They said because I lost all of my amniotic fluid, that my uterus would be deforming our child and if we were able to carry another 6 weeks, she would come out deformed,"" Farmer said. ""Her lungs wouldn’t be any more developed than they were at 17 weeks because the amniotic fluid I guess helps lungs develop. If she were to develop, she would come out deformed and with major disabilities with breathing, and she’d be on a ventilator for a very long time."" The situation was further complicated when doctors found that Farmer\'s cervix was dilated, which increased chances that she would develop an infection and meant ""there was no chance for me to even regain any amniotic fluid,"" she said. Freeman Hospital in Joplin said it cannot comment on Farmer\'s case ""because it is a patient privacy HIPAA issue, which is hospital policy."" Farmer\'s options were limited in Missouri: ""Sit and wait in the hospital for however long it took for her heartbeat to either stop, or for infection to set in or for me to bleed to death. We didn’t like those options."" Doctors suggested she and McNeill travel out of state to receive care. But after calling four hospitals in Illinois and three in Kansas, it seemed no one would take them. They even drove out to Kansas University Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas, that same day, where she said doctors told her the same thing she\'d heard in Joplin: ""This child is not viable. Your health is at risk."" But after consulting with their legal team, Farmer said they told her that they wouldn\'t be able to offer a dilation and evacuation procedure. ""Our providers evaluate each case individually to develop an appropriate treatment plan, and then discuss the options and alternatives for care with our patients,"" said Jill Chadwick, KUMC director of media relations. ""Those are the medical decisions our physicians are trained to make every day, and at the same time always staying within the boundaries set forth by Kansas law.""

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 5:11 am There’s a strip of woods off Elm Street, bordering the Tunungwant Creek and visible from U.S. Route 219. It stands out for all the wrong reasons. A debris field about the length of a football field remains from a homeless encampment that was found to have been used over the summer. Videos and photos have been circulating on social media. Bradford City Police Chief Mike Ward, on Monday, said, “We would ask anybody to stay out of there. “There were signs of drug use at this particular camp,” the chief said. “One of the city officers went down there and collected all of the drug items that could be seen to remove the immediate hazard.” The strip of property where the debris is belongs to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Last week, Ward, PennDOT supervisor Scott Majot and Chip Comilla, director of Public Works, met down there to walk through the area. “The city, in cooperation with PennDOT, is planning a cleanup within the next few weeks,” Ward said, adding he’s asking for volunteers to help. The date for clean-up will be announced. “PennDOT is making arrangements for dumpsters and equipment to be brought to the site, at which time city personnel and volunteer groups are planning to coordinate a cleanup on a specific date yet to be determined,” Ward said. Some detractors have already said that if it’s PennDOT’s property, why not leave the cleanup to them? “Because we recognize that it is a hazard and it’s honestly for the protection of the Bradford community,” the chief said. “It’s an entranceway to our city.” What about the people who made the mess? “The persons responsible are known and are being charged accordingly with scattering rubbish and charges associated with leaving debris at the campsite,” Ward said. “We’ll be seeking restitution from those people.” Is this just piling more problems on the backs of people who are already down on their luck? “We are continuously offering local services to these homeless individuals,” Ward said. “Those that will accept our help, we help. “Those who do not, have been cited accordingly for the damage and the scattering rubbish,” he added. “We continuously strive to help homeless people return to their families, whether it be locally or out of town.” Councilman Tom Riel, one of the city officials behind the move to clean up the debris, said efforts were made to help the people involved. “I’ve reached out to a few of these people and most of them don’t want any help other than money. The majority of them are suffering from one form of addiction or another. “They can’t drink or do drugs in a shelter,” the councilman said. “Some of these people have already been kicked out of shelters. There’s a list of more than 100 people who are banned from OYO Hotel. Almost everybody we had encountered was on that list.” It’s not a city government problem, Riel said, it’s a community problem. “We have received reports and photos of several camps on the hill above South Avenue and West Corydon Street more recently. If the property owners don’t want to do anything about it, there’s nothing the city can do.” Please help local businesses by taking an online survey to help us navigate through these unprecedented times.
