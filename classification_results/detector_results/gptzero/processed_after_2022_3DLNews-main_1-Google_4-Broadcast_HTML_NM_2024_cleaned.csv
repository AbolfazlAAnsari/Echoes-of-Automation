Violators who do not sign the pledge could lose U.S. military support. Friday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre defended the president’s action and says the pledge does not change U.S. support for Israel. “The president has been very clear, he wants to see Hamas, a terrorist organization defeated,” says Jean Pierre. “We want to also ensure we’re protecting innocent civilians. The memorandum was announced as the president delivered his sharpest criticism of Israel’s military campaign. Thursday night he described Israel’s actions in Gaza as “over the top.” He told reporters he’s working to alleviate the humanitarian crisis growing on the ground. “A lot of innocent people are in trouble and dying” says Biden, “And it’s got to stop.” Senate Democrats who’ve been pushing for similar requirements for U.S. military aid applauded the president’s action. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) who led an effort to try and tie aid conditions to a pending foreign aid package called the memorandum was “a big deal.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) one of 18 co-sponsors says the executive action promotes basic transparency and accountability. “U.S. military aid cannot be a blank check” for Prime Minister Netanyahu and his right-wing government,” says Warren. The memorandum comes following months of international outcry over the humanitarian crisis growing inside the Gaza strip. Roughly 28,00 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war and the World Health Organization reports nearly a quarter of the population faces starvation. Van Hollen says the language will require countries to regularly report back to the U.S. to prove they are in compliance. “The first report which is due in 90 days for those countries engaged in armed conflict has to include reporting from January of last year”, says Van Hollen. Israel’s government has not issued a response to the White House’s announcement. Early Friday, Prime Minister Netanyahu prepared troops to invade a densely populated area inside Gaza.

LEILA FADEL, HOST: His report finds, quote, ""evidence"" that Biden, quote, ""willfully retained"" the classified material from his vice presidency. Yet the same report repeatedly gives reasons that the evidence falls short and would not be likely to persuade a jury, which is why Robert Hur declined to prosecute. INSKEEP: NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas has been reading. Ryan, good morning. RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: What do you find in these hundreds of pages? LUCAS: Well, look. This is a long report, but it does focus on a couple of sets of classified materials that FBI agents found in their searches of Biden\'s homes and office. One are documents related to military and foreign policy in Afghanistan during the Obama administration, and the other are handwritten notes that date to Biden\'s time as vice president. Biden jotted down notes in these things during intelligence briefings with President Obama and in White House Situation Room meetings. Some of this material is classified. And it\'s some of that material that Hur says that Biden shared on at least three occasions, the report says, with a ghostwriter that he was working with. But as you said, there are no charges here. The report says, ultimately, the evidence doesn\'t support bringing charges. It doesn\'t establish Biden\'s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Hur says in the report that it would be hard to prove that Biden willfully intended to break the law. And it also describes him as a, quote, ""sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory"" and says it would be hard to convince a jury to convict him. INSKEEP: And unsurprisingly, Republicans have jumped on that last part, describing Biden as an old man with memory problems. How is the president responding to that? LUCAS: Well, look. Legally, this report is good news for Biden in the sense that there are no charges. But that doesn\'t mean that it can\'t still create political problems for him. And the parts of Hur\'s report that raise questions about his age and mental acuity are certainly a case in point. There\'s even a line in there that in his interviews with investigators, Biden didn\'t remember the year his son, Beau, died. Biden talked to reporters last night, and he took that remark head-on. Let\'s take a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: How in the hell dare he raise that? Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself, wasn\'t any of their damn business. LUCAS: You can hear in that comment there how upset Biden was. And he said there\'s no reason for what he called such extraneous stuff to be in the report. And he said the bottom line here is that there are no charges. And this investigation is now closed. INSKEEP: Former President Trump is facing criminal charges for the way that he handled classified documents and, of course, is claiming now that he is being treated differently. What is the response to that? LUCAS: Well, look. The Justice Department rejects any allegation that there\'s a two-tier justice system in this country. It\'s worth pointing out that Robert Hur is a Republican. Before he was appointed special counsel, he served as a U.S. attorney during the Trump administration. Now, yes, you have a Biden case. You have a Trump case. But there are significant differences between those two cases. Hur even points them out in his report. Trump was provided multiple opportunities to return the classified documents that were found at Mar-a-Lago. According to the indictment, Trump refused to do so and even actively sought to obstruct investigators by trying to get others to destroy evidence and then lie about it to investigators. Biden, on the other hand, he voluntarily turned over classified documents to the National Archives and Justice Department after they were found. He then voluntarily agreed to FBI searches of his homes. He sat down for an interview with Hur\'s team. So, as Hur says, there are significant distinctions between these two cases. INSKEEP: In fact, the special prosecutor says at one point the fact that Biden agreed voluntarily to searches of his home implies that perhaps he did not realize that classified documents were there. Ryan, thanks so much. LUCAS: Thank you. INSKEEP: That\'s NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: We now have the story of a former president who made false claims of a stolen election. FADEL: No, we\'re not talking about Donald Trump, but he was friends with him. Ex Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is facing mounting evidence that points to him participating in efforts to overturn the results of an election that ultimately unseated him. Yesterday, federal police showed up at his residence and forced him to hand over his passport. INSKEEP: NPR South America correspondent Carrie Kahn is in Rio de Janeiro. Hi there, Carrie. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Hi. Good morning. INSKEEP: What is the new evidence? KAHN: Well, first, Bolsonaro was not arrested yesterday. Several of his close aides were. And the federal police then unveiled its case of Bolsonaro\'s alleged participation in an attempted coup in this 130-page detailed documents which has a lot of stunning evidence, Steve - much that we have not heard before. The investigation names dozens of people who worked with Bolsonaro, allegedly well before he lost his reelection bid back in 2022. They include military personnel, his former defense minister, his former justice minister and a national security adviser. And the level at which Bolsonaro orchestrated much of - police says was a vast conspiracy to overturn the election results is new, too. At one point, police say Bolsonaro edited a document that outlined how the coup would unfold, including which leaders in the government would be arrested and who would not. And that edit included the arrest of a justice of the Supreme Court. INSKEEP: Wow. Wow. So these things didn\'t necessarily happen, but he\'s editing a document that is the plan. Can you now fit this into the context of what we already knew about his failed effort to overturn his defeat in 2022? KAHN: Sure. He claimed it was voter fraud and that Brazil\'s all-electronic voter system was defective. His supporters spent months camping out in front of military barracks, hoping the army would intervene and overturn the results of the election. When that didn\'t happen, the supporters ransacked the capital on January 8 of last year. Bolsonaro has denied he had anything to do with that attack. Unlike Trump, who was - the two were close allies when they were both in office. Bolsonaro has already been barred from running for office until 2030 by electoral authorities. And like Trump, Bolsonaro is also facing many more cases that could land him in jail. INSKEEP: How is he responding to this latest police raid that grabs his passport? KAHN: Well, the current president, I\'ll tell you first, said that he hopes the investigation of Bolsonaro is professional and unbiased. He did add that he didn\'t think the coup attempt could\'ve happened without Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro, as always, has denied any wrongdoing and says he\'s being politically persecuted. I spoke with Brazilian political scientist Guilherme Casaroes, who was hopeful, despite learning how the right-wing former leader tried to undermine Brazil\'s democratic consensus. I want to play you a little bit about that. You know, this democratic consensus has been in place since the country returned to democracy after the military dictatorship. GUILHERME CASAROES: Even though there were very powerful people - people in office, in power - plotting against democracy, somehow democratic institutions have worked and have been able to save democracy from a complete meltdown. KAHN: He says Brazilians should celebrate that. INSKEEP: OK. Where\'s the investigation go next? KAHN: Well, there\'s a lot of evidence to go over from yesterday\'s police action and possibly new plea agreements from aides of Bolsonaro that were arrested yesterday. And all of that could prove very problematic for Bolsonaro. INSKEEP: OK. NPR\'s Carrie Kahn, thanks so much. KAHN: You\'re welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Let\'s go to Ukraine next, where President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he is sidelining his military commander as Russia\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine approaches its third year. FADEL: Yeah, Zelenskyy posted on X that the country\'s army needs a, quote, ""renewal"" and that he asked his outgoing general to remain part of the team. INSKEEP: Christopher Miller joins us next. He\'s a reporter for the Financial Times based in Kyiv and author of the book ""The War Came To Us: Life And Death In Ukraine."" Mr. Miller, welcome back. CHRISTOPHER MILLER: Thank you. Good morning. INSKEEP: OK, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi was very popular, if I\'m not mistaken. So why replace him now? MILLER: He was. You know, Ukraine\'s war effort right now is stalled and in a bit of trouble. The country\'s big counteroffensive last'}]"

People who live on that reservation cannot use the energy themselves. A senior Biden administration official recently visited the tribe, hoping to secure the support of Indigenous voters. Biden won Nevada last time by just under 3%, and organizers credit Native Americans with helping to secure that win. NPR's Ximena Bustillo reports. XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: The Moapa River Indian Reservation is located just an hour north of Las Vegas, and they have the largest solar project in Indian country. Started in 2014 and still growing, the energy generated here doesn't stay at home. It powers other places, like the Allegiant Stadium, where the Super Bowl is happening, and also goes all the way to California. JENNIFER GRANHOLM: This is kind of what I want to hear is, like, what are you guys planning? And with more or what - what needs to happen? BUSTILLO: That success is why Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm is visiting. GRANHOLM: And so we see the tribes as total partners and friends, obviously, and we want to be able to make sure that we see them. And the only way you see people is if you come and visit their homes and visit their nations, their lands. BUSTILLO: And that's why tribal members welcomed the visit, because even with big success in Vegas and beyond, the reservation is missing out on this energy and power, even with the big solar field on their land. CALISTA CASUPANG: I really hope, you know, that we can move forward and get energy for our own community and start benefiting from the energy, clean energy, instead of just always giving it away and letting everybody else use it. BUSTILLO: That's Moapa Band of Paiute Indians tribal council member Calista Casupang. The conversation was encouraging, but the stakes are high, and the tribe has been here before. CASUPANG: I felt like we were being heard. I felt like it was very genuine and that we'll hear something back. I mean, we always - you know, you always have meetings, and you never get a follow-up. BUSTILLO: So far, climate and infrastructure dollars have made their way to Nevada in the form of tax credits and road projects. But communicating some of these benefits to Nevadans on the ground has been a challenge for Democrats hoping to keep their votes this election. The more than 62,000 Indigenous people living in Nevada, which generally accounts for 3.5% of the state's population, have been credited with helping Democrats secure wins in recent elections. But the young tribal council members meeting with Granholm aren't ready to sign their ballot for Biden just yet. Here's council member Ivan Reel. IVAN REEL: That's why I ended up voting for Biden in the last election, but I'm not currently up to date on if they are doing anything for us. BUSTILLO: He said Biden shouldn't just bank on his vote. Reel and the rest of the tribe will be waiting to see whether the Biden administration's words are followed by action. Ximena Bustillo, NPR News, Las Vegas. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.

If you have a question you\'d like us to consider for a future post, email us at goatsandsoda@npr.org with the subject line: ""Weekly Coronavirus Questions."" See an archive of our FAQs here. My husband is immuno-compromised. He scours the internet for products that can protect him against COVID – from mouthwashes to supplements. Is there any evidence that any of these products work? Four years into the COVID pandemic,many people are relaxing their precautions. But it\'s still tough to be immunocompromised, perhaps even tougher than a year or two ago. Back then, an immunocompromised person who caught COVID could get monoclonal antibody treatments, which were effective at lessening the severity of the disease and could even help prevent infection if taken prophylactically. But those treatments are now all gone. The Food and Drug Administration pulled them from the market as the virus evolved, rendering them ineffective. Yes, we still have vaccines and effective antiviral treatments like paxlovid. But for some immunocompromised folks, vaccines are often less effective as their weakened immune systems fail to mount a sufficient response,and paxlovid can interfere with many commonly prescribed medications. Well-fitted, high quality masks work well, but aren\'t foolproof, especially in crowded indoor spaces where no one else is wearing one. With so few options, many immunocompromised people — and other folks looking to avoid COVID and long COVID — are turning to treatments and products outside of official prevention and treatment guidelines. The dozens upon dozens of products purported to fight or prevent COVID can be overwhelming, ranging from vitamins and other supplements to anti-COVID nose sprays and mouthwashes. ""People, especially immunocompromised people, have a desire to take control of their health, particularly in the context of COVID,"" says Andrea Love, an immunologist and executive director of the American Lyme Disease Foundation who has studied the effectiveness of supplements. ""The wellness industry kind of exploits that."" Naturally, the question arises: Do any of the products have merit? For this edition of the FAQ, we dove into the literature and asked experts whether any of the most common interventions are evidence-backed. We\'ll go category by category. Walk down the supplement aisle of your grocery store and you\'ll be bombarded with products claiming to boost your immunity or immune system. ""It\'s very appealing to feel like you\'re doing something proactive by taking them,"" says Love. On a surface level, it makes sense. Vitamins and minerals, like vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc and copper, are crucial for maintaining a healthy immune system. If you hope to avoid catching COVID or reduce symptoms if you do, nutritional supplements seem like a reasonable option. While there are some studies that suggest certain supplements could help certain people, it\'s far from clear that, on the whole, they do much goodwhen it comes to COVID. ""I\'m not aware of any supplements that are available over the counter, herbal or otherwise, that are associated with a reduction of either the risk of acquisition of infection or a severe infection,"" says Dr. Marwan Azar, an immunologist at Yale University. Love agrees. ""When you look at the big ones — vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, copper, iron — there\'s really no evidence to suggest that supplementation with any of those things improves outcomes related to COVID, reduces the risk of infection or illness severity,"" she says. Vitamin C and zinc are among the most popular supplements, with labels that boast of their immunity-boosting powers. Both nutrients play important roles in maintaining a healthy immune system, and some studies suggest that taking vitamin C and zinc supplements might help reduce the duration of a cold or its severity, though the evidence is far from conclusive. When it comes to COVID, the most robust studies — randomized clinical trials — don\'t show any significant benefit for some of the most common vitamin and mineral supplements. For example, a randomized clinical trial designed to study vitamin C and zinc supplementation for COVID found neither intervention made much difference in speeding recovery. Without conclusive evidence, these supplements aren\'t part of the National Institutes of Health\'s official treatment guidelines. Vitamin D\'s picture is murky, too. Although several studies suggest people with lower levels of vitamin D are at higher risk of COVID infection and severe disease, existing studies (of which there are many) haven\'t clearly shown that supplementation reduces this risk, according to the NIH. N-acetylcysteine, or NAC, is a supplement that acts as an antioxidant and can help reduce mucus along the respiratory tract in some circumstances. Given that profile, researchers started testing its efficacy against COVID early on in the pandemic, finding mixed results. Some studies suggested it reduced severity of illness in hospitalized patients, while others found no benefit. Quercetin is a flavonoid found naturally in many vegetables, fruits, seeds, tea and even red wine. Some researchers suspect it may have antioxidant, antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Several small studies have found that quercetin might reduce the duration of COVID symptoms, though confounding factors in these studies (like the placebo group containing older patients than the treatment group) make it hard to draw definitive conclusions. Why are all these vitamin and supplement studies so... inconclusive? Measuring the impact of supplements is more challenging than, say, a new drug, because we get many of these same nutrients from our food. ""There are so many confounding variables,"" says Love, including diet and baseline levels of these nutrients. A well designed clinical trial can often try to control for those confounding variables, she says, ""but that very often is just not the case with a lot of supplement trials."" As a result, it\'s difficult to get a clear picture Still, what\'s the harm in trying if they might help? For folks looking to take anything that might boost their resilience against COVID, supplements may seem like a low risk. ""People may think, worst case it does nothing, best case it helps,"" says Love. ""But the reality is that\'s not the case, there are a lot of potential harms associated with supplements because they are unregulated."" While multivitamins likely don\'t pose much risk, non-standard supplements, like proprietary herbal blends, can be more problematic. Herbal blends often contain long lists of ingredients of dubious origin and can sometimes get contaminated.

""There\'s significant risk for interaction with something like that,"" he says, adding that immunocompromised people should consult with their physician before starting a supplement. COVID infections usually begin in the nose. Some nose sprays aim to stop or slow down the virus at this entry point, using the antimicrobial properties of nitric oxide, a compound our bodies naturally produces. ""The idea is, if we megadose [the nasal passages] with this chemical that\'s important for immune function, then maybe we\'ll improve outcomes,"" says Love. Such a spray might be useful as a short-term prophylactic, or reduce the chance of getting sick after an exposure. Evidence for these nose sprays is limited. The best study — a randomized control trial of 80 adults with mild COVID in England — found that nasal sprays significantly knocked down the amount of virus in a patient\'s nose, compared to a saline placebo. But the study was sponsored by the company behind the nose spray, SaNOtize Research & Development Corporation, which ""is a major caveat,"" says Love. So far, the sprays seem relatively safe, though they\'ve not been approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration. Several other countries, including Israel, India and Germany, have approved SaNOtize\'s nitric oxide spray, called Enovid, which isn\'t available on pharmacy shelves in the U.S. but can be purchased online.
