January 28th is National Kazoo Day, and you know what that means — it’s time for us to dive into the history, humor, “how,” and “why” of one of the world’s funniest musical inventions. Let’s get to it! As part of All Classical Portland’s Recording Inclusivity Initiative, five pieces were recorded, including “Taking Names” by Jasmine Barnes. Soprano Karen Slack and pianist Yoko Greeney tackled this moving work for the official recording. Enjoy the conversation below as RII Executive Advisor Mara Miller and Slack speak about the importance of this piece, the inspiration behind it, the changing culture of classical music as new generations advance in the field, and more! “Muse” is the name of the debut recording by cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, and his sister, pianist Isata Kanneh-Mason. The siblings have recorded together before, in the 2020 release, “Carnival of the Animals”, and have performed live many times. “Muse” includes two major 20th century cello sonatas, by Samuel Barber (1932); and Sergei Rachmaninov (1901), as well as shorter pieces by both composers. Sheku and Isata share the joys of performing as siblings (there is no rivalry, both say), and the challenges that have become all too familiar in these times. Hear the rest of the story in their conversation with All Classical Portland’s Program Director John Pitman. Buy the CD Each year, All Classical Portland’s Program Director John Pitman, selects twelve carols from our extensive Festival of Carols library for a deep dive look into their origins. In 2019’s list of carols, we explored favorites like The First Nowell and Adeste fidelis. 2020’s list included Riu, riu, chiu and The Sussex Carol. In this year’s list, you’ll encounter sultry Medieval ballads, surprising Victorian retrofits, indigenous Peruvian dance, macaroni, and possible Soviet assassinations. Be sure to tune in to our Festival of Carols on All Classical Portland from December 22-25, and check out the rest of our holiday programming! Are you reading this article in order to avoid whatever you were supposed to be doing? If so, then great news: you’re not alone in your procrastination! In fact, your dilly-dallying habits are shared with several brilliant artists of classical music. Here, we’ll explore three wonderful pieces, the genius composers behind the scenes, and the habit that makes us all human. John Pitman, All Classical Portland’s Director of Music and Programming, interviews pianist Seong-Jin Cho about the sixth and latest album. Returning to the music of Frédéric Chopin with Chopin: Piano Concerto No. 2, Cho’s CD was recorded in April of 2021, in Hamburg and London. Seong-Jin shares with John the process, and the special challenges, of recording in a studio with an orchestra during the pandemic and offers his insight into the young Chopin’s approach to the concerto form, as well as to the four Scherzi, which were written at various stages in the composer’s life. Purchase the album at ArkivMusic. To mark a milestone birthday and celebrate a new chapter in his relationship with the label, French pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet was given “carte blanche” by the Decca classical label to choose personal music that he has never recorded before—a selection that reflects on the people and pieces that have impacted his life as an artist while expanding his already diverse repertoire in new directions. Mr. Thibaudet’s choices on his disc each have a unique story, and he shares the best with host John Pitman in the recorded conversation, which includes brief musical samples. Some pieces were specially arranged for the pianist, such as “Pride and Prejudice” by Dario Marianelli; others arranged by Thibaudet’s teachers (Elgar’s Salut d’amour one example); and still others were arranged by the pianist himself, including an astounding piano version of Barber’s Adagio. Thibaudet’s recording is as much a gift to us as it is to himself and will enhance playlists for years to come. Purchase “Carte Blanche” at ArkivMusic. With Halloween right around the corner, this week is the perfect time to explore haunted houses, carve pumpkins, stock up on candy for trick-or-treaters, and of course, tune into All Classical Portland at 89.9 FM! There’s no better way to enjoy autumn than by listening to a playlist of spooky classical music. Below, we’ll share some of our favorite festive pieces for the fall season. What’s your favorite ghoulish classical piece? John’s guest is Jerod Impichchaachaaha’ (Im-pih-CHAH-chah-ha) Tate, whose 2009 composition, Lowak Shoppala’ (LO-wak SHO-pah-la), an epic retelling of Chickasaw stories, received its world premiere recording this year. Jerod shares his own stories of growing up in a household of Western classical music, and strong ties to his indigenous roots as well. Buy “Fire and Light” at ArkivMusic During Hispanic Heritage Month, which is observed from September 15-October 15, we at All Classical Portland are excited to celebrate the rich musical contributions of Latino and Hispanic composers. In this list, we’d like to introduce you to a few fascinating composers of Hispanic heritage who have lived or worked in the United States. We’ll start back in the mid-19th century, and end the list with some amazing contemporary composers.

Diego Hernandez is resigning. “Today I tendered my resignation so my colleagues may focus on serving Oregonians and so I can move forward with my life and focus on my health and family,” Hernandez said in a brief statement sent to OPB on Sunday evening. Earlier this weekend,a judge rejected Hernandez’s legal effort to stop the vote on his expulsion. The entire House was scheduled to vote as soon as Tuesday on whether to expel the Portland Democrat after a panel of lawmakers determined he created a hostile work environment for three women. It would have taken a two-thirds vote or 40 members of the House to expel Hernandez. The third-term Democratic lawmaker, once considered a rising star of his party, had faced allegations of harassment for months. After an independent investigation, members of the House Conduct Committee determined he harassed and created a hostile workplace at the state Capitol for three women. The women involved in the investigation all worked at the state Capitol or had jobs that required interacting with the state Legislature. Conduct committee members sided with the women, finding Hernandez used his position of power as an elected official to pressure two of them to either resume a relationship with him or jeopardize their careers. Another woman, who had a longer relationship with him, spoke of his controlling and abusive behavior. Hernandez maintained that he did not have a meaningful chance to present his side of the case. He filed a lawsuit, which included several text messages with the women who were part of the investigation and extensive communication records that were not presented during legislative hearings examining his behavior. Hernandez’s lawsuit sought a temporary restraining order to stop the vote on expulsion and to prevent any other sanctions. But United States District Court Judge Ann Aiken made it clear the Oregon Legislature has been “entrusted with power over policing its own members,” and she was leery of allowing the court to intervene.
