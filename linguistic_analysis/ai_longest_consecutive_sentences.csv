state_press_opinion_2021_result_20,ai,"As Maricopa County's ballotaudit continues, conspiracy theories of an unfair election are being fueled.Arizonais not only lowering voter trust, and potentially affecting outcomes for future elections by doing this, but they are also encouraging other states to follow in their footsteps, to lead these biased audits taking place due to unfounded worries. The audit began on April 23 after the Arizona Senate was granted custody of Maricopa County's 2.1 million ballots to search for any trace of fraud. One could argue that these complaints are connected to the ""Stop the Steal"" movement, which promotes a conspiracy theory that argues the election was somehow fraudulent. This theory continues to be believed by some, even though the ballots were counted multiple times. The mostextreme membersof the conservative party, including groups like the Proud Boys, have voiced support, hoping the audit could help turn Arizona's 11 electoral votes from President Joe Biden to former President Donald Trump. The audit is being done by the private Florida-based technology companyCyber Ninjas, which has received backlash the past few months for its credibility since it has never conducted an audit. Even some Republicans, including ASU College Republicans President Joe Pitts, said there areissueswith how the audit is being handled. ""I think there are genuine questions about the validity of the election that can't be pushed to the side,"" said Pitts, a junior studying management."
stanforddaily_opinion_2020_result_206,ai,"Living in a quarantined household offers no reprieve from the daily aggressions and microaggressions that students may face from their families. Dealing with these aggressions can feel even more draining when cut off from chosen families and supportive communities that campus provided. Being back in a space that's invalidating, without the supportive connection of friends, can make folks feel trapped, hopeless, helpless and isolated. Even for those who are out to their families, it can be challenging to navigate family and cultural dynamics. Well-meaning family members may still need ongoing explanations on why pronouns are important, reminders to use appropriate names and words, and rationalizations of choices from hairstyles to clothing to food choices. These could also come up against family expectations, cultural values and spiritual beliefs. This continuous education and defense can be exhausting and take up a lot of emotional and mental space, leaving little left over for things like class, staying active and talking with friends. For some in the queer community, going home is not an option exactly because of these challenges and others more severe. Some folks have been able to stay on campus, but at a cost. Though still connected to shelter and resources, campus is a ghost town and the communities that felt like family are scattered across the world. How do you pay for meal plans if a huge amount of jobs and opportunities have been canceled?"
state_press_opinion_2022_result_47,ai,"Despite experts emphasizing the importance of water in Arizona, politicians cast the topic aside in favor of other policies. Arizona is facing its worst drought in 1,200 years, but the state's water crisis isn't receiving the urgent political coverage and care it deserves. After water levels in Lake Mead reached a historic low, the Bureau of Reclamation announced that it wouldcut Arizona's river allotmentby 21 percent, increasing water loss by 80,000 acre-feet from 2022. Astudypublished in February notes that these extreme drought conditions will likely persist through 2023, with human-induced climate change single-handedly putting the Southwest on a megadrought trajectory. Although Arizona has implemented manywater conservation efforts, it still needs policy reform and attention. ""We need innovative new approaches,"" said Rhett Larson, the Richard Morrison Professor of Water Law at Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law. ""The shortage at this point is so serious that whatever we've been doing in the past is not good enough going forward."" Larson mentioned that permanent conservation measures such as using low-flow toilets and showers and removing decorative turf “will only get us so far” in the fight to preserve Arizona's water supply. ""The vast majority of the water is used by agriculture, so even if the cities and houses made all of these fixes, it wouldn't be enough,"" Larson said. Additionally, not all parts of Arizona manage water equally - a concern that Kathryn Sorensen, the director of research at the Kyl Center for Water Policy, elaborated on. ""We have really strong, really progressive water management in central Arizona, but those rules don't apply statewide,"" Sorensen said. ""It would be nice if rural communities had some additional tools that enabled them to better manage groundwater."" On the topic of water receiving minimal political coverage, Sorensen and Larson offered several perspectives. ""Water issues don't tend to capture public interest unless there's a crisis,"" Sorensen said."
wildcat_arizona_opinion_2022_result_29,ai,"The online community that supports students' mental health is larger than you may think. Counselors and clinicians at the University of Arizona are committed to bringing this community to the student body on campus. Life has increasingly moved online post-pandemic, and this move has generated virtual means to effectively address mental health, changing the landscape of health support for the benefit of students. Student services have expanded to includeTogetherall, a newly adopted resource within UA Campus Health's Counseling & Psych Services. Togetherall has recently emerged as an innovator and leader for improving mental health, and they're doing it remotely. It provides a safe, anonymous space to connect and converse with others who seek similar support, a sense of community and improvement of their mental health. Monitored by licensed clinicians who provide instantaneous responses with full-time access, the platform has been a reference point for many health representatives at the University of Arizona for its reputation of effectiveness. The Assistant Director of Counseling & Psych Services at Campus Health, Debra Cox-Howard, was instrumental in bringing the online community, Togetherall, to campus. While Togetherall is not directly affiliated with the UA, the efforts of Cox-Howard and others have advocated for its expansion onto campus. Its recent addition as a mental health resource will help educate faculty and diversify its portfolio on treatment options when it comes to properly assisting students. Among the many online services offered by CAPS, Cox-Howard emphasized the importance of Togetherall. When asked about the program she said, “they do a very good job of linking back to our website where you can find self-help information and other resources that are available to you as a student on this campus.” Togetherall aligns with the student-driven approach that CAPS takes to ensure a healthy academic experience. Their approach to online services creates convenience and time efficiency for students, as the choice to support a fully online platform was intentional and due to the impact of the pandemic on student life. Many students continue to learn remotely, and health professionals like Cox-Howard strive to meet students where they are. Students have given feedback that Togetherall helped them feel less isolated in the midst of the pandemic."
ubyssey_opinion_2020_result_1,ai,"At this point in the semester, you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who isn't feeling burnt out by the conditions of online learning. Both students and faculty have struggled greatly to adjust to virtual classrooms, heavy screen time and business-as-usual expectations within the midst of a global pandemic. As students, it can be hard at times to sympathize with faculty. This is especially true when we experience instructors who directly contribute to our feelings of powerlessness and marginalization within the institution. However, in the time of COVID, it is critical to realize that these cyclical harms will continue until we understand that the under-resourcing and over-extension of faculty is fundamentally a student issue. Faculty burnout isn't just anecdotal ᅳ we have real evidence of increased workloads and stress levels. At the Board of Governors meeting, we learned through thetenure track faculty COVID-19 surveythat faculty are experiencing substantial increases in teaching and service workloads, as well as caregiving responsibilities. 73 per cent of faculty respondents also reported that stress, anxiety and sadness have reduced their ability to work through the pandemic. We also learned recently that insurance claims for anti-depressants for faculty and staff haveincreased by 15 per centwithin this pandemic. These rates could easily be attributed to simply existing in a pandemic and fielding endless requests for academic concessions from students in distress, but it's most certainly exacerbated by individual teaching loads currently at145-150 per cent of standardfor tenure-track and non-tenure-track faculty. Recent examples of university 'support' for faculty ᅳ like thehurried announcement and submission deadline for a long-overdue $400 desk/chair reimbursementorthe insinuation that the employee & family assistance program is a main source of supportᅳ demonstrate that it has been trying to reach a comically low bar. What these findings don't tell us is the ways that these conditions and stressors have manifested in the classroom for students. Student social media platforms, like the UBC subreddit, are full of screenshots of harsh emails, complaints about unreachable professors and untimely assessment feedback. With the information we have about the conditions faculty are working within, this should hardly be shocking. We need to move beyond interpreting faculty short fuses and shortcomings as a personal offence and understand it as what it truly is: an unavoidable human response to structural squeezing and exploitation of labour."
rice_thresher_opinion_2022_result_15,ai,"That's so cool!” Athletics doesn't grasp what would be ruined by excising this instrumentation. Alumni and community members are excluded, purportedly because it would be too complicated to pay them, but this easily remedied obstacle is a poor excuse. To Kaitlyn, a clarinetist, the MOB has been an accessible alternative to the traditional college marching band experience ᅳ a way to unwind a few times a week with friends, and without the pressure of mandatory rehearsals or games. Rice students are perpetually busy, because even outside of heavy course loads, so many of us devote our free time to more than just one passion. In the fifty years since Rice's marching band was reborn as the MOB, it has scattered instead of marched, and welcomed members regardless of their musical prowess or ability to show up consistently. This structure acknowledges the reality of life at Rice, and for decades has given Rice a more comprehensive band than it may have had otherwise. We're skeptical that the Owl Pep Band can fill its roster from the talent pool to which it's restricted. MOBsters devote countless hours throughout basketball season because they get to do it with their friends amid an invigorating atmosphere. The offer of money can't get students to audition and commit to 30 games in that same way. Ryan would have conducted the BOB as its drum minor but is eligible to audition for the new pep band as a trombonist. To him, being stripped of such a privilege while being asked to join this new band is insulting. The stated motivations behind this band don't come close to justifying the disregard and ungratefulness shown to so many MOBsters, who sacrificed their time for no compensation. Rather than lend the MOB a modicum of support, Athletics would demolish a vibrant instance of campus life and spend thousands of dollars per week on a substitute with embarrassingly little thought put into it. We doubt throwing money in such a manner at what is ultimately a sideshow attraction will earn them back that investment. This decision disturbingly echoesRice's sale of KTRUin 2010, which also happened without consulting its members. Both undermine student autonomy and Rice's connection to its alumni and wider community."
newuniversity_california_irvine_opinion_2020_result_35,ai,"In recent years, the consequences of climate change have become a looming threat to the lives of communities across the world. This rising concern about climate change has led to the creation of terms such as “eco anxiety” and even aglossaryto address the range of emotional and psychological responses to ecological disturbances. The prevalence of climate catastrophes and ecological disasters has specifically affected members of theGen-Zcohort, especially those from marginalized backgrounds, such as women of color. Jamie Margolin, the 17-year-old founder of a youth climate activist group calledZero Hour, said in an interview withBustlethat this anxiety also stems from conflicting narratives youth are given by their society. That is why it is becoming more necessary for individuals to craft their own narratives of environmental awareness and activism ᅳ ones that precede narratives of fear and helplessness. There is no doubt that our communities are developing a keener environmental awareness. In order to combat this gradually overwhelming sense of helplessness in the face of these environmental issues, students at UCI share the ways in which they channel their frustration and concern into powerful change with the help of sustainability resources and spaces on campus. The Sustainability Resource Center, orSRC, is a physical hub on campus that provides educational resources and programming to help cultivate an environmentally conscious campus. One element of the SRC that makes it such a unique program is that it is run by a student and staff team who co-create events to engage both the campus and surrounding Irvine community. Students, campus partners and community members are free to visit the SRC to find leadership opportunities in the realm of sustainability. Programs such as theCosta Rica Program,On-Campus Sustainability themed housesand EarthReps training program are some notable examples of programs supported by the SRC."
ubyssey_opinion_2020_result_19,ai,"They include parents with children, who may now have to complete the task of double homeschooling. They include students who are working to support their parents or extended families. They include international students whose routes home may beblockeddue to financial, safety or policy constraints. They include graduate students whose research work and methods of income may now be stalled as universities like UBCcurtail most on-campus research activities. They include part-time essential service workers in grocery and food service industries. While there is aid available to all UBC students, including international students, who are in immediate risk through the university, the support does not account for the wide range of students affected. There is a need to recognize the diversity of post-secondary institutions across Canada. As many individual universities are offering their own emergency funding and financial aid programs, UBC has also launched its ownfundraising campaignsᅳ with thePresident's Student Emergency Fundon the Vancouver campus and theA.W. Hunt, QC Student Emergency Assistance Fundin Okanagan ᅳ appealing to its donors and alumni networks. But it shouldn't be completely up to individual schools to try and ensure their students can come back in the fall. With its expansive alumni network and a large operating budget, UBC might be able to pull in massive support, but there are many smaller schools across the country that do not have those same resources. Where can these students then turn to, if the federal government is also failing them?"
Crimson_2022_extracted_articles_result_51,ai,"From papers to presentations, our assignments require extensive research and careful analysis. But what if there was a tool that could help us with these tasks and make the learning experience even better? Enter ChatGPT, the helpful (and maybe even self-aware) language model trained by OpenAI. With its ability to generate human-like text based on a prompt, ChatGPT can be a valuable asset for any type of written work. In fact, this very op-ed was written with the help of ChatGPT! Using ChatGPT for written assignments does not mean that students are taking shortcuts or avoiding the hard work of learning. In fact, it can help students develop their writing skills and deepen their understanding of the subject matter. By providing suggestions and ideas, ChatGPT can serve as a virtual writing coach, guiding students as they craft their own original work."
rice_thresher_opinion_2020_result_3,ai,"However, many - including Texas Senator John Cornyn and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham - still state that Biden should begranted access to intelligence briefings. Trump's General Services Administration head, Emily Murphy, is alsorefusing to acknowledgePresident-elect Biden's victory, denying him access to the federal funding and security briefings necessary to begin his transition process. The president has made ahabit of surrounding himself with sycophants, and his appointees are now doing whatever they can to prove their loyalty. The president-elect's team is making efforts to move on regardless and announced a COVID-19 task force on Monday, Nov. 9. Even so, sources close to the transition warn that if the delay in the process continues, itcould become problematic. The president wins on the back of its electorate, but a president is often only as effective as his Congress will allow him to be. These races are particularly critical, and the outcome of the Senate and House will determine Biden's ability to make full use of his power these next two years; your vote may be needed to shift that balance of power in the 2022 midterms. While the results have been certified by multiple news sources there are still a few events that need to occur before Joe Biden is officially the new president, as well as before our new government can be installed.You can keep up with new developments in the election here.Staying informed about the events that are coming up, like the seating of Congress and certification of election results, helps ensure not only that the democracy the United States has been built on not only stays intact, but the politicians who are elected to serve are accurately representing our nation as well."
Crimson_2021_extracted_articles_result_14,ai,"This was the last question I expected to hear in my Harvard interview. “Catching 'em all” is the goal of each Pokémon game, which has captivated me for over a decade. The prospect of taming wild creatures, battling with them, and conquering new lands still excites me to this day. But my passion for the Japanese franchise went beyond pushing buttons on my Nintendo DS and dishing out $40 each year for the latest journey. I participated in many online forums dedicated to the games, offering theories and sharing sentiments with like-minded fans. Eventually, I wanted to go beyond the comment section and share my enjoyment with a wider audience, so I created my own website,Pika News Network. I had no experience with website building, just a love for writing and collecting those pixelated monsters. Alongside some guest writers, I posted almost weekly for about four years, attaining over 30,000 page views from nearly 130 different countries. For a 14-year-old, these statistics were unbelievable, but I never sought to become the New York Times of Pokémon. It was something I enjoyed, but when it became too time-consuming, I made the difficult decision to let the website go and focus on schoolwork. It felt like giving up a part of me, but my education was my main priority. The project was short-lived, but my love for the series and for writing wasn't, so I struggled with deciding whether or not to discuss it in my college resume. I wasn't convinced that Harvard was in need of a Pokémon Trainer. As a school of great prestige, I knew it wanted to see leadership roles and well-rounded involvement."
stanforddaily_opinion_2020_result_146,ai,"However, if Stanford requires universal S/NC until we return to full face-to-face learning, students might have letter grades for an entire school year missing. Universal S/NC already forced students to make drastic changes to their long-term academic plans. The University cannot keep forcing students to change their plans on employment, graduate school, leave of absence and planned graduation quarter by mandating universal S/NC again. S/NC also erases the difference between Stanford and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs).One of the key differences between Stanford and virtual learning websites like Coursera, edX and Khan Academy is that Stanford students receive letter grades. Letter grades from academic institutions like Stanford certify that students learned the course material and provide an informative assessment of student performances on a detailed scale, rather than the dichotomy of Satisfactory/No Credit.MOOCs can provide certificates for course completion, but these certificates do not specify the level of content mastery; you either earn a certificate or don't. By opting for universal S/NC again, Stanford would resemble MOOCs more and more, categorizing student performances into binary outcomes with little description. Universal S/NC harms Stanford families who pay any portion of the tuition. It's true that Stanford families who pay any part of the tuition are probably not low-income. Nevertheless, they should not have to pay regular tuition for a diminished college experience."
stanforddaily_opinion_2020_result_0,ai,"For example, Biden has not shown any support for defunding the police yet promises reform for the Black community and helping disadvantaged minorities. Biden has chosen the centrist path of reform by focusing on crime prevention, expanding opportunities for mental health treatment and reinvesting in education. While the middle ground may seem pragmatic in trying to appease both sides, it can hurt progress toward the original goal. The centrist path, albeit well-intentioned, is not enough and might create stagnation. For many long-timeorganizers, these may seem to be good intentions, but ultimately they only perpetuate a broken system by directing more money back to the police departments rather than toward other much needed community resources. These questions about what we prioritize in our own communities should encourage us to rethink goals and demand meaningful answers from our leaders. The ground for compromise is indeed difficult to navigate given how much cultural and social issues have spilled into politics. Politics in America have become so divisive and the issues of today demand urgency so how Biden chooses to move forward will determine whether the upcoming presidency will be a landmark in history or merely a restoration of the pre-Trump era."
ubyssey_opinion_2022_result_56,ai,"Whether one is studying New Wave cinema, democracy or Indigenous literature, the arts specializes in producing critical thinkers, which has never been more important to the world. In many areas covered in the liberal arts, such as questions about ideal governments, literary style and historical interpretation, there really is no 'right answer.' Such lack of clean-cut, definitive answers means arts majors are required to think open-mindedly about abstract concepts, differing viewpoints and their own beliefs to formulate nuanced arguments and defend their positions. Arts students are thus trained to sniff out places where assumptions and ideology shape interpretation and lead to the scourge of misinformation. Although BA students and grads don't have a monopoly on that ᅳ scientists and doctors are vital in combating anti-vaccination ideas, for instance ᅳ they can be especially equipped for it. With their emphasis on writing and different forms of communication, the liberal arts also create clear and creative communicators. According to Dr. Raúl Álvarez Moreno, a UBC associate professor of Spanish, the humanistic storytelling and debate skills developed in humanities classes give people the skills to findcommon ground. And all those thesis-driven essays might be exhausting to write, but they train students to be better at persuading people ᅳ vital both for the job market, and for creating the connections necessary to build consensus around the issues that matter."
Crimson_2022_extracted_articles_result_23,ai,"The answers to these questions may show that you're engaging in unhealthy trauma politics. Trauma politics at Harvard, where many students arrive having already sold their life before Harvard as a tragic essay for the admissions office, are complicated. For students that come from less privileged backgrounds, hardship can feel like their only distinguishing factor against wealthier, more well-connected peers. If hearing about your friend's childhood evokes a strange sense of covert competition before the urge to trauma dump, you might be using your trauma to prove your worth. Although these manifestations ofimpostor syndromeare powerful, do your best to ignore them. You have value outside of your trauma; you don't need to relive pain to justify your existence here. The only right reason to trauma dump is for your own benefit. Perhaps you hope to find catharsis or believe your friend can help you cope. As long as the motivation for trauma dumping centers on you, and you alone, proceed to step two. Now that you have looked inward and believe that trauma dumping will help you, look outward and consider how trauma dumping will impact your friend. The classic definition of trauma dumping has you oversharing without consent, but a better trauma dump necessitates getting permission before beginning to dump. Today, trauma is a nebulous concept: For some people, it constitutes minor inconvenience, but for others, it carries a much heavier significance. Give your friend a sense of the gravity of your incoming trauma, and ask if they are prepared to listen."
Crimson_2020_extracted_articles_result_114,ai,"Backing one political candidate and writing off the party you find inferior is none of those things. It's the easy way out for people who don't want to challenge their perspectives or reach outside their bubble. So show us Trump's aggression in interrupting the moderator, but make us rethink what it means to have an aggressive president. Show us Biden's resentment, but comment on the broader significance it has for voters who share this view. Comedy's role is not to take jabs for the sake of taking jabs. It is to reveal the parts of issues that hide beneath the surface. There are greater implications to what happened at the presidential debate, and laughter is the first step to understanding. If we can laugh at the forces that divide us, we take away their power. Only from there can we proceed to remedy what ails this nation.

stanforddaily_opinion_2020_result_249,ai,"At home workouts are great but yoga classes are more fun live ᅳ especially if you're lucky enough to know Hesham at YogaSource. Scheduling may be necessary at Stanford but there's also tremendous value in spontaneity: Call people out of the blue (no pre-call text required). And in a time when we're inundated with statistics ᅳ infection rates, death tolls and stock market plunges ᅳ measuring reciprocity simply must be the most useless exercise of them all. Isolation may be no place for an extrovert, but being out of my comfort zone has pushed me to pinpoint exactly what aspects of my daily interactions I treasure most. At first, my efforts fell short because they didn't leave space for the side commentary, the exchange of meaningful ideas and the spontaneity necessary for real connection. Proving to myself that I can begin to replicate that even in the most extraordinary of circumstances has shown me that my happiness is more transportable than I had thought. With moments to reflect, this time of uncertainty can teach us how precious the unplanned moments and sudden connections are. And perhaps it is this crystallization of what makes us happiest, possible only because of our isolation now, that can allow all of us, juniors especially, to maximize our remaining time."
stanforddaily_opinion_2020_result_209,ai,"Students are allowed to apply for financial aid only if they attend classes at least as a half-time student. But the core motivation for many students to remain on campus is not to take classes, but rather because they have no other options. It is deeply unfair to compel students in need of emergency housing to pay for an online quarter when those without the need can avoid doing so. Second, class selections are extremely limited during the summer, meaning that even if a student wants to work toward their degree, they may not be able to do so. Because Stanford only guarantees financial aid for 12 quarters of a student's undergraduate degree, students may lag behind and would be forced to pay an extra quarter out of pocket ᅳ hurting FLI students who simply can't afford it. To address this, some universities like Vanderbilt have given international students who cannot return home a one-time grant that is proportionate to their current financial aid for summer classes. Unlike Stanford, they are exempting this summer semester from the maximum number of aid-eligible semesters. We must not let Stanford hide behind any excuses for making summer housing unaffordable when many other universities are letting students shelter in place on their campuses affordably. Harvard is allowing those on campus with demonstrated need to stay for the whole summer for only$200."

rice_thresher_opinion_2023_result_65,ai,"This would allow the university to keep track of the use of GPT and easily recognize if a student is relying on it too heavily. However, such a policy could dissuade some students from using GPT and lead to a less efficient use of the technology. Another potential response is for the university to develop a system to detect and flag any suspicious use of GPT. This could be done by creating a system that detects any potential signs of plagiarism or unoriginal work, such as particular phrases or language patterns. While this could be effective in identifying students who are attempting to abuse the use of GPT, it could also unfairly penalize students who are simply utilizing it to its full potential. In the end, Rice University must come up with a feasible solution that prioritizes both academic integrity and students' learning. To this end, the university should consider developing a well-defined policy that outlines the proper usage of GPT and making sure to provide adequate resources to help students in understanding and appropriately using the technology. Ultimately, the challenge for Rice University lies in finding the right balance between preserving its academic standards and allowing students the opportunity to benefit from the use of GPT. With the right approach and resources, the university should be able to develop an effective response that takes into account the needs of both students and faculty."

ubyssey_opinion_2024_result_7,ai,"UBC didn't just give me a pretty diploma ᅳ it steered me through the challenges of starting a business with a mission to tackle the very issues I once wrote essays about. By intertwining my business model with support for charitable causes, I not only challenge the prevailing norms of the fashion industry but also champion a model where fashion serves as a force for good. As a researcher turned entrepreneur, I have harnessed my understanding of fast fashion's environmental and social impacts. Looking back, I've realized that this path I've been navigating is less a departure from my academic roots and more a continuation of my commitment to understanding and improving human interactions with the environment. The challenges of sustainable business practices are as complex as any cultural system studied in anthropology, demanding the application of theoretical knowledge in practical and impactful ways. My studies in history and culture during my degree complicated my understanding of capitalism and its shortcomings, and at first, dampened my initial desire to start a business. Eventually, though, these feelings cultivated the curiosity and courage to speak up and innovate creative ways to disrupt the status quo.

Only three universities in Cho's sample of 106 reported full physical accessibility. Indeed, students at Rice have long noted our campus' infrastructure failures, fromHamman Hall's lack of ADA complianceto a flooded Inner Loop many times it rains. Our sidewalks are (marginally) better than the city of Houston's, though that bar is somehow lower than Rice's accessibility grade. The Thresher's own temporary office, which was slated to be on the fourth floor of Lovett Hall after the RMC's now-delayed demolition, would have been inaccessible by elevator. People from both inside and outside the hedges have noticed our school's lack of comprehensive disability support systems, and we urge Rice to act. Several construction projects are ongoing or looming, such as theacademic quad reconstruction, the RMC's eventual rebuild, the upcoming construction of Sarofim Hall and, of course, colleges 12 and 13. We hope that the architecture firms and Rice administration design these new buildings with these issues in mind, prioritizing, among many things, accessibility."

Either choice seems unacceptable according to social media, yet at least silence carries less risk. But our country's educational institutions should be incubators of ideas, which requires us to engage with a diversity of interpretations. Students should be free to challenge and contradict their peers' views, and even their own. This is how we learn about the world with nuance, change our minds and reinforce our beliefs. Some may say that such a view is nice in theory, but dangerous when words hold so much power to stoke hatred. It is undeniable that the modern world exists in a continual war of information and the presentation of that information. We must each acknowledge the weight of that responsibility: that our words have the real ability to harm and misinform others.Incitementthat is likely to produce violence is, of course, unacceptable. Despite these risks, the alternative of a quiet campus is far worse. As the Supreme Court has held over the ages, we must preserve a free market of ideas so that the best ones may prevail through trial and scrutiny.

A high-speed rail line, using existing technology, could slash travel times by over half. This not only has the potential to take cars and trains off of the road, reducing emissions, but it would also bring our cities closer. In Spain, construction of the Madrid-Barcelona high-speed rail line significantly reduced flights and made travel between city centers significantly more convenient. This is the key to good public transit: services that are frequent, punctual, and fast. Because of the costs associated with public transit, achieving this will require challenging a deeply rooted U.S. norm: individualism. This isn't just about shifting from valuing profit margins to valuing innovation and connectivity; it's about recognizing that progress in public transit will only come when we view it as a collective achievement that enhances community well-being and environmental sustainability.

rice_thresher_opinion_2024_result_23,ai,"When I first set foot on the Rice University campus, the contrast with my small hometown of Toomsuba was stark. Moving from a quaint town of 800 people to the big city of Houston, Texas made me realize how large the divide between my experience and that of my peers was. For students like me ᅳ first-generation, low-income, queer students who attended the same elementary and D-rated high school as our parents and grandparents ᅳ the opportunities were limited. Rice held promises, but an unexpected impact came from an initiative called Generation Conscious. This coalition of like-minded innovators, dedicated to providing sustainable hygiene products, turned my journey from Toomsuba into something truly transformative. In the heart of Hanszen commons, an unusual vending machine caught my eye. It wasn't snacks it dispensed, but rather free laundry detergent sheets, embodying a zero-waste, closed-loop system. This system wasn't just environmentally friendly; its job opportunities, too, were regenerative for students like me. Generation Conscious redirected all funds back into student salaries, bridging the opportunity gap that often hindered students of color like me from accessing high-value internships. It wasn't just about financial empowerment; it was about breaking social barriers. While part of my role involved maintaining the Hanszen station, the real adventure unfolded as I dived into my passion as an engineer. From optimizing humidity levels for hygiene products to collaborating on machine improvements, my technical skills evolved beyond the ordinary internship experience. I wasn't just contributing to a cause; I was dismantling barriers in hygiene equity, creating databases and exploring representation in BIPOC communities. Yet, the true value of the Generation Conscious experience lies in the connections it fosters. Tailoring my internship with the founder allowed me to connect with remarkable individuals likeLacie Pierre, a fellow Mississippian and Black sustainability advocate."
thetech_mit_opinion_2024_result_8,ai,"The conflation of an outspoken nature with formal leadership is a deeply troubling notion, one that suggests a desire to suppress individual expression and stifle the voices of dissent. Additionally, in the initial suspension letter, a document as fraught with inaccuracies as it is with unjust accusations, asserts that ""We received information that after being directed to leave by 2:30 p.m., you exited temporarily but continued to engage in escalating activities that endangered members of the community."" This claim, I must unequivocally state, is a gross misrepresentation of the facts and a distortion of the truth that lies at the heart of this matter. First and foremost, it is crucial to note that I was not, in fact, directed to leave by the arbitrary deadline of 2:30 p.m., for the simple reason that I was not present within the confines of the encampment when these letters were disseminated. To suggest otherwise is to engage in a willful distortion of reality, a shameful attempt to paint me as a recalcitrant agitator bent on sowing the seeds of discord and chaos. Moreover, the accusation that I engaged in escalating activities that endangered the community is one that I reject with every fiber of my being. It is a baseless and inflammatory charge, unsupported by any credible evidence and designed solely to tarnish my reputation and undermine my credibility. The only supposed proof offered in support of this spurious claim is a single photograph depicting me in the act of assisting fellow community members over a fence, an act of compassion and concern that has been cynically twisted into something sinister and malign. Let me be clear: I did not plan, orchestrate, or encourage the actions of those who chose to climb over the fence that day. They made that decision of their own volition, driven by a deep-seated sense of moral outrage and a fierce determination to stand in solidarity with their fellow students trapped inside. It is my solemn duty as a member of this community to do everything in my power to ensure the safety and well-being of those around me, even in the face of an administration that seems determined to silence and punish us for daring to stand up for what we believe in. To twist this act of kindness and solidarity into something nefarious and dangerous is to engage in a grotesque distortion of the truth, a shameful attempt to paint those who dare to question the status quo as a threat to the very fabric of our society. Furthermore, the very policies I am alleged to have violated are couched in language so vague and subjective as to render them all but meaningless, requiring a thorough investigation before any punishment can be justly meted out. The fact that an overwhelming majority of the suspended students are people of color raises deeply troubling questions about the role of bias and discrimination in this process, a shameful indictment of an administration that has lost sight of its moral compass. The reported comparison of peaceful protesters to sexual assault perpetrators is not only deeply offensive but also indicative of a fundamental disconnect between the administration and the values it claims to uphold. As a descendant of Black and Indigenous ancestors who bore witness to the unspeakable horrors of ethnic cleansing, lynching and racial injustice in Texas and Puerto Rico, I am appalled by the insinuation that advocating for human rights and an end to genocide is akin to sexual misconduct. This comparison is a grave insult to the survivors of sexual assault and a painful reminder of the long and sordid history of oppression and discrimination faced by communities of color. I implore the COD [Committee on Discipline] to act swiftly and justly in reviewing my suspension, to right the wrongs that have been done and to restore a measure of dignity and respect to a process that has been sorely lacking in both. Every day that passes without resolution is another day of injustice and harm inflicted upon us, a stain upon the very fabric of this institution. We are students who have dedicated ourselves to the pursuit of knowledge and the betterment of society, and we deserve to be treated with the same respect and consideration that we have shown to others. In conclusion, I call upon MIT to live up to the values it so proudly proclaims, to be a beacon of fairness, integrity, and respect for human rights in a world that so desperately needs such leadership."

Many workers possess college degrees and boast years of valuable library experience. This issue is exacerbated by the appalling pay received by our student workers, starting at just $9 per hour. If we genuinely advocate for a 24/7 library, it is only fair and just that we demand better compensation for the staff who make it possible. Adding insult to injury, specific library departments are not recognized as essential workers during disasters, denying them the compensation and recognition accorded to essential workers. Despite these challenges, library staff have demonstrated unwavering commitment, risking their safety to keep the library open during crises. Winter storms, the ongoing pandemic ᅳ we workers have gone above and beyond, ensuring accessibility to resources even in the face of adversity. It's disheartening to witness a focus on initiatives like “Fondy 24/7!” andassociated petitionswithout a parallel emphasis on addressing the plight of the underappreciated library workers. While education is undeniably essential, the constant demands on Fondren Library often result in misplaced blame on the institution itself. The university's priorities, evident in allocations toward areas like theAcademic Quad redesigninstead of the library, need reevaluation. The call for extended library hours is valid but should not overshadow the pressing need to improve the conditions of the dedicated staff who facilitate this service. If we champion “Fondy 24/7,” we must equally champion fair wages and better working conditions for the individuals who make it possible.

In fact, when I began researching Meta in October 2021, Harvard was close to receivingone of its largest donations everᅳ $500 million from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a multi-billion dollar philanthropic organization created with Facebook wealth. At this time, Harvard's endowment held hundreds of millions in Meta stock,currently its largest publicly-disclosed holding. Despite contractual obligations and available research funding, my research into Meta led to my position at Harvard ending abruptly.

Initially directing the Technology and Social Change project at HKS' Shorenstein on Media, Politics and Public Policy, I was promoted to Research Director in February 2020. As adjunct faculty, I taught a popular course on media manipulation and createdthe Media Manipulation Casebook, documenting tactics disrupting democracy.

ubyssey_opinion_2023_result_9,ai,"Yet, for longer-term problems, this frequency of treatment is not nearly enough. In my own experience, I have had counselling appointments weekly or biweekly for periods of months or years, and while it has been incredibly helpful so far, I currently need my regular appointments to continue indefinitely to maintain a functional level of health. While the AMS supplement helps me access treatment that has been life-changing, it is still merely a supplement; I do not credit it with enabling my access to care. For this policy year, coverage wasreduced to 80 per centof the cost of weekly appointments, down from full coverage in last year, leaving students in situations like mine to manage a cost in the hundreds or thousands. This is a significant amount for anyone, but it is made especially more poignant when students are burdened with tuition and skyrocketing rent costs. Without high incomes or large savings, which is generally not the case among this age demographic, students will often need assistance from family to access the care they need. But even if one's family is supportive of their efforts, the extent to which a family can provide that resource varies based on their socioeconomic status. In this way, access to care that can be critical and life-saving is only available to students born into middle to high income brackets. While the supplemental coverage from the AMS plan may give more people access, by not covering long-term treatment, students who are unable to pay for themselves or through their family's support are still being excluded from health care by the AMS because of economic status. Ideally, mental health services would be fully covered under British Columbia's Medical Services Plan or the University of British Columbia as part of its current budgetary priority to support students in areas including mental health. This could take the form of grants from UBC for students paying out of pocket for mental health care, similar to thefirst-year Student Housing Supplement Grantor theproposed international-student housing bursaryon a broader scale. Such changes could be funded by growing the students' priorities portion of the operating fund, which for allcategories totalled $54.9 million for the Vancouver campus. Yet if the university is currently not subsidizing the longer-term care it has not offered, the responsibility falls to the AMS, our studentunion, to advocate to UBC on our behalf or create a comprehensive and effective program on its own. To ensure this need is met without the full support of UBC, the AMS needs to more actively prioritize the health and wellbeing of students, the union's members, in its budget."

But even now, there are many reasons a community member needs either a free test or a more reliable one. At this massive school, there are students facing financial difficulties and community members who are immunocompromised or who live with immunocompromised people. People may also prefer a more accurate test to guide their decision-making, like when they return to classes or a job after testing positive.

Guardian_Clean_2020_result_26,ai,"We can trace its origins to a medieval intellectual movement, and to two individuals in particular, the Arab scholar Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) and the Persian scholar Razi (Rhazes). The movement was called al-shukuk in Arabic (meaning simply ""the doubts""), and it refuted the wisdom inherited from Ancient Greek scholars more than 1,000 years earlier in subjects such as astronomy and medicine. Al-Haytham, an early advocate of the scientific method, cast doubts on the writing of the Hellenic astronomer Ptolemy, and suggested that one should question not only existing knowledge but also one's own ideas - and be prepared to modify or overturn them in light of contradictory evidence. He overthrew the millennium-old idea that we can see things because our eyes shine light on objects, and gave the first correct explanation of the way vision works.This approach still informs how we do science today. Indeed, this is how the scientific method differs from the stance of conspiracy theorists. Conspiracists will argue that, like scientists, they too are sceptics who question everything and value the importance of evidence. But in science, while we can be confident that our theories and descriptions of the world are correct, we can never be completely certain. After all, if an observation or new experimental result comes along and conflicts with an existing theory, we have to abandon our old presuppositions."

Many won't survive the loss of a second summer.The travel limitations the government implemented while COVID-19 was overwhelming Canada's health-care system were appropriate and largely successful. Now, before it's too late, the government should heed its own expert advisors and provide a timetable for a return to travel, based on advice from health officials, to salvage the summer season that is the lifeblood of so many Canadian workers and businesses.As public health and government officials have repeatedly told us, vaccinations are the most important element in getting back to normal life. After a slow start because of vaccine supply challenges, Canada is quickly becoming one of the most vaccinated countries in the world. Marriott International has joined Faster, Together, a coalition of labour, business and individuals encouraging Canadians to get vaccinated. We also introduced our Vaccination Care Program, which provides education, schedule flexibility, and a financial award at our managed hotels for employees who get vaccinated.The recent announcement lifting some quarantine restrictions for fully vaccinated Canadians and permanent residents offers some optimism.

In other G7 countries, guidance has been updated to allow for the resumption of most activities.Not everyone is ready to travel tomorrow, and it is important that we continue to follow public health advice.

CNN_Clean_2022_result_308,ai,"A couple of months ago, when the consensus outlook for the economy was fairly sanguine,we warnedthat the economy was ""close to entering a recession,"" but that there was still time to make hay in the jobs market.But now that a recession is clearly looming, the window of opportunity for job seekers is slowly starting to close.Withgross domestic productdata showing the key measure of economic output falling again in Q2 2022 after declining inQ1 2022, many will likely conclude that we're in a recession. In fact, over the past 75 years or so, there's been a US recession every timeGDPhas fallen for two consecutive quarters, according to our ownanalysis.Official recession recognition will have to await a wider variety of data releases, however, because a recession is a vicious cycle of declining employment, income, output and sales that then feed back into a further drop in employment, etc. In addition, the GDP number often goes through several revisions as the Commerce Department refines its calculations and new data becomes available.While it's premature to officially date the onset of recession, we believe one will take hold, which will begin to undermine hiring. Indeed, if employers believe we're in recession, they'll start to cut back on hiring. We're seeing some anecdotal signs of this caution already as tech companies announcelayoffsandjobless claimsrise.It makes sense, therefore, for job seekers to try finding jobs with companies that are less vulnerable to the economy's troubles. So, where exactly should people look?Thinking big picture, this means focusing on firms whose products or services people need day in and day out, even during recession. This includes health care jobs like those in hospitals, nursing homes and doctors' offices. Utilities and legal services are insulated from recessionary forces for similar reasons, as is education.But within these broad categories, job hunters should be discerning. The key is to avoid employers that offer products and services that cautious customers might elect to forgo or postpone.For example, while the health care sector is generally a safe harbor during recessionary storms, elective cosmetic surgery providers aren't immune to recession as clients might decide to postpone procedures and other services."

This is because the statistics used to show that most capital gains and investment income accrue to high-income individuals are biased by the inclusion of occasional capital gains in the income definition."" We think our findings, which highlight this problem, indicate additional research is warranted, as we hope Prof. Kesselman would agree.His article does make one valid criticism, however. In our paper, which was based on data from a PricewaterhouseCoopers study, the capital gains tax rate for the United States only included the federal component and ignored state-level taxes, an error we obviously regret. We're currently revising our data, which results in the capital gains tax rate (long-term) ranging from 23.8 per cent in the nine U.S. states with no state-level capital gains tax to 37.1 per cent in California. Comparable Canadian rates range from 23.75 per cent in Saskatchewan to 27.0 per cent in Nova Scotia.Contrary to the inference by Kesselman, however, the change in the U.S. rates doesn't materially affect the overall results of the study. Though competitive with comparable U.S. rates, Canada's capital gains tax rates remain middle-of-the-pack among industrialized countries. Prof. Kesselman would eliminate that competitiveness by raising Canada's capital gains tax rates to between 36.6 per cent and 40.5 per cent (depending on the province)."

Bizarrely, though, the details of the report show relatively sound economic fundamentals. In fact, looking ahead, there is reason to be cautiously optimistic about economic growth over the remainder of the year.Indeed, a closer look at the underlying data suggests that the first quarter figure represents a perfect storm of temporary disruptions that distorted overall GDP growth, rather than signs of a deeper problem.Gross domestic product is broken up into several pieces - including consumption, investment, government spending and international trade - which measure the overall spending that occurs in an economy. The biggest and most important components are consumption and investment, which measure what US consumers and businesses are doing. While government spending is important, too, it's a smaller piece, and international trade, which includes exports and imports, can be quite volatile.Over the first quarter of this year,consumptiongrew by 2.7%, with spending onservicesperforming especially well. This tells us that Americans are eager to get out of their homes to dine out and go on vacation.

I was told that I needed to be available from 6am to 12am seven days a week on a four-hour contract, and if I couldn't commit to that then I wouldn't get a job. On the other hand, the Jobcentre expects claimants to find and secure additional work to fit in around existing work commitments or they issue sanctions. I've juggled multiple jobs around my life in the past easily, and never needed to claim government support until 2019.By demanding 24/7 flexibility, employers are inadvertently using universal credit as a government-sponsored bank scheme. With the benefits of having people perpetually available and ready for work at any time at short notice, without the commitment of paying a retainer or higher wages. From my own experience, my previous job gave me six to 12 hours a week splattered over six days a week, where shifts changed without notice. People can't pay bills on unpredictable wages, so they, like me, claim universal credit to help make ends meet.The world of work has changed. It is an employer's market, indicating high unemployment and high competition for jobs, not the high employment record we've been fed over the last few years."
Guardian_Clean_2020_result_3,ai,"One poll, taken as the fight against Islamic State raged, found that 73% of Iranians had a favourable opinion of him. Even so, thelarge crowdsthat have turned out on the streets of cities across the country have exceeded predictions. In a sense, though, the formidable show of unity is no surprise. Iran - like any other country - is proud, patriotic, and its people tend to put their differences aisde when faced with an outside enemy.Suleimani oversaw Iran's regional policy, and as a result is regarded as having spent his lifetime defending his country. When Isis approached the Iranian border after taking over swaths of territory in neighbouring Iraq in 2014, the Quds force were at the forefront, representing the only country willing to commit boots on the ground in the fight to destroy the group. While many in the region viewed Suleimani as a deeply controversial figure, to put it mildly, a significant number of Iranians, Kurds and Iraqis saw him as having been pivotal in stopping Islamic State.At home, this popularity cut across political lines. Becoming a battle hero is one way to win broad legitimacy, and so it has proved in death as in life. The killing of one of their country's most senior officials is perceived by Iranians as a violation of sovereignty, and the rally-around-the-flag effect has been notable.That doesn't mean all Iranians condoned Suleimani's actions abroad. In fact, for years people have been complaining about the extent to which the government has seemed to be occupied elsewhere, even as the internal situation deteriorated."
Guardian_Clean_2020_result_50,ai,"I wonder how many relationships received a baptism of fire because of the pandemic.The psychotherapistEsther Perelhas been producing podcasts, webinars and newsletters throughout lockdown about the challenges it presents. In her newsletter earlier this year, she emphasised the importance of recognising that we all have different coping mechanisms. ""Under acute stress, some of us become highly logical, others become highly emotional,"" she wrote. In other words, we need to tolerate our differences in an emergency situation, too.If you've been single through lockdown, this might all sound like whingeing. There are people who have not touched another person for many months, and that absence of human touch has real, profound emotional effects (this absence can, of course, exist in relationships too). At the same time, it's important to acknowledge that relationships are hard. The lure of the fairytale is powerful, and has been amplified by influencer culture on social media. When it comes to celebrities, we see the romantic weddings and then the catastrophic relationship breakdowns, but far less space is devoted to the everyday challenges that couples face. Perhaps that's whya video of the actors Will Smith andJada Pinkett-Smithdiscussing the time their marriage nearly ended resonated so much online recently. Even if it did feel a tad choreographed, the honesty of the conversation and the visible emotion on display felt new.Attitudes also seem to be changing among the non-famous. Not long ago, Iworked on a pieceabout younger couples who had been to relationship therapy. I was encouraged by how open my interviewees were about having sought help. They still carried a slight stigma about seeking therapy, but far less than that our parents' generation faced, for whom, one interviewee noted, marriage counselling was seen as a last-ditch attempt to save a failing relationship, and any problems were kept from the children. This new culture of openness about the lows as well as the highs can only be a good thing.We are yet to see the effects of lockdown on relationships in the long term, but it won't all be divorce and heartbreak."

Users of the tool claim to be able to write coherentessays and op-edsin seconds.

Al-Qaeda remains a threat to the United States and its allies, while the Islamic State continues to be a menace in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia.The Biden Administration has taken some steps to address these threats, including authorizing the first military strikes against al-Qaeda and Islamic State targets in Syria and Yemen, and deploying special operations forces to Syria to help combat the Islamic State.But much more needs to be done to protect the U.S. and its allies from terrorist threats. The Biden Administration should expand its efforts to counter violent extremism, not just in the Middle East, but in the United States as well.The U.S. should also strengthen its partnerships with countries in the region, such as Jordan and Egypt, that are key to regional stability and counterterrorism efforts. Working with these countries to build up their capacity to counter terrorist threats will pay dividends in the long run.Finally, the Biden Administration should make a concerted effort to re-engage with Iran, the region's most powerful state."

It provided an intimate record of people whether they were visiting drug treatment centers, strip clubs, casinos, abortion clinics or places of worship.Surrendering our privacy to the government would be foolish enough. But what is more insidious is the Faustian bargain made with the marketing industry, which turns every location ping into currency as it is bought and sold in the marketplace of surveillance advertising.Now, one year later, we're in a very similar position. But it's far worse.A source has provided another data set, this time following the smartphones of thousands of Trump supporters, rioters and passers-by in Washington, D.C., on January 6, as Donald Trump's political rally turned into a violent insurrection. At least five people died because of the riot at the Capitol. Key to bringing the mob to justice has been the event's digital detritus: location data, geotagged photos, facial recognition, surveillance cameras and crowdsourcing.The sacking of the Capitol was a shocking assault on the republic and an unwelcome reminder of the fragility of American democracy. But history reminds us that sudden events ᅳ Pearl Harbor, the Soviet Union testing an atomic bomb, the Sept. 11 attacks ᅳ have led to an overreach in favor of collective security over individual liberty that we'd later regret. And more generally, the data collected on Jan. 6 is a demonstration of the looming threat to our liberties posed by a surveillance economy that monetizes the movements of the righteous and the wicked alike.The data we were given showed what some in the tech industry might call a God-view vantage of that dark day.

The paper was crowded with confessions, explanations and apologies over a disgraced podcast called ""Caliphate"" that went off the rails and into the weeds of fiction.Over 12 episodes in 2018, the program promoted the false boasts of a Pakistani man living in Canada who claimed he murdered and beheaded people as a member of Islamic State in Syria. The man, Shehroze Chaudhry, who went by the name Abu Huzayfah, also told tales about terrorist leaders using maps to plan attacks on Western targets and aiming for another 9/11. ""They wanted to outdoAl Qaeda,"" Chaudhry warned.It was sensational stuff and the release sparked political fallout in Canada, withJustin Trudeau's government accused of not monitoring the return of Islamic State fiends.JASON CHAFFETZ: MELANIA TRUMP HAS BEEN AN OUTSTANDING FIRST LADY ᅳ LIBERAL MEDIA HAVE TREATED HER UNFAIRLYSoon, however, critics suggested the Times had been duped and that Chaudhry never joined ISIS or committed crimes. It turns out that the battlefield pictures he posted on social media as his own were taken off the Internet.Although he visited South Africa and lived for a time in Pakistan with his grandparents, Canadian intelligence believes he never set foot in Syria. Indeed, by then Chaudhry was working in his family's shawarma shop in a suburban Ontario strip mall.Predictably, the Times and lead reporter Rukmini Callimachi fought the critics and insisted the paper had gotten the truth out of Chaudhry. The Times began to seriously re-examine its work only when their star confessor was arrested in Canada two months ago and charged with committing a terrorist hoax by claiming he was a killer when he actually wasn't.Finally, the paper's surrender came Friday in a voluminous mea culpa, where top editor Dean Baquet shredded the podcast for failing to vet Chaudhry and ignoring discrepancies. The Times reporters who spent two months hunting the truth described Chaudhry as a ""Walter Mitty"" fabulist, and reporter Callimachi apologized. She keeps her job but is pulled off the terror beat and a Peabody award she won for the series has been returned, the Times said.The bizarre episode is important because it helps illustrate what has happened to the Times since it abandoned its standards of fairness and accuracy to pursue a far-left political and cultural agenda.While the ritualistic repentance in this case seems sincere, it is also designed to create the impression that everything else the paper publishes can be trusted.Nonsense.Here are a few recent examples that had far worse impacts than ""Caliphate"" and none has been admitted or corrected.The Times was the lead offender in the greatest error in modern journalism: The false claims that President Trump colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election.The paper pushed the narrative and was rewarded with Pulitzers and other awards. The Times played Pied Piper to pack rats from other outlets who joined the feast of fabrication.The campaign, based largely on anonymous sources, sabotaged a presidency for nearly three years. Even after special counsel Robert Mueller came up empty in trying to find collusion, the Times and fellow culprits never expressed contrition for their destructive errors. Their hatred of Trump was their justification.The paper also played a major role in the unforgivable smearing of Brett Kavanaugh during the 2018 Supreme Court nomination battle. Times reporters reflexively gave credence to lurid allegations that had not a shred of evidence in a bid to block his confirmation. To this day, there have been no apologies or explanations.The Times runs afoul when it shapes stories to make the truth appear what reporters and editors want it to be. When facts don't fit, they are ignored or massaged.Then there is the 1619 Project, where the Times took it upon itself to rewrite American history, despite esteemed historians pointing out its major errors. For Baquet and his crew, facts didn't matter in their bid to advance a radical racial narrative.The list of errors also includes things the Times doesn't print because the facts conflict with its partisan position. It withheld until after the election the knowledge that e-mails linking Joe Biden to his son Hunter's foreign business schemes were authentic.Despite the different topics involved, the fundamental mistakes are similar."

It's a way to encourage moms to breastfeed, as the nutritional value of breast milk issuperiorto any manufactured formula. But ""breast is best"" does not take into account the often difficult andchallenging circumstancesbetween wanting to breastfeed and not being able to for a variety of reasons.Nonetheless, the societal emphasis on breast milk can create a stigma and cause shame for some mothers. Parents who rely on baby formula are now facing another challenge in the midst of a nationalbaby formula shortage. Stores have, for months, not been able to keep shelves stocked with enough supply, while manufacturers have reported their production is at full capacity. For so many families, this shortage is a crisis threatening the health of their babies.While the White House says the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) isworking around the clockto address the baby formula shortage, the US Department of Health and Human Services has launched a website to help parents find formula. ""You can find this at HHS.gov/formula,"" said White House press secretary Jen Psaki. ""This work is far from over, and in the days ahead, you'll hear about the actions we're taking to increase safe infant formula. ""Amid this shortage, we are reminded again how delicate our supply chains are. AsThe Nationreported in 2020, there's a monopoly on baby formula in the US, with Abbott Laboratories, Reckitt Benckiser and Nestle controlling around 95% of the market.When even one company is unable to keep up with their demand, the supply falls drastically, which is what happened in this case.

They've endured several waves of the virus, government-mandated restrictions on travel and service problems as airlines struggled to staff up for a resurgence in demand. All of this has tested passengers' patience and airlines' balance sheets.Unfortunately, there are more unknowns on the horizon. A new and more dangerous variant of Covid could emerge (there is already a more transmissible form of Omicron spreading); the war in Ukraine could take an even more dangerous turn; or rising interest rates, inflation and oil prices could slow the US and global economies more than expected.We are only about eight weeks into the crisis in Ukraine, but so far, travelers don't appear to be pulling back. In March,passengerswere at 87% of 2019 levels, and manyairlinesare reporting no discernable effect as of yet onbookingsfor future travel, which remain strong.If these trends continue, this summer will most likely be much like last year's - with crowded planes. But this time the fares will be noticeably higher.For airlines, higher fuel costs will slow their long, bumpy path to financial recovery -fuelis already one of the most expensive items for airlines. And the sudden run-up in oil prices will feed through to jet fuel prices. US airlines have disclosed estimates of how much a specified increase injet fuel priceswould raise their expenses. The numbers are sobering.For example, a $1 increase in the price per barrel of jet fuel could costAmerican Airlinesan extra $95 million over the course of a year, based on its forecast fuel consumption. Meanwhile,Delta Air Linesrecently estimated that its second quarter 2022 jet fuel would cost $3.20 to $3.35 per gallon, compared with $2.16 in the same periodlast year.Airlines will try to increase ticket prices to offset rising fuel costs. And they are counting on not losing too many customers since other airlines will also likely hike fares to try to offset higher fuel costs. Even Southwest Airlines, which hedges most of its fuel costs, faces other cost pressures, like labor expenses, and may seek to raise fares somewhat.Airlines are probably right to anticipate that passengers won't stop traveling."

In June they determined that only projects without Russian participation could proceed.Despite this enormous rift, the West still shares interests with Russia in the Arctic - addressing climate change, protecting the environment and advancing sustainable development for the peoples of the Arctic. Russia has half the land mass, two-thirds of the people and three-quarters of the GDP in the region. There can be no meaningful progress on core pan-Arctic issues if Russia is not engaged.That leaves the Arctic Council in a quandary. Other forums exist to address Arctic issues: the International Maritime Organization, various multilateral fisheries arrangements, and numerous climate and environmental agreements, for example. But the Arctic Council, uniquely, includes formal Indigenous representation through six organizations representing the Inuit, Sami, Aleut, Gwich'in, Athabascan and Russian Indigenous peoples. There is valid concern that simply hiving off Arctic issues to other international bodies will diminish the influence of Indigenous peoples in matters affecting them first and foremost.The organization has been effective for shaping Arctic policy and values, and there is no desire to abandon it. Indeed, the seeds planted by Canada when it first proposed the creation of the Arctic Council over 25 years ago have given rise to an organization that has accomplished much and would not easily be replaced. The Norwegians, who are supposed to take over chairmanship of the Arctic Council from Russia in May 2023, have made it clear that they intend to move forward.If it seems certain that the Arctic Council's work will continue in some manner, what are the options available for addressing Russia's participation?The other seven Arctic states are committed to a rules-based international order."

We have cut off Russian banks from theglobal financial system, sanctioned Putin's inner circle ofoligarch cronies, and targeted the country's lucrativeenergy sector. The United States even banned the import ofRussian itemssuch as vodka, diamonds and seafood. These deliberate moves demonstrate that as long as Putin continues his merciless war of choice, we will make him pay for his senseless attack on a free, independent nation.But, as leaders of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Trade, we know that we need to do more if we want to really hit the Kremlin where it hurts. We've built our international trading system to expand access to global markets and lower tariff barriers for our trading partners. But nations should only reap those benefits if they follow the rules. Putin has clearly broken the rules and should no longer have access to that system.That's why it's so important that Congress came together last week and passed a bill to revokeRussia's preferential trade status- a move that will inflict a powerful blow to Russia's economy. And just a few days later,President Biden signedthis critical legislation into law.When nations have preferential trade status, it allows them to trade openly by expanding market access and reducing tariffs.

The first edition attracted more than 20 millionviewers, and the latest edition reportedly reached almost 18 million. Even with uncounted numbers onstreaming, surpassing Watergate's audience would seem to be a reach. People have more diversions now, off and on television.What's more, though: A significant segment of the population - supporters of Donald Trump, who has been the target of the investigation - has stuck their hands over eyes and ears and pretended there's nothing of interest going on.Still, even with fewer Americans tuning into the January 6th committee hearings, I believe they will have just as great of an impact (or even greater) on American history as the Watergate hearings did.The stakes are clearly higher. Watergate was about a bungled attempt by a Republican president to sabotage the political prospects of his Democratic opponents through an office burglary; the attack on the Capitol was about a concerted attempt by a Republican president to undo the foundation of American democracy: the peaceful transfer of power.But if you've listened carefully, it's hard to miss the echoes.

For the Republicans who hoped to put Trump in rear view mirror, this could spell disaster.State parties may not care. Indeed, by attacking fellow Republicans, party officials in places like Arizona, Oregon and Virginia scare away potential moderate Republican voters who do not subscribe to Trumpism. Through censure and resolutions, these officials seek to cast out any Republican they view as not sufficiently loyal to the former President.This was misguided enough during the Trump years. Traditionally, parties have believed it is important to grow their base -- not shrink it through loyalty tests.

Being a patriot is one of those qualities - like having a sense of humour - that cannot be self-certified, but the intent shows awareness of a major deficiency in the party's image under its previous management. Jeremy Corbyn was not mentioned in the speech, so even if there had been an audience, there would have been no awkward moment for Starmer, smiling thinly while the crowd cheered his predecessor's name.By reducing the scope for conspicuous displays of continuity Corbynism, the virtual conference format has done the new leader a favour.

Things peaked when a fracking test site at Balcombe in West Sussex was blockaded thatsummer. A week of actions culminated in mass arrests including that ofGreen party MP Caroline Lucas. For years, similar blockades took the battle to the fracking industry, until in 2019 the government did a U-turn, withdrawing its support andannouncing a moratorium.In recent years disruption has played a huge role in animating public anger and dismay at the government's lack of ambitious climate action. The sobering Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in late 2018 prompted schoolchildren tostrike in their thousands.

If Trump persists in that approach, the baseless claim could offend Republican senators, motivating them to vote for conviction. All of this begs the question: What's next for Trump and the GOP?Depending on the impeachment outcome, it seems there are two possibilities. One is a Trump-lite scenario in which the former president plays a slowly diminishing role in party affairs -- this option would be certain if Trump is convicted. However, if he's not found guilty, the alternative is a Trump-heavy presence, where the former president seeks continuing control over the GOP and runs for president again.First, consider the Trump-lite scenario, which addresses the obstacles Trump faces moving forward. I believe this is the most likely fate for him, even if he's not convicted. This scenario foresees an active, yet not dominant, role for Trump, and results in him not seeking the presidency in 2024.Trump's approval ratings, including among Republicans, can be expected to dip due to impeachment trial evidence like police reports of arrested rioters who claimed they were following Trump's orders, and horrifying new video of the violence. Even more damning will be the account of acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, who told Vanity Fair that Trump advised him the night before the riots to bring in 10,000 National Guardsmen to control the crowd. This indicates that Trump knew the demonstration could spin out of control even before he instructed his base on January 6 to ""fight much harder"" and ""show strength. ""Without his social media megaphone, Trump has lost the most effective outlet for his ""big lie"" tactics, such as convincing his supporters that the election was stolen from him without providing any proof that fraud had occurred."

He also has to be monitored for signs of allergic reactions or side effects of the medications he is receiving, which include an experimental treatment called Regeneron.Regeneron consists of monoclonal antibodies (proteins) that bind to the corona spike of coronaviruses to deactivate them. If this therapy works, it will reduce the viral load in the president's body. Delivering a knockout blow like this to the coronaviruses infecting President Trump will be an important step to returning him to full health.Of course, we must keep in mind that experimental therapies like Regeneron are new and not yet proven to be effective. Clearly, doctors feel the treatment has a good chance of helping the president, but we can't say for sure that it will work as well as hoped.These next few days will be telling. It takes a week to about 10 days in most cases for the coronavirus to cause the peak level of inflammation and damage to the lungs and organs. Given that the president is receiving aggressive treatment with drugs, we'll have to see what happens in his case.Regeneron has only been tested on 275 patients and is being administered to the president under a compassionate care exemption because it has not yet been approved for general use by the Food and Drug Administration.The antibodies in Regeneron are like soldiers deployed against enemy force - the coronavirus invaders that have infected President Trump's body in this case."

AustrailianFinancialReview_Clean_2021_result_0,ai,"Mr Trump's Twitter ban is in keeping with the longstanding principle that the right to free speech can and must be legitimately abridged to protect the norms of a democratic society. This is the line crossed last week by Mr Trump's incendiary tweeting, which incited the violent storming of the Capitol building by a mob of Trump supporters in a futile attempt to overturn the congressional process of confirming the election of Joe Biden. There is no constitutionally guaranteed right to tweet, even under America's expansive First Amendment free speech protections. In a free society, social media companies can choose what content they host on their platforms - even if this undermines big tech's claim not to be publishers. Prohibitions on speech that incite violence are a long-established and accepted part of the law in democratic countries, including Australia, and are especially designed to target speech that might incite political violence that undermines the democratic rights of other citizens to live in a peaceful and civil society. Hence, the widespread condemnation of Mr Trump's disgraceful behaviour across partisan lines in the US and around the world.Mr Trump's demagoguery should not, however, become an excuse to launch a broader free-speech crackdown. Democratic societies must be able to freely debate controversial ideas and issues, even if some people take offence. Unleashing a broader wave of censorship aimed at conservatives would also help to refuel the polarisation and populism that helped get Mr Trump elected in the first place. A renewed outbreak of the culture wars over freedom of speech would only further complicate the Biden administration's difficult task of healing a deeply divided nation.It is also hard to see, two weeks out from Mr Biden's inauguration, what difference at this point would be made by impeaching Mr Trump, who has now belatedly acknowledged that he was fired by the American people at November's election. The case for a quick-fire impeachment suggests that Mr Trump should attract the ultimate constitutional sanction for his outrageous undemocratic behaviour. Writing in The Australian Financial Review today, former foreign minister Alexander Downer says the Capitol riots will have no long-term impact on American democracy and it is only Mr Trump's legacy that has been permanently damaged; former Australian ambassador to the US, Indonesia and Japan John McCarthy says the disgraceful scenes have seriously tarnished the US' global standing as a beacon for democratic values. Mr Trump has, however, already been sanctioned by US civil society: his ""stolen election"" lies have led to a politically significant repudiation by the American public, as shown by the Democrat victories in the two Senate run-off races in traditionally conservative Georgia.This is further proof that America's political institutions and culture are strong enough to see off Mr Trump's populist challenge to democratic norms. With the COVID-19 crisis having lifted US unemployment higher than it was in 2016, the Democrats should now move on to focusing on driving the business-led recovery that will be needed to restore jobs and growth. Reconstruction of the shattered US economy, rather than impeachment or speech bans, is the best way of guarding against a MAGA revival in 2024 and ensuring Mr Trump stays consigned to political exile at Mar-a-Lago, where he deserves to reside in ignominy."
CNN_Clean_2022_result_359,ai,"The latest bombshell about Twitter's alleged lack of security and potential vulnerabilities is yet another sign that social media networks shouldn't be trusted to regulate themselves.Last month, Twitter's former head of security, Peiter ""Mudge"" Zatko, told Congress and federal agencies that the company's security practices pose grave threats to national security. As part of his disclosures, which were revealed byCNNlast week, Zatko claims that the company allows about half of its staff - which amounts to thousands of employees - access to critical controls, and one or more of them may be working for a foreign intelligence agency. He also alleges that the company does not adequately protect the security of user data, using servers with outdated software that are missing critical security features like encryption. What's more, he claims that he was discouraged from sharing the full extent of the company's security problems with its board.Twitter, of course, disputes the idea that it has big security problems. It told CNN that engineering and product teams can only access the production environment if they have ""a specific business justification,"" that employees use devices that IT and security teams oversee, and that if a device is running on outdated software, they can prevent it from connecting to sensitive internal systems. However, Twitter did not respond to questions about its alleged foreign intelligence vulnerabilities.A spokesperson told CNN that ""Mr. Zatko was fired from his senior executive role at Twitter in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance."" The spokesperson also said, ""What we've seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context. ""(Zatko contends that he was fired in retaliation for raisingsecurity concernsat the company. )This latest whistleblower report makes clear that social media platforms not only pose potential privacy risks to users, but also national security risks. Congress needs to urgently pass a law regulating what data social networks can collect, how they can share it, how they can store it, who can access it and under what circumstances. Lawmakers also need to give the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) a specific mandate to closely oversee social media companies' security and privacy practices. That would ensure that these companies follow any new regulations put in place. We simply can't trust them to maintain their own data collection and sharing and security standards.Consider the ramifications of a social media company's inadequate security protocols. If a company lacks proper safeguards to protect user passwords or employees' accounts, the accounts of legitimate sources such as high-profile people could be taken over and used to issue dangerous, even deadly, claims or directives.Recall that, in 2020, hackers took control of the Twitter accounts of people like Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Barack Obama to promoteBitcoin, andTwitter userswere tricked into forking over more than $100,000. The hackers accomplished this by targeting employees who had access to internal tools and were able to post the tweets.Further, if a company lacks protections against how many employees have access to user information and safeguards to ensure that employees and users aren't hacked, then hackers - or even employees - could gather sensitive information about users from their social media data and share it with foreign intelligence agencies. Gaining access to their passwords or private messages can reveal evidence of things like affairs or abortions that bad actors can use to try to blackmail them into spying.Does it sound crazy to think that a Twitter employee would sell user data to a foreign government? Just this month, a former Twitter employee was found guilty of giving private information about Twitter users to the government ofSaudi Arabiain exchange for money.That's why it's critical for social networks to limit access to sensitive user information, store and share as little user data as possible, and take every possible measure to prevent hacks."

The enemy at the gate is the United States, Nato, or Europe. They said that the west had plans to deploy nuclear weapons to Ukraine and take away our nuclear arsenal. Ultimately to take over Russia: divide it, destroy it and take it apart.This is said not just on state news, but discussed all day on big talk shows likeTime Will Tell.

FinancialPost_Clean_2020_result_36,ai,"The result of this de facto co-ordinated expansion of government borrowing could well be an increase in world interest rates - even if our central banks are currently purchasing a significant chunk of this new debt.To see how annual debt-service charges might be affected by the new public debt, let's start with some basic data for the federal government. In 2019 there was $1,045 billion of interest-bearing debt and annual debt-service payments of $23 billion. Thus, the average interest rate across all of the different bond maturities was about 2.2 per cent. The average term to maturity of the federal debt is about eight years, implying that about one-eighth of the government's outstanding debt is refinanced or ""rolled over"" each year.A woman walks past a restaurant closed due to COVID-19, in Vancouver on May 6, 2020.Given this starting point, and the projection that the Canadian government will add $600 billion of new debt over the next six years, we can compute the change in the annual debt-service costs. If all of the new and rolled-over debt is financed at a very low rate, say 1.0 per cent, then annual debt-service payments would not change much. In this case, the government doesn't have to make much of an adjustment to its other spending or taxing plans. But this may be too optimistic.As we argued above, given that many countries are adding to their public debts at the same time and by large amounts, private lenders may not be prepared to finance these budget deficits without demanding higher interest rates on these new bonds. If rates rise from their current low levels so that all of the new and rolled-over debt is financed at the current average interest rate of 2.2 per cent, interest costs would rise from $23 billion this year to about $36 billion each year by 2025. If interest rates on new and rolled-over debt rise only to 3.0 per cent, then the annual interest charges would double to about $46 billion.How would any extra interest payments be financed?"

Democrats, meanwhile, packed up and flocked on private jets to Washington, D.C., to deny them quorum.Across America, ""voting rights"" have become the top political issue after the contested 2020 election. After courts dismissed their claims, states where results were challenged - Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin - have passed measures for election security, requiring photo ID to ensure that only eligible citizens vote. Eighty per cent of Americans, in a recent Monmouth University Poll, support these measures(https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_062121/), with 69 per cent of Black voters endorsing the same(https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/lifestyle/general_lifestyle/march_2021/75_support_voter_id_laws). Though the U.S. Supreme Court recently upheld these laws, 6-3, in Arizona, Democrats are undeterred to ""stop the steal."" Their 'For the People Act,' pending in Congress, would override state election security and end all ID requirements. So far, the Senate filibuster has prevented it from becoming law.While the U.S. bickers over ""election security,"" however, it may be worthwhile to look northward to the Canadian example. In 2007, with the Harper government's Bill C-31 amendments to the Elections Act, Canada made government-issued voter ID compulsory for federal elections (with provinces having similar measures). Voters, per Section 143, are required to prove their identity and residence, with strict requirements for the kinds of ID acceptable."

Trump supporters, and the former President himself, will be livid.It seems like a foregone conclusion they will claim that the charges are politicized and trumped-up, leveled because Trump is a threat to the ""swamp"" and ""deep state,"" and that Democrats fear him so much they are willing to shut him down using any means necessary. An indictment would be hugely divisive in an already-divided nation.In that most basic sense, I do not want Trump to be indicted. It is not good for a nation to be trying and potentially imprisoning its former leaders, even unpopular ones. There is also the risk that charging Trump with crimes would create a cycle of recrimination and revenge from Republicans.But it's worse to allow a former leader to destroy the nation's trust in elections and its democratic processes. If there is no penalty, what will prevent others from doing the same in the future?There is no evidence that Trump regrets his actions. He continues to spread the lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and evenbefore the 2022 midterms, he wasplanning to replayhis election fraud claim if his favored candidates lost. He is running for President again, and if he wins,he may usehis power todestroy American democracyas we know it.In the age of Trump, parts of the Republican Party have been hollowed out for conspiracy theorists, racists, antisemites, liars, religious extremists and adherents to the cult of MAGA.The GOP has become so intellectually bankrupt that it didn't even bother with a platform in the last presidential election, instead essentially saying thatits policy positions are whatever Trump wants.

InTackling racism on social media is just the tip of the iceberg, the writer set out his stall with reference to the grime artist Wiley, whose recent antisemitic posts would eventually lead to him being banned from Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.The article's main image purported to show Wiley but, as readers would soon point out, was in fact of fellow grime pioneer, songwriter and actor Kano. The picture was changed immediately after the newsdesk was alerted at about 7.45am. The paper's head of opinion, Jonathan Shainin, followed up by apologising privately to Kano and later that day the Guardian publicly issued an unreserved apology.Kano was, unsurprisingly, deeply upset by the incident. The Guardian had confused two black British artists and in the context of Wiley's repugnant comments. Although all surrounding text made clear that Wiley was the subject, it was a bad error. To compound matters, it was not the first time that Kano's representatives had cause to complain; the BBC News channel and Variety online had made the same mistake with the picture over the previous weekend.Readers were angry and dismayed. ""For all of the good that the Guardian has done in shining the light on diversity, the Windrush scandal and Black Lives Matter it has been quickly undone and spoiled by lack [of] due diligence in publishing a photo of Kano in place of Wiley,"" wrote one, who in common with other readers suggested it reinforced the painful trope of failing to distinguish between people of colour."

It carries the heaviest potential penalty: up to 20 years in prison. As grave as violations of the first two statutes are, interfering with a Justice Department investigation is especially serious.Trump hasdenied all wrongdoingand claims the investigation is politically motivated.Reporting has already detailed the concerning pattern of document turnover. It started with negotiations andvoluntary requestsfrom national archivists in 2021, resulting in the return of 15 boxes of materials in 2022. That was followed in the spring by a grand jury subpoena evidently compelling production of documents. Then investigators visited in June, taking still more documents with them and at some later point securing the recently reported,evidently false statementthat all material marked as classified had been returned.Neither that subpoena nor the lawyer's June delivery produced the 11 sets of classified information that the FBI said it took from Mar-a-Lago last week.The warrant's release explains whatAttorney General Merrick Garlandwas talking about on Thursday when he spoke of the ""standard practice to seek less intrusive means"" than a search warrant whenever possible. He was telling us that the Justice Department tried everything else (and then some) first.Note that if Trump or others did not honestly comply with the subpoena, that's aseparate possible crime.That might be why the department reportedly subpoenaed the surveillance footage of people going in and out of the document rooms. Government officials were also understandably concerned about who had access to classified documents.Further, if Trump and those around him, including his lawyers, made intentionally inaccurate statements to the government, they may be criminally liable formaking false statements.While this new report on a lawyer's letter casts added light on the situation, gaps necessarily remain."

Bitcoin aspires to be used widely as a currency and has been accepted as legal tender in some developing countries, most notably El Salvador. But its price in U.S. dollars - its exchange rate, if you like - is very volatile, making it too unstable for transactions purposes. And it currently processes about seven transactions per second compared to VISA's average of about 1,700. At bottom, its cumbersome blockchain technology slows the speed at which transactions can be settled. The production of new Bitcoins is also extremely energy-intensive.To serve as currency, ""stablecoins"" look more promising. They are designed to be closely tied to conventional currencies, like the U.S. dollar or a basket of currencies. This tight link is achieved by having stablecoins place their funds in high-quality assets, such as U.S. Treasury securities and other high-grade U.S. dollar-denominated assets for stablecoins linked to the U.S. dollar, which should make for stable values. Stablecoins backed by fiat currency and large social platforms such as Facebook could easily become global in scope given the sheer size of the potential user base.

FinancialPost_Clean_2021_result_149,ai,"An unhelpful change in Ottawa's presentation of some of its pension costs understates its total compensation bill. But adding up everything else - wages and salaries, annual benefit accruals, and employer contributions to CPP, QPP and EI - reveals a seven-year surge.Spending on those components of compensation totalled $39.3 billion in 2014/15. For 2021/22 it's forecast to be $64.0 billion, an increase of almost two-thirds - and more than one-half in real terms - over the seven years. Some of this increase reflects the impact of lower interest rates on the accrual cost of future benefits to employees and some of it would be COVID-related expenses other than those detailed in the budget. But even if those items came to $5 billion, the seven-year increase in compensation would still be 50 per cent. It is no insult to the talent and professionalism of federal employees to ask if the services they provide are really that much better now than they were seven years ago.Looking ahead, the 2021 budget suggests a sharp shift from fat to lean. It shows operating costs, excluding the extraordinary COVID expenses, falling 7.7 per cent in 2022/23, with a cumulative further decline of 3.5 per cent between then and 2025/26. In real terms, that would leave Ottawa's overhead about 10 per cent above its 2014/15 level - a number we can hope improvements in federal services by then will justify.The budget says nothing, however, about how the government will achieve this - to use a word we are supposed to dread - austerity. It forecasts smaller costs for pensions and other benefits, but those reflect higher interest rates, not tough decisions by the finance minister and her colleagues. (Indeed, the promises made to new, better paid federal employees during the seven fat years are eating into those savings.) In any event, those smaller costs are nowhere near enough to explain the overall decline in operating costs.Because compensation does account for more than half of every dollar of federal operating costs, that big a reduction in overhead implies lower payroll. Figures from the federal Treasury Board Secretariat show full-time-equivalent employment this year that is up 16 per cent from 2014/15, but will fall five per cent from now to 2023/24."

In the words of Consumer Reports, ""scientists have not identified a specific fever pattern tied to this disease."" Most of those who have both COVID-19 and a fever will be displaying other symptoms too; in other words, they'll be easy to spot. But the significant number of infected people who are asymptomatic - perhaps 35 per cent of all coronavirus patients, according to the CDC - likely won't have a fever at all. So temperature screening will miss a lot of carriers.Moreover, studies of the relationship between fever and COVID-19 are all over the map. According to a literature review released in April by the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine, fever is present in between 82 and 87 per cent of mild or moderate cases of COVID-19. On the other hand, one study of COVID-19 patients sick enough to be admitted to hospitals found that only 30 per cent presented with fever. Other studies have found much higher figures, but that's the point: We don't know.A health worker in Krakow, Poland, wears a face mask and gloves as he measures the temperature of a man who arrives to watch a screening of a drive-in movie next to Wisla football stadium on May 21, 2020. From May 18, restaurants, cafes, sports facilities and salons in the area reopened as the third stage of easing restrictive measures takes effect.Bear in mind that fevers have countless causes, many not even related to infectious disease. Only a minority of those blocked from boarding planes or entering stores will have high temperatures resulting from the body's battle against this particular illness.Even strenuous exercise can raise body temperature."

The competition isn't close but it is in the capital, where most people who make the news have a vote.British politics is heavily weighted to London. That brings a particular kind of cosmopolitan narrow-mindedness that thinks it is immune to parochialism because it looks out from a global hub. Even when ministers know there is a problem of excessive centralisation, they reach for patrician solutions. They offer to lift benighted provinces with gifts from the metropolis - a Treasury satellite for Darlington; a stretch of Whitehall transplanted to Wolverhampton.That power imbalance causes all kinds of problems.

That was a US$8.68 difference - 775 per cent.To be sure, prices aren't always that far apart. In 2003 Asian spot prices were only three per cent higher than here, while in 2005 they were actually three per cent lower. But for more than a decade the price gap between Canada and Asia has been obvious and substantial.Looking at individual markets, in Japan, where price data for LNG goes back to 1990, prices were higher than in Canada in all but two years (again, 2003 and 2005). In every other year, prices were higher by as much as 797 per cent (which occurred in 2018). The widest gap in dollar terms was in 2012, when natural gas sold for US$2.27 per million BTU in Canada but US$16.75 in Japan, a difference of $14.48 or 638 per cent.In South Korea, where data are available only from 2009 on, prices for natural gas have always been above those in Canada, with the gap varying between US$1.90 (in 2009) and US$13.63 (in 2013) per million BTU. In percentage terms, natural gas prices in South Korea have ranged from 56 per cent more than in Canada (in 2009) to 771 per cent more (in 2018).Western Canada currently has several cost advantages over other LNG exporting countries such as the U.S., Qatar and Australia. For example, shipping costs to Japan from Canada are estimated at between 99 cents and $1.09 per million BTU. That compares to between $1.50 and $1.54 per million BTU from Qatar, and between $2.40 and $2.45 per million BTU from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico."
CNN_Clean_2022_result_480,ai,"Rising prices for fossil fuels -- oil, natural gas and coal -- have led to record profits this year for the companies that produce and sell them. Last week, for example,ExxonMobilreported record profits for a second quarter in a row, and Chevron reported profits that were almost double what they were last year.American consumers, meanwhile, have been feeling the pain of high energy prices as theirwageshave not kept up with inflation. Prices in the US in the past 12 months are up by 18.2% forgasoline, 15.5% for electricity and 33.1% for natural gas. And the impact of these rising prices is being felt particularly by lower-income households and workers.The message is clear: As energy companies continue to rake in massive profits, energy has become increasingly unaffordable for lower-income Americans. The federal government needs to take action now to help families maintain access to affordable energy throughout the winter.The US Census Bureau's recent Household Pulse Survey showed that 47.6% of families earning between $35,000 and $50,000 reducedspendingon food or medicine at least once in the last year to pay their home energy bills, up from 39.2% the previous year. As alarming as these numbers are, those who heat their homes with natural gas, electricity or heating oil could see their prices increase by 28%, 10% and 27% respectively under current winter forecasts, according to theEnergy Information Administration, and these prices could go even higher if it's a colder winter than projected.This is not a complicated problem to solve. Recently, theEuropean Unionapproved a policy to tax energy company profits that are more than 20% higher than the average yearly profits since 2018. The profits will then go to businesses and households to offset the impact of high energy prices.The Biden administration and Congress should follow the EU's lead and pass legislation that would redistribute a portion of energy companies' profits to families who are struggling to pay their energy bills. Just this week, President Joe Biden indicated his support for ataxon excessive oil and gas company profits as a result of the spike in prices.Legislationhas already been introduced in the US that would tax excesspetroleum profits.

Gasoline prices are seemingly breaking new record highs on almost a daily basis, food costs are soaring, and housing is becoming increasingly unaffordable.The persistence of highinflationin the US has been a surprise, certainly to me. But so too has been the ongoing pandemic - the vaccines that became available more than a year ago still have not ended it. And a Russian invasion was barely on the radar screen when troops crossed the Ukraine border earlier this year.Indeed, the quickly rising prices are due mostly to badly scrambled global supplies resulting from the ongoing pandemic and war in Ukraine, and much will depend on how these two shocks play out. Yet while predicting the course of events from here is intrepid, there are reasons to be optimistic. I'm confident that inflation will be meaningfully lower by this time next year and back to something we will feel comfortable with not too long thereafter.To be sure, the pandemic continues to weigh on the global economy. China, a major part of many supply chains, shut down big parts of the economy as it has grappled with the Omicron variant. It is tough to resolve supply chain bottlenecks when the biggest link has been all but broken.And in May, a still consequential 1.8 million Americans said that they were unable toworkdue to their employer closing down or losing business because of the pandemic. Meanwhile, businesses continue to struggle with labor shortages and must jack up pay to find and keep workers, adding to their costs, which they pass along in higher prices to their customers.Russia's invasion of Ukraine has further disrupted global supplies of oil, agricultural products and other commodities, causing prices to spike. USgasoline pricesare headed to over $5 per gallon, anddiesel prices, a big contributor to food prices - as much of what we pay for in the grocery store is the cost of getting the product from farm to store shelf - have risen even more.Nonetheless, the pandemic appears to be winding down. There surely will be more waves of the virus, but since the pandemic hit, each wave has been less disruptive to the economy than the one that preceded it."

Recent contract negotiations are pushing uppilot salaries, which will challenge the airlines' profit margins and may not even be enough to address the shortfall, especially in the near term.The 2021median annual payfor airline pilots, co-pilots and flight engineers was $202,180, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, and has been steadilyincreasing.The race to stay competitive on pilot pay is leaving smallerregional airlinesat a distinct disadvantage because they can't afford to compete. This will be especially true for those airlines not wholly owned by or affiliated with large airlines. Already, regionals are losingpilotsto bigger carriers where the compensation is materially higher and there's more potential for long-term career advancement. We expect the economic impact to be severe enough to prompt consolidations and even failures among US regional carriers - a further threat to service to smaller cities and sparsely traveled routes.The pilot shortfall and rising labor costs also could affect the standing of various low-cost carriers. On one hand, higher operating costs may undercut their ability to maintain lower fares than their global rivals, and the shortage is likely to prevent them from adding flights when demand is high. On the other, the disruption to the regional model may create growth opportunities. We expect the more successful low-cost carriers to cherry-pick the most profitable smaller city routes that might otherwise see reduced service. Success hinges on how effectively low-cost carriers can manage their relative pilot cost advantage, while still retaining pilots for growth.No quick fixWorking our way out of the pilot shortage will not be as easy."

Prosecutors said they had pre-planned their part in the siege including the use of military ""stack"" formations to wedge their way through the mob and into Congress' hallowed halls.The verdicts confirm a core truth: The violent assault that day was designed, not ""spontaneous."" The mob was led, and by those committed to disorder, whatever the cost in bloodshed.Along with Rhodes, Kelly Meggs was convicted of seditious conspiracy. They both face up to 20 years in prison on that charge. Rhodes and Meggs were also found guilty of obstructing an official proceeding, as were their fellow group members Kenneth Harrelson, Jessica Watkins and Thomas Caldwell --and they all face a 20-year maximum sentence for this charge.This is a monumental win for the Justice Department, even though the jury acquitted three alleged Oath Keepers ofseditious conspiracy.But having found that the leader is guilty of that extraordinary crime is what matters most.A seditious conspiracy means that Rhodes and Meggs agreed to forcibly obstruct the execution of the laws of the United States by which presidential authority transfers from one party to the other at the pivotal moment of our constitutional government.Indictment for seditious conspiracy is rare, and convictions even rarer.

For example, it would crack down on giants likeAmazon, which use their massive data harvesting operation to make cheaper versions of popular products and then preference them in search results.Preventing tech giants from leveraging non-public data to give their own products an advantage is crucial to giving small alternative platforms a fighting chance. Stronger antitrust laws are an overdue intervention and would allow alternative platforms and business models a chance to flourish.These two bills won't fix everything that's wrong with Big Tech. We also urgently need data privacy protections, regulation targeting algorithmic discrimination and harm, transparency measures, and more. But after years of inaction from Congress passing these bills would be a historic step toward cracking down on these companies' monopoly abuses.

Republicans have reminded voters of how bad things can get with them in charge, as a spate of unpopular laws go into effect in conservative states that criminalize abortion and put the lives of pregnant women at risk, not to mention attempt to legally force legions of Americans into unwanted parenthood. Since recent estimates from the Brookings Institution show that raising a childhas never been more expensive, that reality hits particularly hard for voters who must now consider whether forced parenthood comports with their vision for America.At the same time, the Republican frontrunner for the 2024 presidential nomination and the undisputed head of the GOP -- former President Donald Trump -- is the subject of an investigation over his handling of classified documents and potential violations of the Espionage Act and other laws.

We are living in an America that is crueler, more divided and more despairing than at any point in my lifetime. And while those conditions can lend themselves to positive and even transformative social change, they often do the opposite, pushing populations toward bigotry, hyper-nationalism and reactionary politics.Democrats are going to have a hard time harnessing voter energy toward positive change.

While this has had a devastating impact on the Russian economy, there's no denying that Americans are feeling the reverberations as well.Gas pricesrose nearly 70 cents per gallon in a two-week period in the wake of the invasion.Pricesat the pump have since plateaued, but they are still more than $4 per gallon. Biden has responded by announcing the release of oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to increase supply and lower prices. The move, along with efforts from US allies overseas, will add more than one millionbarrels of oilper day to supply. Still, the president and Congress should go further in combating price increases. One way to do that is by enacting a temporarywindfall profits taxon Big Oil and the billions of dollars the industry has been raking in.Oil giants Shell, BP, ExxonMobil and Chevron reported more than $75 billion inprofitslast year.ExxonMobilalone made $8.9 billion in the final three months of 2021. This is in the wake of propping up Putin'sfossil fuel economyfor years. ExxonMobil's subsidiary,Exxon Neftegas Limited, has a stake in an oil and gas project that has generated billions in payments to Russia's federal and regional governments.BP, meanwhile, has owned one-fifth ofRosneft, the Russian state-owned oil company, since 2013, though it has said it would divest its stake.Shellhas a stake in an oil and gas project that Russian energy company Gazprom controls, whileChevronowns a stake in a pipeline venture there.These companies are in a position to profit from Russia's attack on Ukraine. Pumping oil costs them the same amount, but now they can sell it at prices driven up by the war. They are using the resulting windfall profits to increase payouts to shareholders throughbuybacks and dividends. When challenged during a congressional hearing last week,oil CEOsmade it clear they are not going to rein themselves in.That's why Congress must implement a temporary windfall profits tax which, according to a new report from theCenter for American Progress(CAP), could bring in tens of billions of dollars to help defray fuel costs for families. The tax would rise or fall as prices fluctuate, until prices return to pre-crisis levels.Currently,oil companiesearn more money when the prices they can charge rise. But if the tax rate of oil companies went up along with the price of oil, the windfall would be recaptured and could then be returned to American consumers via adirect payment, for instance.This proposal would be a temporary response to an extraordinary international energy crisis. Congress could ensure that the windfall profits tax would go away once oil prices return to normal levels ($75 per barrel of oil, according to the CAP analysis). But this won't be the last time that the US consumer is buffeted by volatile energy costs, especially if we remain so dependent on petroleum. For the longer term, Congress must also invest in building a clean energy economy.It's time to make oil companies pay their fair share and alleviate some of the burden on the American consumer.

FinancialPost_Clean_2022_result_101,ai,"Barring any additional changes, though, the bulk of residential development will be subject to the city's higher rates.From a local taxpayer's perspective, development charges and other similar levies are a handy way of funding infrastructure and services that are needed to service the city's growing population.Rather than paying for these services and amenities with property taxes, Toronto has shifted a significant share of the cost burden onto property developers. This arrangement works for city councillors, who can promise more services and amenities to voters without increasing property taxes or fees.On the surface, it would seem as though Toronto can have its cake and eat it, too. The reality, however, is that these fees make Toronto a more expensive, less inclusive place to live.Development charges are baked into developers' feasibility calculations, just like the cost of labour, materials and land. If the market is tight, as has been the case in recent years, there's a good chance they can pass these costs directly onto home buyers and renters, in order to make projects feasible. Otherwise, they might build less housing, which would further drive up prices and rents.In either case, those bearing the brunt of development charge increases are home buyers and renters, including first-time buyers, newcomers and lower-income households.The rationale for development charges is that ""growth should pay for growth."" In other words, new infrastructure should be paid for by new, rather than existing, residents. The problem is that it's not hard for the city to justify shifting the cost of projects it would have financed either way onto immigrants, people moving from elsewhere in the country and Torontonians looking for the opportunity to become homeowners.The list of services to be funded with this revenue stream is quite broad. Beyond the roads, sewers, police stations and other services directly tied to growth, development charges are also used to fund social or non-market housing.The irony is that by setting developer fees too high, the city risks reducing the number of units that would otherwise be built. This not only decreases the fees and taxes it might ultimately collect, but could worsen Toronto's affordability problem.This is especially problematic at a time when interest rates are on the rise and some developers are already considering shelving some projects. The city should be wary of further squeezing the goose that laid the golden egg.Development charges play well politically, but are easily abused."

Don't Expect Harris' Fortunes to Change.Recall thatHarris didn't enter the Iowa Caucus in 2020 because she was not popular among Democrats - most importantly not even among California Democrats. Her polling showed her dropping to fourth and fifth in the California primary before she gave up her presidential hopes.Why was she unpopular at that time in California? She was viewed as ambitious instead of caring - a political social climber not a leader.Part of that was because Harris never cultivated California voters. She was handed the nomination for attorney general and senator and never had to work to win the hearts and minds of California voters.A similar charge was made in a Politico article about her presidential run with the headline ""The spectacular collapse of Kamala Harris,"" which stated ""Aides groused about how Harris never built a base."" Overall, the article hardly painted a picture of a leader in control of her campaign.Her time as California's attorney general was marked by prosecutorial overreach controversies and her refusal to take positions on key issues - much like her absenteeism on the border. Then when she ran for president, she ran away from the ""tough on crime"" mantra she claimed as attorney general. That only reinforced her authenticity problem.All and all, Harris is simply in over her head and she is finding out that on the job learning in the modern media/Internet age is no easy task. In the future, she will be saddled with the Biden administration's bad record and as the face of its most unpopular immigration border policy.The vice president also doesn't have a history of handling difficult political moments - a requisite for presidential nominees - and something she cannot simply laugh off.2."

(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/adam-zivo-is-the-city-of-toronto-giving-young-homebuyers-the-middle-finger)While this wasn't the only barrier to development, it made it difficult to add low-cost, incremental housing in much of the city. Building walk-up apartments and townhouses can be much cheaper per unit than condo buildings that require elevators and parking. So we weren't able to build enough housing, let alone enough low-cost housing.

Guardian_Clean_2021_result_5,ai,"The most serious among them was certainly the ""lockdown light"" which began in November and was intended to clear the way for a safe festive season. It's impossible to know, of course, what the situation might be like now, had the government not taken those measures. But it's also clear that the pandemic worsened substantially despite these directives to minimise social contact, and the government-mandated closure of bars, restaurants, night clubs, gyms, pools and museums, while leaving shops, schools and daycare open.But even as they failed to contain the virus, these measures induced a certain pandemic weariness that spread to even the most avid supporters of the lockdown regulations. Plus, when it became clear that the ""lockdown light"" wasn't going to succeed in reducing numbers enough for Germans to celebrate a normal Christmas, Merkel's government introduced stricter regulations shortly before the holidays. Though, almost as if to make things more confusing, the ""hard lockdown"" included a number of exceptions designed to allow families to spend the Christmas holidays together.The fact that confusion and frustration followed can hardly be surprising. To make matters worse, Germans continue to wait for a vaccination programme to begin in earnest - health minister Jens Spahn's failure to secure enough doses of the vaccine counts as another major error in the governing coalition's management of the crisis. In general, though, it isn't at all clear what Germans think Merkel should have done instead. On the one hand, an initiative popular among parts of the left has argued for a ""zero Covid"" campaign, in which the economy and social life would be stopped nearly entirely in the hopes of reducing the number of new cases to nothing. The proposal is based on an article first published inthe Lancetin which a number of leading epidemiologists, including Christian Drosten, the tsar of Germany's coronavirus response, proposed a radical lockdown in hopes of reducing the number of new cases to 10 per million inhabitants per day.But zero Covid has been met with strong criticism from nearly every side of the political spectrum - as well as from some public health experts. The economic effects would be catastrophic; the measures could be enacted only with ""half-totalitarian"" policies; the cost for children, for women, and for the arts would be enormous. On the other side of the debate, given the high economic, social and psychological costs of lockdown measures, an increasing number of commentators are beginning to claim that we must ""learn to live"" with the pandemic. ""Returning to normal,"" wrote Jakob Augstein, publisher of the left-leaning weekly Der Freitag last week, ""means returning to the virus. ""But both of these calls for radically different approaches to the pandemic feel half-hearted. We've all seen the problems that come with a harder lockdown by now, while the example of Sweden has shown that relying on voluntary measures alone will likely lead to an alarming increase in the mortality rate. With the most recent reports showing a slight but steady improvement in the infection rate, discussions about loosening Germany's hard lockdown are certain to intensify - as is exhaustion with the continued efforts to slow the spread of the disease.All in all, however, most Germans seem to feel that Merkel's government has responded to the pandemic passably well. Distressingly enough, it turns out that 50,000 Covid dead might indeed be the picture of a successful response to the pandemic in a major European country.Peter Kuras is a writer and translator based in Berlin"
NYTimes_Clean_2021_result_96,ai,"The ideal is to look at some type of randomized controlled trial. If researchers could randomly allocate children to schools, they could learn about whether some types of schools deliver better outcomes than others. It turns out this is partly possible, using data from school lotteries, in which schools allocate their classroom spots through a random selection process.Charter schools have been used to study the effects of school lotteries, but there's also some evidence relevant to private schools. Lotteries for monetary vouchers that can be used for private schools have been run in a number of cities, including New York and Washington, and studies on children who received the vouchers do seem to find some moderate positive effects, especially for African-American students. An older study in Milwaukeefound faster growth in math test scoresfor students who won a voucher lottery, compared with those who didn't, and a more recent study in Washingtonfoundthat students with vouchers had higher high school graduation rates.The results are not overwhelmingly positive. One issue is that private schools that participate in voucher programs can be oflower qualitythan average, which is why they have open slots available for voucher programs. For this family, the voucher data may not be that useful.It might be more helpful to them to look at the features of a school that correlate to better test scores. Among the most consistent findings is the role of class size: A large number of studies have demonstrated that smaller class sizes raise student achievement in both the short and longer term. At least one paper, which attempted to look closely at what makes some charter schools work well,arguedthat more instructional time, more comprehensive teacher feedback and more tutoring, among other measures, are correlated with success.Pulling this all together, the family should use the fact-finding portion of this decision making to collect more information about the two schools ᅳ their class sizes, their teacher training and their test scores. They should also find out whether the “feel” of the school would work for their child.The final step here is to plan a time to make a final decision, recognizing that they will need to grapple with questions that go beyond the data. It is impossible to be sure the decision is right; but it is possible to know you made it in the right way."

And is Ohio now a state with electoral votes that can safely be put in the Republican column for 2024 and beyond?The results of 2022 US Senate race in Ohio, pitting Democrat Tim Ryan against Republican J.D. Vance, will be a very significant data point when seeking to answer this question. And the answer to this question is not only important for Ohio but for the nation's political future.Among the so-called swing states, the Buckeye State isfourth in electoral heftbehind only Texas, Florida and Pennsylvania. With Ohio in tow, and with the changes in assigned electoral votes after the 2020 reapportionment, a GOP candidate would only have to add Georgia and Pennsylvania to Trump's tally in 2020 to win an electoral majority.What should we be looking for when analyzing the Ohio vote on November 8? Political scientists like to divide Ohio up intofive somewhat distinct regions: Northeast, Northwest, Central, Southeast and Southwest. Most of the change in Ohio's political behavior after 2016 took place in only one of these regions: Northeast Ohio.Northeast Ohio consists of 12 counties, includes the cities of Cleveland and Akron, and is the most populous region in the state. Historically, it was also the most Democratic, a legacy of the influence of organized labor when the area was a manufacturing powerhouse.In2012, then Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama cruised to victory in Ohio -- in part because he captured eight of these 12 counties. Everything changedfour years later, when only four Northeast Ohio counties voted for the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. By2020, that number dropped to two for Joe Biden.In between 2016 and 2020, however, was the2018midterm election -- featuring statewide races for governor and the US Senate."
CNN_Clean_2022_result_360,ai,"Americans have never seen a wilder year when it comes to gas prices, thanks to the confluence of a surge in demand as the pandemic eased, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which created myriad challenges among oil producers, from supply constraints to volatile markets to unpredictable demand.And even though gas prices have come down in recent weeks, there is still a chance that the bumpy ride could get worse.Gas pricesin most parts of the US started the year around $3 a gallon, but began to climb a couple of months later due to rebounding seasonal demand and Russia's war on Ukraine. Soon,pricesreached $4, with many states even seeingpricescross $5 per gallon, as Americans eagerly hit the road for summer trips.Pricescooled back down to $3 earlier this month, but it doesn't mean that our problems are over. It wouldn't take much to aggravate the delicate balance of supply and demand in today's world and send gas prices soaring again. In the coming months, we could easily be thrown a curveball that causes a brief and temporary spike at the pump.Here's what we need to look out for:Hurricane seasonHurricane seasoncreates the potential for dramatic volatility in gas prices. Natural disasters cause destruction, and can affect everything from production to transportation to distribution of gasoline across the country. Though quiet so far, the season is still projected to be a busy one. If a major storm hits the Gulf states, for instance, we could see prices at the pump rise again temporarily until the threat of hurricane season passes around Thanksgiving. That's because the bulk of the nation'srefineriesare located on the Gulf Coast, along with thousands of offshoreoil rigs. A refinery outage of any magnitude limits production capacity, tightening supply and ultimately elevating prices. So if a big storm hits between the mouth of the Mississippi River and Houston, it could limit supply even further.The stakes are high given that every barrel of oil seems spoken for amid strong demand and still tight supply."

During a crisis, the need to show unity may even trump the careful consideration of alternative approaches. This is one way in which the battle against COVID-19 does resemble a war: those who are waging it are caught in a fog, working with the best information they have and the strategies they judge most appropriate, even if their approach ends up being faulty.Under the circumstances and the muddling through they require, no government will find itself above criticism. While solidarity and support are widespread today, they might give way to scrutiny and resentment, as citizens demand to know why states were not better prepared or hesitant to act sooner.But this could take a deeper form. The connection between populist politics and distrust in expertise and government is evident. Populist movements that have gained prominence across the world in the past decade have fed off the sense of disconnect people feel between their interests and values and those that are championed by governing elites and experts. Those who are already skeptical of technocratic government and officially sanctioned expertise could see their views reinforced as leaders do their best to work with the information and evidence they have available to them. Although many are applauding the return of ""big government"" and the central role of experts in responding to the crisis, in the long run responses to COVID-19 may feed populist fears. Populists may see this as another example of ""elites"" making decisions - and mistakes - far removed from everyday people and their right to make their own decisions.A pedestrian wearing a mask walks across Yonge Street at Dundas Square in downtown Toronto during the COVID-19 pandemic, on April 3, 2020.Perhaps the social solidarity the pandemic is fostering will keep the scrutiny and resentment at bay."

FinancialPost_Clean_2020_result_15,ai,"Almost 20 years ago, Federal Court of Canada Judge Andrew MacKay delivered his decision on the legal status of Helmut Oberlander. His findings were clear: Oberlander had been a member of a Nazi mobile killing unit (Ek10a) for a period of 18 months or more between 1941 and 1942; he had served as an interpreter in a unit whose role was to murder civilians; and he had misrepresented or failed to disclose his wartime activities when he arrived in Canada and later received Canadian citizenship.In his ruling, MacKay argued that had Oberlander been truthful, he never would have been admitted to Canada and would not have been granted citizenship.Following this decision, Oberlander's supporters and his legal counsel claimed, among other things, that the decision was unfair because it provided no opportunity for appeal. Events of the past two decades give ample evidence that this was not the case.Indeed, in the intervening years, multiple attempts to remove Oberlander from Canada have been thwarted, as his lawyers have variously argued that their client's behaviour in Canada, the health of his family members and questions of duress should be taken into consideration. Each successive challenge sent the file back to the government's lawyers for revision. The last challenge was rejected by both the Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada.Now, with all avenues seemingly closed, Oberlander's lawyers have unveiled a new legal argument.In essence, they claim that MacKay was entitled to make a finding only as to whether or not Oberlander misled authorities in order to gain entry into Canada and later receive citizenship. Everything beyond that was merely opinion on the part of the judge and therefore is of no force or effect. They further argue that even if their client was properly stripped of citizenship, he retains ""domicile,"" and therefore cannot be deported. ""Domicile"" is an old Roman legal concept that predates government involvement in immigration."
FinancialPost_Clean_2021_result_164,ai,"By Heather Exner-PirotCanada has adopted one-sided consultation processes that favour First Nations that oppose resource extraction at the expense of those that support such projects. That was the finding of a judge recently in a rebuke to the federal government for its treatment of the Ermineskin Cree Nation.Their case makes explicit what many of us have observed over the years: Indigenous people who support resource development do not fall comfortably into mainstream Canada's idealized version of what Indigenous people should and shouldn't do, and they are therefore ignored.This particular claim saw the Ermineskin Cree, one of the four Nations of Maskwacis in western Alberta, contest a designation order that the federal Minister of the Environment, Jonathan Wilkinson, had placed on the Phase II expansion of Vista coal mine in July 2020. This subjected the mine to a full federal impact assessment - something the Impact Assessment Agency itself recommended against - which had the practical effect of stopping the activity.Yet the federal government never consulted the Ermineskin, who had negotiated Impact and Benefit Agreements (IBA) with Coalspur Mines, the project proponent, in its consideration of the order. The judge concluded that this was wrong: the Crown had a duty to consult with the nation as its decision meant that valuable economic, community and social benefits were lost to Ermineskin.This is a revelation in itself. Courts regularly restrict projects that impact Aboriginal and treaty rights; in this case, however, it was the restriction - the designation order - that was quashed. But the bigger story is the way the minister handled the process. As the judge pointed out, the federal government decided to hear only from Indigenous voices seeking to stop the coal mine through the order, but ""inexplicably"" froze out Ermineskin from the ""very one-sided process,"" despite them being closer and having an obvious interest in the project.The environment minister's decision to grant the designation order for the Vista coal mine without regard for the Ermineskin Cree betrays the mindset of the federal government. It doesn't consider Aboriginal and treaty rights to include economic rights when it doesn't suit its agenda."

The idea that these same people may be losing irreplaceable parts of their history only compounds this unfathomable tragedy.As a historian, my research and writing rely on previous generations' efforts to record their present and preserve relics of their past. That any historical records have survived Eastern Europe's long history of turmoil is nothing short of a miracle. Archives, like people in the region, have been repeatedly displaced and destroyed. Russia's current war on Ukraine is yet another instance of this long history of invasions and conquests.Archival destruction in the current war in Ukraine is especially painful to contemplate, given the difficult history these records have already endured. Consider documents pertaining tothe Great Famine of 1932-33 (Holodomor), stored in the Ukrainian state archives in Kyiv, which have survived both Stalin's repressive regime and damage during the Nazi encirclement of the city during the First Battle of Kyiv in 1941.

Perhaps as soon as this spring, we will be able to hug loved ones, spend time with each other indoors without masking and even eat indoors at our favourite restaurants.Canadians should also expect to be able to travel to several countries without the need to quarantine, once a significant proportion of our country has been vaccinated. Universal masking, however, may be here to stay, at least for a time, especially in health-care settings, to limit the spread of respiratory pathogens to vulnerable individuals. Although it would not be mandated, there may be ongoing use of masks in public by the general population as we saw in many Asian countries after the SARS outbreak.What are the changes that will remain in our everyday lives post-COVID? Firstly, the increased social acceptability around not working or going to school while ill, washing hands and generally being more attentive to hygiene for the benefit of others is likely to persist.Being self-sufficient in the manufacture of personal protective equipment, vaccines and other goods will leave us better prepared if another pandemic ever comes. Investments in health care and long-term care - including a focus on private rooms, stable staffing models, adequate ventilation, infection-control measures and adequate wages for care workers - will help better protect the elderly, whose vulnerability was laid bare during this pandemic.Finally, the pandemic resulted in widespread disruption in many sectors, including health care and education. A backlog of elective surgeries will need to be cleared, access to personalized mental health resources will need to resume and routine preventative medicine will need to be reinforced once again.Likewise, the immense gap left in children's learning and socialization will take many months or years to recover from. Many aspects of the economy, including small businesses, have also suffered a massive blow and the aftermath of this is another thing we may be reckoning with for many years to come.Despite all this, there is much to be hopeful for in the months ahead.

FinancialPost_Clean_2020_result_32,ai,"In one perioperative area, for example, the power infrastructure was not sufficient to reliably run all the necessary critical care equipment."" And this was a perioperative area, where patients are cared for before or after surgery. One can imagine the unsuitability of an ordinary hospital room, especially in countries that lack medical infrastructure.Gauges to regulate oxygen on a ventilator are seen at a lab run by the University Health Network in Toronto, in 2019.The realization that both ventilators and the infrastructure needed to run them might not be available is old hat to the military. In 2004, Tommy Eagles, a medic in the United States Marine Corps, asked Thornhill Medical Inc., an Ontario-based company (which one of us helped found) that was spun-off from Toronto's University Health Network (UHN), to try to combine the ventilator and the infrastructure needed to sustain it in one rugged, portable package. After six years, the result was a small, 17-kilogram life-support system that runs on batteries and concentrates oxygen from the air, rather than having it flow from a tank. During the current pandemic, the Canadian and Ontario governments quickly recognized the limitation of standalone ventilators and ordered more than 1,060 of these devices for use in our health-care system.Even with our current stock of ventilators, Canadian hospitals will not be able to cope with more than a moderate surge in patients requiring life support. But that, too, is changing with the development of a pre-assembled mobile fleet of fully stocked critical care pods built into shipping containers, which are intended to absorb the spill-over of infectious disease patients. These ICU pods were designed by the IDP Group, a multifaceted group of companies in Ontario, and will be tested in the near future. If successful, they will be provided at cost to Third World countries. And it is clear that one of the places where they will be most needed is Africa.That continent is home to 1.2 billion people, but has very few ventilators, or the infrastructure they require."
FinancialPost_Clean_2022_result_107,ai,"CANDU, ranked as one of Canada's top 10 engineering achievements, has a proven track record of deep and rapid de-carbonization. Twenty-three CANDU reactors were commissioned in just 22 years in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick between 1971 and 1993. Today the 19 CANDU reactors still operating account for 15 per cent of Canada's electricity supply, our second largest source after hydroelectricity. Repeating that historic CANDU deployment would produce enough power to replace all fossil fuel-fired electricity generation nationwide.The CANDU supply chain, stretching from the world's richest uranium mines in Saskatchewan to power plants in Ontario and New Brunswick, is 96 per cent made-in-Canada. That stands in sharp contrast to the technologies that are eligible for the investment tax credit. Seven of the world's 10 largest wind turbine manufacturers are Chinese, while the remaining three are rapidly offshoring their operations to Asia because of rising costs. Fully 97 per cent of solar wafers are currently produced in just one country, China.

FinancialPost_Clean_2021_result_207,ai,"The federal government published ""recommendations"" and ""best practices"" on the destruction of voter lists after an election, but they are not mandatory.In September's federal election, there were an average of about six candidates in each of the 338 ridings. Assuming an average of around 50 party representatives and volunteers for each candidate, which is probably an under-estimation in many cases, there would have been 101,400 people working the federal election campaign - including candidates and volunteers for the Canadian Nationalist party and the PPC riding directors with links to white supremacist groups - who might have had access to your personal information. There do not appear to be any rules about vetting who gets access to the data.The level of hatred and intolerance that exploded since the onset of COVID-19 was obvious throughout the federal election, by and toward candidates and their volunteers. This is part of a trend that can be seen across the country. Last year, Statistics Canada reported that crime fell nationally by five per cent, while hate crimes rose an unprecedented 37 per cent, to their highest-ever reported level. Jews are the most targeted, and Islamophobia, anti-LGBTQ and anti-Asian hate are also on the rise.Knowing where one's target or enemy lives makes identity theft and stalking relatively simple. But, sure, let's give every candidate and campaign volunteer a way to access our home addresses.Voter lists have always been important for running orderly democratic elections, and for ensuring that only qualified people vote. We are not arguing that governments stop maintaining such lists for that purpose, only that the information be more tightly controlled.Not very long ago, when there was civility in politics, candidates relied on voter lists to reach out to voters."
CNN_Clean_2021_result_97,ai,"When exposed days before travel, that same person who is negative on arrival would hit their peak contagiousnesstwo or three daysafter arrival. The virus load goes from entirely undetectable on any test (whether PCR or antigen) one day to raging high just one or two days later. That's why daily rapid testing is the smarter move.Rapid antigen testing finds cases quickly, allowing immediate isolation, and because itonly detectsa contagious virus, it means that officials won't have to shut the games down for days on end unless uncontrolled contagion occurs. Those positive on one of their daily rapid antigen tests can be temporarily pulled aside and the positive result confirmed in minutes with a second rapid antigen test or better, a rapid molecular test which, like PCR, detects the genetic code of the virus, offering a highly sensitive, fast andextremely accurateconfirmation of the first test. If a rare false positive has occurred, then it will be apparent within minutes. If the test was a true positive, then an entire new chain of transmission events will have been averted by catching the infection early, potentially saving the Games.Should a person's infection go undetected one day because their viral load is still too low, they will be detected as positive the next day. And if the worst-case scenario happens and transmission does occur, for example in the rare but theoretically possible event that a person with a very low virus load, undetected on the rapid antigen test, manages to transmit to someone nearby, daily testing of everyone will all but ensure that any outbreak will never take off. Any new cases will be detected quickly and the outbreak will be squashed before it ever gets a chance to spread.If someone gets exposed but not necessarily infected, daily testing can take the place of an onerous quarantine; twice daily rapid antigen testing or once daily rapid molecular testing with negative results would serve as an effective alternative."
Guardian_Clean_2022_result_23,ai,"Finally, it captures the gulf between American public opinion and the institutions that have been captured by the right because the electoral college, the Senate and supreme court are all skewed in favour of Republicans. A poll in Januaryfoundthat only 30% of voters wanted to see Roe v Wade overturned; 69% were opposed.The move is also strikingly out of step with the rest of the world. With a few exceptions - notably Poland - the trend has been overwhelmingly towards the liberalisation of abortion laws, including in countries such asChileandIreland. The UN special rapporteur on the right to health, Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng, haswarnedthat overturning abortion rights would set a dangerous precedent, as well as violate international human rights treaties, including the convention against torture.But this decision, of course, can only be fixed at home. Democrats demand the codification of Roe v Wade, knowing that it would require overturning the filibuster, a Senate procedural rule. Calls for supreme court reform will gain ground, with the introduction of term limits a more straightforward move than expanding the court. Beyond the immediate crisis is the greater challenge of fixing a political system now tilted decisively towards Republicans through the systematic pursuit of power, from gerrymandering to voter suppression to control of elections themselves. The right's victory is the fruit of an orchestrated campaign over decades; the fightback will demand equal ferocity and commitment. This blow could yet help to create some of the momentum required."

Long before NATO or Putin were even conceived, Russian rulers were putting down uprisings in Ukraine. Sweeping resistance to the Soviet rule in Ukraine in the early 1930s was no different.Like the rest of the USSR, Ukraine was a rural country on the eve of collectivization. Yet, the resistance to the state takeover of private property here was fiercer than anywhere else in the Union. Ukrainian peasants never supported the Bolsheviks, and the unpopular collectivization policy provoked staunch resistance.In 1930, security services reported to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin that Ukrainian peasants expelled authorities from many districts, which spelt danger for the state. Repressions followed and many Ukrainian peasants were sent to Siberia and the north.At the same time, Ukrainian intelligentsia called for shaking off Russian imperial embrace in culture. In June 1926, the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist (Bolshevik) Party expressed concern at reports that Ukrainian writerMykola Khvyliovy encouragedother intellectuals to get""Away from Moscow! ""in their works.With the spread of the printed word thanks to the Soviet campaign of battling illiteracy, it was only a matter of time before the national movement gained traction.While there was a widespread famine followingcollectivizationin the Soviet Union, the Kremlin imposed an exceptionally high grain procurement plan on Ukraine in 1932-33.

Last week, we learned of one large retailer that in effect used its CEWS payments to fund a special dividend to shareholders this year. Some other countries have banned extraordinary payouts to managers and shareholders by companies taking wage supports. That is a sign of how controversial these massive wage subsidies are.CEWS is not just expensive, it could actually delay the recovery. Under current rules, as business revenues recover to pre-pandemic levels, their CEWS payments automatically decline. For a typical retail business, a $1,000 increase in revenues now means a reduction in CEWS payments of about $320. That's a 32 per cent tax rate on revenues that struggling businesses must pay, in addition to their normal business taxes. It's a ""welfare wall"" businesses must climb as they grow their businesses this year and next.Other countries have recognized the problems with their pandemic wage subsidies and have made reforms. The United States offered similar support in the spring through the Paycheck Protection Program, albeit only to smaller businesses. Researchers found(http://economics.mit.edu/files/20094) it had virtually no impact on employment(https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tracker_paper.pdf), and it has since been wound up.

When other countries' public pensions invest in government bonds, there's no effect on the government's net debt. There's both an asset for the public pension plan and a liability for the government. When net debt for the overall government is calculated they cancel.Not so when the CPP and QPP invest in non-government assets. So as both public plans have increased their assets, the net debt position of Canada's government has improved. But this is misleading: the assets of the CPP and QPP are not actually available to either the federal or provincial governments: they're committed to financing the benefits promised to retirees in both programs.When we look at total government debt rather than net debt - which essentially removes the assets of the CPP and QPP - Canada's relative indebtedness is among the worst in the industrialized world. In 2019, it was 86.8 per cent of GDP, which ranked 24th among 31 industrialized countries.

So why do we still allow and amplify this lazy trope?Years of cultural conditioning doesn't help, I suppose.

The messaging is at its most intense in childhood: villains, from Disney to Harry Potter, are fat, disfigured or ugly.David Walliams has been called out for it; Dahl is infamous for it.

The extent the disease has spread throughout Asia and other countries remains uncertain, and so is the length of time it will take to eventually contain it.In comparison to the SARS outbreak in 2003, COVID-19 is less deadly but much more virulent. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(https://www.cdc.gov/about/history/sars/timeline.htm), there were 8,096 probable cases of SARS in 29 countries, resulting in 774 deaths. As of the time of this writing, COVID-19 had spread to just as many countries, with more than 80,000 probable cases and over 2,700 deaths.COVID-19 also adds much uncertainty to the global economy. China's measures to contain the spread of the virus have been necessary, but they've also resulted in the halting of economic activity across a wide range of sectors and regions, especially in Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak. Throughout China, households are taking a prudent approach, avoiding travel and other discretionary spending on retail and hospitality.The toll on China's domestic economy will be heavy. The extent of the impact on the economy in 2020 will depend entirely on how long it takes to contain the virus and get people back working and shopping. In the case of the SARS outbreak, it was seven months from the first reported cases before the last case was identified.The novel coronavirus is the latest in a group of at least three other respiratory illnesses that have arisen and spread to varying extents in the last decade and a half.But China's economy is also very different than it was during the SARS outbreak.

Wanting to connect with our dancers while raising funds to help Chats Palace in east London - the venue where we host parties - survive the summer, All Our Friends held a radio broadcast in a compact flat with a gorgeous stereo system and a ventilated balcony back in June. Co-founders Cyril Cornet, Cedric Lassonde and I rotated from 7pm to 1am to keep things moving. A few friends joined us for a safe and intimate gathering that observed government guidelines yet still turned into an intense little party. The hope was for listeners to gather in small groups, tune in and share the vibe.The experience reminded us of the simplicity of the ritual, and it was safer than going to the pub. Knowing that Mancuso held parties in his own home for close to three decades, and working alongside him when he came to London, helped us on our way. It doesn't take much to host a small house party, even when taking into account Covid restrictions - just go for a simple stereo and keep the room aerated. Afterwards, I felt inspired to prepare for another one.Just last Friday we decided to hold another All Our Friends broadcast on Saturday 10 October. We want to reconnect with our dancers, many of whom have been partying in public settings during the summer.

A chronic problem across all provinces, Health Quality Ontario reports that over 15 per cent of Ontario's hospital's beds are filled with patients ""ready to go home. ""The best option to make space for people with severe symptomology of COVID-19 is to move out patients whom may not need the intensity of care provided in hospitals.Given what we can safely anticipate will be a huge stress on the capacity of our health workers and hospitals, it is preferable that patients are discharged to home. For others not yet ready to return home, long-term care beds will need to be rapidly found. This presents challenges for most provinces, with wait lists for long-term care beds a common occurrence.For others, hospital beds will need to be found among other hospitals. Co-ordination between hospitals at this speed will be a barrier, as the scale of moving hundreds of patients between hospitals, and away from the epicentre, will be fast. These complex and expensive moves alone may not open a sufficient number of beds. Then, provinces will need to move patients to hospitals in other provinces, a level of co-ordination that provinces have never experienced.Provinces' silo-based health-care delivery systems would need to behave in ways they haven't before in order to avoid premature death and suffering among people affected by a COVID-19 outbreak. Last week, the federal minister of health, Patty Hajdu, reassured Canadians she has a plan. But her government, more than any other, knows that a plan is worth nothing if there is no one to guide or to direct, and the resources to execute.This rapid reallocation of hospital capacity and expertise is not an easy task. Today, we already have crowded emergency departments around the country and hospital beds occupied by patients whom are better served in other settings.A national task force assembled under the leadership of the Public Health Agency of Canada should be quickly established whose objective is to prepare and give advice and support to local, regional and provincial authorities to make room in hospitals."

Guardian_Clean_2021_result_90,ai,"However, there are some things we should keep in mind when evaluating the numbers coming in.Looking at the severity of infections in South Africa, it is important to remember differences in populations. South Africa has a younger population overall, and Covid in younger age groups has been consistently milder than in older ones. There is also the issue of time, and how long it takes for people to fall ill and get sick enough to require care, and for those numbers to be reported. We are still only a few weeks into this newest wave.Similarly, we do expect infections in a highly vaccinated population such as that of the UK to be milder overall, because vaccination is expected to protect against severe illness. However, that is little comfort to those who have beenunvaccinated for various reasons, or otherwise unable to mount a robust immune response after vaccination. The surge of Omicron makes it more likely such people will be exposed.Indeed, because Omicron appears to spread even more quickly than previous variants, we need to be cautious even if breakthrough infections are only occasionally severe, because there are going to be so many breakthrough infections. The ultimate number of severe outcomes is determined by the number of opportunities the virus gets to cause them, which is the result of infectiousness. This is one reason why the Alpha variant wreaked such havoc last winter.You cannot simply compare Omicron with Delta by adding up the numbers of cases and hospitalisations for each over a short timeframe. The numbers of Omicron cases have been growing faster - much faster - than those of Delta, and it takes time for people to become seriously ill. To accurately gauge the severity, we will need to compare the numbers of cases that end up in hospitalisation or death. Mortality is often assessed as death within 28 days of diagnosis, and Omicron was reported to the WHO less than 28 days ago. We cannot afford to wait to find out exactly how dangerous it is.There is a widespread belief that infectious diseases evolve to become less virulent, leaving many hopeful that Omicron will be less severe for everyone, regardless of age or vaccination status."

They could still afford a home, could still afford to send their children to college, could still afford to participate in the fantasy of class mobility and economic stability. But that debt turned out to be inordinately expensive, and paying it back has had a crippling effect on people's ability to make ends meet -- so even households with incomes over $74,000 find themselves struggling with large monthly student debt payments.The pandemic has driven home exactly how much precarity student debt had caused: Households suddenly relieved of repayment found their budgets suddenly had breathing room, even in the uncertainty of the pandemic. (Savingsgrew rapidlyduring the pandemic, in part because of stimulus and child tax credits, and in part because of the student loan repayment pause. )Yet those payments will soon resume in some form, and families will find themselves back beneath the debt burden. And it comes as home prices are soaring,underwritten once again by subprime mortgages.It is easy for some people to write all this off as Americans living beyond their means, and debt-relief as an unearned bailout for financial recklessness. But that perspective misses that these are also Americans playing by the rules: told to work hard and go to college in order to get a good paying job, told to buy a home rather than rent because it builds equity and intergenerational wealth. Yet those rules are a path to prosperity for fewer and fewer Americans, a reality papered over by all that easy, expensive debt.Debt, rather than taxes on the wealthy and generous government services, is how the US has chosen to deal with inequality.

That is why we recently announced council investment into financial support for local people on lower incomes, with cuts in their council tax bills and childcare subsidies. But we know more fundamental change is needed.Poverty has a profound effect on individuals - from life expectancy to physical and mental health. The Covid-19 crisis has shown how entrenched deprivation has driven disadvantaged households further into poverty. Now, faced with soaring fuel and housing prices, benefit cuts and job losses because of the pandemic, many families trapped in poverty now face further difficulties.Though councils are navigating funding constraints, their leaders must remain committed to providing help and support for households in financial difficulty. Old solutions won't work for the new challenges and greater complexities we now face. Fundamentally, to tackle the rising cost-of-living crisis it is crucial, especially in the wake of Covid-19, for the government and local councils to lead the way to a more equal future by actively seeking to understand people's experiences and priorities.In Islington, we have launched Let's Talk Islington, a mass engagement programme to listen to local people and really understand the impact inequality has on their everyday lives."
FinancialPost_Clean_2020_result_68,ai,"The significant increase in testing capacity and access to testing facilities are among the most important achievements in Canada since the beginning of the pandemic. We can now broadly test people in the community who have very mild symptoms, thereby initiating contact tracing on a large scale. With a national test-and-trace strategy, as well as the widespread adoption of public health controls and physical distancing, our rates of COVID-19 have declined substantially.However, as we head into the fall season with an increase in people developing respiratory symptoms that require testing, we must revisit the need for non-targeted testing of people with no symptoms. The justification to test anyone who wished to be tested was reasonable in the earlier days of the pandemic: we did not know much about how the disease was transmitted or the best intervention strategies, we were unclear about the relevance of transmission from infected persons with no symptoms and the extent of transmission occurring from it in our communities. We wanted to protect our health-care workers, long-term care residents, other front-facing personnel, vulnerable populations and their families with everything we had available to us to get through the first wave.Yet we have learned a great deal since the beginning of the summer. New evidence suggests that only 20 per cent of cases truly have no symptoms, and that these people are less likely to transmit the virus. We also learned that people may test positive for up to 90 days, but are only infectious during the first 10 days. As a result, mass testing in many settings when case counts are low has identified very few infectious cases, but instead, a significant number of cases that are not infectious. The latter often triggers unnecessary anxiety, isolation of contacts, work absenteeism with a potential economic impact on the individual and extra efforts by hospitals and public health officials to launch further investigations - all finite resources that were diverted away from the public health response.People have also been using tests inappropriately, often to assure themselves that they are able to participate in activities that are to be discouraged, such as multi-person gatherings, without adhering to physical distancing. Testing cannot rule out that people are going to be infectious a day or two after they get the test. Thus, the false sense of security from testing is counterproductive as it serves as an enabler for risky behaviour. These approaches have had a noticeable impact on the time it takes to process samples. Cities such as Toronto and Ottawa are only seeing 50-60 per cent of results returned within 24 hours.Finding unknowingly infectious individuals by testing people with no symptoms and no known exposure is like finding a needle in a haystack."

Last week, Ben & Jerry's announced that it would no longer allowsales in Israeli settlementson occupied Palestinian land. The company released astatementsaying ""we believe it is inconsistent with our values for Ben & Jerry's ice-cream to be sold in the Occupied Palestinian Territory"". You are welcome to roll your eyes at the incongruity of ""ice-cream vendor"" and high political activism. It would not be unreasonable to assume this was another example of social justice reputation laundering. But look again, and a different picture emerges.Ben & Jerry's is no newcomer to the progressive values game. It is a company that has always been forthright about its politics, with along recordof supporting political causes that include criminal justice reform, voter registration, campaign finance reform and climate justice. One of its most senior roles is that of ""head of global activism strategy"".Its campaigns aren't those you would pick if you were in the business of scoring easy political points. Its stand against Israel's occupation of Palestinian land was certain to bring with it a strong backlash. The president of Israelcalledthe move ""a new kind of terrorism"" that would have ""serious consequences"" for the company."

Given the scale of the task, covering nearly every aspect of public life in a tumultuous year, and the volume of material to be considered, such an inquiry would need to start its work immediately. Its purpose would be to establish truth, not mete out partisan punishment. That truth is a valuable resource in unsafe hands for as long as it is hoarded in the memories of the key players, or saved on the phones of Downing Street aides. It must be compelled into the open, in witness testimony under oath and mandatory disclosure of evidence, using powers bestowed by the Inquiries Act.Mr Johnson might expect electoral exoneration, but history will remember his prevarications and misjudgments throughout the pandemic, alongside their fatal consequences. Conservative MPs also follow that verdict when deciding how loyal they should be to their leader. Reprieve at the polls is a powerful political argument, but it is not the only metric by which prime ministers are ultimately judged. Honesty in public life matters regardless of whether dishonesty is sometimes effective in politics. Debts to the truth can be deferred, but eventually they must be paid."
CNN_Clean_2022_result_370,ai,"We could still very well find ourselves in a recession over the next 12 months, with limited economic growth and lower prospects for improvement in Americans' standard of living that could linger for the rest of the decade.Here's why:Consumer spending on services will start to slowCurrently, spending onconsumer services(think hotels, passenger transportation and hair salons, for example) is growing rapidly and keeping the economy above water. That is not surprising, because consumer services, like travel and dining out at restaurants, are still recovering from the complete collapse during the early part of the pandemic. And because such services are more labor intensive, jobs continue to grow rapidly.But this strong growth can't persist forever. As the fear of the pandemic subsides and households return to pre-pandemic spending patterns, the pace of recovery in consumer services will slow, and by 2023, job growth in this sector will no longer be unusually high. Since consumer spending on services makes up about 45% of theUS economy, the slowdown in this segment could tip the economy into a recession, especially if the rest of the economy continues to contract.The impact of rising interest ratesIn its fight to tame inflation and slow the economy, the Federal Reserve will continue to rapidly raise interest rates. Industries sensitive to rate hikes - like the housing market and auto sales - will suffer.Housing startsandsales, for instance, are already in deep contraction and will continue to decline asmortgage ratesremain elevated. In addition, stock prices tend to decline when interest rates rise, reducing households' net worth and spending.Labor shortages will persist for the rest of the decadeThe worker shortage isn't just a temporary problem, but rather the result of several long-term demographic and labor market trends converging with the pandemic.First, as baby boomers retire, working-agepopulation growthis slowing to a halt. Second, people in the 25 to 34 age group, especially men without a college degree, are more likely to be out of thelabor force. They are much more likely to be single andliving with their parentswith less of a need to earn income.Third, for decades, people under age 25 have been withdrawing from thelabor forceto enroll inhigher education."
CNN_Clean_2022_result_90,ai,"Stockpiling tests now, when the demand for them is low, will keep domestic manufacturing lines open for surge production and allow us to distribute tests better when they're needed.Third, we need to redouble our efforts on protecting the most vulnerable among us, including older adults, the immunocompromised and people with disabilities. This includes encouraging everyone to get their first booster as soon as it's time to do so. The highest-risk individuals should also get a second booster shot four months after their first.We also need to enable greater use ofEvusheld,a long-acting preventive therapy that provides a high degree of protection against infection for those who don't respond effectively to vaccines. There are millions of Americans for whom vaccines don't generate an adequate immune response, and making sure they get thebest protection possible is a critical priority.Treatments need to be more widely available -- and publicized. We now have plenty of Paxlovid -- a highly effective oral antiviral pill -- available in thousands of locations across the nation. It's no longer in short supply, so we must keep expanding access, and getting the word out that Paxlovid is free and available.Easier access to effective treatments is critical to preventing severe illness, keeping our hospitals functional and saving lives.At the same time, we need to keep helping more Americans get vaccinated, which remains the best intervention we have for protecting people. Continuing to purchase vaccines (including potentially variant-specific ones) and making them available, accessible and free to the American people remains a critical public health strategy.Fourth, we need to keep making high-quality masks widely available. The Biden administration has already sentmore than 270 million N95 masksto local pharmacies, grocery stores and health centers for people to pick up for free; we must continue stockpiling masks and keep domestic manufacturers in business so we're ready when they are needed.Finally, to get this pandemic behind us, we have to ensure the world is vaccinated. Every major variant that has hit us hard was first identified outside the United States. There is no domestic-only strategy for a pandemic -- certainly not one that could possibly work.The Biden administration has already deliveredmore than 500 million doses to 114 countries, and we can and should do more to help support the distribution and administration of these vaccines. It's not only the right thing to do but also in our own best interest, both in terms of health and global leadership.All of these ideas, laid out in President Joe Biden's plan, are now possible due to the miracles of the scientific community, the ingenuity of our private sector and the hard work of our government agencies, civil society and community organizations.We can do this. But we need funding to make it happen.Scientists are developing a new generation of vaccines that could provide broader and longer-lasting protection. These will likely be ready this fall, but we cannot guarantee they will be available unless Congress steps up and provides the resources. More and even better treatments are on the horizon, but we need funding to secure them.And if we don't purchase these vaccines and therapies for the American people, other countries will, and we could find ourselves at the back of the line.Two years ago, it felt like we were at the mercy of this virus that we didn't understand and couldn't counter."
CNN_Clean_2022_result_262,ai,"An entire public interest movement emerged to pressure legislators and presidents to tackle these issues.In 1973, with the public aware of the ways that Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Nixon had used executive power to keep sending troops into the disastrous war in Vietnam, Congress passed the War Powers Act to restore more inter-branch balance over the decision to engage in military action overseas.In 1974, theCongressional Budget and Impoundment Control Actwas passed to centralize and strengthen the legislative budget process after Nixon had used methods like the impoundment of funds to circumvent the decisions of Capitol Hill.That same year, Congress amended a campaign financing law from 1971 by passing the Federal Election Campaign Financing Reform Act of 1974, which created a system of publicly financed presidential elections, put into place contribution and spending limits and established theFederal Election Commissionalthough later Supreme Court decisions have lifted many limits on political contributions.In 1978,Congress passed the special prosecutor provisionas part of a broader ethics package that then-President Jimmy Carter supported -- which, until 1999, allowed prosecutors to investigate charges of executive-level misconduct without having to fear the president's retaliation.Congress reformed its own chambers with ethics rulesthat imposed restrictions on conflict-of-interest, along with sunshine rules that opened the chambers to public scrutiny. And there was more.To be sure, many of these reforms accomplished their goals. Some had unintentional effects that created new problems in our body politic -- such as independent prosecutors who were seen as lacking accountability. Others, like the War Powers Act or sunshine laws, were not strong enough to curb the weaknesses that had been exposed by Nixon.But at least Congress tried. The House and Senate elevated government reform as a top priority and moved forward with legislation that addressed structural problems in our system. There were reforms like the publicly financedsystem for presidential elections,which for many decades had positive effects.When the House select committee on January 6 is done with its work, Congress must focus on reform. A few weeks ago, a bipartisan coalition reached anagreementon reforming the Electoral Count Act of 1887 and is working on text for legislation.The reforms would clarify and restrict the role that the vice president plays in theprocess of counting the Electoral College votesand make it more difficult for there to be a challenge of a state's slate of electors. Of all the reforms, this one stands the best chance of passing, and the January 6 committee's work might provide the public support for doing so.Reforming the Electoral Count Act must be only a first step, however. The crisis of the 2020 presidential election also reveals thebroader riskstovoting rights,since many state legislatures have used the lie that there was widespread fraud to introduce more voting restrictions.Even though claims of massive voting fraud have been debunked on numerous occasions -- with high-level Trump officials, such as former US Attorney General William Barr,making the point on video-- this has remained a centerpiece of efforts in red states to undermine the legacy of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.The push to enact the For the People Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act failed due to a combination of Republican resistance and the refusal of Democratic Sens."
CNN_Clean_2021_result_59,ai,"Following the President's lead, Democrats in Congress are prepared to proceed without Republican support if necessary.During Roosevelt's first 100 days, the Democratically-controlled US House of Representatives and US Senate passed numerous aspects of the proposed New Deal legislation, designed to lessen the economic impact of the Depression on millions of Americans. Among the first of these was the Emergency Banking Act, passed on March 9, just five days after Roosevelt's inauguration, which submitted banks to federal inspection and removed the US from the gold standard. Other legislative efforts, such as National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), which aimed to stabilize prices, increase wages and ensure collective bargaining, were hallmarks of this first congressional session.But Roosevelt also utilized executive orders to augment key components of his New Deal program. Citing the Emergency Banking Act, he ordered private supplies of gold to be given over to increase the government's reserves. Building upon the NIRA, he created the Civil Works Administration -- a jobs program that aimed to add about 4 million government jobs -- and following subsequent emergency relief, he established the Works Progress Administration in 1935 that similarly set forth to create public works jobs. Roosevelt also launched the Rural Electrification Administration that helped bring electricity to rural areas across the country.In the same way, many of Biden's executive orders address economic concerns that require immediate action. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, he has called for assistance to those who are struggling to buy food, pay rent and make student loan payments. Similarly, his plan to raise the minimum wage for federal workers to $15 and restore collective bargaining power right echoes Roosevelt's own commitments.Roosevelt's executive orders during wartime likewise aimed to meet the emergency of effective resource allocation. By executive order, Roosevelt established the War Production Board in 1942 for ""assuring the most effective prosecution of war procurement and production."" The board stayed in effect until the end of the war in 1945, when it was replaced by the Civilian Production Administration.The complexities of Covid-19 testing and vaccine distribution demand a similar response from the federal government today. Biden has established a Covid-19 pandemic testing board to widen the capacity of coronavirus testing. He has further directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to expand federal dollars for expenses pertaining to the National Guard's role in scaling up vaccination.Nevertheless, executive action can prove terribly misguided. Roosevelt's infamous Executive Order 9066 created military areas for the internment of certain designated Americans, which in practice predominantly targeted Japanese Americans."

Perhaps as soon as this summer, we will be able to hug loved ones, spend time with each other indoors without masking and even eat indoors at our favourite restaurants.Canadians should also expect to be able to travel to several countries without the need to quarantine, once a significant proportion of our country has been vaccinated. Universal masking, however, may be here to stay, at least for a time, especially in health-care settings, to limit the spread of respiratory pathogens to vulnerable individuals. Although it would not be mandated, there may be ongoing use of masks in public by the general population as we saw in many Asian countries after the SARS outbreak.What are the changes that will remain in our everyday lives post-COVID? Firstly, the increased social acceptability around not working or going to school while ill, washing hands and generally being more attentive to hygiene for the benefit of others is likely to persist.Being self-sufficient in the manufacture of personal protective equipment, vaccines and other goods will leave us better prepared if another pandemic ever comes. Investments in health care and long-term care - including a focus on private rooms, stable staffing models, adequate ventilation, infection-control measures and adequate wages for care workers - will help better protect the elderly, whose vulnerability was laid bare during this pandemic.Finally, the pandemic resulted in widespread disruption in many sectors, including health care and education. A backlog of elective surgeries will need to be cleared, access to personalized mental health resources will need to resume and routine preventative medicine will need to be reinforced once again.Likewise, the immense gap left in children's learning and socialization will take many months or years to recover from. Many aspects of the economy, including small businesses, have also suffered a massive blow and the aftermath of this is another thing we may be reckoning with for many years to come.Despite all this, there is much to be hopeful for in the months ahead. Vaccines have continued to roll out in full force, and disease burden continues to lessen by the day. The light at the end of the tunnel is the brightest it has been for the entire pandemic.

China is making strong efforts in all these areas by improving its laws and their enforcement.

America's fear of Huawei's cutting-edge advantages should not be expressed through government bullying: This not only hurts the company, it also limits many people's access to technological progress. The U.S. government should instead be encouraging its companies to work and compete with Huawei.Its attempt to block the popular social media platform TikTok on national security grounds also seems unfair since the United States has not publicly proved its allegations of security violations and the company has vowed to abide by all U.S. laws and regulations.Washington's so-called national security argument against Chinese companies seems hypocritical to the Chinese, considering that China, over the course of four decades or more of reform and opening up, welcomed all kinds of Western technologies and American companies into China ᅳ all the while maintaining its own national security.And yet if the two sides engage in equal and candid negotiations, they should be able to build a solid basis for long-term relations that are beneficial to both.On the political front, it is high time that the United States drop its habit of interfering in other countries' internal affairs. One hopes that Washington will learn from its unsuccessful interventions the world over, for example in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. America's concerns that foreign forces might interfere with its presidential elections should serve as a good reminder of why other countries are so sensitive about U.S. intervention in their own domestic affairs.China finds it offensive when the United States points a finger at the Chinese system or takes action against Beijing for its policies on domestic matters."

This exodus, which largely stems from retirements, has led to a significant turnover in the aviation workforce, which is particularly concerning given that achieving the highest levels of safety requires qualified and trained personnel. Aviation stakeholders, including airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration, must focus on recruiting and effectively training new personnel. That will help to relieve pressure on existing staff and (eventually) make up for the lost expertise.Also important is the adoption of systems that enhance pilot and air traffic controller situational awareness - especially on airport surfaces like runways and taxiways - and build additional layers of safety in an environment that is increasingly complex. These systems include cockpit-based displays that provide pilots with timely alerting to potential hazards. Similarly, for air traffic controllers, radar-basedtechnologies, such as those installed at some busy airports in the US, provide a significantly improved picture of aircraft movement on runways, taxiways and ramps, especially in low visibility conditions. Some of the advanced capabilities, particularly those designed for air traffic controllers, could be deployed more widely if funds were allocated by Congress. For cockpit-based systems, the standards have been slow to mature.Lastly, better safety data analysis and information sharing across the aviation community can proactively identify potential risks that might lead to safety incidents."

Unfortunately, the survey for southern bears was not available when news of the western bear decline was made public - and generated considerable alarm - in December 2022.According to the report released first, which was by Stephen Atkinson and colleagues, the three most recent population estimates for western bears were 949 (range 618-1280) in 2011, 842 (range 562-1,121) in 2016 and 618 (range 385-852) in 2021. As mentioned, the apparent change from 2016 to 2021 was a 27 per cent decline - although, as the authors noted, that's not statistically significant.The overall drop apparently was driven by a decline of more than 200 adult females and sub-adult bears, especially in the area around Churchill. The authors considered but rejected the possibility that these bears had simply relocated into southern Hudson Bay. Oddly, in light of the 2016 study about changing habitat boundaries, they did not consider the possibility that the ""missing"" animals had relocated northward into Foxe Basin territory.Sea ice in Foxe Basin almost always lingers well into August, so it might now be preferred as a summering and denning area by some western bear females and young bears looking for more predictable ice conditions. Foxe Basin bears haven't been surveyed since 2010 but they were then doing very well, with an estimated population size of 2,580.As for southern bears, their numbers went from 943 in 2012 (range 658-1350) to 780 in 2016 (range 590-1029), and then to a whopping 1,119 in 2021 (range 860-1,454) - which gives, as noted, an increase of 30 per cent over five years. The study's authors don't actually say if that's statistically significant but it seems likely it is, since they concluded a natural increase in numbers had indeed occurred and they couldn't verify immigration of bears from another subpopulation.Overall, the authors of both reports seemed hard-pressed to explain their results."
CNN_Clean_2024_result_230,ai,"Americans today operate under an ethos that the most lucrative financial opportunities are self-made.The newest generation to enter the workforce, Generation Z, has an almost opposite workplace philosophy to the baby boomers. The Gen Z mindset is shaped by the constant instability of their upbringing caused by a pandemic, significant layoffs in multiple industries, the Great Resignation, the ever-looming threat of recession and the advancements of artificial intelligence leading to the erasure of certain jobs.As Gen Z firmly plants their feet in the workforce,they are focusingon how to make their lives the best they can be financially - not how to be loyal employees. It's hard to imagine Gen Zers or millennials for that matter going for a reality show scenario such as what was offered on ""The Apprentice"" (former president notwithstanding) in which contestants vie for a job at a company. A company job is no longer the dream.The show ""Side Hustlers"" zeroes in on this shifting cultural mentality via a handful of female founders whose business ideas Gerde and Graham think have potential for success. While the women introduce their ideas - a food truck, sustainable period products, a makeup company - they also comment on their day jobs. ""It's not where my passion lies,"" says one contestant who is a corporate compliance officer. And also note how much is riding on their side hustle, both financially and with respect to fulfilment. ""I've been working for a cell phone company for the last 13 years, and it's just not cutting it anymore,"" another contestant says.Their day jobs are treated like situations to get out of to find real business potential. It's a mindset that feels reflective of a growing national philosophy in which you have a day job where you make what you need to live, and then you have a side hustle where the real opportunity lies."

Guardian_Clean_2024_result_41,ai,"Louisiana, with one of the US's worst maternal mortality rates, wants to make abortion medication a 'controlled substance'This week, Louisiana moved to expand the criminalization of abortion further than any state has since before Roe v Wade was decided.On Thursday, the state legislature passed a bill that would reclassify mifepristone and misoprostol - the two drugs used in a majority of American abortions - as dangerous controlled substances.Under both state and federal classifications, the category of controlled substances includes those medications known to cause mind-altering effects and create the potential for addictions, such as sedatives and opioids; abortion medications carry none of this potential for physical dependence, habit-forming or abuse. The move from Louisiana lawmakers runs counter to both established medical opinion and federal law. Jeff Landry, the anti-choice Republican governor, is expected to sign the bill. When he does, possession of mifepristone or misoprostol in Louisiana will come to carry large fines and up to10 years in prison.Louisiana already hasa total abortion ban, with no rape or incest exceptions. But the Louisiana lawmakers are pursuing this new additional criminalization measure because while abortion bans are very good at generating suffering for women, they are not very good at actually preventing abortions. Data from the Guttmacher Institute suggests that the United States saw an 11% increase in abortions between 2020 and 2023 - a possible indication that pregnant people are still managing to obtain abortions in spite of post-Dobbs bans. As was the case in the pre-Roe era, women have continued to seek out ways to end their pregnancies, even in defiance of abortion ban laws.In the pre-Roe era, illegal abortions were often unsafe, and abortion bans caused a public health crisis: many hospitals had to openseptic abortion wards, where women who had had incompetent or careless illegal abortions were treated for frequently life-threatening conditions. But the post-Dobbs reality is that advances in communications technology and medicine mean that illegal abortions need no longer be unsafe ones. Now, women living in states with abortion bans can access safe, effective abortion care in the comfort of their own homes, and often law enforcement and anti-choice zealots are none the wiser. Women can perform their own abortions, safely and effectively, without regard to the law's opinion on whether they should be free to. They can do this because they can access the pills.The criminalization measure, then, is part of an expanding horizon of invasive, sadistic and burdensome state interventions meant to do the impossible: to stop women from trying to control their own lives. The Louisiana bill nominally will not apply to pregnant women - they're exempted from criminal punishments for possession of the medications. But it will take square aims at the vital, heroic efforts of feminists, medical practitioners and mutual aid networks that have been distributing the pills in Louisiana: the people who have adhered to the principles of bodily autonomy and women's self-determination even amid a hostile climate. These people's courage and integrity is the greatest threat to the anti-choice regime, and so it is these people whom Louisiana's new medical criminalization law will be used against first.But pro-abortion rights and women's rights activists are not the only ones who will be hurt by the new law. For one thing, the criminalization of possession is likely to scare many Louisiana abortion seekers out of ordering the pills online, even if the bill itself technically excludes them from prosecution. These abortion seekers, dissuaded and threatened out of seeking the most reliable and safe method of self-managed abortion, may then turn to less safe options.But the new drug classification also has implications for a wide array of healthcare treatments."
CNN_Clean_2023_result_246,ai,"When senior global politicians sign off on the next panda loan, it will not be a couple of cute bears taking up residence in a foreign land but two diplomatic envoys for the Peoples' Republic of China.Thefirst country to be the recipientof panda breeding loans was the US, with pandas embedded in the cities of San Diego, Atlanta, Washington and Memphis. China also sent pandas to its neighbors, includingTaiwan in 2008(marking apositive development in China-Taiwan relations) and severalSoutheast Asian countriesin the years that followed. Alongside this continental expansion, China has also dropped pandas into countries across Europe, including the UK, Germany, Finland and the Netherlands.Unlike the movement of most other zoo animals, the placement of pandas seems to have strategic calculations for China, which has often opened up diplomatic channels and trade negotiations in places the pandas are sent. Panda loans to Australia, France and Canada, for instance, have all been linked to China's efforts to source uranium to fuel amassive transition towards nuclear energy.This motive would help explain why Beijing would approve of sending pandas to a minor city like Adelaide with a population sizeless than one-third that of Sydney. TheOlympic Dam mine containsone of the world's largest known deposits of uranium, and where is it found? South Australia.The arrival ofpandas in Edinburghin 2011 was tied to contracts valued at several billion dollars for the supply of renewable energy technology, salmon and Land Rovers. The agreement to send pandas to Copenhagen is said to have coincided with 40 new trade agreements betweenChina and Denmark.And also unlike most other zoo animals, pandas cannot experience the biological inevitabilities of illness and death without causing a political disturbance. The Memphis pandas - and allegations that the zoo had been neglectful - are just the latest example. In 2010, when amale panda diedin the midst of an electroejaculation operation at Oji Zoo in Japan, there was outrage on Chinese social media based on next-to-no evidence that the Japanese had done this tohumiliate its age-old rival.This increasing politicization of pandas comes with a cost. As the political animal grows in strength, the zoological animal - the real wild panda - gets eclipsed."

Many Canadians with modest annual incomes own businesses, second homes or stocks and could end up paying these higher taxes following a onetime sale where the appreciation of their asset equals at least $250,000.Moreover, economic research finds that capital taxes remain among the most economically damaging forms of taxation precisely because they reduce the incentive to innovate and invest. By increasing them the government will deter investment in Canada and chase away capital at a time when we badly need it. Business investment, which is crucial to boost living standards and incomes for Canadians, is collapsing in Canada. This tax hike will make a bad economic situation worse.Finally, as noted, in the video the prime minister claims that this tax increase will generate ""almost $20 billion in new revenue."" But investors do not incur capital gains taxes until they sell an asset and realize a gain. A higher capital gains tax rate gives them an incentive to hold onto their investments, perhaps until the rate is reduced after a change in government. According to economists, this ""lock-in(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/EconomicCostsCapitalGainsTax.pdf)"" effect can stifle economic activity.We need a 'That's enough, thank you!' federal political party(https://financialpost.com/opinion/thats-enough-thank-you-federal-political-party)Capital gains tax hikes are terrible optics for Canada(https://financialpost.com/opinion/capital-gains-tax-changes-terrible-optics-canada)The Trudeau government likely bases its ""$20 billion"" number on an assumption that investors will sell their assets sooner rather than later - perhaps before June 25th, to take advantage of the old inclusion rate before it disappears (although because the government has not revealed exactly how the new rate will apply that seems less likely). Of course, if revenue from the tax hike does turn out to be less than anticipated, the government will incur larger budget deficits than planned(https://budget.canada.ca/2024/home-accueil-en.html) and plunge us further into debt.Contrary to the prime minister's claims, raising capital gains taxes will not improve fairness.

But hidden in the shadows, obscured from the accolades they rightfully deserve, are the unsung heroes of our nation - Canadian military Families.Military Family Appreciation Day in Canada, on Sept. 15, is a special occasion to shine a well-deserved light on these remarkable individuals. It's a day when we express gratitude to the spouses, children, parents and partners of our service members, to acknowledge their sacrifices, resilience and unwavering support.A military family's life is characterized by constant change and challenges. Whether it's a sailor's months-long deployment at sea, an Air Force pilot's overseas mission or an Army officer's sudden base relocation, these families endure unique hardships that test their strength and determination.Imagine being an Air Force mom, anxiously waiting for your husband to return from overseas while your son undergoes multiple life-saving operations. Picture the search-and-rescue wife whose spouse is deployed to the farthest reaches of the North, searching for missing people, only to lose communication and be presumed lost himself until he miraculously restores contact. These are not fictional stories; they are the daily realities faced by Canadian military families.Overseas deployments, often lasting six months or more, or rigorous weeks-long training exercises, mean that spouses and children must navigate life without their loved ones. But it's not just about the extended periods of separation; it's the uncertainty that military life brings. Families must adapt to sudden changes, such as geopolitical shifts extending deployments, disrupting family plans and creating financial challenges. This constant state of flux requires unwavering perseverance.Military families face similar challenges to civilian families but with the constant threat of danger and loss. Military families regularly wait for the knock on the door indicating a loved one's involvement in a training accident or the unthinkable news of a fatality. Their strength is tested every day, knowing that the risks associated with military service are real and ever-present.Military life also demands frequent relocation. As the Canadian Armed Forces rotates personnel between bases, families uproot their lives, starting anew in different parts of the country. This means finding new schools and health-care providers, and often dealing with the frustration that credentials obtained in one province may not be recognized in another. Military spouses often need to re-educate themselves, adding complexity to their already challenging lives.While military service members are the backbone of our national defence, they couldn't succeed without the steadfast support of their families, which provide the emotional and logistical foundation upon which our uniformed heroes stand. They are the quiet pillars of strength, the unsung heroes of our nation.Despite their immense contributions and sacrifices, Canadian military families often remain underappreciated and under-served. The challenges they face - emotional, financial and logistical - are formidable, and they handle them with grace and courage. As a nation, it's our duty to ensure they receive the recognition, support and resources they need and deserve.Canada's military faces its own set of challenges, including under-funding, under-staffing and equipment shortages. However, today is not the day for that debate.On Military Family Appreciation Day, let us come together as a nation to show our profound admiration for these unsung heroes. While we should always respect and honour our uniformed service members, let us not forget to express our heartfelt gratitude to the families who support them through thick and thin. They endure sleepless nights, silent tears and the constant fear that their loved ones may not return from duty.As Canadians, we have a duty to stand with these families, to offer our support and to let them know that their sacrifices do not go unnoticed. In the age of social media, a simple gesture can go a long way. Use the hashtag #MFAD to share your appreciation on social media platforms, letting these families know that their country stands with them in admiration and gratitude.Let's remember that Canadian military families are the unsung heroes who enable our uniformed service members to fulfill their duty to our country. Their unwavering support, resilience and sacrifices deserve our deepest respect and gratitude.On Military Family Appreciation Day, and every day, let us celebrate and honour these remarkable individuals who stand as the bedrock of our nation's defence."

And Florida is just the beginning. In this presidential election year, American politicians of both major parties are feeling the heat from voters to take advantage of cheaper Canadian drugs. Eight other states have laws allowing the importation of drugs, according to The New York Times. Each still needs FDA approval to begin buying foreign-sourced drugs, but the pressure to do so will only intensify.Florida and any other approved states will be negotiating with Canadian wholesalers for their drugs. Some wholesalers and drug companies already have self-imposed restrictions on exports, while Ottawa says it has measures in place to prevent shortages. But there is cause for concern.As health policy experts Nigel Rawson and John Adams explain: ""Drug manufacturers allot production to countries by assessing the number of patients who will take the medicine each year. They are highly unlikely to allocate more drugs to Canada... when they know that the medicines will be redistributed to the United States at prices that undercut their American business. ""If states do start importing drugs from Canada, that's also likely to cause renewed interest in direct pharmacy-to-patient exports to the U.S., another pipeline by which drugs can leave this country.Cross-border pharmacy sales to the United States have been an issue for decades. In the early 2000s, the widespread adoption of internet-enabled mail-order pharmacies led to approximately one million American patients ordering $1 billion worth of prescription drugs from Canadian pharmacies.This surge raised concerns about potential drug shortages and price increases in Canada, prompting discussions within the government about regulatory action."

Despite former President Donald Trump's attempts to undermine the case by calling it a ""witch hunt,"" what happened in that courtroom was the epitome of what our criminal justice system should be: a fair-minded judge, an unbiased jury - even including one juror who gets the news from Trump's Truth Social - and a reasoned result.Now the attention turns to sentencing, which is scheduled for July 11. During the trial, Merchan repeatedly said he did not want to imprison Trump for violating the gag order barring the former president from making public statements about the witnesses, jurors and others. Now, Merchan will be forced to decide whether Trump's 34 felony convictions warrant that penalty. This is an unenviable task to say the least, and Merchan will be vilified no matter what he decides. Will he treat Trump more like a 77-year-old first time, non-violent offender?

Politico_Clean_2023_result_71,ai,"This is known as ""mechanistic interpretability"" research, and it's the closest thing we have to neuroscience for artificial brains.Unfortunately, the field is still young, and far behind in its understanding of how current models do what they do. The ability to run experiments on large, unrestricted models is mostly reserved for researchers within the major AI companies. The dearth of opportunities in mechanistic interpretability and alignment research is a classic public goods problem. Training large AI models costs millions of dollars in cloud computing services, especially if one iterates through different configurations. The private AI labs are thus hesitant to burn capital on training models with no commercial purpose. Government-funded data centers, in contrast, would be under no obligation to return value to shareholders, and could provide free computing resources to thousands of potential researchers with ideas to contribute.The government could also ensure research proceeds in relative safety - and provide a central connection for experts to share their knowledge.With all that in mind, a Manhattan Project for AI safety should have at least 5 core functions:1. It would serve a coordination role, pulling together the leadership of the top AI companies - OpenAI and its chief competitors, Anthropic and Google DeepMind - to disclose their plans in confidence, develop shared safety protocols and forestall the present arms-race dynamic.2. It would draw on their talent and expertise to accelerate the construction of government-owned data centers managed under the highest security, including an ""air gap,"" a deliberate disconnection from outside networks, ensuring that future, more powerful AIs are unable to escape onto the open internet. Such facilities would likely be overseen by the Department of Energy's Artificial Intelligence and Technology Office, given its existing mission to accelerate the demonstration of trustworthy AI.3. It would compel the participating companies to collaborate on safety and alignment research, and require models that pose safety risks to be trained and extensively tested in secure facilities.4. It would provide public testbeds for academic researchers and other external scientists to study the innards of large models like GPT-4, greatly building on existing initiatives like the National AI Research Resource and helping to grow the nascent field of AI interpretability.5."

After all, he's the one who proved that anything can happen in presidential politics. This mentality now encourages long-shot Republicans such as Suarez to enter the race.Who knows how the primaries and caucuses will unfold? How can anyone possibly imagine what drama is lurking around the corner? Why should any Republican assume that the outcome is inevitable when Trump himself showed us otherwise?Equally important for some of the candidates, such as former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, is using this opportunity to go after Trump and what he represents for the party. If there was ever a time for the Never Trump camp to gain traction, this might be it. Even if Christie's odds of victory are small, there's the possibility that he could kickstart a process of change and create a party with more room for him down the road.Some of the candidates are well aware that their chances of winning are slim to none. But a decent showing in key states could elevate their national stature and increase their chances of being picked as a running mate or cabinet official. And the more they can prove their campaigning chops and media savvy, the better the odds are that they can make a lasting name for themselves, even if they end up dropping out of the race.And then there is the generational argument that Suarez highlighted.

The skills that come from legislating, which forces members to build support among colleagues and secure their backing, has not been part of his repertoire.His well-known reputation as a ""legislative terrorist,"" as former Speaker John Boehner has called him, scared Republicans as they look at the possibility of losing their House majority in 2024.It is not that his tactics are unacceptable, after all the Party of Newt Gingrich and the Tea Party is more than comfortable burning down the House but placing Jordan at the top of the ticket - with Democrats licking their chops to connect the GOP to him as the titular head - could easily cost them a majority.Theswing districts in New York, for instance, would very likely go back to blue. The party needs someone who at least appears more reasonable - such as thetemporary Speaker Patrick McHenry- so that they have a serious chance of keeping power. In a party that privileges partisan power above all else, Jordan is too high a cost. The same partisan imperative that has allowed someone like him to thrive in a major party is now a roadblock to his success.Furthermore, the wrestling scandal that continues to swirl about him is not insignificant for the same reason. Six former wrestlers at Ohio State University, where he once coached, went public in 2018 with allegationshe had dismissed their complaintsof a doctor who was sexually molesting them.

NYTimes_Clean_2023_result_303,ai,"In a Yahoo News poll from July, 62 percent of respondents said that if Mr. Trump is convicted, he should not serve as president again. A December Reuters/Ipsosnational pollproduced similar results, with 59 percent of voters overall and 31 percent of Republicans saying that they would not vote for him if he were convicted.New datafrom our work with the Research Collaborative confirmed the repercussions of a possible conviction on voters. These questions did not ask directly how a conviction would affect people's votes, but they still supported movement in the same direction. This survey, conducted inAugustand repeated inSeptember(and then repeated asecond timein September by different pollsters), asked how voters felt about prison time in the event that Mr. Trump is convicted. At least two-thirds (including half of Republicans) favored significant prison time for Mr. Trump.Why do the polls register a sharp decline for Mr. Trump if he is convicted? Our analysis ᅳ including focus groups we have conducted and viewed ᅳ shows that Americans care about our freedoms, especially the freedom to cast our votes, have them counted and ensure that the will of the voters prevails. They are leery of entrusting the Oval Office to someone who abused his power by engaging in a criminal conspiracy to deny or take away those freedoms.We first saw this connection emerge in ourtestingabout the Jan. 6 hearings; criminality moves voters significantly against Mr. Trump and MAGA Republicans.But voters also understand that crime must be proved. They recognize that in our legal system there is a difference between allegations and proof and between an individual who is merely accused and one who is found guilty by a jury of his peers. Because so many Americans are familiar with and have served in the jury system, it still holds sway as a system with integrity.Moreover, recent electoral history suggests that merely having Mr. Trump on trial will alter how voters see the importance of voting in the first place. In the wake of the Jan. 6 committee hearings, the 2022 midterms saw turnout at record levels in states where at least one high-profile MAGA Republican was running.The criminal cases are also unfolding within a wider context of other legal challenges against Mr. Trump, and they may amplify the effect. That includes several state cases that seek to disqualify him under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.

Aiming for outbreaks to be detected within seven days - too long for cholera outbreaks but a good first target - and to be reported to public health authorities within one day and establishing the essential components of an effective response, as defined by objective benchmarks, within the next seven days establishes the urgency of rapid outbreak response. The 7-1-7 target enables countries to find gaps and to close them quickly. If we consistently hit this target, we can reduce spread of cholera and other diseases.The third intervention is wider use of oral cholera vaccines, a new tool in our armamentarium. But there aren't enough cholera vaccine doses being produced, and the vaccine is more effective at preventing outbreaks than stopping them. When one private company stopped making the vaccines, the world didn't move quickly enough to finance and develop alternatives, so now there's a major shortage.Korean and South African companies are working quickly but it will take years before their efforts help fill this gap. This is a systems failure that needs a systems-level response, including planning; reliable funding via Gavi, the vaccine alliance; collaboration with vaccine producers and new manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC); and financing mechanisms. These mechanisms could include advanced market commitments; private sector cross-subsidies from profits of publicly funded vaccines; requiring manufacturers who profit from vaccines such as those for Covid to subsidize vaccines for which there isn't a profitable market, such as those for cholera, yellow fever and typhoid; and new financial instruments such as taxes and bonds. With increased urbanization and warmer environments, the need for cholera vaccines could continue to increase; expanding manufacturing capacity and ensuring multiple producers will be necessary to make supply reliable.Safe water, better health care and public health, and expanded vaccine access require community engagement, political leadership and accountability."

CNN_Clean_2024_result_476,ai,"(CNN) &#8212; The 2024 election has prompted anavalancheofstoriesabout the placeswhere abortionis on the ballot. Usually, these stories zero in on the states that are likely to have reproductive rights propositions on the ballot in November (such a ballot initiative is already going forward in two states, Florida and Maryland, and additional measures could be on the ballot in ten other states by the fall).Ballot initiatives are certainly important. In states with gerrymandered legislatures and limited partisan competition, such measures allow voters to setabortion policy directly.But the received wisdom underestimates the extent to which abortion is on the ballot in every state - even when there is no ballot initiative that poses the question to voters directly.In some states that already have or could soon have state constitutional protections, the 2024 election will determine whether state legislatures and the many Supreme Court justices who face some kind of election, will interpret state court decisions in line with the will of voters. And then there is the simple reality that a possible federal backdoor ban could preempt any state protectionsvoters create.These tensions are higher because of two pending US Supreme Court cases on abortion. One, a challenge to nationwide access to mifepristone, a drug used in more than half of all abortions, appears likely to be dismissed because the plaintiffsdon't have standing to sue. The result in a second case, on access to abortion in medical emergencies, is harder to predict - but could very well allow states to limit access to abortion for more pregnant patientsfacing medical emergencies.Ultimately, 2024 will likely be taken as critical evidence by both Democrats and Republicans about how much the abortion issue matters. If voters put former President Donald Trump back in the White House and award Republicans control of the House, Senate or both, pundits will read that - rightly or wrongly - as a sign that the electorate does not care that much about reproductive rights after all. All of this means that abortion is on the ballot in far more - and more consequential - ways than in decades.Start with the complexities of state elections. If a ballot initiative on reproductive rights passes, there will be open questions about how the measure will be implemented and interpreted. In Florida, for example, voters approvedAmendment 4, which restored the voting rights of former felons after they served their time."

Some of his political appeal appears to stem from voters thinking the powers that be will not allow them to choose him again. Putting him in jail before he is convicted of any of these alleged offenses during a campaign in which he is leading in many polls would reinforce all these arguments.There are obvious risks to Trump, too. The unprecedented sight of a presidential candidate behind bars could make all these charges seem more real, and there is no telling how voters will react. In what is shaping upto be a close race for the presidency, even a small shift could be significant.Juries are also unpredictable. There is no way of knowing in advance how they would react to Trump going to jail for violating the gag rule. It is possible that it would make him a more sympathetic defendant. Jurors could also be swung toward a conviction if a jailing reinforces their belief in his guilt or they don't respond well to his defiance. Either way, the voters at home aren't the only audience Trump needs to reach.Nevertheless, given the way Trump's past legal problems have largely played out, it is easy to see how he could turn a brief incarceration to his advantage.

And then, without warning, somebody will tip the conversation into altogether more exotic territory, centred on a conspiracy theory.Not long after the death of Queen Elizabeth II, I was in the South Yorkshire village of Grimethorpe, listening to a somewhat earnest young man's views about how the deceased monarch had been fond of drinking babies' blood. On a visit to Birmingham in 2022, I listened to two loquacious pensioners talking about how Covid-19 was a fiction invented by the world's rulers, and global death figures had largely been made up - opinions that blurred into a general sense that a lot of people still did not believe a word of what they had been told about the pandemic.The previous year, in fact, I had reported from parts of the city where community organisations were trying to get people to be vaccinated, in the face of large-scale public scepticism and hostility.In late 2020, I had revisitedCollyhurst, the deprived Manchester neighbourhood on the northern edge of the city centre. Covid restrictions were still in place and the streets were silent, but I had a long conversation with two twentysomething men whose opinions followed a familiar pattern.

Moreover, once other candidates are formally nominated, they will have the opportunity to engage in a series of serious debates on the key issues rather than shunning the one-on-one encounters in Trumpish fashion.In short, by affirming the Colorado decision, the Supreme Court will not only begin a long hard struggle to reconstruct its own shattered legitimacy, it will reinvigorate the democratic energies of the American people - and may enable their eventual choice as president to gain public and congressional support for a serious program of social and political reform. To be sure, these legislative initiatives will be vastly different depending on whether a Democrat or Republican enters the White House. But, in either case, the broad direction of change will be in the hands of the voters.This is precisely what democracy is all about. In contrast, a democracy can't possibly function if presidents use force to remain in power after they have lost elections. If the court turns its back on the Constitution and allows Trump to run, it won't be furthering the cause of democracy by ""letting the voters decide"" his political fate, as many commentators have suggested. The justices would instead be propelling the United States in the direction of Latin America - where judicial passivity has, with tragic frequency, enabled presidents who lose elections to stage coup d'états.This historical experience suggests that, even if Biden beats Trump in 2024, the Supreme Court's failure to uphold the Constitution may well facilitate a vicious cycle that leads to the death of American democracy over the course of the 21st century. But should the justices stick to their principles, the court's reputation - and American democracy - will get back on track."
CNN_Clean_2024_result_122,ai,"Paradoxically, symptoms of emergent psychosis could lead people to self-medicate with cannabis meaning that, in some cases, the psychosis is the cause of the cannabis use, not the other way around.Secondly, cannabis could trigger or worsen psychosis without being a primary cause. We know that other drugs, including psychostimulants, steroids, psychedelics and alcohol can trigger a briefsubstance-induced psychosis, which can last for days to months. Still, of all the drugs associated with this uncommon kind of psychosis,cannabis is the most common culprit.Among people with substance-induced psychosis,those who use cannabis are most likely to eventually progress to schizophrenia. So, it appears as if the cannabis is causing not just the transient psychosis, but schizophrenia as well. At the same time, studies show thatthese patients have a higher genetic risk for schizophrenia, meaning that cannabis may simply trigger what the patient is predisposed to suffer from eventually.To make things even more complicated, there is a third explanation of the relationship between cannabis and psychosis. There is some evidence thatcertain genes can predispose a person to both cannabis use and psychosis, a shared genetic basis.So, where does all of this leave us?It is unlikely that cannabis use by itself causes schizophrenia. Therates of schizophrenia have been stablefor the last 70 years, while the rates of worldwide cannabis use have gone up from the hundreds of thousands in the 1950s to thehundreds of millions today. If cannabis caused schizophrenia, the rates of schizophrenia would have risen alongside the thousand-fold increase in cannabis use,and they haven't.Still, ifcannabis can precipitate the onset of schizophrenia earlier in vulnerable individuals, that by itself is a public health issue. An earlier onset of schizophrenia means that patients have fewer years of biological and psychological growth before mental illness adversely affects brain development and adult coping skills. That could lead toworse outcomes, including more positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as paranoia and delusions.Given the ongoing uncertainty around this issue, it would be wise for people with a personal history of schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder to avoid cannabis completely, unless there is a compelling medical reason to use it under close clinical supervision. Even people who have blood relatives with psychotic disorders or other severe mental illness should think twice and exercise a lot of caution before using cannabis."

According to the accounts from the whistleblower who sought me out, sexual assault and harassment was rife. It was student on student, professor on student and merchant mariner on student during the mandatory sea year.I found the allegations so troubling that I requested an Inspector General investigation which the IG declined to pursue. A few months later, then-Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood directed me to resign, stating that he'd lost confidence in my ability to be the agency's chief counsel. [In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for LaHood said that Krepp's removal was not taken in retaliation for her request for the launch of an IG investigation. ""Denise Krepp was not fired in retaliation for her actions,"" read the statement from Joan DeBoer, the former chief of staff for LaHood at the US Department of Transportation. ]That series of events showed me that the leaders of military services caremore about the reputations of the service academies than about the well-being of the men and women who have been assaulted.And indeed, that was the finding made by investigators during an exhaustive inquiry, dubbedFouled Anchor, that revealed a dark history of sexual misconduct at the Coast Guard Academy, substantiating dozens of rapes and assaults there from the late 1980s to 2006. That probe focused on the Coast Guard Academy but might as well have been speaking about all of the service branch academies.A US Coast Guard Academy sexual assault survivor who was quoted in the CNN investigationexpressed frustrationabout how inadequately sexual assault and sexual harassment are addressed in the service."
FinancialPost_Clean_2023_result_173,ai,"Given the risk of a wage-price spiral, the Bank of Canada began a series of rapid and sharp interest rate hikes, knowing that inflation would not settle at two per cent with labour markets so tight.The central bank's policy was intended to reduce consumer spending, as households were forced to devote more income to servicing their debt. That would in time hamper business revenues and hiring, eventually softening labour markets and easing pressures on wages. The Bank of Canada cannot affect commodity prices or snags in global supply chains. The rise in interest rates(https://financialpost.com/tag/interest-rates/) we've endured is aimed at solving a problem within our borders - employers facing a lack of workers that prevented them from increasing output as demand surged from the economy's reopening.The rise in immigration has helped fix our labour market challenge in another way. Rather than beating back consumer spending to slow hiring, we added to the supply of labour. Over the past seven months, despite robust job gains, the unemployment rate edged up from 5.0 to 5.7 per cent in October. As well, job vacancies have fallen by nearly a third.Of course, immigration has also added to demand. Strong hiring supported income growth, and immigrants coming to Canada need places to live and spend money on all the necessities of life. This adds to demand pressures and is especially concerning for rental housing affordability. Such strength in underlying demographic demand is inflationary when there is so little slack in the economy. Taking in so many in such a short period of time has stretched our ability to provide settlement services, affordable housing and other necessities. But there is also no doubt that the surge in migrants has alleviated massive labour market pressure and is thus deflationary."

But it's not too late to change course.We lost electricity almost immediately, while the strikes became more and more ferocious. We learned to differentiate each terrifying sound of war: screaming fighter jets in the skies, attack helicopters buzzing overhead, sprays of automatic gunfire rippling through the neighborhood.The RSF indiscriminately lobbed anti-aircraft missiles that crashed into homes and onto the streets.

His ability to maintain his leadership position in a party that has undergone such turbulent change is fascinating. Many politicians have come and gone during his tenure, while others have spun like weather vanes in a futile attempt to keep up.But the stoic and understated McConnell changes little, which serves as a source of frustration for his enemies, not to mention for more than a few of his fellow Republicans and the reporters assigned to cover our democracy.I've often heard McConnell remark that when he took office in January 1985, he would peer over his desk from a dark corner of the Senate and think, ""None of these people are ever going to die, quit or get beat."" He wondered often if his tenure would be one of longevity and consequence, or a short-lived trip on the backbench.Indeed, McConnell has become one of the most consequential political figures in American history. His longevity and deal-making abilities draw comparisons to his idol,Henry Clay, a fellow Kentuckian who served as US senator, House speaker and secretary of state.UnlikeClay, however, McConnell never pined for the presidency. Rather, he set out to master the greatest deliberative body in the world. From the back row, McConnell moved up, building a reputation as a campaign street fighter and savvy operator. He won two hard-fought reelections in 1990 and 1996 (Kentucky was still a blue state back then) and then worked his way up to becomeRepublican leader in January 2007following stints as the Senate GOP's campaign chief and conference whip.McConnell's initial and most recent elections as party leader both came during moments of turmoil for the GOP."

And also, for Arizona's merit-based judicial-selection system, which has avoided the unseemly spectacle of judges running on partisan platforms and amidst campaigns with tens of millions of out-of-state dollars. ""The system is not built to withstand political attacks,"" Bolick wrote in the Arizona Republic last month, ""and judges seeking retention are at a massive disadvantage."" ""Our judicial ethics limit what we can talk about, and even prohibit us from endorsing each other,"" he continued. ""For those reasons, I will not have a campaign,"" relying instead on independent groups to educate voters.Bolick's decision in the abortion case exemplifies judicial fortitude. Upholding a law that predates Arizona's statehood while knowing that it would ignite a political firestorm and jeopardize his career is a testament to his integrity.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThe backlash against Bolick and King is emblematic of a broader ignorance or willful disregard for the judiciary's role. Honest judging protects minority rights and maintains a check on majoritarian excess. If judges either followed their own policy views or their best judgment of what decision would be popular, they would undermine the rule of law, making it subject to the political majority's whims. This erosion of judicial impartiality is precisely what critics seem to desire, so long as it benefits their political agendas.But political questions should remain within the legislature's purview, the branch most attuned to the electorate's will. Dissatisfied citizens should focus their energies on legislative change, as demonstrated by Arizona's subsequent repeal of the old abortion law. Attempting to co-opt the judiciary for political purposes distorts its role and ultimately endangers all citizens, regardless of political allegiance.Ironically, Bolick's wife Shawnna now faces the loss of her own public office because of the tough political decision her husband's judicial vote necessitated. Shawnna Bolick was one of two Republican state senators who joined with Democrats to repeal the 1864 law ᅳ a complete ban is unpopular, including in her district ᅳ so now she's being primaried.The political challenges faced by both Bolicks highlight the personal sacrifices demanded of judges committed to impartiality. At a time when judicial decisions are increasingly scrutinized through a partisan lens, it's vital that judges put principles ahead of politics.Bolick's decision in the abortion case exemplifies judicial fortitude. Upholding a law that predates Arizona's statehood while knowing that it would ignite a political firestorm and jeopardize his career is a testament to his integrity.Public confidence in the judiciary is a cornerstone of our democracy. Bolick's unwavering commitment to these principles, even at great personal and political cost, deserves our respect and support. Our judiciary's health and our constitutional order's preservation depend on it.The aftermath of this abortion case reveals a critical moment that asks voters to reward judicial integrity even when it's politically inconvenient."
CNN_Clean_2023_result_796,ai,"These trials also have an impact on the careers of those in law and order, even if in different ways given that none of them is accused of being engaged in wrongdoing.For starters, James is emerging as one of the most interesting Democrats in New York politics and could receive a boost in her own public standing as a result. Should James be the person who can puncture one of the things Trump loves most - his wealth and claims about his economic prowess - and at the same time damage the partisan shield that has seemingly protected him from accountability, she will undoubtedly become an even bigger player on the national stage.And she's not alone.Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willisis on her way to becoming a household name as she pursues Trump over alleged election interference, as isAlvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorneywho is prosecuting Trump over hush money payments. (Trump has denied all wrongdoing in these cases as well as the federal indictments over alleged mishandling of classified documents and election interference on January 6, 2021. )Just as ironically, the political player who has the most to gain from the spotlight staying laser-focused on Trump is President Joe Biden.Biden, who has struggled in the polls, would retain considerable advantages if he faces a rematch against Trump in the general election. As Biden demonstrated in the 2020 election, he knows how to craft a campaign around the themes of integrity, normality, stability and a commitment to governance. The contrast with Trumpian chaos and disregard for guardrails was striking and remains so.Though Biden faces many challenges in the months ahead regardless of his opponent, the baggage that the former president will be bringing with him, amplified and clarified by these cases, will likely strengthen Biden's case before the electorate.All of which creates a paradoxical political dynamic as political and legal adversaries end up finding advantage from common events in very different ways.This tension is already being seized on by Trump attorney Alina Habba. In her opening statement on Monday, Habba attacked James for saying, in the prosecutor's own campaign for attorney general, that she was going to ""get Trump"" as evidence of this being a partisan exercise.Judge Arthur Engoron pointed out that he'd already found that Trump hadgrossly inflated his asset statements, as James had alleged, before the trial began. That suggests James is on solid ground in pursuing her case.Engoron addedthat the ruling was affirmed by a New York appellate court, ""So Ms. James' motivations are no longer at issue in this case, are they? ""Since the fraud trial is being held without a jury - asEngoron explained Monday, neither side asked for one - Habba's attack on James' motivations is likely to be of no help to Trump in the fraud suit. But in trials with a jury, similar attacks could have more impact. And Habba's words still might resonate in the court of public opinion.Biden has taken a different approach to the interconnected political relationship presented by these legal matters. He has been extraordinarily careful to stay free from the investigations against Trump and to allow the process to play out on its own - including with aTrump appointee heading the inquiryinto his son Hunter. But he continually faces the danger of saying something that would be fodder for Trump's unproven allegations that this is all a political hit job.The judges in these cases have also wrestled with this issue, weighing imposing some form ofgag order on a former presidentwho loves to threaten and intimidate, but without infringing on the speech rights of a political candidate.The prosecuting teams, meanwhile, will contend with the elevated status that comes from high-profile cases. They will have to navigate the attention that is impossible to avoid - and is no doubt sometimes desired - with the need to protect public perceptions that the case, and they themselves as agents of the law, are legitimate. In a world filled with conspiracy theories and disinformation, this won't be easy.To be sure, there is ample precedent for this dynamic. There's no doubt thatUS Attorney General Merrick Garland's rolein the Oklahoma City bombing case -heoversaw the prosecutionof Timothy McVeigh - elevated him in the pool of judicial, and eventually, White House nominees.Further back, during the Watergate investigation, some of the senators involved in the panel looking into the matter, such asSen. Sam Ervinof North Carolina, also saw their national stature elevated as a result of their role. Ervin was transformed from one of the old conservative Dixiecrats into a constitutionalist and institutionalist who defended the integrality of Congress.Leon Jaworskiemerged as the embodiment of the dutiful prosecutor, guided by law seeking justice.Others, however, found infamy. In the late 1990s, for instance, independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who led the investigations into President Bill Clinton that culminated in impeachment, found his career greatly diminished by perceptions that he wasa partisan hack.Those who are seeking Trump be held accountable thus need to be extremely cautious. After all, Trump's main response to trouble has never been to get people to like him. Instead, he tries to get Americans to distrust and dislike the other person just as much. And this will remain his major strategy as the legal proceedings unfold. He will do so with the trials, sowing doubt as to whether any of this is legitimate. No doubt he might play onracial and ethnic prejudice, as he has done before.Trump's trials are unprecedented. We have not had a former president and party front-runner in this kind of legal jeopardy before. But we do know that Trump isn't the only one whose future is likely to be affected by his legal cases and their outcomes. Indeed, just as he did with American electoral politics, Trump is now dragging down the entire legal system into his chaotic world.Opinion by Julian ZelizerTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company."

It was also shocking to discover that insurance companies often consider hair loss from chemotherapy a cosmetic issue.Original Medicare, for instance, doesn't cover wigs even, because they are deemed not medically necessary.Some insurance companiesdo at least partially cover the cost of wigs, but this took years.The stance that hair loss is a cosmetic issue is akin to blaming the victim; it implies that it's the patient's problem if there is a concern about going bald. However, concern about losing one's hair from chemotherapy has deeppsychological implications for one's mental health. A dramatic change in one's appearance can be achallenge to one's identity.

Taamneh, which examined the potential liability of social media companies for aiding and abetting terrorism by hosting content that expresses support for a group behind an act of violence. Twitter's attorney, Seth Waxman, argued thatTwittercould have been liable if the company were warned that specific accounts were planning an attack, but that in the absence of such warnings, Twitter was not liable.Social mediacompanies must no longer have their cake and eat it too. They must be held to account for failing to quickly deploy the resources and technology to prevent extremist content from inciting violence despite earning a financial bonanza across their platforms.Section 230 has shielded their need to make that investment. Passed at the dawn of the internet age in 1996,Section 230was intended to immunize social media companies from third-party content posted on their platforms. It absolves an ""interactive computer service"" from being treated as a ""publisher or speaker. ""In other words, the platforms are treated as benign providers of digital space and have limited liability exposure to whatever customers decide to upload onto that space."

It will take courage from journalists as well, to defy the warning of Assange's persecution.Fortunately, Assange's release bodes well for this possibility of a democratic resurgence. His release was not the result of some generous whim on the part of President Biden. We must instead thank the tireless work of his family and close supporters, the journalists who kept his cause in the public eye, and also the millions of citizens around the world, especially in Australia, who refused to be silent until justice was done.That struggle is not over.

As an elected official profoundly uninterested in legislating, hehas spent very little time rounding up support. Most of his notoriety has come from being on television, whether on interviews or in the committee room, making outrageous statements and repeating partisan talking points. The skills that come from legislating, which forces members to build support among colleagues and secure their backing, has not been part of his repertoire.His well-known reputation as a ""legislative terrorist,"" as former Speaker John Boehner has called him, scared Republicans as they look at the possibility of losing their House majority in 2024.It is not that his tactics are unacceptable, after all the Party of Newt Gingrich and the Tea Party is more than comfortable burning down the House but placing Jordan at the top of the ticket - with Democrats licking their chops to connect the GOP to him as the titular head - could easily cost them a majority.Theswing districts in New York, for instance, would very likely go back to blue. The party needs someone who at least appears more reasonable - such as thetemporary Speaker Patrick McHenry- so that they have a serious chance of keeping power. In a party that privileges partisan power above all else, Jordan is too high a cost. The same partisan imperative that has allowed someone like him to thrive in a major party is now a roadblock to his success.Furthermore, the wrestling scandal that continues to swirl about him is not insignificant for the same reason. Six former wrestlers at Ohio State University, where he once coached, went public in 2018 with allegationshe had dismissed their complaintsof a doctor who was sexually molesting them. Jordan hasemphatically deniedtheir claims.While many Republicans consider Jordan to be a useful attack dog for the party, he hasn't sold the entire caucus that he is the best leader for the party.Finally, even in the most bitter and contentious of parties, personal relations still matter. Within the GOP, Jordan has not been a figure who is well loved.

Freeing the government from the need to follow the rules is troubling? unless, that is, the legislature has concluded that the procedure it had previously required is superfluous, after all.And this brings us to the second, and worst, problem: the bill picks favourites. The rule of law not only speaks to whether and how courts look at laws and decisions, but also how laws should be designed in the first place. Among other things, laws should consist of general rules for the future? not commands or exemptions directed at particular people.General laws that apply to everyone at the outset leave people free to plan their lives around them.

Today, as a doctordelivering cancer diagnosesnearly every day, I often witness firsthand the profound impact of illness and suffering on individuals and their loved ones. In these moments of vulnerability, I lean on my faith to provide comfort, hope, and guidance, reminding myself of the inherent dignity and worth of every human being and the importance of walking alongside others in their darkest hours.At its core, faith offers a profound sense of purpose and meaning, anchoring individuals amidst the uncertainties of existence. In times that challenge us, whether grappling with personal loss, navigating through tumultuous circumstances, or confronting existential questions, faith provides comfort and resilience. It also fosters a sense of belonging to a larger, interconnected tapestry of humanity, offering reassurance that one is not alone in their journey.Because of this, the positive correlation betweenfaith and mental wellnessis well documented. Faith provides a framework for coping with stress, anxiety, and depression, offering a sense of inner peace and a sense of belonging. Through prayer, meditation, or communal worship, individuals find avenues for self-reflection, introspection, and transcendence, nurturing a sense of harmony within themselves and with the world around them.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONFaith also has profound implications for physical health.

FinancialPost_Clean_2023_result_129,ai,"They are inexpensive but relatively inflexible, which means they are not easy to turn on and off. Unfortunately, power demand does go on and off - both daily as our needs adjust and seasonally as weather affects our needs. This is why peaking power is also necessary: generators that can be called upon (""dispatched"") to ramp up or down on a minute-by-minute basis. Currently only fossil fuel-powered generators are dispatchable on a large enough scale to serve the Ontario grid. The province shut down its coal-fired plants so that leaves gas generators.A third category of generator consists of intermittent renewable systems(https://financialpost.com/category/commodities/energy/renewables/) like wind and solar. We could actually do without them but for political reasons we use some of each. They're neither reliable (as baseload is) nor dispatchable (as peaking sources are). They generate intermittently, depending on the time of day and the vagaries of the weather.Our gas-fired power plants currently make up 28 per cent of installed capacity but provide only about nine per cent of our power, as they are idle most of the time. But that nine per cent is critical, coming online when neither baseload nor renewables are adequate to meet system demand. If we didn't have natural gas plants, then on hot summer days when the wind is absent and air conditioners are going full blast we would face blackouts. Similarly, the presence of a lot of wind capacity in Ontario requires us to keep gas plants running in the background because wind turbines are prone to unexpected drops in output, requiring immediate power generation from gas to fill the gap.Ontario's electricity sector is exceptionally clean. Annual air pollution emissions from power generation fell by 98 per cent between 2000 and 2020. The electricity sector nowadays has virtually no effect on Ontario's air quality. As for greenhouse gases, the sector only contributes about two per cent of Ontario's emissions (because CO2 is a by-product of gas-fired generation), which translates into 0.008 per cent of global emissions, far too small to have any effect on the global climate.In 2021 the IESO issued a report examining possible ways to phase out natural gas. They studied a plan based on a mix of increased hydro imports from Quebec, a new small modular nuclear reactor, new battery storage systems and aggressive conservation measures. They concluded that the plan: depended on technologies not currently available; would increase power prices by 60 per cent; and, because none of the replacements are fully dispatchable, would give rise to significant risk of blackouts.Using a Canadian macroeconomic model, I simulated what would happen if the IESO plan were implemented. I looked at several scenarios, including one in which Quebec is unable to commit to the new exports and Ontario needs to procure supply elsewhere. Under reasonable assumptions, by 2030 the plan would cut Ontario's GDP by about three per cent and would cost between 17,000 and 25,000 jobs. The IESO estimated its plan would cost about $1,200 per household - though that only includes the direct costs."

Their expertise in how government works is vital.The froth of Tory outrage is partly synthetic, whipped up to make a stink for Labour on the eve of local elections, but not entirely insincere.

But on the other side of the lens, I grew to fear more than what these people were saying about me.Several of my coworkers received a message on Instagram that seemed to threaten my life, which meant that each video of me ""in the wild"" was not just a potential source of humiliation, but a beacon letting the entire internet - including those who wished me harm - know my location in real-time. Yet there was no recourse to be taken: I was in a public position that allowed, even encouraged, anyone who wanted to film me at will. I was alone and exposed and scared.But I still had to go to work. Every performance, my anxiety was through the roof, wondering if that person who shouted my name was just being a harmless jerk or planned to follow me in the parking lot.

CNN_Clean_2024_result_56,ai,"There are obvious parallels with the present day, when many Russians are trying hard to ignore the devastating war their country is waging on neighboring Ukraine.Certainly, this is a more pertinent point of comparison than the notion that Putin's regime in any way approximates Stalin's. The estimated imprisonment of between628 and 1,011political prisoners in today's Russia is a horrific reminder of the brutal authoritarianism with which the Kremlin rules. But to compare it to the millions worked to death in Siberian labor camps or executed in KGB basements is hyperbolic.What the West gets wrong about Stalin and PutinMoreover, these comparisons divert attention from important differences between the Stalin and Putin regimes. Beyond the drastically different scales of repression, the most obvious one is that Stalinism was a deeply mobilizing ideology that sought to remake man and undertook industrialisation with unprecedented scale and speed. That is abundantly not the case in Putin's Russia, where the government instead encourages a ritualistic patriotism and political apathy.Such conclusions point to intractable policy and security issues for the West. If Putin wasin power solely thanks to the machinery of repressions, then it is not Russia that is a security threat, but his regime. In such a case, the problems posed by his regime would cease to exist when he does.Likewise, if one argues that Putin is the only driving force behind Stalin's rehabilitation, then one can also continue the fantasy that, if it weren't for Putin, Russians would embrace Westernized liberal democracy and stop justifying the sacrifice of thousands of lives for the whims of the state.These assumptions are flawed and lacking in nuance, no matter how comforting such a shallow understanding of Russian society might be.The Western tendency to reduce mass-scale crime to an omnipotent leader has always been a misleading one. Even Stalinism was not the work of one man, but of the security services and individuals willing to denounce their fellow neighbors for housing rights or petty grievances, as the Kyiv-born Russian writer Mikhail Bulgakovso mercilessly satires in his short storiesof the time.Likewise, efforts to pretend that Putinism is just the work of one man will lead to myopic thinking and poor analytical predictions regarding Russia's future."

We have the world's largest deposits of uranium, a key fuel source. And we have a history as a research leader and exporter of reactor technology and radio-isotopes. At the moment, though many Canadians may not realize this, 15 per cent of Canada's electricity already comes from nuclear power. And the $26-billion,15-year program to refurbish Ontario's Darlington and Bruce nuclear units is one of the largest such projects in North America. The sector can expand, offering not just clean energy but also high-quality, well-paying jobs in the future.For its part, LNG(https://financialpost.com/tag/lng/) is a transitional fuel with considerable benefits. It's cleaner burning than coal and oil, which can help reduce emissions during the transition to a fully renewable energy system. Gas in liquid form is also more versatile and can be transported and stored more easily than in its gaseous form, which allows for greater flexibility in meeting energy demands. Given Canada's immense gas reserves, LNG really should be an important economic driver in the medium term, so long as policy allows it.Building LNG infrastructure and export facilities does generate demand for construction jobs, which are always attractive to governments. But a more important consideration is that LNG is a good alternative to coal consumption, which rose 3.3 per cent worldwide in 2022, according to the International Energy Agency. Supplying LNG that can replace coal will offend purists who would have the world eliminate all fossil fuels immediately, but in the world as it is rather than as they would prefer it to be, countries switching over from coal to Canadian LNG would be an environmental improvement. An energy-hungry world could consume fuels that produce a lower total of emissions. As in so many areas of policy (and life) we shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.But time to act is short. While supplies remain tight and pricing robust, many global LNG projects will come on stream over the next decade just as the world's de-carbonization policies advance."

In some cities, barriers to getting new homes built(https://financialpost.com/real-estate/slowing-home-building-bad-news-buyers) are a major reason why.Barriers to constructing new single-detached homes drive a wedge between what it costs to build and the market price. On average between 2011 and 2021, a single-detached home in the Vancouver area cost homebuyers $2 million. But the construction cost of a new home was only about $700,000.

Homes in the Toronto area now cost homebuyers $350,000 more than they cost to build. In the Montreal area, however, the difference between cost and market price is negligible.Why is there this gap between what houses cost to build and what they cost to buy?

FinancialPost_Clean_2024_result_45,ai,"By Alex Laurin and Nick DahirLooking around the OECD, Canada is an average-tax nation overall but relies far more on income taxes and much less on consumption levies than most other industrialized nations. Leaning so hard on income taxes hurts our economic performance.Every tax creates economic distortions but some overused taxes are more damaging than others. By raising more of our revenue from the less damaging taxes we could improve economic performance without reducing public services.The latest C.D. Howe Institute Shadow Budget(https://www.cdhowe.org/sites/default/files/2024-02/Shadow%20Budget%202024%20Commentary_653.pdf) proposes a simple change in the federal tax mix: raise the GST rate by two percentage points - back to its original rate of seven per cent. At the same time, cut the federal corporate rate by two percentage points and the rate in the second personal income tax bracket by 5.5 points, from 20.5 to 15 per cent. That's the bracket ranging from $55,867 to $111,733.Finally, to cover any harm to lower-income Canadians from the increase in GST and also any political blowback from the fact that in the very lowest bracket the income tax rate doesn't move: double the base amounts for the GST Tax Credit.Revenue forecasts are always difficult, but our best estimate is that an extra two points on the GST will bring in $26.1 billion next fiscal year, while the corporate rate cut will cost $6.3 billion, the income tax rate cut, $14.9 billion, and the increase in the GST credit, $5.8 billion. Sum those four changes and the federal government ends up short $900 million. In a more than $500-billion budget that's not a lot.What are the benefits of this revenue-neutral tax switch?The corporate tax cut would increase the expected after-tax return on potential business investments, making more opportunities desirable and thus increasing the capital stock and economic activity. It may also shift some multinationals' profits back into Canada.Lower personal income taxes would reduce tax avoidance and stimulate greater work effort and participation."

(He actually tried to suggest that the homeless issue had begun under Ronald Reagan's governorship. )Asked about these issues, Newsom mostly skirted the questions, denied the facts or pivoted to talking up President Joe Biden's record. For instance, he resorted to White House talking points on the large number of jobs added nationally under the Biden administration rather than explain why unemployment is so much higher in California than it is in Florida. On our open border, Newsom blamed Republicans for not backing Biden's plan for comprehensive immigration reform, rather than admit that the millions of people pouring into our country illegally pose a security threat.Sometimes, Newsom made up completely non-credible statistics of his own. He claimed, for instance, that more people had moved from Florida to California in the past two years than the other way around. People watching immediately debunked that idea,posting on X, formerly known as Twitter, actual numbers that disproved the governor's claim.Of course, there was a subtext to the evening's debate.

Trump, of course, vehemently denies this charge and claims executive immunity from all wrongdoing. He is also fast becoming the presumptive Republican candidate for the presidency. In their decision, the Supreme Court made no attempt to decide whether Trump and his followers did engage in an insurrection or not.The language of Section 3 is clear and unmistakable: Any person who has sworn an oath of office to uphold the Constitution and then participated in or given aid and comfort to a violent insurrection against the government of the United States is barred from holding office unless pardoned by two-thirds of both houses of Congress. The president, like any other federal official who takes such an oath of office on the United States Constitution, is covered by this provision. Trump's lawyers' attempts to hold the president of United States above the rule of law and endow him with absolute immunity, even in cases of personal wrongdoing, make a mockery of our republican form of government, a constitutional guarantee and would convert our republic into a monarchy where the king can do no wrong.The Republican Party of the mid-19th century, the party of former President Abraham Lincoln and big government, sought to safeguard the American republic from all future insurrections after the slaveholders' rebellion that had precipitated a crisis of the Union and Civil War.

The2,500 American troopsstill in Iraq on anadvise-and-assist missionwill also present tempting targets.That means at the very least thatIran is well-positioned to heighten already roiling tensions in the Middle East after spending decadesbuilding a network of proxies and terror cells in Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere to act as a forward line of defense for a clerical regime that sees itself as surrounded by external threats. Most important - especially in the case of Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon - these furnish a direct front and capable forces in the armed fight for Israel's destruction.But there's also a deeper question of what exactly Iran did to bring about this crisis in the first place with the October 7 attacks - and what that says about where it goes from here.In Gaza, Iran has helped transform and expand the capabilities of Hamas (and its smaller cousin,Palestinian Islamic Jihad, also involved in the recent attacks on Israel) almost since the group's inception in 1987. Tehran has supplied a wide array ofrockets, missilesandother weapons, while Israeli intelligence has assessed that it manages asophisticated and complicated ratlinesmuggling weaponry from Iran to Yemen to Sudan by sea, to Egypt by truck, through the Sinai courtesy of Bedouin smugglers, and from there into Gaza via Hamas' extensive network of cross-border tunnels. In addition, Iran hasprovided Hamas up to $100 millionannually, according to a 2021 State Department report.Given that largess, some Biden opponents have charged that the $6 billion inembargoed oil sales""released"" to Iran in exchange forfreeing five American hostagesin September played a role in financing the Hamas attack. But thefunds are held in an accountcontrolled by Qatar and carefully monitored for humanitarian purposes, and none of those funds (now frozen) had been released at the time of the attack.It's also important to note that Iran has never been at a loss for funds to support its clients, notwithstanding internationallyfrozen assets, heavy international sanctions and abiding economic problems. Ironically, such spending is controversial even in Iran itself; revelations concerning the substantial billions Iranspends on foreign adventurismhelped fuel anti-government protests in 2018.There has been much speculation about whether, given these well-documented ties, Iran ordered the Hamas operation in southern Israel. The White House has tentatively concluded that while Tehran has provided material assistance that could facilitate such an operation, it hasno informationto suggest that Iran did so.Despite a story in The Wall Street Journal of Hamas sources claimingIran helped plan the attack,there is no analytical unanimity, and no firm public evidence, verifying this report. Other intelligence reported in the WSJ thatHamas militants recently receivedsome specialized training in Iran hasn't been linked specifically to the October 7 attacks.WhileIran shares an anti-Israel agenda with Hamas, manyexperts assessit has never had the ability to control it and doesn't require prior authorization for its activities. It is reasonable to assume, as the US has said, thatIran was surprised(albeitpleased) with the October 7 operations.All of which is consistent with the fact that neither Iran nor Hezbollah appear to have committed to more intensive involvement - yet Iran is reportedly fearful of a harsh responseif it crosses Israel's red lines. Meanwhile, Hezbollah'sprobing attacksin Israel's north over the past two weeks may be intended as signs of solidarity with Hamas and to keep Israel distracted from Gaza. And while the Iran-allied Houthis in Yemen havefired shotsat Israel in recent days, they haven't yet posed a serious threat to the Jewish state.Still, Iran and its allies have theirred lines, too."

CNN_Clean_2024_result_330,ai,"She made up a legal standard, asking both sides to assume that Trump could have deemed a record personal by simply not including it with the records transmitted to the National Archives and Records Administration at the end of his term. If this were true, the mere fact that Trump took the documents with him from the White House would inherently turn them into personal records.Of course, Trumpleapedat this interpretation, fashioningproposedjuryinstructionsthat would inevitably result in his acquittal. But, as Smith noted, this approach has no basis in the law - or the facts. Even Trump himself does not seem to have considered classified documents personal after he left the White House, as evidenced inan audio recording CNN obtainedlast year in which Trump, during a conversation at his Bedminster, New Jersey, estate in 2021, discussed documents remaining classified even though he took them with him upon leaving office. Smith hits this point hard, arguing that Trump's position that records are personal was ""invented"" when the controversy over the documents began to emerge in February 2022, over a year after Trump left the White House.Importantly, Smith asked Cannon to let both parties know ""promptly"" how she viewed the law. If she ultimately embraces the legal interpretation articulated in her proposed scenarios, Smith indicated he would strongly consider immediate appellate review. That shows how seriously Smith views this issue and the fundamental error Cannon would be making.Nor is all this an isolated mistake by Cannon.

Although this mission was unmanned, the Artemis program will eventually lift astronauts in a spacecraft called Orion into space, withplans to land humanson the moon as soon as 2025. The DSN will be the method whereby mission controllers on Earth will communicate with astronauts and monitor the trajectory of the craft.During the Artemis I mission, the DSN was used totrack the unmanned Orion capsule. The capsule was accompanied by 10 small secondary ""CubeSats,"" which are tiny satellites that range in size from about the size of a toaster to the size of a briefcase. Essentially, they are inexpensive devices that can perform specific tasks.However, each of those CubeSats required its own DSN link for Earth-bound technical staff to monitor its performance, which imposed a heavy load on the capabilities of the communication network. Indeed, during the 25-day-long Artemis I mission, other science-critical missions were neglected.To give a sense of the impact, the Orion spacecraft received 903 hours of DSN time, while the CubeSats consumed an additional 871 hours of DSN time.During the Artemis flight, the use of DSN meant thatimportant science missions were denied1,585 hours of the use of the network, including 185 hours that the James Webb Space Telescope could not communicate with Earth. In addition, while the Orion spacecraft was in flight, NASA deferred 509 hours of important DSN maintenance.This is not to say that the Artemis mission is unimportant. On the contrary, if humanity is going to once again venture into deep space, it will be crucial to be able to maintain a radio link with those intrepid explorers."

The increased interest rates for federal and other debt have pushed mortgage rates up from less than 3% during the pandemic to 7.63%.In another world, high mortgage rates might have crashed the housing market and at least reduced prices for new homebuyers.

And when it was enforced in the early 1900s, federal appeals courts had read the language of the lawvery narrowlyto apply only to illegal abortions. This interpretation was necessary for many reasons, but one of the most obvious was that the act, by its terms and contrary to pre-Roe standards, doesn't contain an exception to save a pregnant person's life.The Department of Justice reinforced that narrow interpretationin 2022.But antiabortion activists, emboldened after the demise of Roe, have a new interpretation that contradicts this almost-century worth of precedent: The law is asbroadand as strict as its plain terms would indicate. And, in effect, interpreting Comstock this way would solve the problem of a divided Congress that won't pass anationwide abortion ban. They have set forth this new interpretation inlitigation,local ordinances, threatening letters bystate legislatorsandattorneys general,media statementsandplans for a Republican administration in 2025.For now, the current Department of Justice will not enforce the Comstock Act. As long as a Democrat sits in the White House, the law will remain in the dustbin of history. But a future Republican administration could exhume the law and make enforcing Comstock a top priority. Even worse, given that the Act has afive-year statute of limitations, an antiabortion administration could not only prosecute people for violations that occur in the future, but also for any violations occurring right now. Current abortion providers targeted under this interpretation would try to make arguments about due process and entrapment, but they'd have to raise those arguments in court after being prosecuted, a precarious position.With this potential threat, the Comstock Act is too dangerous to stay on the books and remain unchallenged or in the shadows."

Politico_Clean_2024_result_0,ai,"The fewer companies there are in a given market, the less pressure they face to innovate in ways that benefit consumers and the more power they have to harm consumers and competition. On the other hand, in the AI economy, cloud and foundation models are what electricity was to the early 20th century: They are essential inputs to dozens of uses, many of which we have yet to imagine. As a result, we might actually want monopolistic scale in some layers in the stack. It takes a lot of computing power (and carbon) to run the most powerful models, and models with a lot of good data are better than ones without. These costs and scale make it hard for small businesses to replicate what the tech giants can do.There is a longstanding American tradition to regulate businesses with similar features using tools from the law of networks, platforms and utilities. We accept that it doesn't make sense to have a dozen competing electricity or telephone providers in the same neighborhood - but also expect government to closely regulate these local monopolies. One form of regulation we could apply to AI is structural separation: not allowing a business to operate at multiple layers in the stack. For example, banks have long been prohibited from running commercial businesses, out of concern that they would use their power over money to favor their enterprises over the competition. In the AI realm, structural separation might mean blocking cloud providers from also running the businesses that rely on the cloud to reach customers.A related concept is nondiscrimination: rules that require businesses to offer all users equal service and prices. Just like net neutrality prevents Comcast from favoring Peacock and throttling your access to Netflix, these rules would prevent Amazon from favoring affiliated entities while stifling competitors."

FinancialPost_Clean_2023_result_52,ai,"There was no option zero, however - no examination of Canada not pursuing net zero.The report concluded that option two (the status quo plus the net-zero cap) would reduce Canada's GDP by $200 billion in 2050 compared to just the policy status quo, while option three, adding in the complete phase-out of Canada's oil and gas production, would increase the loss in 2050 to $300 billion.The $100-billion figure you may have heard about thus refers to the difference in costs between options two and three. The PPF report concluded that this extra $100 billion was not justified by the in fact rather small additional emissions reductions from phasing out oil and gas production.And that's true even though their estimate of the incremental cost of phasing out oil and gas production is almost certainly too low. According to a statistical overview(https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/media/3792944/iveyenergycentre_policybrief_dec2020_energyinca_overview_editedjan13.pdf) by the Ivey Business School, in 2019 Canada's oil and gas industry alone accounted for almost $150 billion in GDP, or 7.5 per cent of Canada's total. Wiping it out all but entirely should produce a loss at least in that range, as well as further costs all across the Canadian economy. That even the Public Policy Forum, which has been an active advocate for net zero, thinks wiping out oil and gas would be a mistake should be an important source of moderation in Ottawa's clampdown on the industry.But what's also important to realize is that the PPF/Navius report did not present an estimate of the policy status quo compared to rejecting non zero as a policy objective. So its numbers are in no way an estimate of ""the cost of net zero."" They are estimates of different variants of a policy aimed at achieving net zero.Another shortcoming of the report is that it focused on the reduction in GDP in 2050 and did not report the accumulated reduction in Canadian incomes from today through 2050. Nor did it include any analysis of the costs of the technologies that would be required for Canada to reach the proposed net-zero target.In 2021, Navius did publish a report ""Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 in Canada(https://www.naviusresearch.com/publications/climate-choices-net-zero/)."""
FinancialPost_Clean_2024_result_3,ai,"By John Lester and Alexandre LaurinIn its November Fall Economic Statement(https://www.budget.canada.ca/fes-eea/2023/home-accueil-en.html), the federal government presented a long-term projection that shows its debt ratio - that is, federal debt divided by GDP - declining smoothly over the next 30 years. But this outcome follows from overly optimistic assumptions about interest rates and program spending, and a decision to ignore the impact of recessions, which are certain to happen in any 30-year period. Taking such a rosy approach to debt sustainability allows the government to avoid making the hard choices on spending and taxes that no government likes.Ottawa's analysis assumes the effective interest rate on federal debt remains below the growth rate of the economy from now all the way to 2055-56. This sunny projection means debt interest falls as a share of GDP with no need for action to improve the government's fiscal situation. (The parallel with personal borrowing is this: If your income is rising at seven per cent a year, you can take out a loan at five per cent, borrow to pay the interest, and watch your debt decline as a share of your income. )The historical record provides no support for this optimistic assumption that the interest rate will be less than the growth rate. Quite the opposite: looking back over 35 years the interest rate has exceeded the growth rate by 0.8 percentage points on average, and by 0.4 percentage points over the past 45 years.It's true that extending the averaging period to 55 years does result in a negative gap.

FinancialPost_Clean_2023_result_33,ai,"Still, for most high earners the AMT will have limited impact, and even for those most affected the bite will be small compared to their true incomes.Although more than 300,000 tax-filers have incomes above $250,000 the reformed AMT is forecast to affect just 32,000 taxpayers per year. The most impacted will be the 8,200 filers with incomes above $1 million who will pay 80 per cent of the AMT's increased annual revenue of $600 million. Their average income is about $2 million, so the new revenues represent about three per cent of their incomes. The average impact will be even smaller in proportionate terms for taxpayers at $500,000 incomes, though the budget offers few details.Some changes to how the AMT reform calculates income subject to tax are curious. It will disallow 50 per cent of deductions for disability supports, workers' compensation, social assistance and Guaranteed Income Supplements. The AMT's exemption level is projected at $173,000 in 2024, and very few people at that income or higher will have any such deductions in their regular tax.Other notable changes to the AMT taxable base are: including 100 per cent of capital gains (up from 80); adding 30 per cent of capital gains on charitable donations (up from zero); and disallowing 50 per cent of most non-refundable tax credits, capital loss carry-forwards, business investment losses and deductions for investment interest expense and for child care expenses.Changing the treatment of capital gains on charitable donations and non-refundable tax credits is a hard hit on donations by high-net-worth taxpayers. And disallowing parts of various expenses directly associated with earning incomes violates a basic premise of an income-based tax: we tax income, not what's spent to earn it. The reform also penalizes taxpayers whose incomes fluctuate year-to-year and will force investors to anticipate whether they'll be subject to the regular or the alternative tax in future years.Finally, the reforms will make the current eight-page (!) AMT schedule T691(https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/cra-arc/formspubs/pbg/t691/t691-22e.pdf) even longer, and the provinces will likely follow suit with greater complexity in their own AMTs.Instead of further complicating the AMT, it would be better to scrap it entirely, incorporate its key points into the regular tax system and adopt a much simpler approach. For filers with income above $250,000, say, or capital gains above $50,000, raise the inclusion rate on capital gains above that threshold to 75 per cent and cap tax credits on dividends from large corporations at, say, $20,000. In addition, restore income averaging (to be fair to taxpayers with highly variable incomes) and limit deductible interest expense on investments to the associated taxable income (as Quebec does).Currently, the effective tax rate (ETR) on capital gains for top earners, who receive a very high share of all such income, is 16.5 per cent (50 per cent inclusion times the 33 per cent top rate). Under the existing AMT, the ETR on gains is just 12 per cent, though this would rise to 20.5 per cent under the proposed reforms."

Assuming SMEs can pass along something over half the tax they pay, CFIB estimates SMEs pay about 40 per cent of the carbon tax revenue.The main reason government can claim most Canadians are getting more back in rebates than they pay in carbon taxes is that others are getting back far less than they pay.

Simply put, four new Medicare billing codes were added to fund chronic care management and continuous remote disease monitoring.5 STEPS TOWARD A FRESH APPROACH TO HEALTH CARE REFORMWith this, we set a course to address more than 75% of the nation's $4 trillion in annual health care costs: chronic disease management. Before we could implement this simple bipartisan reform,the coronavirus pandemicseized the world. Priorities changed quickly.These codes, and the work that went into establishing them, are still the foundation of fundamental reform. The next administration, Republican or Democrat, must follow through on that work to transform structural health care problems. This will cut costs while improving the health of our nation.Our problems are driven by the conflict of interest between health care providers and insurers. Providers are incentivized to maximize patient visits and treatments; insurers strive to minimize payouts. This misalignment plagues our nation with fragmented care, higher costs and poor patient outcomes.AI COULD PREDICT WHETHER CANCER TREATMENTS WILL WORK, EXPERTS SAY: 'EXCITING TIME IN MEDICINE'Indeed, this conflict kills.To address this, we must integrate health care services with insurance functions under a unified model."

This is especially true for Biden, who has invested so much of his career in being the individual who has sought and held office because of who he is - not what he can raise. At a certain point, too many headlines about fundraising hauls can easily turn off voters.Although Trump is just as eager to raise funds,though struggling to do so as effectively, it is notable how his supporters devote much less airtime to that metric compared to extolling his anti-establishment, faux victimhood narrative.While having Obama, Clinton and other prominent Democrats play a strong role in the campaign is valuable, they can't become the focus of the campaign. Biden's greatest asset is to have public attention turn toward the dangers that Trump poses to the nation. When that is not the subject of conversation, the discussion needs to center on what Biden does well for America. Shifting to past presidents, which will include memories of the Clinton scandals and stir the backlash sentiment against Obama, has its costs.And none of the Democrats in Radio City Music Hall could ignore themassive protests that were unfolding outside, primarily from activists condemning Biden's support of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.

FinancialPost_Clean_2023_result_25,ai,"The motivation behind the higher rate was to get high earners to pay their ""fair share."" A similar goal is driving the government's plan to amend the alternative minimum tax in its upcoming budget.Recent studies confirm that capital gains and dividends are highly concentrated in the top tail of incomes. And they receive very favourable tax treatment: only 50 per cent of realized capital gains are included in taxable incomes, and corporate dividends receive a special tax credit. A study(https://financesofthenation.ca/2023/03/09/pathways-to-reform-of-capital-gains-taxation-in-canada/) I've just published for Finances of the Nation(https://financesofthenation.ca/ ) (""Pathways to reform of capital gains taxation in Canada"") confirms that, while nearly one in five tax-filers benefits from capital gains relief over a 10-year period, the total tax benefits are extremely concentrated at very high incomes.Consider what the exclusion of 50 per cent of capital gains from taxable income means for a high-income filer. The top federal rate of 33 per cent currently applies to taxable incomes above $235,000. With only half of gains included, such people face an effective rate of just 16.5 per cent. That is only modestly higher than the bottom-bracket rate of 15 per cent on wages and salaries faced by filers with taxable incomes below $53,000.Reform of capital gains tax has been debated for years, and an increase in the inclusion rate has been rumoured in the run-ups to recent budgets. Financial and tax advisors have written about how investors might best prepare for it, while tax policy and economic experts have argued its merits both pro and con.My study takes a deep dive into the equity and efficiency effects of raising the inclusion rate. In terms of fairness, higher capital gains tax would be the most effective way to make those with the highest incomes bear a larger share - much more productive than further increases in top-bracket marginal rates. And by targeting the increase on taxpayers above a high threshold of incomes or capital gains, most lower-income recipients of gains could be spared.In terms of efficiency and growth, a large empirical literature shows offsetting results. Many channels for tax avoidance - and the waste of tax planning and real resources it entails - would be curtailed if the payoff to garnering income as a capital gain were reduced. Similarly, the diversion of resources from productive business investment would be reduced if tax-free gains on homes were curbed. On the other hand, the evidence does suggest that business startups, venture capital and other economic drivers might be adversely affected - which is why my study proposes measures that could offset most such impacts."

The Ontario(https://financialpost.com/tag/ontario/) government certainly thinks so and is creating the Ontario Infrastructure Bank (OIB) to get that done.Unfortunately, inadequate funding is not the problem plaguing infrastructure investment. The province never comes close to spending the money it allocates to infrastructure. In 2022-23 alone, it underspent its infrastructure budget by a whopping $3.4 billion (15 per cent). Under-spending has happened every year in recent memory.What's more, increasing funding over time has not increased actual infrastructure output. According to Statistics Canada, the combined capital expenditures of all levels of government in Ontario have risen 33 per cent over the past 10 years, but in real terms production is essentially unchanged. Costs have risen (close to a point a year faster than the consumer price index); output has stayed the same. On a per capita basis, output is actually down 10 per cent.Ontario's infrastructure problem is not a shortage of funding, it's the cost and availability of construction labour and materials."

Part of the challenge is that they stem frommultiple causes,includinglack of availability of raw ingredients, quality issues in plants which are largely located outside of the US, regulatory barriers and global emergencies that lead to supply-chain disruptions.To prevent these shortages, US regulators should expand on the existing essential medicines list to create a more comprehensive list of critical drugs - both for cancer and other conditions - needed for emergency responses and saving lives. Every drug on the list should be evaluated for availability, quality, manufacturer reliability and potential weaknesses in the supply chain.The list of drugs should be used as a starting point to coordinate access to drugs in anticipation of natural disasters, public health crises and other unforeseen events. In the same vein, the government should consider establishing and maintaining a buffer supply of critical drugs, which would help avert shortages. Manufacturers, the FDA, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response and other government agencies would all have to work together.Drug shortages are acute today in the US, but the drug manufacturing and supply chain is global. Assuring consistent access to life-saving drugs will require theinternational community to work togetherto achieve a regulatory and manufacturing environment that incentivizes production of high-quality drugs and allows quick response when production is jeopardized by global events.To be sure, these aren't quick fixes, but drug shortages did not come about overnight.

So we stayed inside and watched news reports of the destruction.Now, there's no telling how much new damage we'll see each day when we emerge from our homes. With this current disaster, as with the last, we're experiencing a familiar feeling of doom.

However, a bonding company requires a defendant to put up 10% of the total and would lose that amount even if he prevailed. That is a roughly $45 million cost just to secure the right to an appeal. In this case, the cost could be higher given the judgment and the bar on Trump doing business for three years in New York.The expectation is that Trump can make the deposit or secure a bond to avoid what some gleefully called a ""fire sale"" on this properties. The deposit is now being celebrated as an added indignity and penalty.However, as New Yorkers cheer this moment, many business leaders are likely wondering if ""there but for the grace of God go I.""

The lower court hadstruck downthe map in January 2022, ordering the state to redraw a map with two majority-Black districts.Just two weeks later, the Supreme Courtput that lower court opinion on hold, allowing Alabama to use the map, even though there was plenty of time left before the election to draw a new one. That decision had a tangible effect: Republicanswonsix of the seven seats - all but the one majority-Black district.The same thing happened in Louisiana: the Republican-controlled legislaturedrew a congressional mapin which Black voters were a majority in only one district, though a fair map would have included two.

He may even be factoring in Biden's impulse toward moderation and bipartisan cooperation, and hoping the president will pardon him in a step toward healing a badly fractured nation.There is also the question of whether prosecutors would even offer a deal Trump might consider. On the one hand, a deal that barred Trump from running for public office would neutralize his ability to impose his will from the White House. On the other, it might only confirm exactly what Trump has long argued: that he is a victim of so-called elites hell-bent on keeping him out of office and blocking the desires ofreal Americans.Unless a deal also barred Trump from so much as speaking about US politics - which seems highly unlikely - it's hard to imagine how Trump wouldn't simply use pleading out to avoid the humiliation of an election loss while continuing to feed dangerous lies to his supporters and undermine the public's faith in the electoral process.Trump's defense team is no doubt looking for a way to keep their client out of prison. But Trump's calculation is likely more complicated, colored by his ambitions, his personal history and his belief in his own power to make things go his way. One thing is clear: Predicting with any amount of certainty how Trump will behave is a losing game.Opinion by Jill FilipovicTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company."
CNN_Clean_2024_result_249,ai,"Historically, presidents running for reelection have counted on the vice president to go after the other ticket. Because they are not at the center of the contest, there is more room for VPs to fully embrace the hardball partisan tactics necessary to win without feeling the countervailing pressure of appearing dignified and civil. (Donald Trump, of course, had no problem doing the attacking himself when he ran for president in 2016 and 2020).In 1952 and 1956, Richard Nixon was probably the most famous of them all, eviscerating Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson on the campaign trail to support the military hero Dwight Eisenhower, who tried to stand above the fray. In 2012, then-Vice President Biden jumped into the role with fervor despite his natural inclination toward restraint. He boasted about his working-class identity as a way toeviscerate Republican nomineewhose policies would be devastating to average families.

For various reasons, ranging from her race and gender to the conservative media machine, Harris has been painted as a ""bad"" vice president who could never lead the country herself.But others who have worked with her have a very different perspective; Harris is widely considered to be a highly intelligent politician with the ability to grasp andanalyze complex public policy conundrums.

CNN_Clean_2023_result_28,ai,"In the 18th and 19th centuries, cheap publications detailing scandalous crimes - ""Horrid brutish and bloody murder"" and promising ""Awful disclosures!"" - circulated widely.It's much the same with the ""true crime"" genre that's all over cable television, streaming services and podcast charts -- stories that detail the actions of the murderous criminal, the vulnerability of his victim and how he almost got away with the evil deed.An unsolved crime troubles our desire for certainty, answers and justice. It's tempting to go over the facts of the case again and again, hoping to find the one piece of information that will unlock everything and bring closure. That certainly has proved to be the case for the awfulmurders of the four college students- Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin and Xana Kernodle - stabbed in Moscow, Idaho.Murders have always been a particular subject of public fascination. Homicides that get the most coverage, however, tend to be the least representative. This particular case had many of the hallmarks of the kind of killings that become national obsessions.The murders were brutal, and for many weeks, the suspect remained at large. The victims were heartbreakingly young and had beenkilled at college, a place that many of us like to imagine as safe. The murderer had, inexplicably, fatally stabbed four roommates but left two others alive.Immersing ourselves in such a horrific story can be an attempt, perversely, to make it less frightening: If we understand what happened, perhaps we can avoid falling victim ourselves. Some true crime enthusiasts I've spoken with told me they were driven by empathy. They felt that staying up late, reading about a case, was a way of connecting to the victims, of not letting them be forgotten.Then, of course, there are the less-flattering motivations. For some people,consuming true crimeprovides an opportunity to indulge their appetites for lurid details. For others, it's an exercise in superiority: That happened to you because you were careless, or clueless or somehow deserved it. It would never happen to me.True crime stories can bring out our best and worst instincts. Empathy can curdle into voyeurism; a desire for justice can cross the line into demands for vengeance.AfterI wrote a bookabout women's obsession with true crime, I largely stepped away from the genre. I thought I'd gotten over my own fascination, but the story of these four murdered college students got into my head. Before I went to bed, I'd visit various subreddits dedicated to the case - Moscow Murders; Idaho Murders - to see if any new details had turned up.I scrolled through the victims' social media accounts, staring at pictures of them giddy and full of life, which were almost unbearable to look at. I brought up the crimes at a dinner party before seeing everyone else's stricken facial expressions and realizing, too late, that murders didn't make for good dinner table conversation.But the more time I spent reading about the case online, the more uneasy I grew. In their hunger for more details, some people seemed to forget that we were talking about a real tragedy that had happened to real people, and not an episode of television.They discussed the case with the fervor of fandom and fumed that the police weren't releasing more details. They speculated over who the killer's ""target"" was, as if the storyline needed a main character. They pounced on anyone who had the bad luck to be loosely tied to the crimes -- an awkward neighbor, a guy at the food truck at the same time as two of the victims, a random professor -- treating them as potential culprits.These amateur sleuths spun out wild theories, as if they expected a murderer with the convoluted motivation of a villain on an episode of ""Criminal Minds."" They picked apart the victims' lives, scrutinized their romantic choices and publicized their family members' criminal records.By late December, whenpolice arrested a suspectat his parents' house in Pennsylvania, national attention to the case had reached a fever pitch. Since his arrest, the suspecthas been extraditedfrom Pennsylvania back to Idaho and has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary.So far, the ultimate twist in the narrative around this case has been that the suspect was studying for his PhD in criminology: He was someone who might have been expected, once his education was completed, to help apprehend criminals."

For months Tehran apparently has been planning amore aggressive strategyaimed at US troops in the region.Last February, Reuters reported that Iran used earthquake relief flights to Syriaas a coverfor secret weapons shipments, and The Washington Post reported thatdocumentsleaked as part of theDiscord troverevealed plans by the IRGC Qods Force to equip and train militias with devastatingadvanced IEDs.All this may be part of an effort coordinated among Russia, Iran and Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad to expel the900 US troops in Syria, who are there to counter the Islamic State. The2,500 American troopsstill in Iraq on anadvise-and-assist missionwill also present tempting targets.That means at the very least thatIran is well-positioned to heighten already roiling tensions in the Middle East after spending decadesbuilding a network of proxies and terror cells in Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere to act as a forward line of defense for a clerical regime that sees itself as surrounded by external threats. Most important - especially in the case of Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon - these furnish a direct front and capable forces in the armed fight for Israel's destruction.But there's also a deeper question of what exactly Iran did to bring about this crisis in the first place with the October 7 attacks - and what that says about where it goes from here.In Gaza, Iran has helped transform and expand the capabilities of Hamas (and its smaller cousin,Palestinian Islamic Jihad, also involved in the recent attacks on Israel) almost since the group's inception in 1987. Tehran has supplied a wide array ofrockets, missilesandother weapons, while Israeli intelligence has assessed that it manages asophisticated and complicated ratlinesmuggling weaponry from Iran to Yemen to Sudan by sea, to Egypt by truck, through the Sinai courtesy of Bedouin smugglers, and from there into Gaza via Hamas' extensive network of cross-border tunnels. In addition, Iran hasprovided Hamas up to $100 millionannually, according to a 2021 State Department report.Given that largess, some Biden opponents have charged that the $6 billion inembargoed oil sales""released"" to Iran in exchange forfreeing five American hostagesin September played a role in financing the Hamas attack. But thefunds are held in an accountcontrolled by Qatar and carefully monitored for humanitarian purposes, and none of those funds (now frozen) had been released at the time of the attack.It's also important to note that Iran has never been at a loss for funds to support its clients, notwithstanding internationallyfrozen assets, heavy international sanctions and abiding economic problems. Ironically, such spending is controversial even in Iran itself; revelations concerning the substantial billions Iranspends on foreign adventurismhelped fuel anti-government protests in 2018.There has been much speculation about whether, given these well-documented ties, Iran ordered the Hamas operation in southern Israel. The White House has tentatively concluded that while Tehran has provided material assistance that could facilitate such an operation, it hasno informationto suggest that Iran did so.Despite a story in The Wall Street Journal of Hamas sources claimingIran helped plan the attack,there is no analytical unanimity, and no firm public evidence, verifying this report. Other intelligence reported in the WSJ thatHamas militants recently receivedsome specialized training in Iran hasn't been linked specifically to the October 7 attacks.WhileIran shares an anti-Israel agenda with Hamas, manyexperts assessit has never had the ability to control it and doesn't require prior authorization for its activities. It is reasonable to assume, as the US has said, thatIran was surprised(albeitpleased) with the October 7 operations.All of which is consistent with the fact that neither Iran nor Hezbollah appear to have committed to more intensive involvement - yet Iran is reportedly fearful of a harsh responseif it crosses Israel's red lines. Meanwhile, Hezbollah'sprobing attacksin Israel's north over the past two weeks may be intended as signs of solidarity with Hamas and to keep Israel distracted from Gaza. And while the Iran-allied Houthis in Yemen havefired shotsat Israel in recent days, they haven't yet posed a serious threat to the Jewish state.Still, Iran and its allies have theirred lines, too."

The resistance is both political, for fear of giving the Democrats any kind of victory that could help them gain the majority, and ideological, given that many in the GOP claim that anything their opponents want constitutes a fundamental threat to the country.While Democrats too have alsoveered toward the left, the party remains much more ideologically and politically diverse.

For decades, there has been a willingness to throw leaders overboard rather than providing them with the leeway congressional leaders have historically needed to govern.The trend started as a Republican strategy against Democrats.

CNN_Clean_2023_result_792,ai,"These trials also have an impact on the careers of those in law and order, even if in different ways given that none of them is accused of being engaged in wrongdoing.For starters, James is emerging as one of the most interesting Democrats in New York politics and could receive a boost in her own public standing as a result. Should James be the person who can puncture one of the things Trump loves most - his wealth and claims about his economic prowess - and at the same time damage the partisan shield that has seemingly protected him from accountability, she will undoubtedly become an even bigger player on the national stage.And she's not alone.Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willisis on her way to becoming a household name as she pursues Trump over alleged election interference, as isAlvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorneywho is prosecuting Trump over hush money payments. (Trump has denied all wrongdoing in these cases as well as the federal indictments over alleged mishandling of classified documents and election interference on January 6, 2021. )Just as ironically, the political player who has the most to gain from the spotlight staying laser-focused on Trump is President Joe Biden.Biden, who has struggled in the polls, would retain considerable advantages if he faces a rematch against Trump in the general election. As Biden demonstrated in the 2020 election, he knows how to craft a campaign around the themes of integrity, normality, stability and a commitment to governance. The contrast with Trumpian chaos and disregard for guardrails was striking and remains so.Though Biden faces many challenges in the months ahead regardless of his opponent, the baggage that the former president will be bringing with him, amplified and clarified by these cases, will likely strengthen Biden's case before the electorate.All of which creates a paradoxical political dynamic as political and legal adversaries end up finding advantage from common events in very different ways.This tension is already being seized on by Trump attorney Alina Habba. In her opening statement on Monday, Habba attacked James for saying, in the prosecutor's own campaign for attorney general, that she was going to ""get Trump"" as evidence of this being a partisan exercise.Judge Arthur Engoron pointed out that he'd already found that Trump hadgrossly inflated his asset statements, as James had alleged, before the trial began. That suggests James is on solid ground in pursuing her case.Engoron addedthat the ruling was affirmed by a New York appellate court, ""So Ms. James' motivations are no longer at issue in this case, are they? ""Since the fraud trial is being held without a jury - asEngoron explained Monday, neither side asked for one - Habba's attack on James' motivations is likely to be of no help to Trump in the fraud suit. But in trials with a jury, similar attacks could have more impact. And Habba's words still might resonate in the court of public opinion.Biden has taken a different approach to the interconnected political relationship presented by these legal matters. He has been extraordinarily careful to stay free from the investigations against Trump and to allow the process to play out on its own - including with aTrump appointee heading the inquiryinto his son Hunter. But he continually faces the danger of saying something that would be fodder for Trump's unproven allegations that this is all a political hit job.The judges in these cases have also wrestled with this issue, weighing imposing some form ofgag order on a former presidentwho loves to threaten and intimidate, but without infringing on the speech rights of a political candidate.The prosecuting teams, meanwhile, will contend with the elevated status that comes from high-profile cases. They will have to navigate the attention that is impossible to avoid - and is no doubt sometimes desired - with the need to protect public perceptions that the case, and they themselves as agents of the law, are legitimate. In a world filled with conspiracy theories and disinformation, this won't be easy.To be sure, there is ample precedent for this dynamic. There's no doubt thatUS Attorney General Merrick Garland's rolein the Oklahoma City bombing case -heoversaw the prosecutionof Timothy McVeigh - elevated him in the pool of judicial, and eventually, White House nominees.Further back, during the Watergate investigation, some of the senators involved in the panel looking into the matter, such asSen. Sam Ervinof North Carolina, also saw their national stature elevated as a result of their role. Ervin was transformed from one of the old conservative Dixiecrats into a constitutionalist and institutionalist who defended the integrality of Congress.Leon Jaworskiemerged as the embodiment of the dutiful prosecutor, guided by law seeking justice.Others, however, found infamy. In the late 1990s, for instance, independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who led the investigations into President Bill Clinton that culminated in impeachment, found his career greatly diminished by perceptions that he wasa partisan hack.Those who are seeking Trump be held accountable thus need to be extremely cautious. After all, Trump's main response to trouble has never been to get people to like him. Instead, he tries to get Americans to distrust and dislike the other person just as much. And this will remain his major strategy as the legal proceedings unfold. He will do so with the trials, sowing doubt as to whether any of this is legitimate. No doubt he might play onracial and ethnic prejudice, as he has done before.Trump's trials are unprecedented. We have not had a former president and party front-runner in this kind of legal jeopardy before. But we do know that Trump isn't the only one whose future is likely to be affected by his legal cases and their outcomes. Indeed, just as he did with American electoral politics, Trump is now dragging down the entire legal system into his chaotic world.Opinion by Julian ZelizerTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company."
CNN_Clean_2023_result_356,ai,"Yet, judging from the barrage of news about it, many of us are hoping that Cattrall's return as Samantha Jones brings some magic that the new series has lacked. Because, to be perfectly honest, the Samantha character - always lusty and libidinous - helped put the ""sex"" into ""Sex and the City. ""But considering that Cattrall's cameo is to be so glancing, I'm curious why so many fans of the show seem to be so deeply invested in her return.The irony about tension among the cast members is that the entire subtext of the show is the kind of bonding that women are capable of. Any woman who has found herself caught uncomfortably between two estranged friends - and who perhaps hopes to play peacemaker between them - understands how profoundly sad this falling out is, on or off the screen.Much more than the prurient fascination about who was sleeping with whom, what captivated so many of us with ""Sex and the City,"" episode after episode, were the enduring entanglements among the foursome of lead characters.Yes, ""Sex and the City"" is about romantic intimacy, but it's also about the centrality in women's lives of female friendship, the importance of platonic female love and the deep sense of loss and longing we all have felt some time or the other, when those connections slip out of our lives.Even as the show initiated conversations about sexual identities and the complex world of female friendships, it was criticized for the ways in which it failed to portray LGBTQ+ characters and people of color. ""And Just Like That,"" which has received its fair share of well-deservedcriticismon the artistic merits, succeeds somewhat in rectifying that lack of diversity.Of course, the sex part of the show was always front and center - even among and between the women characters. Female sexuality is an unbelievably rich tapestry woven with the threads of friendship in the complex and intricate dynamic of long-term female friendship.During one scene in the original series, for example, Carrie accidentally walks in mid-encounter on Samantha and the UPS delivery guy, and a vigorous conversation about sex and judgment ensues. After some embarrassing conversation and some awkward conflict, Carrie comes to understand Samantha in a deeper way, recognizing her as a whole person who struggles with sexual identity from time to time.Samantha comes to realize how much she actually does care what Carrie thinks and feels about her sexual world. In the sequel, a more extreme version of this plays out when Miranda and herlover, non-binary comedian Che Diaz, become passionately intimate in Carrie's kitchen.How we relate to - and accept - our female friends' sexual desires and their changing sexual appetites leads us to the recognition that in order to maintain long-term female friendship, we must accept our friends as complicated sexual creatures in ways that can challenge our perceptions of our own relationship to sex.In this regard, ""And Just Like That"" certainly has had its challenging moments. Miranda's maturing sexuality, as captured in her romantic relationship with Che, and the awkward scenes that follow with Carrie, took this to the next level - far beyond the oldSamantha-tries-on-lesbianism-for-a-whilestoryline from the original series.Even in these plot lines which didn't entirely succeed on a dramatic level, both the original series and the spin-off remind us that women have the emotional leeway to talk about intimacy with each other in greater depth and in ways that are often deeply connected to the body. I am reminded of a scene from the original SATC series, in an episode where Samantha, with a stiff drink in hand, dutifully helps Carrie dislodge her stuck diaphragm.Our friendships endure over time, even when one friend or the other goes away - and sometimes even when one of the gang isn't speaking to the others."

This debacle epitomizes weak and indecisive leadership, emboldening our adversaries and contributing to global instability.The conflicts in Ukraine and Israel, alongside increased tensions in the Middle East, reflect a perceived lack of American resolve.

But in 2015the ICC stepped in to decidethat implicitly it is,by accepting it-without consulting the Assembly of States Parties (ASP), representing ICC member states.Moreover, the ICC can only take on cases that have occurred on the territory of member states - but Palestine, even if it exists, does not have recognized territory. So again, the ICC judges, in a majority but not unanimous vote, decided in 2021 that Palestinecomprised the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem(the last of which has been annexed by Israel).That reflects the fairly randomceasefire lines of 1949that ended the war that accompanied Israel's own declaration of independence. The West Bank and East Jerusalem are the areas of British Mandate Palestine seized in that war by Jordan, while Gaza was seized by Egypt - but neither country now lays any claim to them.Israelis and Palestinians cannot themselves agree. Many Israeliswant no part of annexing the West Bank whole, fearing for the Jewish majority in their country. Hamas, meanwhile, has little interest in these borders,claiming all of Israel for the Palestinians. An ICC indictment would mean that the court has ruled meaningfully on borders.Then there's proving the chargesLastly, there is the question of the charges. To justify any war crimes charge against Israel's leaders, the court would have to deem Israel's actions to be disproportionate to what was needed in response to the Hamas attacks on October 7.No matter how the court spins this, for instance if it were to claim it was only looking at a particular crime and not the aggregate, this will be perceived by its many critics as being subjective (in addition to selective).And there will be no escaping factoring in Hamas' manifest policy of using the population of Gaza as ahuman shield. Even though the media has hardly mentioned this, established war crimes jurisprudence makes clear that civilian sites lose their protected status if they are in effectturned into military sites. (As journalists have lacked access to active war zones in Gaza, it is difficult to assess how actively Hamas is using civilians as human shields, but the terrorist group is known to embed itself in population centers and has been widely accused of making use of hospitals and schools."
FinancialPost_Clean_2023_result_120,ai,"In the ongoing debate over the soaring food prices(https://financialpost.com/tag/food-prices/) in Canada, it's tempting to lay the blame at the feet of the most visible players - the grocery stores, suppliers, farmers and fishers. However, as someone deeply entrenched in the food industry, both as a supplier and distributor and a food brand owner, I can tell you that the situation is far more complex than it appears.Let's set the record straight. Canadian grocery stores are not solely responsible for these high food prices, nor are suppliers, farmers, or others in the supply chain(https://financialpost.com/tag/supply-chain/). In fact, it has been an uphill battle for those of us on the supply side to even consider passing increases through to consumers. Our grocery partners have fought hard against such price hikes, with a consistent message that they do not want to burden consumers with higher costs. This sentiment resonates with us because we too are consumers, and we have our own families to feed and employees to support. It's not just about business; it's about survival.So, who's to blame for the current state of affairs? To put it simply: war, energy prices and weather.Firstly, Russia's invasion of a crucial global breadbasket had a massive impact. The Black Sea's closure, although now reopened through the Black Sea Grain Initiative, led to a substantial reduction in global wheat and corn supplies, a 1.5 per cent decrease that can alone raise cereal prices by 10 per cent within a year.Secondly, rising energy prices(https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-gas/oil-surges-10-month-high-brent-tops-95-barrel) have rippled through the supply chain, affecting fuel and fertilizer costs. Fertilizer prices have doubled since the pre-pandemic era, adding yet another layer of pressure to the agriculture sector.One often overlooked contributor to these high prices is the positive aspect of higher labour costs. While it does contribute to overall expenses, it also means that workers throughout the supply chain are earning more - a sign of progress in worker well-being.Weather, specifically La Niña, has played a significant role in the dramatic surge in food costs as well. Predictions suggest that La Niña will persist for a third straight year. The last time we experienced such a prolonged La Niña period was in 1973-1976, which coincided with a global food crisis. It happened again in 1998-2001.While there may be other contributing factors to the global food price crisis, it's unfair to single out retailers or suppliers as the sole culprits. Instead of pointing fingers, let's address these complex challenges together as a nation. Blaming individuals or businesses for political gain only distracts from the real issues at hand."

Bush-era housing bubble. In January 2006, housing prices were 6.82 times greater than the median household income.LIVING CLOSE TO MOM IS A MAJOR CONSIDERATION FOR AMERICANS BUYING A HOMEThe high housing costs witnessed under the Biden administration are a remarkable departure from historical norms. From 1978 through the end of 2001, housing prices were between four and five times greater than annual household incomes. Housing prices soared in the early 2000s, but they did not reach current levels at any point during Bush's presidency. Then they crashed hard from 2006 to 2009, triggering the Great Recession.Home buying has run into several problems - especially those that are the result of President Joe Biden's leftist policies. (iStock)Throughout Barack Obama and Donald Trump's presidencies, housing prices were significantly lower than they are now. Prices were typically five to six times higher than the average household income. Economic growth occurred during long periods of both Obama and Trump's terms, but prices did not come close to matching the numbers we've seen since the Biden administration took over.Since March 2022, the ratio of home prices to median household income has continuously stayed above seven, meaning housing prices have been at least seven times greater than household income for most of Biden's presidency. Even worse, the most recent data shows prices appear to be on track to become eight times higher than household income before Biden's first term ends.These troubling figures only tell part of the story, however."

Violators can be punished by a prison sentence of up to 15 years.This law represents a powerful example of how lawmaking in a democracy is supposed to work. The American people, recognizing a pressing public safety problem, prevailed upon our elected legislators to pass a meaningful protective measure. Yet in the Rahimi case, the Supreme Court will soon tell us if we were actually wrong all along to think we had such power.It will do so because under its 2022 ruling in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, the court announced that it - and not the people's chosen lawmakers - would have the final say on gun safety measures. Rather than letting the people and our legislatures weigh the tradeoffs between public safety and gun ownership for ourselves, the court declared that henceforth, five justices could strike down any law they deem insufficiently compatible with ""this nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.""

It took a few years, but federal agencies are finally sounding the alarm on the devastation the pandemic had on our kids. Addressing the learning loss requires a comprehensive and holistic approach that involves parents, teachers, schools and communities working together.The biggest thing we can do as parents is to get more involved with our children's learning and daily lives, whether it is sitting and doing homework together or choosing a school that is right for your child. As parents, it is our job to check in with our children and ensure they are getting the support they need.When parents can choose a school for their child, they become more invested in their child's education. This engagement can lead to improved student outcomes and a more supportive learning environment.PREPARING YOUR TEEN FOR COLLEGE AND LIFE IN A DORM: AVOID OVER-PACKINGIn traditional public school systems where there's no choice, families are often limited to a single neighborhood school. School choice breaks down this geographical barrier and provides more individualized options, reducing the monopoly of one school over a student's education.School choice also allows parentsand students to choose an educational institution that aligns with their values, learning styles and academic goals. This can lead to a more personalized and effective learning experience.While school choice is not an option for everyone, educators everywhere should consider extending school days and offer weekend classes or summer programs to make up for lost instructional time. If they don't, parents should seek out these resources for their kids.It is also crucial to ensure our kids' physical well-being by encouraging healthy eating habits, physical activity, limited time on electronics, and getting quality sleep, as these factors can impact learning.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONRemember that addressing learning loss will be an ongoing effort that requires patience, flexibility and a willingness to adapt to changing circumstances.

While it is natural to want the best for our kids, parents should temper expectations and focus on fostering a sense of intrinsic motivation that will provide lasting effects beyond a single semester.The answer is not to lower our expectations of kids, but students need to know that their worth is not solely determined by their academic performance. As parents, we need to make sure they understand their unique talents, passions and contributions to the community are equally as important to academics, if not more so.

None of this critical information was available to border officials at the time of the encounters; it wasn't until later that the FBI put the pieces together and activated field agents all around the nation to locate these illegal immigrants.These are three stories that ultimately went well for the country - at least in the result. No one knows, though, what these men might have been planning or doing in the interim between their entry into the United States and their later arrests.In the case of the immigrants connected to the ISIS terrorist, some of those individuals may still be outstanding. All these arrests are proof that the system is not working as intended.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONWe must note, too, that these are just three stories that we know about. The historic chaos and lawlessness of Biden's border means that there are certainly many more cases of suspected terrorists and other illegal aliens with bad intentions or criminal backgrounds, who were allowed to go free into the heartland of the country after being apprehended by border agents - or who were never caught in the first place.Make no mistake: these three examples are the tip of the iceberg, with the exact size of the submerged mass very much undetectable.These are three stories that ultimately went well for the country - at least in the result."
CNN_Clean_2024_result_177,ai,"But the film still gets energy and mileage from the sense that just showing queer people driving and living and being horny in Florida is a bit of rainbow glitter thrown into the law's toothy smirk.Free-spirited Jamie and buttoned-up Marian engage in some loitering, some extortion, some lewd use of stolen property and maybe some public indecency as they dodge thugs and back-talk the law. The real heist, though, is stealing pleasure - in each other, in the senator's misappropriated goods, in a passing women's soccer team - from a state and a world that wants them to disappear.This isn't the first lesbian heist film to kick the patriarchal homophobic law in its upright moralism and scurry away with the cash. The Wachowski sisters ""Bound"" (1996), John McNaughton's ""Wild Things"" (1998) - also set in Florida - and the less-openly-LGBTQ-but-still-pretty-obviously-LGBTQ ""Ocean's 8"" (2018) are all predecessors. ""Drive-Away Dolls"" is, though, the breeziest of these, rolling into Florida onscreen with the windows down even as the cops, governors and senators in the real world glower more and more ominously.Heist films can end in a grim bloodbath, like Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992), but many of them are (like the Ocean films) more cheerful celebrations of a world in which you can game the system and win. Coen's and Cooke's film is one of the purest expressions of heist-as-utopia in the genre. The exhilaration of the heist film is that the rules no longer apply; it offers an anarchic release, in which those who refuse to live by the law are rewarded with all the money. The money is nice in ""Drive-Away Dolls"" too, but it's off to the side of the real promise, which is queer expression, queer community, queer love and queer lust without a judge or congressional delegation ruling you guilty.The heart of the film is a mostly dialogue-less flashback to Marian's youth. In the present day, Marian is less adventurous and less sex-driven than Jamie. But younger Marian was obsessed with her nude, sun-bathing neighbor, and drilled a hole in the fence to watch her.The scene is reminiscent of Norman spying on Marion in Hitchcock's classic ""Psycho"" (1960) - a viciously transphobic film about a heist gone awry in which everyone involved is punished, by both karma and the gendarmes. But there is no punishment for Marian (who may well be named for her Hitchcockian predecessor). She looks, and is, happy, and nothing happens to her except that she grows up and gets away with more."
CNN_Clean_2023_result_199,ai,"No matter how angry he may be about what he views as President Joe Biden's ""open borders"" policy, DeSantis cannot lawfully take immigration matters into his own hands.Legal issues aside, the governor's ideas really don't make sense in a state where the Migration Policy Instituteestimatesone in five residents is an immigrant,including772,000 who are undocumented.Because Florida's proposed immigration measures are written so broadly, all kinds of everyday activities could become a crime for people living there. This wouldinclude citizens and legal residents, like a pastor who gives an undocumented immigrant a ride to church, a landlord who rents to a family with an undocumented member, or a person who hires an undocumented caregiver for their elderly parents. The measures would also force state and local law enforcement officers to act as immigration agents, diverting time and resources away from serious offenses.The provision of the proposed law involving hospitals is especially problematic. If Florida hospitals begin asking patients' immigration status, it will lead to undocumented people avoiding medical treatment for themselves or for their children. Research shows that even lawfully present immigrantsavoid accessing health caredue to language barriers, confusion, or fear, and these fears are heightened when immigrants are undocumented. You don't have to be a medical expert to recognize that Florida's plan could result in serious emergencies, needless suffering and the possibility of a broader public health crisis.It's no wonder that the DeSantis plan is generating pushback among some Floridians. Religious leadersare concernedthat the proposalscould hindertheir outreach efforts in immigrant communities.Some conservativesview these immigration measures as a potential intrusion by big government, whileLatino advocacy groupssee them as an invitation to racial profiling by law enforcement.True, DeSantis is rightly concerned about illegal immigration and its impact on Florida. But unauthorized border crossings have been trending downward, with US Customs and Border Protection reporting that last month's numbers were lower than in March 2022 or March 2021."

FinancialPost_Clean_2024_result_23,ai,"(We don't have complete numbers for 2023, but a forecast using the actual sales in the first three quarters plus an estimate for the fourth shows that battery EV sales were nine per cent of Canada-wide sales, 18 per cent in B.C. and 14 per cent in Quebec).In a new working paper(https://www.cdhowe.org/public-policy-research/time-reboot-federal-zev-mandate-requires-flexibility) for the C.D. Howe Institute, I develop a forecast of battery EV sales between now and 2035 using a bottom-up process that looks at the situation of each significant Canadian seller. I examine each supplier's production and sales plans, make a risk-based projection and then sum the projections. My estimate is that 860,000 battery EVs are likely to be sold in Canada in 2035 - which is 640,000 less than my assumed forecast sales of 1.5 million in 2035. Sales in future years may well be higher due to population growth - for example, sales in 2023 are estimated to have been over 1.6 million. If these higher sales do occur, it means an even larger shortfall of battery EVs.If this estimate is right and production does undershoot desired sales by more than 40 per cent, that will cause serious disruption in the market. To keep their EV sales at the mandated percentage of total sales, sellers may have to cut back on sales of gas vehicles (until 2035, when they will be required to cease gas sales altogether). If the overall demand for light vehicles does exceed overall supply, possibly by a lot, several undesirable things may occur - importation of slightly used vehicles, longer use of existing gasoline vehicles and an increase in vehicle prices, to name three.The obvious question is: what is Plan B if the mandate's rigid objectives can't be met? Perfect, 100 per cent compliance is a laudable goal, but the world is seldom perfect. The federal government needs to be flexible.To that end, Ottawa should consider letting plug-in hybrids count as EVs."

FinancialPost_Clean_2024_result_5,ai,"Like all other organizations, pension funds should win bids to operate companies they'd like to control based on their management skills, not their tax-exempt status.And there's a further misallocation: once a company is no longer paying tax on its operations, it has a competitive advantage - a completely artificial one - against companies that are taxable who are trying to compete with it in whatever line of business it's in. If you have the privilege of not paying tax, it's no surprise you'll do well against competitors that do.Our other major concern is that removing the 30 per cent rule would cost governments substantial revenues. From 2011 to 2022, pension assets (including CPP and QPP's) grew by 80 per cent, reaching $2.9 trillion. Non-publicly traded assets - private equity and bonds, real estate and infrastructure - now account for 35 per cent of this total. With no limits on tax arbitrage by tax-exempt companies, federal and provincial governments could lose $3.5 billion in tax revenues for each trillion dollars in assets held by pension funds.If the 30 per cent rule were eliminated, the federal and provincial governments would need to find other ways to limit tax arbitrage by pension plans. They could impose the new interest limitation rule for private companies on subsidiaries controlled by pension plans. Net interest expense in excess of 30 per cent of earnings before the deduction of depreciation, interest and taxes would not be deductible. That would help but wouldn't prevent pension plans from exploiting trust arrangements with the companies they operate.Another option would be to tax the earnings of controlled subsidiaries held by pension plans and other tax-exempt entities (e.g., charities such as university endowment funds)."

Ignored, this will be an issue that haunts the nation for decades with higher rates of addiction, fractured family lives and other health and social ills.Good for U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy for calling attention to the psychological turmoil of our youth. Even before the pandemic, Murthy notes in an advisory issued this week, there were clear signs of diminished mental health among young people. From 2009 to 2019, the proportion of high school students reporting persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness increased by 40%, and reporting suicidal thoughts by nearly as much. In just four years ᅳ from 2011 to 2015 ᅳ youth psychiatric visits to emergency rooms for depression, anxiety and behavioral issues increased by 28%.The pandemic worsened things considerably, Murthy said. In the United States, suicide attempts by girls increased by 51% this year, as compared to the same period just two years before. It's a global problem; a study of young people worldwide, published this year in JAMA Pediatrics, found that symptoms of depression and anxiety have doubled under the pandemic. The problem is especially acute among Black, Latino and low-income students, whose communities were under extra stress during the pandemic. Their parents were more likely to be essential workers who were at higher risk of catching COVID-19 on the job. There was more infection and serious illness and death in their neighborhoods.It's not that California or the federal government ignored this. The schools are awash in money to provide more mental health services to students, but the counselors simply aren't available for hire. Even families who can afford paying for private mental health services are finding that therapists are booked. This is the result of the state failing to build a robust, well-organized mental health infrastructure for kids, who generally need therapies geared to their developmental stage in life.Murthy provides a long list of remedies for parents, schools, governments, and the media."

Program directors (often volunteers) frequently lack training, resources or interest in radio strategies. Radio in general depends on a positive public association with its station, even though the average listener tunes in fewer than 10 minutes at a time on any station. One poorly delivered moment on radio can lose a listener for life. At the same time, community radio is where you will find the most inspiring and expressive programming. With free speech also come personality, adventure and authenticity, which are unique to its medium. My opposite personal experience with many public radio stations often exposed an environment of fear and control due to finances and invasive oversight. One swear word on daytime radio can result in an FCC fine that can threaten a station's future (and it only takes one complaint to investigate). Community radio is far less likely to have listener scrutiny for the occasional swear word, with fewer listeners and more audience affinity for free speech. Even so, community broadcasters are cautious with cussing, and community radio doesn't have much money to take away! With all its challenges and opportunities, the future of community radio is bright. As commercial radio, social media and public radio become increasingly rigid, with dehumanizing algorithms, our neighbors and culture are accessible on the dial through community radio.

He helped Bill Clinton win his two election campaigns and fought for Hillary Clinton in 2008 to no electoral avail. President Clinton had made him vice chairman of a State Department advisory committee, and he was an executive of a PR firm dealing with Russians.The FBI is a puzzle in all of this.Even though it seems increasingly clear that the dossier's propagandistic rumors and ludicrous sensationalism played a part in the Robert Mueller spectacle, the FBI says there was other evidence.The investigators, who never mentioned the dossier and never explored the Clinton connection, concluded there was insufficient evidence to assume Trump had conspired with Russians in crimes they did commit, although with minor, if any, effect on the election. The investigation listed instances of Trump at least considering using his powers to stop the investigation, but this is not ipso facto obstruction of justice if his intent was to end proceedings he considered a phony smear.Durham portrays the FBI as mostly being duped while others argue its leadership was partisan.

As of last month, half of the countries covered by Covax were using less than 75% of their existing vaccine supply; presumably, they'd also have trouble absorbing new shipments.Although the hurdles to converting vaccines into vaccinations in such places are complex, wealthier countries can help. Greater transparency and predictability about vaccine deliveries would allow local governments more time to prepare for inoculation campaigns. Funding, technology and transportation are needed to set up reliable, low-temperature supply chains to preserve vaccines and distribute them deep into rural areas. Through partnerships developed in the fight against HIV/AIDS and other diseases, the U.S. in particular can help train and pay the armies of vaccinators needed to put shots into arms. Countries will need technical assistance to track initial shots, make second appointments, and monitor and quickly investigate any adverse reactions.Combined, those efforts should help developing nations reduce friction and reach those willing to be inoculated. The more difficult task, as rich countries have themselves found, is overcoming deep-seated suspicion of COVID-19 vaccines.That effort needs to be intensely local. Wherever possible, authorities should work with community groups, particularly churches and women's organizations, to assuage doubts about the vaccines' safety. Public campaigns should be tailored to local conditions and delivered on the platforms, particularly social media and messaging services, where disinformation is most rife."

On paper, the initiative is already a success: Nearly $30 billion in subsidies and $25 billion in loans have been awarded, supporting investments of roughly $350 billion. One industry-sponsored study expects U.S. chipmaking capacity to triple by 2032, with output of advanced logic chips rising from zero in 2022 to 28% of global production.To build and run those fabs, however, companies need workers the U.S. doesn't have. Shortages of skilled installers of hyper-precise chipmaking equipment have already delayed projects. The number of Americans studying in relevant graduate programs has been flat for 30 years. A third of current fab workers are 55 and older, and more than half say they're eager to quit. The Semiconductor Industry Association says chipmakers will face a shortfall of 67,000 skilled workers by 2030.Congress needs to weigh the consequences. Companies that can't scale up will demand additional subsidies or shift production to Taiwan and Japan. As domestic production struggles, the problem might get worse, as American STEM graduates seek work in other fields. The hoped-for benefits ᅳ U.S. technological leadership and enhanced national security ᅳ will come to nothing.The Chips Act anticipated this difficulty. It includes a $200 million training and education fund, and it requires companies to prioritize workforce development.

From hiking and camping to fishing and birdwatching, these outdoor spaces offer a pause from the hustle and bustle of daily life and a chance to connect with nature.I'm a champion for Virginia's outdoors and there are many reasons why you should be, too. In 2021, outdoor recreation contributed $9.4 billion to the commonwealth's economy and supported 107,000 jobs according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. These are big numbers, proving our natural resources are a crucial part of our state's economy. Tourism is one of Virginia's largest industries, and much of that tourism is driven by our state's natural beauty. People come from all over the world to hike our trails, fish our rivers, travel in their RVs, and enjoy our beaches. By protecting our natural resources, we're also protecting our economy and the jobs that depend on it.But the importance of Virginia's outdoors goes beyond just economics; it is simply the right thing to do. Our natural resources are part of our state's heritage and identity and make Virginia such a special place to live, work and visit. By working to protect our natural resources, we're preserving a legacy for future generations. We're ensuring that our children and grandchildren will be able to enjoy the same natural beauty that we do today.Finally, natural resources are essential for our physical and mental well-being. Study after study has shown that spending time in nature is good for our health. It reduces stress, boosts our immune systems and even improves our cognitive function. In a world where we spend so much time indoors and in front of screens, our state's outdoors provide a much-needed escape and a chance to recharge.The recent formation of the Our Virginia Outdoors coalition is a positive step towards protecting and promoting these invaluable resources. Results of the 2017 Virginia Outdoors Demand Survey found that 70% of Virginians support public spending to prevent the loss of natural areas and open spaces. By bringing together conservationists, outdoor enthusiasts, and business leaders and other diverse stakeholders the coalition is working to ensure that Virginia's outdoors remain healthy and accessible for generations to come. We're building support for the recommendations found in the Virginia Outdoors Plan, the state's comprehensive plan for land conservation, outdoor recreation and open-space planning.So whether you're an avid biker, fisher, runner, kayaker, hunter, a nature lover or just someone who cares about the future of our state, there are many ways you can get involved."

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) then allocates resources and writes regulations for housing authorities. Over the years, the costs of keeping public housing in good repair have continually outpaced funding.Those are the parameters LMHA must budget and plan with each year for our public housing and mixed-income communities, our voucher program, and the special programs we offer residents for financial empowerment and more. This process is guided by me - the Executive Director - in collaboration with our Board of Commissioners.Despite the funding situation, I have hope that we can make positive things happen. To do that I will work closely with our residents, our Board, and our partners to lead LMHA in a new direction - one where all our residents feel pride in their homes, our staff is excited to come to work, and where the entire city of Louisville cheers us all on.This is going to take time, energy, and a multitude of resources, but there are immediate steps we can take to deliver short-term solutions, while building strategies for long-term success.Our first focus is on resident engagement and services. We have to rebuild a regular communication process so that our residents feel heard, have confidence that we're being responsive to their needs and are aware of the work LMHA is doing.Second, LMHA must bolster safety and security at our properties. We are taking a holistic approach to community safety and resident service needs by partnering across city agencies. We've also improved our relationship with the police department and are investing in critical upgrades to secure entrancesand restore order. Our goal is to instill a sense of safety and security rather than chaos, which every person deserves in the place they call home.Third, we must stabilize the physical conditions of our properties. This is LMHA's most basic responsibility as a landlord, and it is unacceptable that conditions have deteriorated at Dosker Manor, Avenue Plaza and Parkway Place. We will do better by fully staffing maintenance, property management and security. We will also address deficiencies more quickly and work to clean up and invest in properties to restore a sense of pride in the community.And, finally, we are planning now for the future."

(Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images/TNS)Joe Biden is toast, and with the media now sharply focused on his medical condition, the best scenario for Democrats is that the president resigns and turns the Oval Office keys over to Kamala Harris.The debate over Biden's future has changed its tone and turned more urgent amid new reports that a neurologist specializing in Parkinson's visited the White House eight times over an eight month period. Reporters also testily sparred with White House officials on Monday over complaints that they're not being candid with the media about the president's health.The discussions have shifted from concerns over Biden's cognitive abilities to a possible medical emergency. It's not just an elderly guy in decline any more.Democrats need an exit strategy to get Biden out of the way and avoid a costly defeat to Donald Trump.It's so bad that Biden has lost Michael Moore, Stephen King and Rob Reiner. When you've lost them, you know it's over.Democratic prognosticator Nate Silver even said that the Democratic president can't continue, after watching his stammering interview with ABC's left wing George Stephanopolous.Biden though has reportedly closed his inner circle of advisers to just a few aides and family and is angrily refusing to step aside. So he needs cover to get out.Is the party and nation going to be held hostage by Hunter and Jill Biden? Surely party elders will not let that happen.The reports about the neurologist visits - which the White House press office refused to confirm even though it came from the visitor logs - give Biden an opportunity to bow out of the race or resign with dignity citing a serious medical condition.That scenario also gives a chance for Democrats to avoid a protracted and divisive debate over whether Biden should hang on or quit, and abandon these crazy plans for a “blitz primary” to determine a nominee. With the president out, he can turn over his delegates and millions in campaign cash to his vice president.Biden can continue to say he's a fighter and wants to beat Trump all he wants, but for the good of the nation and party he must resign."

The court needs to understand that its vast power is not without limits. If it does not voluntarily pull back from the brink, then the other branches of government and the people themselves must step in to restore the balance.The potential dismantling of democracy is an existential concern that we must all address.

Regardless of our political leanings, every American who cares about the future of our republic must recognize the danger this shift represents. In their rush to impose a narrow and divisive vision upon the nation, the court's ideologues have upset the delicate balance of power our system depends on.They have chosen to ignore decades of legal precedent, dismissing the people's will and our elected representatives' role in shaping the country's laws. This court's practices are not just an attack on certain cherished rights, though those are also undoubtedly under threat. It is a threat to the very essence of our self-governance, to the idea that, in a democracy, it is the people who ultimately determine the nation's direction.We cannot afford to be complacent in the face of this threat. The court's actions demand a swift and decisive response from all of us. We must organize, mobilize and make our voices heard in the streets and at the ballot box. We must demand that our elected officials take action to check the court's power and defend the rights and principles that are under attack. This can be done through civic actions like contacting elected officials, participating in peaceful protests or voting in upcoming elections.This will not be an easy fight and will only be won over time.

However, as temperatures get warmer in the future, the scales will tilt toward rain, and thetotal amount of snowwill decrease.For communities, planning for water supplies and extreme weather gets more complicated in a rapidly changing climate. Planners can't count on the weather 30 years in the future being the same as weather today. It's changing too quickly.In many places, snow will not persist as late into spring. In regions like California and the Rockies that rely on the snowpack for water through the year, those supplies willbecome less reliable.Rain falling on snowpack can also speed up melting, trigger flooding and change the flows of creeks and rivers. This shows up in changingrunoff patterns in the Great Lakes, and it led toflooding on the East Coastin January 2024.For road planners, the rate of freeze-thaw cycles that can damage roads will increase during winters in many regions unaccustomed to such quick shifts.An especially interesting effect happens in the Great Lakes. Already, theGreat Lakes do not freeze as earlyor as completely as in the past. This has large effects on the famous lake-effect precipitation zones.With the lakes not frozen, more water evaporates into the atmosphere.

AI can, in fact, diagnose disease using new patterns too subtle for humans to identify. Consider, for example, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a rare genetic condition in which the heart's muscle has grown more than it should, leading to eventual heart failure and sometimes death. Experts estimate that only 20% of those affected are diagnosed, a process that requires consultation with a cardiologist, a heart ultrasound and often genetic testing. What, then, of the remaining 80%?Researchers across the country, including at the Mayo Clinic and UC San Francisco, have demonstrated that AI can detect complex, previously unrecognized patterns to identify patients likely to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, meaning AI-driven algorithms will be able to screen for the condition in routine EKGs.AI was able to recognize these patterns after examining the EKGs of many people with and without the disease. The rapid growth in health care data ᅳ including detailed electronic health records, imaging, genomic data, biometrics and behavioral data ᅳ combined with advancements in artificial intelligence technology has created a major opportunity. Because of its unique ability to identify patterns from the data, AI has helped radiologists to find hidden cancers, pathologists to characterize liver fibrosis and ophthalmologists to detect retinal disease.One challenge is that AI is expensive, requiring large-scale data to train computer algorithms and the technology to do so. As these resources become more ubiquitous, that can make the associated intellectual property difficult to protect, discouraging private investment in these products."

Our loyal pets may have fur, but they are not immune to the harsh realities of cold weather. Here are some key considerations to keep our furry friends safe and snug during the chilly months.First, shelter is paramount. Ensure that your pets have a warm and dry place to escape the cold. Whether it's a cozy bed indoors or a well-insulated outdoor shelter, providing a refuge from the biting wind and freezing temperatures is essential.Second, monitor outdoor activities. While some dogs love playing in the snow, prolonged exposure to extreme cold can be harmful. Limit outdoor time and be attentive to signs of discomfort, such as shivering or lifting their paws excessively. Consider investing in pet-friendly winter gear like coats or boots for added protection.Maintaining a proper diet is equally crucial during winter. Pets burn more calories in an effort to stay warm, so consult your veterinarian to ensure they are getting the nutrition they need. Additionally, ensure that your pet has access to unfrozen water at all times to prevent dehydration.Antifreeze is a common winter hazard that poses a severe threat to pets. Its sweet taste is attractive to them, but even a small amount can be fatal. Keep all antifreeze containers securely sealed and promptly clean up any spills to prevent accidental ingestion.Finally, be aware of the unique needs of different breeds. Short-haired or smaller dogs may require extra layers of protection against the cold, while certain breeds are better equipped to handle winter conditions. Tailor your care routine to your pet's individual needs.As responsible pet owners, it's our duty to ensure that our beloved companions remain healthy and happy throughout the year, even when temperatures drop."

This operation, commencing on Jan. 10, signifies a major escalation in the ongoing dispute between state and federal authorities regarding immigration policies and border control.Shelby Park in Eagle Pass, Texas, a known hotspot for migrant crossings, has emerged as the epicenter of this intensifying conflict. The intervention by the Texas and Florida state guards has effectively barred Border Patrol access to this area, starkly opposing the objectives of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the federal government.Remarkably, the National Guard's deployment seems to have drastically impacted migrant crossings. Reports suggest a plummet from around 13,000 daily crossings to merely a handful, highlighting the complex nature of border security and immigration enforcement.The recent alteration of the Title 42 border policy, initially a public health order during the COVID-19 pandemic enabling rapid migrant removal and blockade, is a key factor behind Texas's stance. The policy's termination has shifted from a 'catch and release' approach back into allowing migrants to seek asylum in the heartland of the United States. This change, reportedly accompanied by Border Patrol agents aiding in asylum efforts, marks a significant deviation from earlier practices and has heightened concerns among Texas officials and residents about potential increases in illegal border crossings and associated criminal activities, particularly those involving cartels.The White House has issued a stark warning in response, indicating, with the support of the Supreme Court, to allow board patrol to remove barbed fencing. This pronouncement suggests a possible rapid escalation in the conflict between the federal government and the state of Texas.This confrontation transcends mere border security concerns, reflecting deeper, long-standing issues between federal and state authorities over immigration policies and national security. The tension underlines the contentious nature of these issues across multiple administrations.Observers express concern that without a prompt and diplomatic resolution, this standoff could mark a critical turning point in federal-state relations, especially concerning immigration and border security, increasingly regarded as national security crises. Even to the extent that independent journalist are reporting on migrants crossing who are eluding that the American people “will soon know who we are”, and presumed to threaten the journalist.The revised policy, moving from expulsion to asylum assistance, has been a significant shift, provoking Texas to take a proactive role in border security, leading to the current impasse with federal authorities."

Finally, California doesn't consider emissions from digestate (manure after methane has been captured) that is applied to farm fields as fertilizer, thoughevidencesuggests digestate can emit more GHGs than undigested manure applications.Under California's LCFS, any biogas project around the country, including those in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Missouri, New York and otherstates, are eligible for credits if the captured methane enters into a North American natural gas pipeline.The expansion of CAFO biogas projects raises concerns for rural communities and our farm economy. Because these digester projects are so expensive and require so much manure, they are only practical for the largest CAFOs located close to natural gas pipelines. When the biggest operations generate revenue from dairy, beef or pork and from the methane gas from their manure, they have a major advantage over small and mid-sized operations in sectors where consolidation is already occurring. Minnesota and Wisconsin have lost thousands of dairies over the last decade as bigger CAFOs have flooded the market, with nearly 150 dairy permitslostin Minnesota in 2023.Rural communities are concerned about the growing role that fossil fuel companies play in farm operations. Food & Water Watch reported recently on the many ways oil giants, such as Chevron, BP and Shell, are investing in on-farmbiogasand associated pipelines running through rural communities.The climate benefits of CAFO biogas are questionable.

Just a few decades ago, AI was largely theoretical, existing primarily in the realms of science fiction and academic research. Today, AI permeates nearly every aspect of our lives, from the algorithms that curate social media feeds to the autonomous systems that drive cars. This rapid advancement, while promising in many respects, also heralds a new era of uncertainty and potential peril.The pace at which AI technology is evolving outstrips our ability to predict its trajectory. Breakthroughs occur at a staggering rate, often in areas previously deemed infeasible or far-off. For instance, the development of GPT-3, an AI language model capable of producing human-like text, astonished even seasoned AI researchers with its capabilities and the speed at which it surpassed its predecessors. Such rapid advancements suggest that the future of AI holds both immense potential and significant risks.One of the most pressing concerns is the increased likelihood of emergencies exacerbated by AI. More sophisticated AI could enable more complex and devastating cyberattacks, as malicious actors leverage AI to breach security systems that were previously impenetrable. Similarly, advances in AI-driven biotechnology could lead to the creation of more deadly bioweapons, posing new and unprecedented threats to global security. Moreover, the rapid automation of jobs could lead to widespread unemployment, causing significant social disruption. The displacement of workers by AI could further entrench economic inequality and trigger unrest, as societies struggle to adapt to these changes.The likelihood of an AI emergency paired with our poor track record of responding to similar emergencies is cause for concern. The COVID-19 pandemic starkly highlighted the inadequacies of our constitutional order in emergency responses. The pandemic exposed deep flaws in our preparedness and response mechanisms, demonstrating how ill-equipped we are to handle sudden, large-scale crises. Our fragmented political system, with its layers of bureaucracy and competing jurisdictions, proved unable to respond swiftly and effectively. This deficiency raises serious concerns about our ability to manage future emergencies, particularly those that could be precipitated by AI.Given the profound uncertainty surrounding when and how an AI accident might occur and the potential damage it could cause, it is imperative that AI companies bear a significant responsibility for helping us prepare for such eventualities. The private sector, which stands to benefit enormously from AI advancements, must also contribute to safeguarding society against the risks these technologies pose. One concrete step that AI companies should take is to establish an emergency fund specifically intended for responding to AI-related accidents.Such a fund would serve as a financial safety net, providing resources to mitigate the effects of AI emergencies. It could be used to support rapid response efforts, fund research into preventative measures, and assist individuals and communities affected by AI-driven disruptions. By contributing to this fund, AI companies would acknowledge their role in creating technologies that, while beneficial, also carry inherent risks. This approach would not only demonstrate corporate responsibility but also help ensure that society is better prepared to respond to AI-related crises.The establishment of an emergency fund for AI disasters would require a collaborative effort between the private sector and government. Congress could mandate contributions from AI companies based on their revenue or the scale of their AI operations. This would ensure that the financial burden of preparing for AI emergencies is shared equitably and that sufficient resources are available when needed. To safeguard the proper use of the funds, Congress should establish an independent entity tasked with securing contributions and responding to claims for reimbursement.In conclusion, the rapid advancement of AI presents both incredible opportunities and significant risks."

America's fate in the 20th century was sealed when the nation, torn between isolationism and interventionism, was swayed by the British to defend their cause.The declining British Empire recognized the need to reshape the political and cultural influence surrounding America's pride in its 1776 independence. It aimed to establish an Anglo-American presence on American soil, influencing the United States' foreign policy towards Europe. Consequently, Cecil Rhodes, an Oxford figurehead and English colonialist, founded the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford University. His intention was to recapture the minds of American statesmen and “reintegrate the USA as an integral part of the British Empire,” as outlined in his 1877 will. Rhodes bequeathed his wills and amassed fortunes to select members of his Rhodes Society, a group whose key members and objectives were chronicled by Dr. Carrol Quigley in 'The Anglo-American Establishment."

For my justice-impacted community, the toll of tobacco addiction is particularly devastating. Despite decades of valiant efforts to combat this scourge, smoking remains a leading cause of preventable death globally, with a disproportionate impact on marginalized populations like ours.In the United States, where the stark reality of tobacco's deadly consequences is well-documented, it's imperative that we adopt innovative solutions to reverse this trend. One such solution is nicotine e-cigarettes, a polarizing yet potentially game-changing tool in harm reduction and smoking cessation. By embracing this technology, we can harness its potential to transform the lives of millions of smokers, particularly in our justice-impacted community.The evidence is clear: e-cigarettes can help smokers quit or significantly reduce their tobacco use, thereby reducing the staggering burden of tobacco-related diseases. Healthcare providers and advocates must reassess their stance on e-cigarettes, acknowledging their role as a harm reduction strategy. E-cigarettes deliver nicotine without the harmful tar and combustion products of traditional cigarettes, offering a less harmful alternative for those unable to quit nicotine entirely. However, entrenched misconceptions among physicians and health professionals often lead to inconsistent patient counseling that contradicts existing evidence.It's time to shatter the myth that nicotine, without tobacco combustion, poses significant health risks. This pervasive misconception disproportionately affects justice-impacted communities of color, low-income households, and those with lower education levels. By perpetuating this falsehood, we're hindering the transition from combustible tobacco to e-cigarettes and exacerbating existing health disparities.The data is clear: misinformation about e-cigarettes versus traditional tobacco products is scaring smokers away from making the switch. Many mistakenly equate nicotine with tobacco smoke, fearing a similar risk profile. This is particularly devastating in justice-impacted communities already ravaged by tobacco-related health inequities.It's imperative that healthcare providers acknowledge the progress made in harm reduction strategies and incorporate e-cigarettes into smoking cessation toolkits. We can't afford to stick to an all-or-nothing approach that disregards potential benefits. Instead, U.S. public health agencies and medical societies must reassess their cautious stance on e-cigarettes. The staggering toll of tobacco-related diseases demands a nuanced approach that harnesses harm reduction strategies to reach all populations effectively.By embracing evidence-based solutions and debunking harmful myths, we can empower justice-impacted communities to break free from the grip of tobacco addiction and reclaim their health. It's time for a pragmatic approach that prioritizes progress over dogma, ensuring equal access to life-saving alternatives for all.To address disparities in smoking cessation outcomes, targeted education and awareness campaigns are essential. Healthcare providers must receive comprehensive training on the relative risks of e-cigarettes versus traditional tobacco products, enabling them to provide evidence-based guidance. Culturally sensitive outreach efforts are equally crucial to dispel myths and empower at-risk communities to make informed choices about their health.The integration of nicotine e-cigarettes into smoking cessation strategies represents a pivotal step toward reducing the burden of tobacco-related diseases. By challenging misconceptions and expanding access to harm reduction tools, healthcare providers and advocates can empower individuals to take control of their health."

Togetherall appeals to students as it is easily accessible, always available and free to join. “2.5 million students [are] able to access the platform, and CAPS gets thousands of new students that are joining every month,” Cox-Howard said. The sudden influx of students joining the online mental health community is likely due to the comfort in online anonymity and the ability to share sensitive information freely without worrying about personal identification or association. According to Cox-Howard, a striking “64% of students are sharing thoughts or feelings [on Togetherall] because it's anonymous.” Anonymity is simply more time efficient for students because it focuses on only providing the important information and avoiding any introductions or social interactions present in-person that may otherwise inflict on students' treatment processes. Pros and cons exist for both online and in-person treatment, and Cox-Howard believes that online treatment has strengthened enough to become as effective as the human presence of a therapist or community group because, “it's going to depend upon the person and their needs” and “we as clinicians have become more savvy as to how we can still interact with students.” As a senior student, I have experienced the UA before and after the pandemic, which brought significant online mental health opportunities to campus. In my experience, health professionals have built the skill set to sufficiently treat patients and handle their needs virtually.

The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. Starting this season, Rice's Marching Owl Band, longtime instigators of musical shenanigans at various Rice sporting events,will no longer play at basketball gamesᅳ a role the university intends to fill with the traditional-instruments-only, student-only, audition-only, near-perfect attendance-required Owl Pep Band. To the three of us, this is a slap in the face to everything the MOB, and indeed Rice, stand for. According to Rice Athletics, our removal and replacement is an improvement as Rice moves toa better conference, and they say a conventional band will attract and animate crowds to improve the home advantage our basketball teams enjoy at Tudor Fieldhouse. To us, this means the MOB, and the quirky side of Rice that we represent better than anything else, is unwelcome in Rice's cold, corporate public image as it seems to reject the “unconventional wisdom” it uses as a selling point. For decades, the MOB's incarnation as the Basketball Owl Band has performed at dozens of basketball games each season, lead crowd chants, and put on comedic half-time shows. If waving our cutouts of memes while wearing Aloha shirts can't attract the crowds Athletics is looking for, then a run-of-the-mill pep band, with no energy to give outside of their stand tunes, will fail. String and miscellaneous instruments obviously don't fit that insipid sameness of nearly every other basketball band that Athletics wants to copy. Violins are hardly even audible over percussion and wind instruments, so Athletics must think the mere sight of unexpected instruments risks frightening off attendees. But James, the MOB's accordionist, can readily affirm the opposite: He and fellow members of the Stringatronics section, like our cellist and ukulelist, bring a wow factor that nothing can come close to replicating."
newuniversity_california_irvine_opinion_2020_result_35,human,"Lou is one of the two ASUCI Sustainability Project and Gardencommissionersunder the Office of the Internal Vice President. Lou combines hands-on education, hard work and a lot of soil to fulfill this need to act sustainability in this time. In the past year, Lou has transformed theAnts in Your Plants Gardeninto a flourishing space in which students could learn how to garden and harvest produce. “Our garden acts as an educational tool for students interested in sustainable agriculture and developing self-sufficiency. We also help fight food insecurity by donating produce to theFRESH Basic Needs Hub,” Lou said. For Lou, acting sustainably is a balanced coupling of building essential skill sets and giving back to the community. Lou and his co-commissioner Joseph Nguyen also host events on campus such asZot-N-Clothesand theSustainability Fairin order to help provide resources and education about sustainability to students. From creating Garden Restoration Days to sharing with hisFacebook groupwhat he recently baked with ingredients from the garden, Lou brings together the surrounding student community through an activity that is close to his heart. Both Nguyen and Lou practice sustainability through different means that suit their talents and interests. However, there is a common thread that connects their views on sustainability today: Nguyen and Lou both acknowledge that the difficulty for young people to act sustainability is a cause of living in an aggressive consumer-society. When students are constantly forced to work to make their own ends meet, sustainability could be one of the last priorities. What Nguyen and Lou reveal through their involvements is that students must redefine living sustainably for themselves. Even in a broken and difficult system that demands so much of young people today, there are ways to combat environmental crises that do not involve placing oneself in an economic burden. “Living in an unhealthy throw-away society fueled by a capitalist burn-out culture and political corruption has made it a norm to carelessly dump people and objects when they no longer meet our needs and expectations,” Nguyen said. “Sustainability is about cultivating a world of kindness, empathy and love so that it becomes natural for us to respect our earth. So that it becomes impossible for us to ignore the impacts that our actions have on ourselves, others and inequity across the globe.” Being sustainable does not have to be separate from the other aspects of our lives. Our view of nature being the opposite of modern human life and technological advancement is constantly constructed by this capitalistic way of viewing the world. Nguyen and Lou are challenging these narratives by asserting that living one's normal life and being sustainable should be inextricably connected to each other. Many of us simply have not put enough thought to it yet. “Living sustainably, especially for busy college students, can be seen as a hassle [or] impediment to daily life. Living in a fast-paced, consumerist society where everything is given and done for us, it is challenging sometimes to just slow down and evaluate our own impact.” Lou said. Nguyen and Lou also reveal here that sustainability is about cultivating a mindset of care and mindfulness for the world that provides us life. Students must not allow the demanding expectations of institutions to desensitize them to processes that are affecting their lives and others in the present. Instead, they can focus on what they can do in their own power to practice a mode of sustainable living that works for them. Student-life sustainability should not be seen as an impediment to the flow of our busy lives but a way to enrich it. By practicing sustainability, one can improve their practice in mindfulness, relieve stress and engage in activities that are meaningful and life-giving to them, all while preserving the earth for future generations."
ubyssey_opinion_2020_result_19,human,"Between adjusting to online classes and exams during aliteral pandemic, a significant portion of students are dealing with immediate financial stresses likelast-minute moving,food insecurityand job losses. Many are battling worries and anxiety about saving up for the upcoming school year's tuition and fees. Some may even be dealing with the personal health effects of COVID-19. Yet, post-secondary students have been systemically left out of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), which provides those who lost their income because of COVID-19 $500 per week for 16 weeks, starting April 6. And many students would continue to be left hanging ᅳ even as the federal government expanded CERB to more groups, including seasonal workers and those who are still earning up to $1,000 per month, two weeks later. “If you are looking for a job but haven't stopped working because of COVID-19, you are not eligible for the Benefit,” reads the eligibility requirements on CERB'swebsite. “For example if you are a student who had a job last year and were planning on working this summer you do not qualify for the benefit.” Undoubtedly, this requirement fails to consider that many co-op or university programs hire students on contracts that usually end right around this time ᅳ meaning students did not lose their jobs due to the pandemic, but a contract expiry. Many students also rely on summer employment to help cover the costs of the school year. But we wouldn't be the first one to point out its severe limitations. UBC's Gender, Race, Sexuality and Social Justice Undergraduate Association createda petitiontwo weeks ago to push for student inclusion. Similarly, the#Don'tForgetStudents petitionhas attracted over 40,000 signatures since it was first posted in early April. More concretely, 83 per cent of respondents in asurveyconducted by the Undergraduates of Canadian Research-Intensive Universities ᅳ which represents student unions at research-focused universities in Canada, including the AMS ᅳ say they did not meet CERB's initial eligibility requirements. That's a hell of a lot of students falling through the cracks. Saying so, there's no denying that governments at different levels have been rolling out different student-specific support programs."

Vulnerability is scary: Opening up your insecurities to the greater scrutiny of more eyes feels shameful and thus impossibly difficult. These feelings can protect you from harm in uncertain social situations, but they can also isolate you.

You can be open, honest, and authentic around the people you trust without owing them an apology. If you absolutely feel that you have to say something, try gratitude: Instead of apologizing for yourself, thank your friend for their kindness and patience in listening. With that, a successful trauma dump ends, avoiding any awkwardness, uneasiness, or thoughtlessness. You have gained the benefits of trauma dumping without the harms associated with the typical process. If you want bonus points (and you're a Harvard student, so I'm sure you do), a final, final step is to be kind to yourself.

stanforddaily_opinion_2020_result_209,human,"On Tuesday, the dean of students emailed those currently living on campus to inform them of Stanford's summer housing plans. This was an announcement students were anxiously awaiting after much stalling from the administration, but it was also one that thoroughly disappoints. To start, the policy does not address the uniqueness of hardships students are facing under COVID-19. Stanford wants to charge the same fees for housing and food as it would any other summer. The standard rate for eight weeks of housing is $2,773, and the standard rate for 10 weeks is $3,455. This does not include the meal plan, which is typically priced at $1,900. In addition, there is an $800 to $900 summer-autumn interim housing fee. A conservative estimate of housing and boarding is hence $4,673 for eight weeks, $5,355  for 10 weeks and $6,155 for the entire summer. Usually, summer housing fees make sense because students can supplement them via research grants and internships or receive financial aid as they make up for a missed quarter. However, those who need summer housing this year do not fit into the typical mold. A plethora of reasons may leave students no choice but to shelter in place on campus."

ubyssey_opinion_2023_result_44,human,"Moreover, I was disgusted to learn about the ignorance and idleness of my own department, the history department, in their mishandling of PhD student Dmitry Mordvinov's allegedstring of assaultsin the early 2010s. However, instances of rape culture and campus gender-based violence aren't always private: such as the disturbingSauder 'rape chants' of 2013, to theplacement of a male signatop the Engineering Cairnthe day before the Ecole Polytechnique Massacre Memorial in 2016. These public displays of misogyny normalize and validate violence against women and non-binary people, viscerally reminding all of campus who is welcome and who is not. Everyone deserves to feel safe and sovereign in their bodies, regardless of how they dress or where they go. Normalizing sexualized violence and seeing nonconsensual sexual advances as inevitable and ordinary exacerbates rape culture at UBC. The anger I experienced as a first year witnessing this immense disregard for bodily autonomy and self-determination was reinforced when we were isolated by the COVID-19 pandemic in my second semester. As domestic and sexual violence rates climbedacross the countryandthe world, I resolved to find a community on campus where I could put this anger into action on campus. That is how I found the peer program at UBC'sSexual Violence Prevention and Response Office (SVPRO), a campus resource centre dedicated to combating sexual violence and supporting survivors. Here, I was able to educate myself on the intersections of sexual violence, rape culture and other systems of oppression in our society like racism, sexism and capitalism. By reading the incredible works of feminist, critical race and Queer theorists, such as bell hooks, Angela Davis and Audre Lorde, I have come to understand the personal as political. While narratives at neoliberal institutions like UBC encourage us to see sexual violence as an individual issue ᅳ one that can be solved through lifestyle changes like carrying pepper spray,drink-checking nail polishand whistles ᅳ feminism teaches us to contextualize social issues by understanding them as part of larger social system. The history of recorded North American anti-violence work started with thefights of the feminist activists in the 1970s and 1980sagainst systemic misogyny and normalized rape culture. Against a backdrop of increasing cutbacks to social services as well as a rising anti-feminist rhetoric, activists and workers collaborated to start shelters, transition houses and rape crisis centres across Canada. It is only through this grassroots work that we even have the vocabulary to define and fight back sexual violence. Unlike the solutions of the state, which focus on institutionalization and criminalization, feminists inspired a grassroots plea to find inclusive and holistic strategies. This included building a movement that was not only explicitly feminist, but also anti-racist, anti-colonial and Trans-inclusive. Our culture must change, and since language and everyday interactions perpetuate rape culture, we must all change as well. I believe we have a collective responsibility to destabilize rape culture and dismantle the oppressive notions that sexual violence is expected or inevitable. The only way to stop sexual violence and make people feel safe on campus is to make it unacceptable in our community."

The change deprives students of an important sense of community that remains years after they graduate and brings them to revisit their old haunts. I was at CASA last February on a Saturday afternoon while the Sun Devils were playing an important basketball game against UA in Tucson. The game was on the TVs, but no one was really watching. When Desmond Cambridge Jr. hit a full court buzzer beater to beat ASU's biggest rival and give the Sun Devils a boost into the NCAA tournament, the people at the bar - most pregaming for Innings Festival down the street - met the occasion with mild applause at best, a far cry from the electricity that used to characterize the area. Although it's a popular place, CASA lacks what College Bar and Grill was. Healey said he talks to people who do not know where to watch a road game in Tempe. ""I've had people that I'm involved in all these different ASU groups, and people are like, 'What's a good place to see a road game?'"

stanforddaily_opinion_2023_result_53,human,"Without editors or writers who have a vested interest in maintaining and building the reputation of a breaking-news newsletter, Fizz seems to more closely resemble a campus-wide game of “telephone,” which can sometimes become a breeding ground for misinformation. In contrast, FoHo curated, chose and developed on the stories of most interest to the Stanford community to create its digests. FoHo is not the only student-run media outlet at Stanford that has ceased to exist. Most prominent among the rest wasStanford Politics, which was an invaluable source of high-quality, impactful investigations that sadly petered out in 2021. Their coverage was broad and unique in focus, ranging from an investigation intosorority lifeon campus to commentary on theLebanese governmentto think-pieces on Americancriminal justice reform. Stanford Politics pieces were thoughtful, well-sourced and held to high standards, fostering deepinvestigationsinto Stanford issues and providing a platform for political discourse ranging beyond Stanford's campus. There was also theStanford Sphere, a lesser-read but still rigorous publication whose left-wing editorials balanced out theStanford Review's conservative slant. The Review remains active and is today's most prominent student publication after The Stanford Daily. Founded in 1987 by Peter Thiel and Norman Book, the Review's primary output is op-eds, although it dabbles innews coverageandsatire. Although the Review does not have as long of a history as The Daily nor match its publishing volume, the two papers play a critical role in facilitating campus discourse. The coexistence of the Review's and The Daily's Opinions sections allows for more spacious commentary on campus events. For instance, the two outlets have offered unique critiques on Hoover's institutionaldecisionsandpolicies. The Review also provides perspectives that lack on-campus representation, such as itscommentaryon last Spring's Judge Duncancontroversy, where students continually interrupted a guest speaker. While none of The Daily's writers opined about the issue, we applaud the Review's timely position when other campus publications were quieter. We believe that the Reviewinjectsan integral dose of contrarianism into predominantly-liberal campus discourse ᅳ one that challenges students to question their existing beliefs and examine issues through a new lens. While we often differ from the conclusions and rhetoric of the Review, the Review's contribution to the ideological diversity of Stanford's media system deserves our recognition. Before COVID, the diversity of student-run media outlets dedicated to discovering stories created a healthy symbiotic relationship in our campus news ecosystem. FoHo curated the juiciest stories by parsing through hundreds of tips from on-the-ground sources, which The Daily would often investigate and publish with accurate facts and verifiable sources. Stanford Politics published long-term investigative projects and political commentary that went beyond the Stanford bubble. The Review and the Stanford Sphere filled out the spectrum of ideas and beliefs on campus, prompting open discourse and debate. This range of styles and competition for eyes kept more Stanford community members more informed, and constantly pushed publications to a higher standard of timeliness, engagement and impact. Without a range of options for all reading appetites, many Stanford students have simply turned to Fizz for their news and entertainment, where there is little to no authority, trusted sources, accountability, nor the ability to follow up on stories or make corrections in a uniform and transparent way. The Stanford Daily, the Stanford Review and even Fizz can only write, report, analyze and elicit so much."

Ressa, former Shorenstein Fellow and Nobel Peace Prize winner, who introduced me toWhistleblower Aid. In December 2023, I went public onCNNandNBCand in theWashington Postwith mywhistleblower declaration. What's most jarring is that it's precisely Elmendorf's job to protect academic freedom. What does it say about the state of academic freedom at Harvard that he did the reverse? HKS's response to my research exposed broader issues of institutional integrity and academic freedom that then reached a fever pitch when professor Claudine Gay resigned under less-than-transparent circumstances after powerful donors called for her downfallpublicly and behind closed doors. By prioritizing donor interests over academic freedom, Harvard's leadership has failed in its duty to uphold the principles of free expression and intellectual honesty. The future of Harvard will require limits and oversight of faculty and administrators' financial and personal ties to actors and industries under study. The quest for a new University president will undoubtedly attract considerable attention from factions with political designs for Harvard, desiring to make it more a hedge fund than a center of higher learning. Already, Meta's Mark E. Zuckerberg ᅳ a former member of the Class of 2006 ᅳ tried, but failed, to install an ally on the Board of Overseers. As sociologist Max Weber wrote, a useful professor teaches students to confront inconvenient facts, regardless of their ideological leanings. Similarly, members of the academic community must uphold academic freedom as a sacred principle, defending it against all attempts at suppression and co-option. Only then can universities fulfill their vital role in advancing society through the pursuit of truth and knowledge."
Independent_Clean_2020_result_166,human,"Please send your letters toletters@independent.co.ukThe protest movement sweeping the world since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis has forced an international soul searching to understand the pervasive racial inequalities that haunt most sectors of our society - including our own major institutions and industries.Publishers have taken advantage of this moment to amplify the marketing of titles by their black authors and release statements of support for the black communities who have been campaigning for equality for decades.Although we welcome your support at this time, we are deeply concerned that British publishers are raising awareness of racial inequality without significantly addressing their own.We are calling on you to help us tackle the deep-rooted racial inequalities in the major corporate publishing companies and support grassroots black literary communities such as booksellers, book clubs and the Black Writers' Guild.We request the following:1. We would like there to be an audit of the books published by black authors. This should include genres, the submission-to-acquisition ratio of black authors in the past five years and the median and mode of the advances of black authors.We'd also like data on the roles of black staff across the business. Rather than relying on anecdotal information, the data is crucial for us to better understand the current situation and how each area can be resolved for equality.2. We are concerned that an absence of black commissioners who understand our communities and nuanced life experiences is limiting the ability to find the stories that best capture and reflect the sensibilities within them, to market them and also identify new talent across a broad range of areas. We are calling on publishers to hire black commissioners at every level of their companies.3. We are aware that there is a worrying absence of black publishing staff in key positions in sales, marketing and publicity departments. These roles are vital in the acquisitions process and, in addition, these specific roles are focused on books reaching readers from a range of backgrounds, so diversity is essential. This also extends to designers and illustrators who are an important part of the messaging and engagement of a book - there is a woeful lack of black talent in this area.4. One of the biggest complaints about publishers amongst black writers who do not start out with a notable profile is that our books are misunderstood by both editors and the marketing departments. Our books can often require additional support to reach the audiences who should be sought beyond the usual retailer pathways. We would like publishers to create a ring-fenced fund for marketing and specialist publicity focus to support the books of new and emerging black talent.5. We are deeply concerned by the absence of any black members on core leadership boards. In 2020 this is unacceptable as well as unsustainable in the modern world."
CNN_Clean_2022_result_153,human,"At just a couple of weeks old, my son wasn't gaining weight, so his pediatrician suggested I may need to supplement with formula. This was hard for me to hear, so the pediatrician suggested I come back in two days to reevaluate; if he didn't gain weight -- or worse, if he lost weight -- we would need the help of formula.I spent those two grueling nights before my son's follow-up appointment breastfeeding him as much as possible to my own physical, emotional and mental detriment. I often caught less than four hours of sleep, and during those sleepless nights, the slogan ""breast is best"" played in mind on repeat. During the follow-up appointment, and the moment of truth, my son had gained about 2 ounces, enough for the doctor to say I could stick with breast milk, which I continued to do for another 17 months.When I had my second child, I also breastfed, but due to a busy work schedule and barely finding time to pump milk, I supplemented with formula. I would be lying if I said I didn't feel a bit ashamed at the time. As a health care professional, it was ingrained in me to promote breast milk.My sister, Syma, also tried to give breast milk to each of her three boys after birth but struggled every time. She had to remind me it's not just about the baby but what benefits both of mother and child.My third child -- my pandemic baby -- was a whole different experience. Two weeks after giving birth in mid-January 2020, I went back to work to help my health care system in New York City prepare for a possible surge of Covid-19 cases. And, as we all know, a massive surge ensued just a few weeks after. I didn't have time to breastfeed but pumped breast milk for over a year on the train, in empty offices, in public restrooms and in my car. I was tempted to give formula but was motivated to pass on antibodies in my breast milk to my daughter. By fall, I contemplated whether to switch to formula.Again, hearing news of a Covid-19 vaccine on the horizon, I decided to continue pumping so once I was vaccinated, I could potentially pass my antibodies to her. At the time, there was no data on antibodies from the vaccine being passed to babies through breast milk (we nowknowthis to be true), but given my background in infectious diseases, I knew it was a possibility."
CNN_Clean_2022_result_427,human,"Over the years, I've worked as a self-defense instructor, trained officers on firearm safety and ran the corrections training academy for the Sheriff's Office.Law enforcement officers must complete countless hours of firearm training prior to being certified -- and even we are less accurate in a crisis situation. I'm 95% accurate on a good day, when I'm stationary in front of a target. But introduce loud noises, sirens, the darkness of night, lots of people and someone running at me, my skill level -- despite all my training -- will go down. And the likelihood that I, or any trained officer, will hit something we don't intend to hit goes up. This has been known in law enforcement for decades.Training creates an awareness of your immense responsibility in carrying a firearm. To carry a weapon with no training makes us all less safe.That's part of the reasonI spoke out last yearagainstOhio SB215, which wassigned into lawand went into effect in June. The bill removed the concealed carry license requirement which mandates eight hours of training and background checks. It also eliminated the requirement of citizens to announce to a deputy that they have a concealed weapon if stopped.By removing these requirements, law enforcement officers are more in danger -- and so is everyone else.Today, the state of Ohio allows virtuallyanyone 21 years of age or olderto conceal carry a firearm without a license that requires a background check to determine any criminal records. I, as the Sheriff of Hamilton County, now have no oversight over who carries a concealed weapon. Prior to this bill being passed, I rescinded last year some 200 concealed carry permits from those charged with crimes such as domestic violence or assault. Now, I can't do that, and those 200 people can conceal carry without the benefit of law enforcement oversight.To those politicians who claim to be all about law and order -- and pro-police -- I want to say, ""Really?"
CNN_Clean_2021_result_46,human,"The Washington Post catalogued 30,573 false and misleading claims Trump made while President, and one study found that misinformation about election fraud decreased by over 70% in the week after Trump lost his social media, underscoring the impact of his public muzzling.Trump also faces serious legal issues. New York Attorney General Letitia James has an active tax fraud investigation into the Trump Organization. Meanwhile, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance opened an investigation into alleged hush-money payments to two women, which has expanded into an active criminal investigation into Trump's business operations. Also, since Trump left office without giving himself a pardon, he's open to any number of federal charges. Indeed, the House Ways and Means Chairman Democrat Richard Neal has renewed his call for the Biden Treasury Department to submit Trump's tax returns to Congress. These legal woes will bedevil Trump for years, and news of his possible -- or actual --criminality will further erode his public standing.Trump has serious financial problems. Numerous banks, including Deutsche Bank, Signature Bank, Bank United Inc. and Professional Bank, will no longer work with the former President, who has between $421 million and $1.1 billion in loans coming due in the next four years, according to New York Times, Financial Times and Forbes reports. While Trump has a long history of evading serious financial difficulties, multiple banks shunning him will impair efforts to fight legal woes and salvage his business.Consequently, social media de-platforming, possible criminal proceedings, and serious financial problems will likely cripple Trump's comeback attempt.However, given his astonishing ability to overcome seemingly-insurmountable obstacles, we must consider a second scenario: a Trump-heavy influence on the Republican Party. This foresees the former president re-establishing a bully pulpit, raising money, and staying politically relevant. It culminates with him being the Republican presidential nominee in 2024.Trump can reconnect with his base and monetize supporters for some badly-needed cash. Barron's estimates that a Trump TV network (assuming it can get carriage) could charge an audience of 5 million customers $5 a month to yield $300 million annually. Additionally, if he can regain access to his email list, which was suspended by digital provider Salesforce after the riot, Trump could offer a paid digital newsletter for a monthly fee. His campaign has roughly 20 million supporters' email addresses, so this could be a real money-maker.A Trump-hosted television show on Fox News, NewsMax, or AmericaOne is also a possibility, which again would serve his dual strategy of making money while reconnecting with his supporters. Also, Trump could be invited to host the ailing Rush Limbaugh's radio show with its reported 15.5 million listeners, once failing health causes Limbaugh to relinquish his microphone.Political endorsements and rallies could also keep Trump in the public domain. His endorsements would be widely sought after, particularly by GOP candidates who want to help Trump take revenge on the House and Senate Republicans who publicly favored impeachment. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's recent meeting with Trump to discuss his involvement in the 2022 midterm elections signals that GOP leaders still believe in the potency of Trump's appeal with their base voters.At its root, Trump leads a cult of personality, enabling him to scare Republican leaders and possibly deter some Senate impeachment votes. His big-lie tactics have brainwashed Americans across the nation into believing whatever he says. This is perhaps the most powerful -- and utterly morally reprehensible -- tool that Trump can use to control the GOP going forward.Post-impeachment, there is a fork in the road for the GOP."
FinancialPost_Clean_2020_result_36,human,"By Paul Boothe and Christopher RaganThe strong public-health measures Canadian governments enacted to control the pandemic have started to pay off. After nine weeks of self-isolation and physical distancing, our health-care systems have not been overwhelmed, new cases are beginning to fall, and governments are starting to plan a prudent and gradual re-opening of their economies.Governments have moved quickly to support hard-hit workers and businesses by providing a financial bridge until economic activity - and thus their incomes - returns to more normal levels. This provision of economic ""relief"" is different from conventional ""stimulus"" common during normal recessions. Whereas stimulus policies are all about getting people back to work and businesses back to normal levels of operation, the current relief policies are about replacing people's incomes while they are safely isolating at home.Sensible and necessary as these relief policies are, replacing a big fraction of the lost income is proving to be very expensive for Canadian governments, and the bill is being added to our public debt. Demands for the government relief programs to continue grow as it becomes clear that a return to full economic activity lies months, rather than weeks, ahead.At the federal level, the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) estimates that the budget deficit, projected last year to be about $20 billion, will rise to over 12 times this amount in a single year. Driven by a sharp decline in tax revenues and an even sharper increase in relief spending, an estimated budget deficit of $250 billion this year will be the largest ever recorded in Canada.Perhaps surprisingly, there has been little worry expressed so far about the mountain of debt we are building. This lack of worry stems from two observations.First, Canada's federal net debt-to-GDP ratio in 2019 was only 31 per cent, very low by historical standards and also low by comparison with other developed countries. Even this year's projected massive deficit of $250 billion is only about 11 per cent of 2019 GDP, suggesting an increase in the debt ratio to only 42 per cent once the economy fully recovers. This would still leave us with a debt ratio far below other countries and still substantially below its level from the mid-1990s, when Canada's experience ""hitting the debt wall"" led to more than a decade of necessary but painful fiscal consolidation.The second observation is less about the accumulated stock of debt and more about the annual interest payments required to service it. In today's world of extremely low interest rates - Canadian 10-year government bonds currently trade at an unprecedented annual yield of 0.6 per cent - even $250 billion of new debt doesn't require much in the way of annual debt-service payments.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau listens to a question during his daily news conference outside his residence at the Rideau Cottage in Ottawa, on May 20, 2020.However, there are two good reasons to worry about Canada's emerging fiscal situation.First, it is likely that budget deficits will continue to be large for several years, so using this year's deficit of $250 billion as the only number for debate is misleading. Second, given the large budget deficits across the world, it is likely that interest rates will begin to rise, and such increases would certainly impact our ability to service any new debt. Let's unpack these two concerns.To think about the likely path of budget deficits over the next few years, we need to predict the shape of the recession and the subsequent economic recovery. Rising tax revenues will depend on how many and how quickly Canadians get back to work; declining relief spending will depend on the same thing, and also on the ability of governments to resist the temptation to maintain these programs beyond the point when they are really necessary.Many things enter this prediction."
CNN_Clean_2022_result_572,human,"After more than a year of digging through evidence to understand what happened on one of the darkest days in American history, the House January 6 committee has issued itsfindings: Former President Donald Trump aided an insurrection and should be charged with multiple felonies.That conclusion is extraordinary, unprecedented and wholly necessary exactly two years after Trump senta late-night tweetto his supporters to come to Washington, D.C., on January 6, 2021, promising that it ""will be wild!

And there are risks, too, of fueling the perception that Democrats are using the DOJ to go after political opponents. If it were simply about partisan revenge, such a prosecution would be disgusting and egregious.But the committee's findings are about a shocking attack on American democracy, one with which the nation has not fully reckoned. How strong are our democratic institutions if those who attempt to level them can simply walk away without being held accountable? Can a democracy thrive if attempts to topple it are simply washed away?The January 6 committee recommended that Department of Justice prosecutors proceed withfour criminal charges: assisting or aiding an insurrection, conspiring to defraud the United States, conspiring to make false statements and obstructing an official proceeding of Congress. Its final report, to be released Wednesday, will provide justification for recommending the charges, but a referral does not require the Justice Department to act.These are serious accusations, but the committee has spent months interviewing witnesses, evaluating the evidence and putting together a full and coherent story about what led up to the January 6 insurrection, what happened that day and what played out in the aftermath.That story is damning. Witnesses testified that Trump knew that the January 6 protest over the 2020 election had spun out of control into violent chaos and was told repeatedly that he should ask rioters to leave.He did not do so for hours, even as he watched the carnage on television, according to the panel.Evidence showedthatTrump was told multiple timesthere was no evidence of election fraud.

However, the best intentions are no guarantor of outcome, and readers rightly ask to know how the fault occurred and how a recurrence will be prevented.Jones had filed his column at 1.30pm on Tuesday. Three staff were then involved in preparing the piece before the finished version - including headline, caption and a photo - was sent back to an editor for approval about 6.30pm (writers are rarely, if ever, involved once their words are submitted). However, shortly after the piece was signed off, it was suggested that a picture of Wiley would be a better illustration than the one already chosen.A production journalist searched for a replacement image within the Guardian's picture library, which receives upwards of 30,000 photos a day from staff, contributors and agencies, using the term ""Wiley"". Of the first eight images returned, with the most recent at the top, six were of Wiley, one of Emma Barnett, who had condemned the rapper's comments on her BBC Radio 5 live show, and the eighth was of Kano, taken in 2017 but uploaded on 23 July 2020 following his nomination for this year's Mercury prize.The description provided by PA, the agency that sent the photo, accurately stated this was Kano, but a secondary mention of Wiley - a featured guest on Kano's 2016 Mercury-nominated album - had caused it to appear in the top search results. Kano was seen in profile, wearing a cap and with a microphone held close to his face. The misty stage setting looked of a piece with the concert photo of Wiley that sat alongside, creating an illusion of similarity that had already caught out two media organisations and prompted PA, alerted by Kano's team, to issue a warning email to clients, which, due to technical error, was not sent to the Guardian.Careful reading of the agency description, displayed when a photo is selected, would have set a misapprehending journalist straight. Individuals working on opinion and news pieces possess sound knowledge of core current affairs but are not specialist in every topic - social, political, scientific or cultural - that crosses their desk. The abiding instinct to doubt and check is therefore vital.So is an extra pair of eyes.

CNN_Clean_2022_result_339,human,"As is standard operating procedure, the Justice Department has not released the FBI agent's sworn affidavit supporting the search warrant. Such affidavits, and the evidence they contain, are closely held until soon after the DOJ files any criminal charges.Disclosing affidavits prematurely can give away the government's case and inform targets what investigatory routes they need to block, what evidence to destroy and what potential witnesses' cooperation they need to forestall. That is why Garland should hold firmdespite demandsfrom some of the former President's allies in Congress to see the affidavit.The ordinary reasons apply with even greater force in a case involving exceptionally sensitive national security data and a highly confidential informant. In our current, hyper-charged political environment, when an armed follower of Trump's social media site enters aCincinnati FBI officewith an apparent intent to kill, any public information on areported Mar-a-Lago informantcould easily put that person's life in danger.Still, Garland has adeptly brought the picture into focus with his properly terse statement and release of the warrant -- while complying with the DOJ's stringent rules on what can and cannot be said. We shouldn't take the attorney general's integrity and prosecutorial experience for granted. After all, we just had Bill Barr, whosedistortionsas attorney general of the Mueller report may have emboldened Trump's belief in complete personal impunity from legal consequences.

That is so even though Trump has not declared his candidacy for 2024 and is not on any ballot.The accumulation of allegations adds to the chances that Trump might be charged. It's not just the possible removal of documents, or even the more serious national security ones. It's that documents appear to have been withheld again and again.Moreover, Garland's moves last week were not necessarily just about potential document crimes. As anearlier overviewexplained, the DOJ can use anything found pursuant to the search warrant to prove other possible crimes.There are three fronts on which federal criminal investigations are likely to proceed, quietly before November but perhaps more loudly afterward: alleged document crimes, conspiracy to defraud the United States by seeking to overturn the 2020 election before January 6, 2021, and obstruction of Congress on January 6.On Sunday, Trump may have dropped a hint that the FBI seized information related to the latter two. He complained on his site,Truth Social,that the FBI ""took boxes of 'attorney-client' material, and also 'executive' privilege material which they knowingly should not have taken."" We know that attorney-client and executive privilege arguments have loomed large in the January 6 investigations. Time will tell whether the FBI also swept up information relating to additional matters separate from the removal of classified documents.Trump's groundless caterwauling this past week proves he's concerned about possible prosecution."

SK Telecom has developed a new autonomous robot to handle disinfection and monitoring duties as part of efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), the company said. It will also monitor the temperatures of people around it and check whether they are wearing face masks.On top of all that, our thermometers might be wrong. A 2014 literature review by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health found accuracy issues with many devices used to measure body temperature non-invasively. Thermometers that measure temperature in the ear tend to be more accurate than those that measure from a distance. This is a concern that matters, given the rush by employers to install thermal cameras and similar devices.A screen shows a thermal imaging system taking the body temperatures of health workers inside a public hospital to identify people potentially infected with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Valparaiso, Chile April 23, 2020.All of which leads us to another big question: the potential for invasions of privacy. The American Civil Liberties Union argues in a recent white paper that we shouldn't do routine temperature checks until we know more about both the accuracy of the devices used and the relationship of temperature to COVID-19. Among the organization's particular concerns is that the rise of automated temperature monitors that scan people from a distance. Their use, the ACLU warns, might transform the workplace into a realm of constant health surveillance of employees.The caution is sensible, but I wonder whether it misses the point. I doubt that many experts would seriously argue that constant temperature monitoring will do much to curb the spread of COVID-19 or other diseases. I suspect that the true, if unspoken, purpose of using thermometers before allowing employees into the office or patrons into the opera house is to reassure a frightened public. If public confidence grows, we might yet find it possible to return to some semblance of normality.My point isn't that the ubiquity of the thermometers is all smoke and mirrors. But by now, those with businesses or governments to run have to be wondering whether the balance between prudence and freedom might have swung too far in one direction. If taking temperatures is helpful in getting things up and running, they're willing to try.On the other hand, if we really want to go down this road, screening people for COVID-19 before allowing them to mingle with other people, maybe temperature is the wrong thing to measure. The aforementioned literature review from the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine suggests that sudden onset of ansomnia - loss of the sense of smell - might be a stronger indicator that a person has the disease.

Without the record low interest rates and trillions in aid from the federal government, the economy would be much diminished from where it is today. Uncomfortably low inflation would still be the problem, as it had been in the decade leading up to the pandemic.My optimism does depend on the Federal Reserve getting monetary policy roughly right. That means raising interest rates fast enough and high enough to slow down the strongly growing economy and contain inflation expectations, but not too fast and high to push us into recession. This will require some deft policymaking, but so far so good.The Biden administration and Congress should agree on legislation that helps ease inflationary pressures, whether it's reducing prescription drug prices or increasing tax incentives to spur the construction of more affordable housing. Unfortunately, legislation seems a big political stretch in the leadup to the midterm elections.But legislation isn't necessary for my optimistic inflation outlook to come to pass.

CNN_Clean_2022_result_361,human,"And as long as much of the Republican Party keeps walking down its current antidemocratic path, the same will be true of subsequent elections as well.While voters handed Biden a victory in 2020, the last two years have been fairly lackluster. Biden did offer some important improvements in people's lives, most notably extending important economic lifelines to get Americans through Covid shutdowns. And just this month, Biden also announced a significant student loan relief program,unshackling a great many graduates from up to $10,000($20,000 for Pell grant recipients) of student debt and reining in predatory interest rates.But thanks in large part to congressional recalcitrance, including from two moderate Democratic senators in Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, the Biden administration has not been able to go as far as many Democratic voters would have liked on some of our country's most pressing needs, from universal pre-K to paid parental leave to legislation to curb climate change that goes far beyond what the Inflation Reduction Act will do.While economists may quibble about who or what is at fault for our odd economic reality -- inflation coupled with healthy jobs reports -- Americans are feeling the pinch on their pocketbooks. Add that to a growing sense of pervasive disorder and discord, and the reality that rates of some serious violentcrimes shot upduring Covid-19 after years of decline, and Democrats had good reason to be worried about how they might fare in November.But then, Republicans got what they wanted: A Supreme Court that stripped the broad right to abortion from American women and conservative state governments that immediately outlawed the procedure with few (and in some cases, no) exceptions for rape victims, fetal anomaly or a pregnant woman's health. Extreme anti-abortion politics may dominate among Republican Party elected officials, but they arevastly unpopularnationwide, and these Republican-penned laws go far further in restricting abortion rights thaneven most Republicanssay they want.Stories now abound of women seriously injured or nearly dying because of these laws. And while Republican-led states are forcing pregnant women to give birth against their will, the cost of raising a child has ticked up to more than$300,000-- and that's before paying for college. States that outlaw or likely will outlaw abortion are much, much worse than states with liberal abortion laws when it comes tosupport for women and children, and even whether a woman and her child are likely to make it through childbirth at all. Perhaps as a result of these extreme attacks on women's right and the immediately apparent and dire consequences, huge numbers of women haveregistered to votesince the Supreme Court issued its decision, portending a large-scale female rejection of anti-abortion Republican candidates.Republican voters also got what they wanted when they cast their ballots for Trump in 2016, and the Republican establishment largely got in line; many of those who initially warned of the dangers Trump posedbecame pathetic sycophantssinging his praises, and the very few who stuck to their principleshave largely been voted out of office.Trump misled no one about who he was: A ruthless businessman who always put his own interests above all else; a man who did not believe the rules, legal or otherwise, applied to him; a demagogue whose campaign was largely bereft of policy but heavy on reactionary rhetoric. But that hardly makes the midterms Democrats' to lose.The same landscape of despair and dissatisfaction that make Republican anti-abortion laws so galling is also a landscape in which far-right movements often thrive. You see this in views creeping more into the conservative mainstream, with right-wing commentatorssuggestingthat only a small group (wealthy White men) should have the right to vote, Republican candidates for office publiclyromanticizing violenceor fantasizing aboutmurdering the oppositionand even Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolinawarningthat people will ""riots in the streets"" if Trump is held legally accountable.This is the ideology underpinning so much of Trumpism: That there are ""real"" Americans who are deserving of all of our nation's privileges and protections and the less-real ones who are not. That can be an awfully tempting view for those who believe they are part of the in group, who are searching for a simple explanation for the complicated forces that have shaped their lives, and who need some sense of greater purpose -- and may find it in being an armed thug for Trump.It is also creeping awfully close to fascism.When Biden made the point, though, that a propensity for ""semi-fascism"" drives reactionaries toward the Republican Party, conservatives howled -- despite decades of calling just about every Democrat, including the extremely moderate Biden, a ""communist"" or a ""socialist."" The hypocrisy is indeed a bit rich -- right up there with the people whose favorite campaign chant was ""lock her up"" now threatening street riots if the investigation of Trump ends in criminal charges.It's equal parts absurd and dangerous. The stakes were high in 2020; they are high in November; they will be high again in 2024, unless the Republican Party moderates itself and decides it would like to participate in a multiparty representative democracy, rather than dominate in a single-party state."

President Biden's approval ratings rank among the worst of any president after just ten months. They include a poll with 37.8% approve and a stunningly high 59% disapproval rating.There are good reasons for those low ratings, including the worsening state of the economy, the disastrous pullout from Afghanistan in August, the out-of-control border crisis, COVID policy dissatisfaction and policies mandated by the heavy hand of an out-of-control federal government.WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCER APPEARS TO SKIP KAMALA HARRIS AT INFRASTRUCTURE BILL SIGNING AFTER DISASTROUS CNN REPORTThe problem for the Harris is that there is no end in sight to those policies. Yes, Afghanistan is fading from view but the poor state of the economy will not.Rather than deal with inflation, which is getting out of hand, Democrats are pushing another spending bill (which Harris supports) that will only make things worse. And, rather than working to fix our supply chain problems, the harmful effects green energy regulations and COVID mandates imposed by the Biden administration are only making things worse.Overall, despite their recent election losses in Virginia and elsewhere, Democrats are moving further to the left than where voters want to be."

There is no shortage of scapegoats including foreign buyers, house flippers and private equity companies buying single-family homes. But at the end of the day, government-imposed restrictions on development have prevented the market from providing enough housing for current and future Ontarians. Finally, Queen's Park appears to be taking meaningful action.According to confidential documents(https://www.thestar.com/politics/provincial/2022/10/20/doug-ford-will-override-municipal-zoning-to-allow-more-housing-across-ontario-confidential-document-reveals.html) obtained by the Toronto Star, the Ford government plans to table legislation featuring sweeping changes to land-use planning provincewide. Among the most promising changes, Queen's Park reportedly plans to override municipal zoning rules to allow duplexes and triplexes on single-family lots across Ontario. They are also proposing to curb the role of conservation agencies, waive site-plan control for smaller developments and reduce the number of public meetings required, as well as the possibility for appeals.These changes echo recommendations from the Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force(https://files.ontario.ca/mmah-housing-affordability-task-force-report-en-2022-02-07-v2.pdf), which called for allowing even more density ""as-of-right"" (without rezoning) in single-family neighbourhoods. The government already committed to several recommendations, but this was a hard one. While they appear not to be going quite as far as the panel suggested, this could be a serious step forward.To understand why something like this needs to be done, you need to go back to 2005. The McGuinty government introduced the Places To Grow Act, intended to curb the outward expansion of Greater Toronto and its outlying areas. In doing so, the province essentially assumed municipalities would allow enough homes to be built in existing urban areas, to compensate for reduced outward growth.

And indeed, Black residents of Buffalo dealing with the aftermath of the attack havevoiced similar emotions.In fact, many Black Americansharbored such fearsof attack by White terrorists even before the Buffalo massacre. And in the wake of the shooting, a majority of Black Americans recently polled said they live withthe fear of another such attack.As with the lynchings of the past, today's racially-based attacks put Black suffering on display for the entertainment of a 21st century version of the White mob.

He reportedly wrote in a long online post he was inspired by the shooting attack carried out by aWhite supremacist in Christchurch, New Zealandon two mosques that killed 51 people. The shooter in that attack aimed to foment discord between Muslims and non-Muslims, with the goal of driving followers of Islam out of the country. And like the shooter in Buffalo, hefilmed and streamed videoof the attack, in his case on Facebook.According to the posts shared on Discord and on the hate-filled online forum4Chan,the Buffalo suspect planned the massacre for months. The streaming siteTwitch, most often used for sharing games - including ones simulating violence battlefield violence - was also used by the shooter, including during his livestream of the attack.

The shooter's youth - he was just 18 - was a likely factor in his receptivity to the unsavory ideas he took up so readily.Other young racists who carried out heinous racist shootings in the United States include the 21-year-old gunman who opened fire on Latino shoppers at a Walmart inEl Paso, Texasand the 21-year-old gunman who killed Black worshippers at an evening prayer service inCharleston, South Carolina.Now we can add to the roster of youthful mass murderers the shooter inUvalde, Texaswho was just 18.

The disproportionate burdens and risks the pandemic will place on the least privileged is increasingly being recognized. Yesterday's job precarity has already translated into deep economic uncertainty for significant segments of the population under COVID-19. New government programs will help buffer economic hardships for now, but it will likely take years for many to recover what they have lost or will lose. As importantly, many will be dismayed if governments rush to re-establish the previous economic order.

FinancialPost_Clean_2021_result_207,human,"The recent federal election was one of the nastiest in Canadian history, complete with calls to hang or otherwise harm our prime minister, racist attacks against candidates and their volunteers, and journalists being harassed and threatened. Yet even in the face of such vitriol, governments continue to give political parties and candidates, and therefore their workers and volunteers, copies of voter lists - which includes full names and home addresses.A wide spectrum of views was represented among the 24 parties vying for election this year that included a neo-Nazi party (Canadian Nationalist party), a Marxist-Leninist party and the People's Party of Canada. PPC Leader Maxime Bernier reportedly insulted journalists and shared their contact information, suggesting that his followers ""play dirty"" and contact the reporters to tell them what they think of them. Many of the same parties ran in the previous federal election, when civility was already giving way to malevolence.The Canada Elections Act mandates that the chief electoral officer maintain a ""Register of Electors"" (RE), which lists those who are eligible to vote, as well as a ""Register of Future Electors"" (RFE) - our children. Both lists contain residents' surnames, given names, genders, dates of birth, complete civic addresses, complete mailing addresses, unique identifier numbers and other information gathered from various government databases and other sources. No parental consent is required for listing in the RFE.Every year, each of Canada's 338 members of Parliament may request the Register of Electors for their electoral district from the chief electoral officer, who provides them with electronic and hard copies. Each time a federal election is called, the chief electoral officer makes the updated electors' list available to each registered party and to the returning officer for each riding, who, in turn, makes it available to every candidate in the riding. The lists provided by the chief electoral officer details each elector's surname, given names, complete civic address and mailing address, and their unique government-issued identifier number.The chief electoral officer can also share the information with provincial authorities to establish a list of electors or future electors in a province. In Alberta, the Election Act requires that such voter lists also include a wealth of personal information. The list of electors - including the full names, the addresses including postal codes, telephone numbers and the unique identifier numbers of electors - is then provided to all registered political parties. As well, voter lists for individual ridings are routinely sent to members of the legislative assembly.Alberta municipalities may also obtain the provincial list to help prepare their own list of electors, which must then be shared with municipal election candidates. Calgary city council voted in May not to prepare a list of electors for the Oct. 18 municipal election. Had the city opted to compile one, the complete list - identifying every eligible Calgary voter - would have been available to each of the 27 mayoral candidates, including Kevin J. Johnston, whose well-publicized threats to show up at the homes of Alberta Health Services employees to ""arrest"" them inspired the city (as well as some other municipalities) to forego a list of electors - this time, at least.Pastor Henry Hildebrandt of Aylmer's Church of God addresses the crowd at a People's Party of Canada rally in Chatham, Ont., on Sept. 15.Other provinces have analogous legislation regarding voter lists. Although both the federal and Alberta elections acts contain prohibitions on the improper use of these lists, complying with those requirements is largely on the honour system. And the wide distribution of voter lists makes it difficult to know which candidates, volunteers or other people have accessed, retained or distributed copies, during or after an election."

My generation of Millennials was taught this pious reverence to bread by our grandparents who survived the 1932-1933 famine in Ukraine -- known as theHolodomor.Many a time I heard the story of how a soup with wild sorrel saved my grandmother and her siblings while the grain collected from her village was left to rot at the train station. That wheat could have saved so many lives, but ""the state"" did not allow it. My grandmother could not stand the sight of sorrel for the rest of her life, and always kept her cupboard well stocked with salt and flour.With""glasnost""in the 1980s, and Ukrainian independence from the Soviet Union shortly after, came a new freedom to process this national trauma. The history of the Holodomor prompted Ukrainians to see their country as the victim of the Soviet empire. And in recent years, theannexation of Crimea,conflict in Donbasand now all-out war wherefood is being used as a weapon, fit that picture.In the occupied territories, there ismounting evidenceRussian forces are stealing grain and equipment from Ukrainian farmers or forcing them to sell produce at extremely low prices. From there, it is reportedly taken by trucks to ports in the annexed Crimea and Russia. The Kremlindenies the allegations.But such an apparently coordinated removal of grain from Ukraine is not an opportunist loot. It is centrally managed, from the troops arriving at the farm to the trucks transporting grain to the ports.Meanwhile, millions of tons of grain are stuck in Ukrainian ports,blockadedby Russian ships in the Black Sea. And taking agricultural produce overland to the ports in neighboring Romania and Poland is a slow and arduous enterprise.By controlling the export of Ukrainian wheat, Russia can influence the prices on grain just as it does with oil and gas. It will secure more leverage over the countries relying on its grain, including China, India and Turkey. Moreover, if grain supply is limited, poor countries in Asia and Africa will be left with limited supplies and millions willface starvation.As a scholar of the Holodomor, I see many parallels between the artificial famine of almost a century ago and today's war."

Facing what feels like ongoing government fiat ""for my own good,"" my theme for 2022 is rekindling old virtues to survive a flood of ineffective government action.Families in Ontario, where I live, have struggled. We have the dubious distinction of enduring one of the longest school closures of any jurisdiction in North America. Many parents, particularly mothers, quit paid work or lost aspects of their sanity in juggling waged work and home work. In my view, parents in general and mothers in particular should never be coerced in any direction, either to full-time mothering or to waged work. Instead, families that are (we hope) embedded in functioning extended communities should be free to make their own decisions about what works for them. In 2021, it hasn't always been the case that choices were freely made. It was a year to grit one's teeth and power through.That said, instead of thanking all parents for rising to the task however they could, some commentators saw quitting the paid workforce even temporarily as a failure. Widespread discussion of a ""she-cession"" highlights the prevailing government view that all Canadian citizens - even the mothers of young children - must be taxable, ideally on full-time hours. With businesses needing workers and inflation and interest rates rising as we head into next year, the tendency to drape what are actually economic concerns in a mantle of ""helping families"" will only grow.That is a key problem with national daycare, one of 2021's major policy concerns. A hundred different politicians of many political stripes all claim subsidized child-care spaces ""help the economy."" But Quebec, where this kind of child care has been available for 20 years, has excelled at neither child care nor the economy.

Guardian_Clean_2020_result_69,human,"As UK coronavirus restrictions deepen we can find new ways to share the ecstatic, communal joy of musicLast night a DJ probably didn't save anyone's life - but not through lack of want or need. Among the many calamities of the pandemic, one of the underreported ones is the sweeping obliteration of social dance, particularly in its most popular form: dancing to the selections of a DJ.Raising concerns about party culture at a time when so many lives and livelihoods have been lost might seem facile. Opinion largely views DJ-led dance culture as a self-indulgent, frivolous, non-productive pleasure. It encourages participants to escape the world rather than engage with it.Then again, the culture has become integral to the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of us. The Night Time Industries Association recently warned of a looming ""financial Armageddon"" that could lead to 754,000 job losses in the UK. Many more dancers derive a sense of wellbeing and release from a constantly evolving culture that enables them to forge new forms of open, pleasurable community - or, to quote the polymath musician and composer Arthur Russell, to see all our friends at once go bang. It also encourages strangers to trust one another, in turn promoting social cohesion.Party culture exists on a continuum alongside other activities whose communally based, psycho-acoustic underpinnings provide participants with a dose of natural serotonin, among them music concerts, theatrical performances, sporting events, religious gatherings, choirs and walks in the park. As the New York City DJ and party host Jon Martin asked during a recent conversation, to what extent can the spiralling anger, domestic abuse and everyday violence of the pandemic be partly explained by the collapse of these forms of socialisation?Party culture's kaleidoscopic, connecting potential arguably outstrips these other experiences in terms of immersion, duration and joy. David Mancuso, pioneering host of the Loft in New York, even believed that communal dancing amounted to humankind's best attempt to tune into the underlying essence of the universe, which was born out of sound and amounted to one big party of constantly, intensely vibrating atoms.Party organisers and DJs have overwhelmingly placed safety above desire during the pandemic. Back in mid-March we took matters into our own hands: cancelling events, losing money, disappointing dancers and forsaking basic freedoms after the government fell asleep at the wheel, delivering only mixed messages and half-measures. Since lockdown was eased over the summer, organisers have reopened nightclubs as socially distanced lounge spaces and staged summer-friendly, safety-conscious outdoor gatherings."

Millions of residents are still without power, and the losses covered by insurance alonecould cost tens of billions of dollars.Two key politicians will be scrutinized for how they respond. At the federal level, President Joe Biden needs to demonstrate he has the leadership and rigorous governing skills that are necessary to help Florida out of this mess. On Thursday, Bidenstatedhis intention to visit the sunshine state and announced that those in Florida without enough insurance would be provided additional assistance for home repairs and loss of property.At the state level, Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is billed as a potential Republican presidential nominee for 2024, needs to show that he can achieve more than political stunts like the one he orchestrated earlier this month when he sent migrants from Texas to Martha's Vineyard.DeSantis has alreadyrequestedfederal assistance from Biden -- a man he has long trolled as ""Brandon."" But he will have to balance the need for federal relief with his own party's steadfast opposition toward the Biden administration.In other words, he must weigh the political costs of replicating a""Christie-Obama"" moment, when the former New Jersey governor met with the president after Hurricane Sandy. Rupert Murdoch suggested Christie's effusive praise might be responsible for Obama's reelection in 2012, and many Republicans never forgave the governor.It wasn't always the case that the federal government was expected to step in after natural disasters. In September 1900, few thought President William McKinley would do much when the Great Galveston hurricanekilled somewhere between 6,000 to 12,000 people. Much of the relief effort was left to local officials, philanthropists and the private sector. Railway companies, for example,provided free ticketsto workers who wanted to get out of the city.But the federal government would eventually become more important. In 1938, President Franklin Roosevelt championed a larger role for Washingtonin response tothe ""Great Hurricane"" that hit the east coast."

He is playing one community off against the other while cosplaying as a unionist.With the UK set to breach its international obligations, the European Union has responded by saying that it is the one protecting the Good Friday agreement. The fact that the assembly didn't consent to the withdrawal agreement, that people in Northern Ireland have serious issues with it, seems lost on the commission as it pats itself on the back. The EU can hardly claim to be an impartial broker.Johnson's move has led to interventions from the US presidential candidate Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and four influential US congressmen. All of them believe the internal market bill threatens the Good Friday agreement. Pelosi and Biden have both said that the British government won't get a US trade deal if it threatens the peace process.While Biden and Pelosi's interventions should make the prime minister consider the implications of his actions, they aren't helpful.

We know that some people roll off their ballots, voting for candidates higher on the ballot but not for down-ballot offices such as the state legislature. But how common is ballot roll-off, and do both parties experience it equally?To answer these questions, we compared the differences between the number of votes each major party's presidential, gubernatorial or US Senate candidate (""up-ballot"" candidates) and their state legislative party mates (""down-ballot"" candidates) received in even-year elections between 2012 and 2020 in 10 battleground states.The findings from the recent report of our organization, Sister District,were staggering: Democratic voters appear to roll off at much higher rates than Republican voters. The results echoed ourpastfindings.Down-ballot Democrats received fewer votes than up-ballot candidates in their own party93.08% of the time. Down-ballot roll-off was less severe for down-ballot Republican state legislative candidates, who received fewer votes than up-ballot candidates75.47% of the time. While both parties suffered from down-ballot roll-off, Democrats experienced it more often.Interestingly, both parties sometimes experience what we are calling an ""overage."" In this case, down-ballot candidates get more votes than their up-ballot party mates. Republicans again were more likely to experience this down-ballot advantage than Democrats (78% to 22% in the instanceswhere we saw this happen).We suspected that including uncontested state legislative races might be skewing our results. Perhaps some voters who appear to roll off the ballot didn't have anyone to vote for down ballot. So, we looked at state legislative races in which both major parties fielded a candidate.But the partisan trend only intensified."

Predictably, the reaction has been mixed, with the editorial board of The New York Times opining that the new president should ""Ease Up on the Executive Actions, Joe. ""However, Biden's flurry of executive orders forms part of a deliberate strategy to project a new vision for the country, and it makes sense for him to use the power he has in this way. In fact, Biden and his team are modeling their first 100 days in office after the example of one former president in particular: Franklin D. Roosevelt.Like the Great Depression facing the nation in 1933, when Roosevelt took office, the multiple crises -- health, economic and racial -- afflicting the United States in 2021 require decisive action on both the executive and legislative fronts. To follow successfully in the footsteps of Roosevelt, however, Biden needs to thread the needle between targeted executive action and congressional legislation.The crisis of the Great Depression compelled Roosevelt to take bold action during his first 100 days in office. In his first inaugural address, he declared: ""This nation asks for action, and action now."" He hoped to work in coordination with Congress, but if that legislative body failed to act, he would ask for ""broad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe. ""Biden and his team have hewn closely to this Roosevelt strategy in their first two weeks. In his inaugural address, Biden declared that the many crises facing the United States required ""a time for boldness.""

Today, mortgage interest rates are up - the30-year fixed rateis currently 7.63%- and so are home prices. Americans need about35%of their income to pay for a mortgage, which is higher than at the peak of the so-called housing bubble in the early 2000s.Unfortunately for homebuyers, there is almost no hope that we'll return to the affordable housing days of 2020. More concerning, there is little indication that recent trends will reverse or that homebuying will get much more affordable in the near future.The main reason homebuyers are struggling is that the cost of borrowing has gone up for everybody. After a burst of inflation, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates at one of the fastest paces in its history. The Fed has taken its targetinterest ratefrom near zero at the beginning of 2022 to almost 5.5%today.But the Fed's rates mainly affect short-term borrowing. Even more important for mortgages are long-term interest rates that recently hit peaks.One of the main reasons for those higher long-term rates is unprecedented levels of federal deficits and debt.

However, that would mean Trump would have to frequently report to his probation officer who would monitor him to make sure he was obeying the law. Every time he traveled, he'd have to getpermission from his probation officer. That doesn't make sense for a presidential candidate or a former president.I do expect that Trump's anticipated appeals will be unsuccessful. There's always grounds for appeal on evidentiary rulings or jury instructions, but it doesn't mean that the grounds would be strong.

That was clearly the lack of evidence - aside from Michael Cohen's unreliable testimony - showing that Trump knew about the falsification of business records. Spending any time on the alleged affairs with Karen McDougal or even Stormy Daniels (which Trump denies), gave more oxygen to the prosecution's case tying the ""catch-and-kill"" schemes to election interference.While Trump is sure to appeal, a ruling is unlikely to happen until well after the election.

Politico_Clean_2023_result_71,human,"It deserves an enormous response.Worries about artificial intelligence have suddenly seized Washington: The White House just hauled in a roster of tech CEO's to press them on the safety of their new AI platforms, and Congress is scrambling for ways to regulate a possibly disruptive and risky new technology.There are a lot of immediate concerns about the latest generation of AI tools - they could accelerate misinformation, job disruption and hidden unfairness. But one concern hovers over the rest, both for its scale and the difficulty of fixing it: the idea that a super-intelligent machine might quickly start working against its human creators.It sounds fanciful, but many experts on global risk believe that a powerful, uncontrolled AI is the single most likely way humanity could wipe itself out.At the heart of the threat is what's called the ""alignment problem"" - the idea that a powerful computer brain might no longer be aligned with the best interests of human beings. Unlike fairness, or job loss, there aren't obvious policy solutions to alignment. It's a highly technical problem that some experts fear may never be solvable. But the government does have a role to play in confronting massive, uncertain problems like this. In fact, it may be the most important role it can play on AI: to fund a research project on the scale it deserves.There's a successful precedent for this: The Manhattan Project was one of the most ambitious technological undertakings of the 20th century. At its peak, 129,000 people worked on the project at sites across the United States and Canada. They were trying to solve a problem that was critical to national security, and which nobody was sure could be solved: how to harness nuclear power to build a weapon.Some eight decades later, the need has arisen for a government research project that matches the original Manhattan Project's scale and urgency. In some ways the goal is exactly the opposite of the first Manhattan Project, which opened the door to previously unimaginable destruction. This time, the goal must be to prevent unimaginable destruction, as well as merely difficult-to-anticipate destruction.Don't just take it from me. Expert opinion only differs over whether the risks from AI are unprecedentedly large or literally existential.Even the scientists who set the groundwork for today's AI models are sounding the alarm. Most recently, the ""Godfather of AI"" himself, Geoffrey Hinton, quit his post at Google to call attention to the risks AI poses to humanity.That may sound like science fiction, but it's a reality that is rushing toward us faster than almost anyone anticipated. Today, progress in AI is measured in days and weeks, not months and years.As little as two years ago, the forecasting platform Metaculus put the likely arrival of ""weak"" artificial general intelligence - a unified system that can compete with the typical college-educated human on most tasks - sometime around the year 2040.Now forecasters anticipate AGI will arrive in 2026. ""Strong"" AGIs with robotic capabilities that match or surpass most humans are forecasted to emerge just five years later. With the ability to automate AI research itself, the next milestone would be a superintelligence with unfathomable power.Don't count on the normal channels of government to save us from that.Policymakers cannot afford a drawn-out interagency process or notice and comment period to prepare for what's coming. On the contrary, making the most of AI's tremendous upside while heading off catastrophe will require our government to stop taking a backseat role and act with a nimbleness not seen in generations."

Alleged conspiracy and its alleged cover-up: the classic prosecutorial one-two punch.Let's start with the alleged conspiracy. Colangelo made the complex simple,going throughthe chronology of evidence that prosecutors will present toprove the election interference. Like a Shakespearean drama, it had five acts.ACT ONE:TheAugust 2015 Trump Tower meetingthat will be covered by the first witness, former American Media CEO and National Enquirer publisherDavid Pecker(who was testifying as I began to write). Colangelo said Trump agreed with Pecker and former Trump attorney Michael Cohen at that meeting that they should attempt to influence the election and therefore it proves Trump's intent - a key issue here. If the prosecution proves that, then they can argue everything else that follows just corroborates that intent.ACT TWO:The first""catch and kill"" payment to Dino Sajudin, a former doorman at Trump World Tower who had a damaging story.ACT THREE:A payment to another person with a damaging story -Karen McDougal, who alleged she had an affair with Trump.ACT FOUR:The panic inside the campaign after the release of the""Access Hollywood"" tape. Colangelo named Hope Hicks, Trump's former White House communications director, as the key witness here (and one I know well - I examined her on these identical issues in the first Trump impeachment).ACT FIVE:Thehush money paymentto Stormy Daniels.Then Colangelo came to thealleged elaborate 2017 schemeto cover all that up. Trump reimbursed Cohen with fake income amounting to more than double what Cohen had paid to Daniels (including to cover Cohen's taxes on the fake income), the prosecutor said.Colangelo played off of Trump'snotorious cheapness,explainingthat he was habitually ""frugal"" and that ""the Trump Organization was not in the practice of paying twice what they owed for anything."" That they did so to repay Cohen, Colangeloargued, provides insight into Trump's state of mind and ""shows just how important it was to him to hide the true nature of Cohen's illegal payment to Ms. Daniels and the overall election conspiracy. ""Defense attorney Todd Blanche, in the Trump team's opener, also focused on the question of intent. It's clear that he views fighting that issue as the key to securing his client's acquittal. He told the jury that nothing the prosecution might present would directly show whether Trump had the criminal intent to conceal another crime as required for document falsification to be a felony.

CNN_Clean_2024_result_85,human,"Last year, Ohio made it a felony to call in a false emergency if it leads to a law enforcement action. Meanwhile, Virginia last year stiffened penalties, making swatting calls punishable by up to 12 months in jail.But we need more than just stiffer punishment. We also have an interest in toning down the potentially incendiary rhetoric that ignites this kind of dangerous behavior by dangerous and misguided people. Some of the most prominent victims of swatting in recent months have been associated in some way with former President Donald Trump. As TheWashington Post reported recently, ""While some on the right have been affected, many targets share a common attribute: They have done or said something that has earned Trump's ire. ""In January, a day after Trump berated Judge Arthur Engoron, who is presiding over his New York civil fraud trial, as ""TRUMP HATING"" on social media,Engoron was swatted; A caller reported topolice that a bombhad been placed at Engoron's home. A contingent of police officers, including members of the local bomb squad,rushed to Engoron's residence, but no bomb was discovered.Other officials involved in Trump-related cases have also been swatted in recent weeks. Jack Smith, the special prosecutor in two criminal cases involving Trump,was swatted on Christmas Day.On January 7, police received acall about gunfire at the home of Federal Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is presiding over a federal case in which Trump is charged with election interference. Again, the reported emergency was false.Shenna Bellows, the secretary of state in Maine, wasswatted in late Decemberafter making public her finding that Trump had participated in an insurrection on January 6, 2021,when more than a thousand of his followers fought their way into the US Capitol,which she concludedmade him ineligible to run for president in her state. Her decision has beensuspended pending a US Supreme Court rulingin the case.Swatting increases the likeliness of inadvertent harm to the public by the very people whose job it is to protect us. As someone who hasreceived his share of threats from Trump supporterswho remain incensed by my participation in the congressional investigation into January 6, I can tell you that it's very difficult to stay calm when someone tells you they are ready to come kill you.Officials have been swatted at every level - even the highest office in the land. Earlier this month,firefighters rushed to the White Houseafter a caller falsely reported a fire."
CNN_Clean_2024_result_476,human,"But in implementing Amendment 4, the Florida legislature created legislation requiring that former convicts pay off certain legal financial obligations before their rights were restored - a hurdle that prevented manyFloridians from voting.If states pass a ballot initiative on reproductive rights, hostile legislatures could likewise pass legislation testing the limits of new constitutional protections - for example, by imposing limits claimed to help women. That means that state legislative majorities and governors will have a good deal to say about abortion policy in a state, even if a ballot initiative passes.The same is true of state Supreme Court elections.State courtsare tasked with interpreting the open-seeming terms of ballot initiatives - and determining whether they would permit specific restrictions. Most state Supreme Courts require their judges to face somesort of election.Critical partisan races in states like Ohio,Wisconsinand Michigan will determine the balance of power onstate Supreme Courts.Retention elections, which tend to reward incumbents, can also produce surprises, especially when a state court hands down anunpopular, high-profile ruling. State courts will decide whether to interpret a ballot initiative to permit more regulation - or even whether a state constitution protects the personhood and fetuses and embryos and thus potentiallyprohibits abortion or IVF.If state legislatures or judges can gut ballot initiatives, a Republican president might set the stage for a federal ban that would preempt state constitutional protections. Conservative activists who worked in the first Trump Administration (and who remain close to the former president) have promised that Trump's Department of Justice would interpret the Comstock Act, a 1873 obscenity law, asa de facto banon all abortions and prosecute doctors and drug companies across the country, even in states where reproductiverights are protected.If Trump wins office, embraces this argument and convinces the Supreme Court to agree with his interpretation, the Comstock Act, as a federal law, could override any state protections voters create. Trump has been asked repeatedly about the Comstock Act and has thus far refused toanswer the question- a telling omission given his public position that the states, not the federal government, should decide the abortion question.And significantly, the 2024 election will be taken as a bellwether about whether voters actually care about issues related to reproductive rights. For years, conventional wisdom suggested that most voters opposedcriminalizing abortion- especially early in pregnancy- but that reproductive health issues were a top priority only for a relatively smallfraction of the electorate. That made Republicans comfortable tying themselves to the antiabortion movement, even if that movement's favored laws were unpopular: most voters may disagree, but few seemed to prioritize the issue.That assumption no longer seemed to hold true after the Dobbs decision. Democrats' position on abortion seems to have prevented a widely expected red wave inthe 2022 midterm. Voters who supported reproductive rights began ranking the issue as one of the mostcritical to their decision. It is for that reason that President Joe Biden and othershave made reproductive rights socentral to their campaigns.If Trump wins, pundits - and the GOP - will conclude that voters do not care much about reproductive issues after all. Republicans, who have been caught between the demands of base voters opposed to abortion and the majority unhappy with the status quo, will be sorely tempted to read a Trump win as a way out. Many Republicans will want to give the antiabortion movement more of what it wants without consequences. That means that if Trump wins, it could encourage far more aggressive actions on abortion by Republicans across the country.So it is absolutely right to think that abortion is on the ballot. But if anything, the stakes are far higher than the fight over ballot measures would suggest.Opinion by Mary ZieglerTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company."

Trump is prohibited from making personal attacks on witnesses, prosecutors, jurors,court personnel and their families.Prosecutors haven't askedfor jail time for Trump's violations.But it is possible that threats of jail time won't have the desired effect either, as Trump may believe such a penalty will be the best illustration yet of a politically biased legal system run amok. ""Frankly our Constitution is much more important than jail,""Trump saidon the 12th day of his trial over falsifying business records in a hush money scheme to improve his chances in the 2016 election.Jailing Trump could give him yet more ammunition for rallying his base against what he calls awitch huntand describes as a form ofelection interference. It could also be afundraising boon, whichTrump sorely needsto pay legal expenses and keep up with Democrats. (Biden's principal campaign committee went into Aprilwith nearly twiceas much as Trump's main campaign account.) His campaign says it raised$7.1 millionfrom his booking and mug shot alone in the Georgia election interference case. The windfall from this imagery could be even greater.It would also mean that the first real possibility of Trump sitting in a cell would come from the criminal case that many legal experts widely considerthe weakest of the four against him.Merchan appears to understand the risk as well as the sheer weight of his decision over possible jail time. ""Mr. Trump, it's important you understand, the last thing I want to do is put you in jail. You are the former president of the United States and possibly the next president as well,""the judge said. ""The magnitude of this decision is not lost on me, but at the end of the day I have a job to do. ""However, no previous adverse legal judgment against Trump has seemed to make him a less competitive general election candidate, including theverdicts in the E. Jean Carroll civil casesover sexual abuse and defamation and theNew York civil fraud judgment.The handing down of multiple indictmentsboosted Trumpin the Republican primaries. The beginning of the hush money trial hasn'tnoticeably hurtTrump in polling matchups against President Joe Biden. Most of the country appears divided over whether Trump is being treated more harshly or lightly than other defendants, according toa CNN poll conducted by SSRSin April, but about three-quarters of voters backing Trump say they will still support him even if he is convicted of a crime. (Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied all wrongdoing in the four cases against him. )In this particular case, Trump could be jailed for speaking out during a trial over allegations that some critics say should bea case of misdemeanor chargesonly, while an accuser such as former Trump attorneyMichael Cohenhas been nearlyubiquitous in the press. (Merchan has warned Cohenthat if he keeps criticizing Trump the gag order barring the former president from comments about witnesses, jurors and others might no longer apply to references to him.) One of Trump'sgag rule violationswas reposting a link to aNew York Post columnby George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley attacking Cohen's credibility on the basis ofpast perjury.Discussions of offensesfor which Cohen pleaded guiltyseem like fair play for public debate rather than an attempt to threaten or intimidate a witness. Trump and his supporters could argue a double standard here.All these developments come against the broader backdrop of Trump blaming his legal woes on his political opponents - Biden and allied Democrats."

She was one of the few peace candidates,calling for a ceasefire early onin Gaza, and even wrote that ratherthan bombing the Houthis in Yemen, we might resolve the Red Sea shipping crisis by stopping the bombing of Gaza, the stated reason for the Houthis' attacks on merchant vessels - a principled liberal stance that no other mainstream candidate seems willing to say out loud. Biden's stance on both Gaza and Ukraine seem to align more with neoliberal and neocon values.After liberal stalwart Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator, criticized Biden for failing to address working-class voters' concerns,Williamson pointed outthat there was a Democrat who was already doing so (herself), but was largely ignored by Sanders and the media.Even failed 2020 candidate Andrew Yang, who suffered a similar fate to Williamson in the Democratic primaries,encouraged Williamson to step asidein favor of Minnesota Rep. Dean Philips just a few days before the New Hampshire primary. Williamson's response to Yang should make traditional liberals beam: ""The days of a woman stepping aside on the assumption that a man can do a better job are over.

Nikki Haley may have barely mustered a close enough showing in the New Hampshire primary Tuesday to justify a push toward her home state, but for all intents and purposes, the Republican Party has chosen to nominate former President Donald Trump for a third time.The roster of those whom Trump defeated on his way to victory in2016,2020and 2024 shows the deep bench of possible presidential contenders that Republicans had prided themselves on during the presidency of Barack Obama.Dozens took their shot and lost: Successful governors who turned out to be paper tigers, like former Wisconsin Gov.Scott Walkerand Florida Gov.Ron DeSantis;self-described compassionate conservatives like former Florida Gov.Jeb Bushand South Carolina Sen.Tim Scott;principled conservative senators like Texas Sen.Ted Cruzand Florida Sen.Marco Rubio;business-friendly moderates like former Ohio Gov.John Kasichand, of course, Haley. All of them, plus many more, proved more out of touch with the base of the party than the twice-divorced former reality TV star from New York.There's little doubt, now, that Trump has remade the party in his own image. In so doing, he cleared out an entire bench of those who would have offered a different path to the White House. Even if the likes of Cruz or DeSantis were to run again, they would do so as a Trump product, not a tea party one.The next time there's a meaningful Republican primary election, it will be a question of which of the post-Trump figures can best channel his energy - not which of his contemporaries can best present an alternative.Patrick T.

Politico_Clean_2024_result_4,human,"Yet public alienation will escalate further if Barrett, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh join Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas in overruling Colorado's decision amid blistering dissents by Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. In contrast, if Roberts can convince even one Trump appointee to remain faithful to his or her professed originalist principles and join him and the liberal wing, the court would be in a position to issue a bipartisan opinion that Trump did indeed join an ""insurrection"" on Jan. 6.By affirming the Colorado decision, the Trump-appointed justices would make it clear that they are not merely rubber-stamps for the president who propelled them through the Senate - and that, despite prevailing public skepticism about the court, they are reaching out to their fellow justices in an on-going effort to decide hard cases on the basis of fundamental principles.Of course, Trump himself would react with outrage. He has already warned in a filing to the Supreme Court that the efforts to disqualify him threaten ""to unleash chaos and bedlam"" around the country. Yet his ultimate response may be tempered by the criminal trials he will be confronting over the coming months. Prosecutors and judges will not respond kindly to incendiary calls to allies like the Proud Boys to engage in violent protest. Nevertheless, so long as he remains relatively calm, he will still have many chances to speak to a larger public, and what he says will have a big impact on the presidential campaign.He has two choices if the Supreme Court prohibits his candidacy. On the one hand, he can call on his followers to boycott the polls, since they can no longer cast their ballots for their hero. On the other hand, he can make a deal with a particular Republican candidate and support their election as the second-best way to Make America Great Again.In either case, his position will have counterintuitive consequences. Although true believers will heed his call for a boycott, this will greatly increase the vote share of moderate Republicans showing up at the primaries - and help a mainstream GOP candidate gain the party's nomination. In contrast, if Trump designates a proxy, his candidate may well gain the party's nomination, but struggle to win the general election if they hold fast to the MAGA-line - since the Republicans must gain the support of centrist voters in swing states to win.However, there would be an even more significant consequence of the Supreme Court's vindication of the Disqualification Clause: its impact on Joe Biden. Though he tried to walk the comment back, few were shocked when Biden acknowledged last month, ""If Trump wasn't running, I'm not sure I'd be running."" As the president recognizes, he will be 86 by the end of his second term, even as he remains convinced he's the Democratic Party's best shot to defeat Trump.But if the court remains faithful to the Constitution, Trump won't be running. A much younger Republican candidate will take his place, which should lead Biden to reconsider his decision. A recent Gallup Poll reports that he entered the New Year with a 39 percent approval rating, lower than any modern president at this point in their first term - and that his age is one of the most important reasons he is suffering at the polls. Without Trump on the ballot, the president will be under intense pressure to leave the scene and open up the Democratic primary to younger candidates.If he does so, the 2024 campaign will take a dramatically different turn. Voters won't be hearing Biden and Trump make the same old attacks on one another. Democratic and Republican candidates will be looking to the future - and arguing for very different solutions to the very real problems the nation confronts at home and abroad.To ensure this happens, the Supreme Court should take one final step to reset the campaign. The justices will be hearing the Colorado case on February 8th, but 15 states have currently scheduled their primaries for Super Tuesday, March 5th. By the end of that month, voters will have elected more than half of all delegates to the national conventions. They'll have done so, however, with frontrunners who are no longer running. To allow new contenders from both parties to make their case to the voters, the justices should issue an injunction postponing Super Tuesday to early May - and provide potential candidates with a six-week opportunity to satisfy state ballot requirements.The Republican convention meets in the middle of July and Democrats will gather for their convention in August."

CNN_Clean_2023_result_1265,human,"(CNN) &#8212; On Tuesday, the ACLUfiled a lawsuitin response to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott'ssigning of a billthat he says will enable his state to fight illegal immigration. Under SB 4, migrants who enter Texas without authorization will be committing a state crime. Local law enforcement officers in the Lone Star State will have the power to arrest them, and state judges will be able to order them removed to Mexico. The law is scheduled to take effect in March.Abbott saidat a Monday news conference that he was taking this action on immigrationbecause""President Biden's deliberate inaction has left Texas to fend for itself. ""In escalating the battle over immigration between Texas and the Biden administration, Abbott is playing a dangerous, cynical game. His new law isconstitutionally suspect and logistically impractical.It will open the door to racial profiling of Latinos while placing Texas communities at risk. And there is no sound evidence that it will lead to a significant drop in illegal immigration.Abbott made this move against a backdrop ofrecord levelsof unauthorized entries at the southern border. In November alone, officials apprehended about 192,000 migrants between ports of entry, aborder patrol chief told CNN. This ongoing influx of migrants has become a huge political liability for President Joe Biden, and a drain on resources in border states.Yet SB 4 is legally problematic because it encroaches on federal authority over immigration. Under theSupremacy Clause of the constitution, federal laws take precedence over state measures, and existing federal law already guarantees migrants theright to apply for asylum.Texas cannot sweep such humanitarian relief away with its own law.In addition,for over 100 yearsthe Supreme Court has held that the power to regulate immigration lies exclusively with the federal government. In the 2012 caseArizona v. US,the high court established that states may not put in place their own immigration laws, citing ""the federal government's broad, undoubted power over immigration."" It's no wonder that a group of 30 former immigration judges, appointed by both Republicans and Democrats,signed a November letteropposing SB 4 as unlawful.SB 4 will allow state and local law enforcement in Texas to arrest people they suspect of being in the country illegally. However, assome Texas police chiefshave pointed out, this will pull police away from their regular duties, such as fighting violent crime. The law burdens local officers with immigration responsibilities, for which they may not have been trained.In a state that is40% Latino, according to the US Census Bureau, and about17% foreign-born, according to the American immigration Council, how are state and local police supposed to decide who is undocumented - by asking for papers? Or judging people based on their skin color or language preference?Turning all police into de facto immigration agents is bad policy because it will discourage migrants and their families from reporting crimes or coming forward as witnesses. Texas' new law will likely sow distrust between local law enforcement and Latino communities.That's whythree county chief executivesin Texas have written to Biden, urging him to take action against SB 4; they recognize the measure as a threat to public safety. It also represents a potential financial burden on state and local jail and justice systems, asTexas localities will bear the costsof incarcerating migrants andadjudicating their cases.Without a doubt, SB 4 is an extreme measure."
CNN_Clean_2024_result_144,human,"But we wondered, could it be that for parents, record-high rents -three in ten renter households now spend more thanhalf of their incomeon rent (according to a 2024 study)- are being exacerbated by a lack of affordable, accessible child care?In other words, could the convergence of a housing affordability crisis and a care affordability and availability crisis be forcing American parents to choose between paying for housing and paying for child care? Or, like Ms. Schields, could the inability to find child care, much less afford it, prevent parents from finding and keeping a job that would pay the rent?Across the country, parents have trouble finding child care - about half of the US population lives in achild care desert.When parents do find care, it's difficult to afford. An analysis by the Department of Labor's Women's Bureaufoundthat annual child care costs in 2018 ranged from more than $4,810 to $15,417 per child, depending on the type of care, a child's age and the population size of a county. The high cost of child care eats up between 8% to 19.3% of median family income - far higher than the7%that the Department of Health and Human Services considers affordable for families with low wages.For single parents like Schields, the 2018 analysis found that infant care costs can eat up anywhere from 24% to 75% of family income. And that cost is climbing: Average household child care costs have climbed more than 30% from 2019 to 2023. ""That's where my savings got depleted,"" Schields said.During the pandemic, Congress allocated $24 billion to a Child Care Stabilization Program to keep the already fragile child care system afloat. The funds enabledmore than 200,000 child care providersacross the country to pay rent, lower tuition for families in their care and raise wages for child care workers, which helped stanch the loss of child care workers to higher-paying sectors and kept programs open.But those funds expired on September 30 - the so-called child care cliff. Without them, as many asone in four child care programs is likely to shutteras a result. Could more families with young children lose child care, lose jobs and wind up losing their homes?Already, the Department of Labor is reporting that the number of people who've had toreduce hoursorcan't workbecause of a lack of child care skyrocketed from 112,000 to 179,000 workers in the two months following the September 30 child care cliff.But it doesn't have to be this way. Congress could agree to allocate the $16 billion increase in funding forchild carethat the Biden administration and Democrats in Congress have been pushing for since October to replace the expired child carestabilization funds.States can also step in. At least 11 states and Washington, DC have spent a combined $2.9 billion since 2023 to help support and stabilize local child care programs, according to a newly-releasedreportby The Century Foundation. TheNew MexicoandVermont legislatureshave passed measures to create and fund universal public child care systems. And more states can dedicate unused pandemic-eraAmerican Rescue Plan Act(ARPA) funds to shore up their child care systems.But as vital as these stabilization funds have been, they were never designed to fix the broken US child care system. To fix the system in the long term, we first need to shift long-held cultural biases.Some Americans believe it's better for a young child to stay home with a parent - namely the mother - and don't want a universal child care system. That view was clearly on display when the Idaho legislature not onlyprohibitedsome ARPA funds from being spent on child care for children ages four or younger, but last yearvotedto return millions of dollars back to the federal government rather than spend it on child care.RepublicanRep. Charlie Shepherdof Idaho said in 2021 that he wanted to stop any bill ""that makes it easier or more convenient for mothers to come out of the home and let others raise their child. ""But that view is disconnected from many families' everyday reality: A majority of children are raised in families whereall available parents work."

The former president has growing momentum, added fund-raising and better pollnumbers in the Republican primary.Maybe this is exactly what Democrats want. After all, President Joe Biden seems dead set on running for re-election even though no president with a job rating as low as Biden's has ever gotten re-elected. His best chance, many strategists believe, is to run a re-match against Trump. But our recent polling shows that Biden loses to Trump in a rematch given the state of the economy, immigration, and crime.Last December, Trump had a 2024 campaign announcement that lacked energy, was barely noticed, and he was giving rallies that few news outlets were even covering. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was every month gaining new voters in the Republican primary while Trump was stalled. Then the full force of the law started coming after Trump and resuscitated his campaign and his political life.The indictment is splitting Americans along party lines. Eighty percent of Democrats supported an indictment, 79 percent of Republicans opposed it, and Independents were split 51-49 against according to the March Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll. Most Americans, however, also believe that the indictment is politically motivated and the Trump will eventually be acquitted.JONATHAN TURLEY: DONALD TRUMP INDICTMENT IGNORES THIS CORE LEGAL PRINCIPLEA review of the actual indictment raises even more questions about how it could possibly be issued. It claims that payments made in 2017 affected the 2016 election and fails to specify any crime that was committed to trigger making it a felony and extending the statute of limitations. Even in NY, this indictment is, in my view, likely to be tossed, further energizing the Trump campaign.Americans are split along party lines over how the indictment will affectTrump's presidential chances. Sixty-seven percent of Democrats think it will hurt his candidacy and 57 percent of Republicans say it will help, according to the March Harvard CAPS/Harris poll."
CNN_Clean_2024_result_523,human,")These films connect ecological devastation to patriarchy and hierarchy; the collapse of global ecosystems and the scarcity of resources are inseparable from violent (and gendered) exploitation. Dealing with climate catastrophe requires a fundamental challenge to the systems that have created the climate catastrophe in the first place: something that Hollywood, and people outside Hollywood, have trouble imagining or embracing.Like all the Mad Max films going back to the 1979 original, ""Fury Road"" and ""Furiosa"" are set in post-apocalyptic wastelands following some indeterminate eco-catastrophe. Food is scarce, water scarcer and civilization has disintegrated into warring gangs. ""Fury Road"" and ""Furiosa"" focus on a citadel ruled by tyrannical, bloodthirsty and toothy-masked Immortan Joe (played in ""Fury Road"" by Hugh Keays-Byrne and in ""Furiosa"" by Lachy Hulme). Joe controls a water supply pumped from an underground aquifer; women serve as his wives and bear him children, or else are hitched to giant milking machines. Male children become war boys - fanatic fighters convinced that they'll go to heaven if they die in battle for Joe.Joe keeps most of the population subjugated: They're thin, dirty and wait desperately for a sip of life-giving water. The control of natural resources gives Joe control of women's reproduction and of male violence - or vice versa.Either way, or both ways, Joe's rule depends on mechanics of exploitation and hierarchy. Patriarchal power is built on treating both people and the environment as things - to be expropriated for the greater glory of Joe. A better world requires not just a better use of resources, but a different relationship to resources and each other.In both Furiosa films, such a society emerges in the Green Place, the home from which Furiosa (played in ""Fury Road"" by Charlize Theron and in ""Furiosa"" by Anya Taylor-Joy) was stolen as a child. We only get glimpses of the Green Place, but it appears to be ruled collaboratively by women, and resources are shared, conserved and allocated to all.Again, many Hollywood films address climate crisis. Yet calls for sweeping political change often sit uneasily withingenre conventions and corporate moviemaking. There are some exceptions - such as the acerbic ""Don't Look Up"" (2022). But in general, creators have largely tried to avoid the insight that ""Furiosa"" makes plain - to solve the climate crisis, we need to resolve a crisis of political exploitation and inequity.One common narrative choice is to make the most fervent environmentalists the bad guys."

The platformclaimsto take down videos for harassment - many before they're even reported - and that is a good start. Some harassing comments and videos about me have indeed been removed in recent months. But that wasn't before they got to me - and potentially influenced the creation of other harassing comments and videos.I did not reach out to any social media platforms to report the bullying I received; even if I had, it was so widespread that I wouldn't have known where to start. Instead, in the interest of preventing that disturbing hashtag from coming true, I deleted all social apps from my phone. I have yet to reinstall them.I'm aware that as an entertainer - and an internet creator, especially - I am subject to people having and sharing opinions about me and my work. But what started as discussion about me turned into pointed attacks toward me. The former is discourse, which is very much within the scope of acceptable behavior toward a public figure; the latter is harassment, which is very much not.But not all who experience cyberbullying are internet personalities who have opened themselves up to public critiques. Many targets are everyday users who find themselves unwillingly thrust into an antagonizing spotlight, and the effects can be devastating.A 2018reviewof 26 independent studies that were published between 1996 and 2017 (TikTok was released in September 2016) found that adults and young people are more than 2.5 times as likely to attempt suicide when they've faced online bullying, and theCDC saysthat levels of sadness and thoughts of suicide among teen girls have ""increased dramatically"" over the past decade. Thesame 2021 studynotes that 16% of high school students surveyed by the CDC said that they had been ""electronically bullied"" through social media or over text in the past year.We saw a tragic convergence of this just last month, when 14-year-oldAdriana Kuchdied by suicide two days after a clip of her being assaulted at her New Jersey high school was shared on TikTok. Shetold her fatherbefore she died that she didn't want to be ""that girl who gets beat up on video and made fun of. ""Social media companies are not without the tools to address the persecution that can proliferate on their platforms, yet they seem to not use them as well as they should.Some sites reportedly utilize a form of ""shadow-banning,"" when the reach of a post is inhibited for community violations, but the practice is famously opaque andalgorithmscan misinterpret allowed content as verboten.

Twitter's Trust and Safety Council, which advised on issues including suicide prevention and mental health, wasdisbandedlate last year. It doesn't take much to understand why stories like mine - and many far more heartbreaking - pervade the online zeitgeist.Perhaps unexpectedly, I don't want TikTok to be banned - in fact, I hope it won't be. I loved being a creator: the grind of making videos all the time, the challenge to push myself in new directions on a dime, the thrill of watching strangers around the world connect with a song I wrote minutes after filming it in my bedroom.

The Russian human rights organization Memorial worked tirelessly for over 30 years to document Soviet crimes, which were widely discussed during the Gorbachev and post-Soviet era.More recently, Russian journalist and YouTube starYury Dudpowerfully depicted the horrors and legacy of Stalinist Gulag forced labor camps in his 2019 documentary ""Kolyma: Birthplace of Our Fear."" TheYouTube videohas over 29 million views.Putin's treatment of Stalin takes both of these stances into consideration. Rather than a glorification of the Communist dictator, he offers a somewhat equivocating view that strives to placate both pro- and anti-Stalin constituencies within Russian society.To do so, he glosses over but does not deny the large scale of the Communist dictator's terror and repressions. In 2017, Putin unveiled Russia's first monument to the victims of Stalin's repressions in Moscow: the""Wall of Grief. ""Duringthe opening, he asserted: ""We must never again push society to the dangerous precipice of division. ""Over his 24 years in power, Putin's rhetoric on Stalin has remained reasonably consistent. He does not deny Stalin's crimes but rather tries to divert attention away from them, admitting the horror of the Gulag and mass repressions but insisting thatthe memory of these crimes should not overshadow Stalinism's achievements. In his view, efforts to overly 'demonize'Stalin are part of an attack on Russia.Silencing Stalin's victimsWhile Putin has shown little enthusiasm for glorifying Stalin, his government has worked methodically to silence, or at least render abstract, the memory of the Gulag's victims.For example, the ""Perm-36"" memorial complex, Russia's only remaining intact Gulag, was taken over by local authorities in 2015.When it reopened, individual storiesof the prisoners' lives were replaced by content celebrating the prison guards and the camp's contribution to timber production during World War II.Elsewhere, the 2021shutdown of Memorial- which documented Soviet human rights abuses especially during theGreat Terror- and the recentremovalof 'last address' plaques marking victims sent to the Gulag, were almost certainly state-directed initiatives that seek to erase reminders of the human cost of Stalinist repressions.However, their removal cannot be reduced to the question of Stalin's legacy alone - it can also be seen as an attempt to eliminate evidence of the crimes of the security services, in which Putin's career and power base are rooted.After all, thinking about the individual victims leads to thinking about the individual perpetrators.The Putinist regimeThe erasure of personalized reminders of the Gulag and Terror must be contextualized within the Kremlin's use of history and myth to legitimate the Putinist regime, Russia's war on Ukraine, and the country's great power status. As the prosecutor at Memorial's liquidation trial in 2021argued: ""Memorial besmirches our history. It forces us - a generation of victors and the heirs of victors - to justify our history. ""The prosecutor's comments reveal not an ignorance of the dark spots of history but a desire to ignore them."

Given that Newsom is indeed building a stealth campaign and that the vast majority of Democrats feel Biden is too old to run again, his commitment to the incumbent seemed insincere if not downright absurd.Newsom smirked and laughed throughout, while engaging in petty and personal attacks on DeSantis; perhaps he considers Florida's governor a possible rival down the road. Many of his jabs were simply not true.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONFor instance, he claimed that DeSantis implemented a more heavy-handed approach toCOVID restrictionsthan he had; DeSantis countered, claiming (accurately) that beaches and schools in California were kept closed much longer than in Florida. Newsom also said that Florida had suffered a much higher death toll from the pandemic. That claim was debunked by numbers presented by debate host Hannity; in fact, the two states' records were remarkably similar.Newsom tried to claim that California's tax policy is less regressive than Florida's and that the middle-class was better off as a result; that is tough to argue since the Sunshine State has zero income tax and California boasts the 49th highest rate in the U.S.  DeSantis countered that California's higher cost of living hurts middle class residents, which is true.The debate was a good one for DeSantis, whose campaign has struggled over the past few months.

CNN_Clean_2024_result_214,human,"It does not require a law or a trial to enforce it.On Monday, the Supreme Courtdecided unanimouslythat Trump is not disqualified from the presidential ballot. The Supreme Court was united on the idea that Trump will remain on the ballot in Colorado and that the state cannot remove him off its ballot. But the justices were divided about how broadly the decision should be construed. A conservative 5-4 majority, usually very respectful of states' rights, said that no state could remove a federal candidate off any ballot - with four justices, including the court's three liberal justices, asserting that the court should have limited its opinion.Although the 14th Amendment was ratified during Reconstruction, the period immediately after the Civil War, its provisions weren't just for that historical moment in time, but a safeguard for the future. In ruling that Trump should stay on the presidential ballot of 2024, the Supreme Court has delivered a mortal blow to Section 3 that basically eviscerates its power altogether. In doing so, the court is living up to its sorry 19th-century history of emasculating Reconstruction federal civil rights laws and constitutional amendments.The Colorado Supreme Court, in Trump v. Anderson, had upheld Trump's disqualification per Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, but the high courtbaldly rejected that: ""Because the Constitution makes Congress, rather than the States, responsible for enforcing Section 3 against federal officeholders and candidates, we reverse."" But Section 3 does not call for Congress to enforce disqualification for participating or aiding in an insurrection. It only gives Congress the power to remove that disqualification by a two-thirds majority of each house.While correctly pointing out that the 14th Amendment restricted state autonomy, the high court again erred in claiming that the ""Constitution empowers Congress to prescribe how those determinations should be made."" To argue that the ""States have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the Presidency"" is tantamount to claiming that the states have no power to uphold the Constitution.It bears repeating that qualifications to run for president and the constitutional disqualification of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment are self-executing. The Colorado Supreme Court did not enforce that disqualification; it simply upheld Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. In their concurring opinion, the three liberal justices, Justice Elena Kagan, Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson,argued against""a chaotic state-by-state patchwork"" that the Colorado decision would allegedly unleash, while chiding the majority for its lack of ""judicial restraint"" in ruling not just in this case, but for all future cases on the need for congressional legislation to enforce Section 3.While the court's liberal justices rightly grasped that the majority decision would emasculate the constitutional disqualification for waging and abetting an insurrection against the US government, they wrongly surmised that upholding the Colorado decision would allow each state to go their own way. Just as this decision allows Trump to be on the presidential ballots of all states, upholding the 14th Amendment disqualification would have meant his removal from the presidential ballots of all states. As during Reconstruction, when even Republican-appointed judges went along with undoing federal laws and constitutional amendments, the justices have also left us defenseless against future insurrection attempts. As they conclude, ""the majority goes beyond the necessities of this case to limit how Section 3 can bar an oathbreaking insurrectionist from becoming President."

Jamie Raskin, D., Md., announced that he will be reintroducing a prior bill with Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., to disqualify not justformer President Donald Trumpbut a large number of Republicans from taking office.The alternative, it appears, is unthinkable: allowing the public to choose their next president and representatives in Congress. It appears that the last thing Democrats want is for the unanimous decision to actually lead to an outbreak of democracy. Where theCourt expressly warned of ""chaos""in elections, Raskin and others appear eager to be agents of chaos in Congress.Soon after the decision, Raskin went on CNN to assure people that he and his colleagues would not stand by and allow the right to vote to be restored to citizens in the upcoming election. He pledged to reintroduce a prior bill that would declare Jan. 6 an ""insurrection"" and that those involved ""engaged in insurrection.

Cori Bush, D-Mo., to disqualify members got 63 co-sponsors, all Democrats.Raskin's participation in this effort is crushingly ironic. In 2016, he sought to block certification of the 2016 election under the very same law as violent protests were occurring before the inauguration.The prior bills were sweeping and included members who did not engage in any violent acts (no member has been charged with such violence or even incitement) but merely opposed certification).Raskin recently offered a particularly Orwellian argument for thedisqualification of Trumpand his colleagues in Congress: ""If you think about it, of all of the forms of disqualification that we have, the one that disqualifies people for engaging in insurrection is the most democratic because it's the one where people choose themselves to be disqualified. ""SUPREME COURT RULES UNANIMOUSLY FOR TRUMP IN COLORADO BALLOT DISQUALIFICATION DISPUTEIn other words, preventing voters from voting is ""the most democratic"" because these people choose to oppose certification… as he did in 2016.After the ruling, Raskin added the curious claim that the justices ""didn't exactly disagree with [the disqualification theory]. They just said that they're not the ones to figure it out. It's not going to be a matter for judicial resolution under Section 3 of the14th Amendment, but it's up to Congress to enforce it.""Rep. Jamie Raskin offered a particularly Orwellian argument for the disqualification of Trump and his colleagues in Congress.

CNN_Clean_2023_result_921,human,"(CNN) &#8212; Anyone looking to buy a house knows that this is not a great time. During the pandemic, mortgage rates were at their lowest level inhistoryand housing was cheaper. It took just about 20% of the median family income to pay for a mortgage with 20% down. Today, mortgage interest rates are up - the30-year fixed rateis currently 7.63%- and so are home prices. Americans need about35%of their income to pay for a mortgage, which is higher than at the peak of the so-called housing bubble in the early 2000s.Unfortunately for homebuyers, there is almost no hope that we'll return to the affordable housing days of 2020. More concerning, there is little indication that recent trends will reverse or that homebuying will get much more affordable in the near future.The main reason homebuyers are struggling is that the cost of borrowing has gone up for everybody. After a burst of inflation, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates at one of the fastest paces in its history. The Fed has taken its targetinterest ratefrom near zero at the beginning of 2022 to almost 5.5%today.But the Fed's rates mainly affect short-term borrowing. Even more important for mortgages are long-term interest rates that recently hit peaks.One of the main reasons for those higher long-term rates is unprecedented levels of federal deficits and debt. This year the federaldeficit, excluding the reversal of the government's student loan forgiveness plan, hit $2 trillion, a level once inconceivable in peacetime. The Fed has also beenreducingits holdings of many long-term federal bonds and evenmortgage-backed securitiesbacked by the federal government."
CNN_Clean_2024_result_63,human,"We need a repeal bill now.We concede that the questions of when and how to go about repealing Comstock involve complex strategic considerations. It is reasonable to worry that a repeal bill would draw even more attention to the Comstock Act and inadvertently confer legitimacy on the broad antiabortion interpretation. Moreover, courts might view a failed repeal effort-and given the current Congress, failure is likely-as evidence that Congress believes the Comstock Act is good law and applies to all abortion, not just illegal abortions. It's true that courts sometimes look to thissubsequent legislative historyto interpret laws, though doing so is generally disfavored for good reasons.These concerns are real but should be evaluated alongside other strategic considerations. Most notably, as already described, antiabortion extremists are already hard at work pushing their interpretation of the Act into the mainstream discourse. Ignoring those strategies will not stop them from gaining momentum unless those in power call out the severe (and absurd) consequences of enforcing this law.And antiabortion judges wouldn't need a failed repeal attempt to achieve the outcome they want. They can and will rely on Comstock's current text whether Congress tries to repeal the law or not.Federal courts in Texasandthe Fifth Circuitof the US Court of Appeals have already accepted the antiabortion interpretation without a whisper of Congressional action to repeal the Act. And there are ways to mitigate the risks of a failed repeal bill. The bill could include ample language in the preamble or purpose section that explicitly rejects any endorsement of the broad, antiabortion interpretation of Comstock.The risks of a repeal effort also need to be balanced against the benefits. We are not naive enough to think the repeal law will pass in this Congress given theRepublican-controlled Houseand lack of a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. Nonetheless, there is much to be gained in introducing a repeal bill that forces every federal legislator to take a public position on Comstock.With a repeal bill on the table, representatives would have to state publicly whether they defend a law written at a time whenwomen couldn't vote, couldn't say no to their husbands'sexual advances, werebarred from most professions(including the legal profession), and had their legal identity disappearupon marriage. They should be forced to say whether they support banning not only abortion-inducing items but also lingerie and sex toys and any other items that could be put to ""indecent or immoral use."" And perhaps most forcefully, they should look their constituents in the eyes when they explain that, with Comstock still on the books for an antiabortion Department of Justice to enforce, there will likely be nowhere for them to go when they need an abortion resulting frompregnancy complications,inevitable miscarriage,fetal anomaly,rape,incestorunwanted pregnancy.Again, the Comstock Act has no exceptions and applies nationwide. Everyone implicated by the act, even pregnant people, are subject to punishment, and the penalties for violating the act are steep:federal prison time and fines.It's time for legislators who support abortion rights to take control of the conversation - to force their colleagues to say the quiet part out loud and to vocalize their support for these draconian laws. And even if a repeal effort fails, making Comstock an issue now might influence voters to choose a president and other politicians in November who do not want Anthony Comstock's moral judgments, from a bygone era, governing our modern life.Opinion by David S.

The congressional political hearings held back in December and theorchestrated campaignto pressure the presidents of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard to resign, were not about protecting Jewish people; they were a strategic takedown of diversity initiatives.The same strategic takedown has continued this past week with thesubpoenas issued by the House Education and Workforce Committee, chaired by GOP Rep.

It's reminiscent of a similar effort to weaponize longstanding criticisms of affirmative action that centered on Asian American students at Harvard in 2022.

Otherwise, they could risk being seen as not committed, passed over for promotion or worse, let go.Adia Harvey-Wingfield, a sociologist who studies race and work culture told me that right to disconnect laws are a step toward recognizing workers' rights to their own time and independence, especially for workers who feel they can't say no to employer demands without repercussion. ""This is often the case for underrepresented workers due to their heightened visibility and stereotypes about their work ethic,"" she wrote in a, yes, late-night email.

They often have no control over their time.Right to disconnect laws don't ensure stable schedules. They don't require shorter work hours, which is a problem in the United States. Unlike in many other advanced countries, there is virtually no legal limit to the number of hours some salaried workers can work in the US, and no legally-guaranteed paid time off for any worker. (A 1938 law mandates overtime pay for hourly workers putting in more than 40 hours a week, though the Biden administration isseeking to extend overtime to salaried workersin non-supervisory positions earning about $58,600 a year or less. )Nixon, Harvey-Wingfield and I had the choice to work and answer emails during non-work hours, and the flexibility and power to take our personal time back later. Most of these workers don't have that option.Giving workers across the board more choice and control should be at the heart of any attempt to redesign work.

FinancialPost_Clean_2024_result_3,human,"For effective interest rates to remain below GDP growth over the next 33 years would require a similar unexpected acceleration in inflation. But this is ruled out in the federal projection, which shows GDP inflation quickly returning to its target value of two per cent and remaining there.A second controversial assumption is that the government will allow program spending to fall as a share of GDP while revenues rise broadly in line with GDP. The resulting increase in the government's operating balance - its revenues minus its program spending - also helps drive the debt ratio down. The slower growth in program spending occurs because increases in many transfer programs are limited by legislated escalators and the growth in target populations. Judging from experience, however, it is very unlikely that any party in power will allow the real value of these programs to decline substantially. Three decades of fiscal austerity is not in the cards.Our approach to forecasting the debt ratio is to assume instead that program spending stays constant as a share of GDP over the projection period. We then assess debt sustainability by holding the operating balance at 1.2 per cent of GDP, its value in 2028-29, the last year of the government's medium-term forecast and the starting point for our sustainability analysis.The third and most important limitation of the federal debt sustainability projections is that they don't include a provision for the discretionary stimulus spending that inevitably accompanies economic downturns. Building in recessions and the typical government response provides a better idea of the likely fiscal impact of recessions. Over the past 60 years there have been five significant downturns, all of which have prompted governments to respond with temporary stimulus averaging 1.1 per cent of GDP to support incomes. In contrast to automatic stabilizers like Employment Insurance, which increase debt during downturns and reduce it during upswings, these discretionary measures ratchet up a permanent increase in debt.In our own alternative debt projections, we assume program spending grows at the same rate as GDP and that on average over the projection interval interest rates are the same as GDP growth. In our own simulations(https://www.cdhowe.org/public-policy-research/ottawa-needs-new-approach-fiscal-policy), we capture the effects of economic downturns on the debt ratio by playing out 1,000 randomly generated scenarios in which future recessions and government responses to them are similar to those over the past 60 years.This more realistic analysis(https://www.cdhowe.org/intelligence-memos/lester-laurin-federal-debt-not-sustainable) reveals a more turbulent path ahead, with quite a different denouement than the government's smooth slide to a low debt-to-GDP ratio. In our simulations, there is a 50-50 chance that late in the projection period the debt ratio will in fact exceed its 2028-29 value."

FinancialPost_Clean_2024_result_44,human,"According to a recent report(https://on360.ca/policy-papers/public-private-partnerships-is-a-reassessment-underway/) published by the think-tank Ontario360, some of Canada's worst-performing infrastructure projects have been PPPs, including Ottawa and Toronto's new light rail lines, which have been plagued by technical challenges, construction delays and cost overruns. Even when projects are delivered on time and within budget, they can be more costly to the taxpayer. In 2014, Ontario's auditor general reported that such projects had resulted in significantly higher costs ($8 billion) to the province.What is the likely outcome of the investment bank? The Ontario ministry of finance has a strong reputation and can be expected to set up the OIB quickly and capably. The bank's new leadership will be under political pressure to demonstrate results. A few ""quick win"" investment announcements will be portrayed as proof of success. But the actual benefits, costs and efficiency of these projects will not be known for many years. If they get built on time, it will only be by drawing resources away from other projects. Even if they get built within budget, they will be expensive.Despite the weak business case for it and the many possible unintended (negative) consequences, the OIB is almost certainly going ahead. So here are a few ways to maximize its value and minimize its risk.First, give it a very focused mandate to start with. Long-term care homes and affordable housing answer clear public policy needs, have easily identifiable roles for the private sector and relatively low risks - at least when compared with energy and transportation infrastructure projects.Second, ensure taxpayers are protected by a robust investment framework reviewed and approved by the auditor general. Clear and binding financial accountability is in everyone's best interest, especially given public skepticism regarding recent Ontario government dealings with the private sector (in the Greenbelt and at Ontario Place, for instance).We need faster, fairer assessments of major energy projects(https://financialpost.com/opinion/need-faster-fairer-assessments-major-energy-projects)Banning flavoured vapes would promote harm, not reduce it(https://financialpost.com/opinion/banning-flavoured-vapes-promotes-harm)Rapid public-sector growth means flat living standards for us(https://financialpost.com/opinion/canada-public-sector-growth-means-flat-living-standards)Finally, devote some policy attention to the real problems inhibiting infrastructure project delivery - the shortages of skilled labour, project delivery capacity and contract management expertise. Without action on the supply side, adding the OIB to the demand side won't help and may even make things worse.Brian Lewis, former chief economist for Ontario, is a senior fellow at both the C.D.

CNN_Clean_2024_result_249,human,"(CNN) &#8212; Vice President Kamala Harrisvisiteda Planned Parenthood clinic in Minnesota Thursday, marking the first time that a USpresident or vice president has publicly visited an abortion provider.After Democrats spent years trying to sidestep this issue for fear of alienating Catholic voters, the Biden administration is now a staunch defender of reproductive rights following the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision in 2022, which overturned Roe v. Wade and the right to abortion nationwide. The stop in Minnesota marks part of the vice president's ""Fight for Reproductive Freedoms"" tour.The event marks a turning point in the relationship between President Joe Biden and his vice president. Until recently, Biden has not done much to bolster his controversial partner. He saddled her with some of thethorniest issuesthat the administration faced (such as immigration), and many members of Harris' inner circle claimed she had beensidelinedby the president. Meanwhile, Republicans, along with much of the press,pilloriedherfor making public statements likened to ""word salad,"" and seized on the dysfunction among her staff. Last year, NBCfound49% of voters had a negative view of Harris, compared to a 32% who had a positive view of her. The net-negative 17 rating was the lowest for a vice president in the history of the poll.Now, as the election heats up, Biden seems to see that Harris could be pivotal to his reelection campaign. Although vice presidents have not typically determined the outcome of elections, in this particular case Harris' performance in the coming months will be essential.That, of course, is due toongoingconcernsabout Biden's age (at 81, he's the oldest president ever) and whether he will be able to govern effectively for a second term - an issue that has been consistently registering in the polls. There is every reason to believe the election will be extraordinarily close, coming down to slivers of the electorate in just a handful of swing states. The more that Harris can start to shine - and the more she can convince the public that she has what it takes to be a national leader - the better the odds will be that Democrats may enjoy another four years of power in the White House.At a time when support for Biden is shaky among some key constituencies, includingyoung and Black voters, the vice president will be on the campaign trail trying to connect with these voters. She has also been spending time behind the scenes, trying tobreak out of Biden's campaign bubbleto find out what problems need to be addressed, and how to get Democrats excited about backing the president again.Stopping in Minnesota is one pillar of this strategy. Few issues have been more energizing to suburban women than the Dobbs decision, which has led to a draconian rollback of reproductive services inmany red states. If anyone thought that there were limits to how far states would go, the Alabama Supreme Court's decision undermining in vitro fertilization (IVF) has been another wakeup call. (Following swift backlash, the state legislature then passed a law aiming to provide criminal immunity to providers and patients for the destruction of or damage to embryos. )Harris has taken to the stump to speak directly about a number of other contentious issues, including theIsrael-Hamas Warandvoting rightswith a level of fervor and directness that doesn't always come naturally to the president. Her voice will be especially important given that the Biden reelection team seems to want to preserve the preisdent's energy and focus on the most important events.Harris will also be important in taking on the more traditional role of a battering ram against the opposition."

This long-awaited witness in the Manhattan criminal trial of former President Donald Trump ultimately checked important boxes for both sides - though more for the prosecution. This was to be expected, as they called her to the stand.Daniels, the adult film actress who received a $130,000 hush money payment in 2016, is a witness to the heart of the felony false business records case against Trump. Prosecutorsallegethat the documents were falsified to cover up Trump's payment to suppress her story of a sexual encounter with him (which Trumpdenieshappened). They claim the payment was, among other things, made with the intent of illegally influencing the presidential election.We can break down Daniels' testimony by five critical ""C"" components:Curiosity:From the moment Daniels entered the room on stage right, the jury's eyes - indeed, all eyes in the courtroom - were on her. That included Trump, as he repeatedlyglancedtoward and away from her as she began her testimony. She was dressed conservatively, her all-black outfit setting off her pinned-up blond hair as she told her story. Juries expect to meet the key players in a case and will reward the prosecution for providing them, as the district attorney's office did here.Character:Assistant District Attorney Susan Hoffinger spent the first 15 minutes or so of direct examination introducing Daniels to the jury. She was not what they might have expected from the label ""porn star."" The jury was attentive as she put on her black horn-rimmed glasses and began testifying about her childhood in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, her love of horses and her scholarship to the Texas A&M veterinary program, and her career as an actress in both adult and mainstream films, a director and a writer of scripts and books. Like any of us, juries need to get to know a witness and Hoffinger took the time to do that, conveying a likable persona through biographical details.Credibility:Next, Daniels testified in detail about meeting and having sex with Trump in 2006, establishing for the jury that the alleged encounter happened -and that she is credible."
Politico_Clean_2023_result_119,human,"In Chevron, the court held that where a statute is susceptible to multiple reasonable interpretations, courts should generally defer to the understanding favored by the federal agency that administers the law.The Chevron doctrine has drawn fierce criticism, particularly from the court's conservative justices. That should come as little surprise given that those same justices often oppose the policy initiatives advanced by agencies under Democratic presidential administrations. When the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Centers for Disease Control took action against Covid-19, for example, it was the conservative justices who pushed back on the ground that the agencies had exceeded their lawful authority.If anything, though, the justices' partisan voting patterns illustrate why we need the Chevron doctrine in the first place. The crux of the doctrine, after all, is a bet on democracy over juristocracy. When Congress enacts an ambiguous law in a scientifically or politically fraught field and authorizes an agency to implement that law, to whom would we rather entrust responsibility over that law: unelected judges, or a president who is accountable to voters for his agencies' actions?For decades, a bipartisan slate of justices (including the late Antonin Scalia, one of Chevron's most ardent defenders) chose the latter approach. Yet the court seems poised to overrule this venerable precedent and hold that it, not the president we choose, should ultimately be in charge of solving our nation's most complex and freighted policy challenges in diverse fields such as environmental law, public health and immigration.Finally, the most high-profile legal issues that may make it to the court this term involve the pending prosecutions of Donald Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his mishandling of classified documents. The court has not yet granted review, but it seems likely they will wind up at the high court because Trump has already signaled that he intends to raise constitutional defenses based on official immunity and the First Amendment.If these defenses are rejected before trial, the former president would likely need to wait until after final judgments - and potential convictions issued by juries of everyday Americans - to appeal to the Supreme Court. Given the looming 2024 presidential election, though, it remains quite possible that the justices will need to rule on Trump's arguments during the coming term.Notice, however, the fundamental dynamic that would characterize such a ruling. The court would be asked to override the considered views of a jury of citizens in favor of its own lawyerly take. Yet as Alexis de Tocqueville once remarked, it is the American jury that ""places the real direction of society in the hands of the governed... not in that of the government."" The pending Trump prosecutions thus represent another area in which the justices may soon decide who is responsible for resolving our most pressing societal problems: us, or them?None of these outcomes are set in stone. Perhaps the justices will buck recent trends and humbly recognize across these areas that they do not possess any magical insights - and that their repeated, overconfident intervention can harm the public more than it helps. That would be a welcome development.Or perhaps the court will continue its imperial march, adding even more power to its already impressive portfolio. If it does so, though, the cost to its public legitimacy will be steep. Faced with the prospect of rule by an unaccountable and self-aggrandizing court, after all, the American people will find yet more reason to demand significant structural court reforms, such as term limits, jurisdiction stripping and even court packing.So as the court kicks off its newest term, the stakes could not be any higher. Not just for the court as an institution, but also for concerned Americans - and for our very idea of self-rule."

Last year, I correctly predicted that 2023 would see the ""hottest phase"" of what has become the biggest and bloodiest war in Europe since World War II. Here's my assessment for 2024.Moscow will likely escalate hostilities in the first quarter of the year, aiming to force Kyiv to capitulate, ahead of Vladimir Putin's run for re-election in March. As neither Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy nor the Biden administration are likely to hand Putin such a clear victory - losing face in the process by signing a peace agreement on Putin's terms.BIDEN'S 'AS LONG AS IT TAKES' APPROACH IN UKRAINE HAS FAILED: HERE'S WHYA unit of border guards on the front line in trenches on Dec. 26, 2022, in Bakhmut, Ukraine. A large swath of the Donetsk region has been held by Russian-backed separatists since 2014. (Pierre Crom/Getty Images)Alternatively, and more likely, none of the three sides - Moscow, Kyiv and Washington - would be willing to compromise. In this case, the conflict will grind on until it reaches the threshold when the level of attrition of Ukrainian manpower becomes unacceptable to its citizens - probably in summer, early fall - or till the U.S. government stops sending weapons and money to Kyiv. At that point, active combat operations will gradually transition to low intensity fighting, with occasional flare-ups. And by 2025, the conflict will be ""frozen,"" with no formal peace settlement in place.Contrary to President Biden's and the Washington establishment's expectations, and tragically for Ukrainians, Kyiv's victory remains mathematically impossible. Here's the basis for my analysis.Russia holds an overwhelming military and economic advantage over its former Soviet satellite. Since the very start of the war, Russia has held an overwhelming military and economic advantage over its former Soviet satellite. Despite the valor of its citizens and episodic tactical successes - such as a missile strike on Tuesday that damaged a Russian warship in the occupied Crimean port of Feodosia - strategically, Ukraine is in a deadlock with Russia, fighting a losing battle of attrition.There's a reason why the Pentagon considersRussia a ""near peer competitor."" The war in Ukraine, has not changed this view, according to Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall. Kendall acknowledged last year that, although the Russian military has experienced logistics and command and control problems in Ukraine, his service's plans for countering Russia remain unchanged, still calling for modernization of the U.S. combat arsenal.While Russia has suffered significant losses in the past 20 months in Ukraine, the Russian military remains very well resourced, in manpower and matériel.

For his legion of passionate supporters, he is more than a politician. He is like a sports team or a rock band that helps define who they are as much as the families and communities to which they belong.Republican rivals, led by former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, have been unable to shake the loyalty of voters to Trump. Indeed, the entire ""anti-Trump"" contingent in the party, from conservatives who want to replace him to the handful of moderates who want to purge everything he stands for, hasn't shown it can move the needle. Trump keeps coming out on top.There are many reasons behind the passionate loyalty that Trump commands within the base. Many of the ideas that he has championed, including his nativism and skepticism about US alliances overseas, resonate with voters in the evangelical, working class and rural coalition that has constituted his base. Many of his policies as president, such as corporate tax cuts, tariffs on China and deregulation, sit well even with Republicans who don't have a strong taste for his political style.There is also the purely practical calculation. In a party that has become fiercely partisan in recent decades, there is the perception that Trump offers the best odds of reclaiming the White House in November's election, despite his performance in 2020 and detrimental influence in 2022. (Never mind that polls show that, if the election were held now, Haley would romp to victory over Biden while Trump and the president are essentially tied).Given that Trump has successfully sold election denialism to his supporters, the argument that the four indictments of the former president are a form of persecution makes sense to them. In Iowa, an entrancepollshowed that a large number of Republican voters don't believe that Biden won the 2020 election and many would consider backing Trump even if he is convicted of a crime.To understand Trump, however, it is also important to recognize that he has become a cultural phenomenon within large swaths of the GOP. He has been able to sell his role in politics as something akin to a sports team, a popular musician or a social media influencer.His ""base"" supports him without any reservation and without any sense of doubt."

But sometimes - as in Ethan Coen's and Tricia Cooke's wonderful ""Drive-Away Dolls"" - they're more adventurous. Then, you get to root not just for those outside the law, but for a different law, and a different world: in this case, a world in which Florida's homophobic politicians are driven from the state with dildos (metaphorically, more or less. )Coen, best known for his collaborations with his brotherJoel, co-wrote andco-directed""Drive-Away Dolls"" with his wife and queer filmmaker, Cooke.

But the car they pick up just happens to be carrying a contraband suitcase and a mysterious smoking box. The suitcase and box are tied to a scandal involving conservative Senator Gary Channel (Matt Damon) - and he wants his things back. As the bad guys come after them, Jamie and Marian attempt to turn the tables and beat the criminals at their own game, as in many a heist movie.The film has an effervescent camp punch quite different than classic Coen Brothers' productions - from the psychedelic interludes to Jamie's over-the-top Texas drawl and libido. But even amidst the fun and the retro setting, the script is clearly and deliberately aware of what's happening in Florida right now.When Jamie and Tricia see Sen.

Access to green space is especially valuable for residents who may not be able to travel easily beyond city limits.On May 22, 2024, the nonprofitTrust for Public Landreleased its annualParkScore report, which ranks U.S. cities based on the quality of their parks. Beyond tallying how many parks a city has, the rankings also consider the share of residents who livewithin 10 minutes' walk of a park. This recognizes that in the U.S. and other wealthy countries,affluent white neighborhoods often have more parksthan low-income areas and communities of color.Access is important, but I believe making people feel included and welcome is equally important. If parks do this well, people will be more willing to use them.I aman urban geographerand study how parks affect social interaction in diverse communities.My studentsand Iare examininghow people interact with the built environment ofPhalen Regional Parkin St. Paul to understand what leads people to experience this park as awelcoming and inclusive space. I believe Phalen Park offers useful strategies that other cities can emulate.Phalen Park is among St. Paul's largest parks, covering 494 acres (2 square kilometers) ᅳthree times the size of Disneyland. It includes a 198-acre lake encircled by a trail, watercraft rentals, scenic views, a golf course, an amphitheater,sculptures, a playground and two pavilions for picnics, performances and other gatherings.One important feature is St. Paul's sole public beach with lifeguard services. Many low-income households around the park don't have access to places where they can swim for free. Providing a safe place to swim helpsreduce this inequity.People in the Twin Citiesuse parks in a variety of ways. For example, Asian American park visitors are 2.5 times more likely than others to attend family events in parks, while Black park visitors are 1.75 times more likely than others to go fishing there. InsurveysandinterviewsI have conducted, people from many social groups report that they use Phalen Park because there are so many things to do there and there are diverse groups of people in the park.Community organizations use the park's green spaces and shoreline for year-round public events and festivals. The park hosts cultural performances, community gatherings such as movie screenings, and regional events such asfreshwater stewardship activitiesanddragon boat races.These free events cater to many different age groups, attract diverse crowds and promote cultural learning and positive interracial encounters. Phalen Park is one of the most-visited parks in the Twin Cities, with anestimated 1.1 million visits in 2021.There are many practical reasons for cities to invest in public parks. Studies have found that visiting green spacesreduces stressand that people who live within half a mile of a public parktend to get more exercisethan those who lack access to safe places for walking, biking and recreation. Public parks provide spaces where people can gather for free, or sometimes for a nominal permit fee.However, it's important for visitors tofeel safe and welcome. Due to a legacy of racial segregation, and to uneven investment in parks, that doesn't always happen.In Chicago, for example,white and Hispanic groups have clashedover using certain segments ofThe 606, an elevated park that follows the path of an old rail line. These encounters have led some Hispanic visitors to avoid using parts of the park. In turn, white visitors say this distancing makes them feel suspicious of groups of Hispanic people in the park.The Twin Cities typically perform well in ParkScore ratings ᅳ for 2024, Minneapolisranks secondamong U.S. cities, followed by Saint Paul ᅳ but there's still room to improve. The Trust for Public Land has identifiedsignificant differencesin park access between people of color and white residents in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Neighborhoods in St. Paul where people of color are the predominant group have access to24% less park space per person than the city's average neighborhood.St. Paul has a diverse population that measures 54.3% white, 18.3% Asian, 15.6% Black and 8.6% Hispanic,according to 2023 census estimates."

In essence, realistic optimists chart their course by acknowledging the present while envisioning a brighter future.In my book ""The Perfect 10,"" I delve into the profound lessons of realistic optimism through the stories of Sir Ernest Shackleton and Viktor Frankl. Frankl's ability to find meaning in the present moment enabled him to endure the darkest days of captivity under the Nazis. Similarly, Shackleton's remarkable mental fortitude enabled him to defy overwhelming odds and lead his team to safety.What I call realistic optimism goes beyond mere positive thinking; it's a mindset that blends practicality with hopefulness. It's about facing challenges head-on while maintaining a constructive outlook.These stories vividly demonstrate howresilience of spiritcan empower individuals to surmount seemingly insurmountable challengesᅳa valuable lesson for recent college grads and young professionals embarking on a career journey, where the future awaits as an open canvas ready to be painted."

The idea of slowing down is ingrained in us as if the number of years lived should correlate with a reduction in adventure. But stories like that of Saroj Patel, who, well into her years, took to the skies for a second skydiving adventure, challenge this notion in the most exhilarating way.Patel's decision to skydive alongside her adult grandchildren isn't just a testament to her adventurous spirit ᅳ it's a powerful statement about the vitality that can thrive at any age. It's easy to assume that such high-octane activities are reserved for the young, but Patel's experience reminds us that the boundaries of age are often self-imposed.Her inspiration, drawn from the late President George H.W. Bush, who famously continued to skydive into his 90s, is a poignant example of how adventure knows no age limits. Bush's jumps were more than just stunts; they were declarations of an undying zest for life. Patel embodies this same ethos, proving that age is not a barrier but a backdrop against which we can paint our boldest strokes.There's a unique courage in embracing adventure later in life."

We understand that the first step is being transparent and clearly explaining the reasoning behind the initial decision. Despite widespread narratives, Isais was not removed from her position because of anti-police views, her personal or political views. She was removed because her tweets violated oursocial media guidelinesandjournalistic ethics, and ultimately endangered our staff as well as our organization's reputation. When someone represents a news organization and celebrates or endorses harm publicly, they draw the same level, or even more, harm to the rest of the staff. As leaders of this organization, our priority is the safety and well being of our staff, especially those from marginalized communities. We know our initial actions were not perfect and we have been working to address mistakes made in haste. We started addressing these mistakes by deleting our first statement ᅳ the Twitter thread regarding its deletion canbe found here. We have also provided Isais with copies of her unpublished columns to give her an opportunity to publish them elsewhere. Additionally, we extended the opportunity for her to write a piece explaining the sentiment behind her tweets because we understand her views come from a place of pain and lived experiences and these views are largely unrepresented in mainstream media. In recent years, our organization has been addressing its faults, and we are committed to being more diverse and inclusive in the work we do, the staff we hire and the journalism standards that we abide by. We want to explicitly note that not all of the decisions made about how to address Isais' demands were made unanimously."
state_press_opinion_2020_result_0,human,"As the number ofCOVID-19 cases in Arizona continues to grow, theASU Community of Care Coalition, a group of faculty, staff and students formed last summer in opposition to ASU reopening for in-person instruction, remains deeply concerned about the harmful impacts of ASU's pandemic policy on University workers. The Community of Care Coalition'stown hall, hosted on Sept. 11, made it clear that ASU has not extended its “care” to all workers. The University community should not only be asking, but demanding to know how workers have been affected by their rushed return to campus and ASU's less than thoughtful implementation of COVID-19 policies. The Multicultural Solidarity Coalition was correct when it stated thatASU terming itself a “community of care” was an act of violence. The return to campus already putmarginalized communities at greater riskand was further compounded by the exploitation of working people. While ASU claimed to be prepared to care for and house returning undergraduate students, the experiences of our undergraduate community assistants, who assist in coordinating resident hall activities, demonstrate that this was not the case. CAs have submitted these stories in solidarity with the Community of Care Coalition to shed light on the conditions undergraduate student workers were forced to live and work in, as well as ASU's failure to treat workers with dignity, care and respect. From the beginning, ASU's upper housing administration excluded CAs from decision making processes and were less than transparent about how COVID-19 and housing related decisions would be made."

Among these guidelines was a troubling section which stipulated that those studying in the states on M-1 and F-1 visas would have toreturn to their nations of origin during the coming semestershould their classes be fully online. We, the College Republicans at ASU,believe that this decision is cruel and irrational, and it will only degrade American education and our nation's legacy as a global hub for academic excellence. The U.S. remains, despite the wanton cries of an out-of-touch media, the last best hope for freedom on the face of the earth. Weexceed all other nationsacross the world in our acceptance of foreign migrants, and we remain the most longed after nation in the world. While this is a result of our nation's commitment to law and order, it is also a reflection of a genuine belief."
