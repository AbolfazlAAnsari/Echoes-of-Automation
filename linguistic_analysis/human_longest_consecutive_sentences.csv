While the lack of purple packaging and photocards left many U.S. ARMYs underwhelmed, the meal was certainly a hit. The sauces had a special uniqueness to them that made them memorable to fans and regular consumers alike. Even as fans were upset at not receiving the special purple packaging that had been promoted, they were all in agreement that the sauces saved the experience. While I personally preferred the Sweet Chili sauce, Cajun seemed to be a general favorite among the public given its spicy flavor kick."
rice_thresher_opinion_2021_result_4,human,"Since the president is the figurehead of the university and a member of the board, most of the credit or blame for whatever decision is made about the statue will fall on them. Because of this, we think it's only fair that President Leebron doesn't ignore his responsibility to solve one of the most contentious issues at Rice in recent memory and simply pass this decision, and the ridicule that will inevitably come with it, on to incoming-President DesRoches. To be clear, we are not advocating one way or the other with respect to the placement of the statue. Rather, we are calling for a decision to be made on the statue in the next few months. Yes, selecting a Black man as the next president of a university is a step toward addressing a fundamentallack of diversityin the leadership of top universities across the country ᅳ as Leebron so astutely pointed out in his Sept. 13, 2020 instagrampost. But this selection cannot serve as an excuse to remain neutral and silent on an issue with this level of racial sensitivity. Furthermore, the appointment of DesRoches cannot be seen as a fix-all solution to meeting the demands of Black students at Rice. To the Board and other members of the administration, please do not use the recent news as an excuse not to pursue progress."
rice_thresher_opinion_2022_result_25,human,"But then, during the second week of classes, college presidents attempted to clarify by saying, technically, students could retrieve their second plate from the cashier after exiting the servery and eating their initial meal. Students began to follow that guidance, but H&D cashiers seemed unaware of this policy in some instances, and confusion ensued. Originally, we had planned to write this week's editorial promoting our solution to the allocation of plates while regulating who can access the servery. We spoke to students, college presidents and staff, but it was only after speaking to David McDonald, the senior director of Rice housing and dining, that the policy became clear. According to McDonald, students can reenter the servery as many times as they'd like for drinks and portions in smaller plates and bowls that are available throughout the servery. The only line that seems to explain that policy in the FAQ states “the swipe and plate(s) is the ticket to entry and once you have that it is all you care to eat.” We're used to reading and interpreting campus policies, and we cannot connect that FAQ statement to the policy as McDonald explained it to us. We believe that the specifics of the meal swipe and servery entry policies were not made remotely clear."

Crimson_2022_extracted_articles_result_165,human,"This Board did not mince words about the “farcical legal theatre” behind the opinion, reflecting its apparent belief that there is no legal basis for the decision. Accordingly, it made only casual use of technical terms like “fundamental right” at the heart of long-running doctrinal debates to draw sweeping legal conclusions that its reasoning could not support. This needlessly obscured the powerful moral argument at the heart of the piece: that women's bodies should not be conscripted to carry unwanted children to term. It is, of course, entirely reasonable to have serious grievances with the ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson, and that doesn't require any knowledge of the law."

rice_thresher_opinion_2022_result_33,human,"But it is also the place I have met some of my best friends and formed some of my favorite memories. Speaking to the journalism experience, the Thresher is a student media group, and in my four years I've seen how important both of those words are. We get a lot of attention for being “media,” and as a group with a large campus presence and channels to communicate with a majority of the broader Rice community, it's important we take this seriously. The other part of that is “student.” We are students first and we are constantly learning in our roles with the Thresher. Because we want to be held accountable by the community, we value feedback from readers as the best way for us to learn and grow and make sure the paper continues to fulfill its role on campus."
Crimson_2022_extracted_articles_result_149,human,"In the midst of an add-drop period that many students are treating as the shopping week they'll never have again, the pressure to find classes that are simultaneously interesting, requirement-fulfilling, and chill enough for students to catch a breath is intense. With Harvard offering more than3,700 coursesin 50 different undergraduate fields of study, students here should have their pick of the litter of classes that satisfy their personal trifecta of interest, requirements, and acceptable workload. There are more than enough classes for every Harvard student to logistically achieve the well-roundedliberal arts and sciences educationthat the College so prides itself on delivering to students. Yet in practice, few Harvard students pursue such a liberal arts and sciences education, even as the College encourages it with requirements and special programs."

rice_thresher_opinion_2021_result_39,human,"I believe the statue should be replaced by new art, created by a Black student or former student of Rice University. This art might be abstract, might be neutrally emblematic, such as an owl, or might in some way commemorate and honor the achievements of Rice students of all ethnicities, with the achievements of BIPOC students given pride of place. I further believe that, if possible, Rice's ashes should be removed from the plinth and laid to rest respectfully elsewhere on campus, marked notably but less centrally and less monumentally. I believe the wreath-laying ceremony should be removed from commencement, perhaps performed more privately at another time, and replaced within commencement with something less religiously exclusive. But I believe all of these changes centered on the statue should be only one aspect of the program we adopt. A museum area recording the university's problematic history would be much better than a statue in the middle of the quad. And I would be incredibly proud to say my university was instituting a program of reparationssuch as the one being undertaken by Georgetown University, including offering legacy admission status to descendants of the Black people the Rice family enslaved, and whose exploitation profited Rice, which profits our university was founded with."

newuniversity_california_irvine_opinion_2022_result_43,human,"That's been a theme in their communications throughout the pandemic, and that's a shared opinion of many on AGS and of many of our constituents who have told us that they're frustrated by the lack of transparency and detail in the University's communications,” Winer said. Winer emphasized that AGS had “urged the university repeatedly to consult student government leadership,” yet claims they were never consulted. Consultation and clear communication with members of our community is imperative, especially on an issue that involves student's safety and health. In addition to allegedly failing to consult members of the community, UCI's statement on returning to campus lacks a clear scientific basis. Sternclaimedthat the decision was based on “a recent decline in the Omicron surge, in both case counts and positivity rate,” and ultimately, “[COVID-19] models predict that this will continue.” It's also never specified what “models” Stern is referencing. In contrast, Chancellor Howard Gillman'sstatementon Jan 6. explained that UCI was remaining online due to both high case numbers at UCI and in Orange County as well as a shortage in staffing and faculty. However, Stern never addressed what specifically changed about these factors that now make it safe to return to campus."

Crimson_2022_extracted_articles_result_128,human,"The report does discuss the prominent antebellum abolitionists who had graduated from Harvard or worked there, but it spends far more time listing selected Harvard affiliates who owned slaves before 1783, when Massachusetts abolished the institution. As the data in the report shows, Harvard men favored the Union over the Confederacy by a wide margin during the Civil War. Union soldiers from Harvard outnumbered Confederates by 1,358 to 304, and 176 Union soldiers died, compared to 70 Confederates. The report does not mention that the builders of Memorial Hall, where the names of the Harvard Union dead are honored, did not memorialize those 70 graduates, presumably because they were traitors who had fought to destroy the Union and preserve slavery. The sum of dead Confederate soldiers from Harvard and the report-mentioned Harvard faculty and staff who owned a confirmed total of 70 slaves before 1783 falls considerably short of the total of Union dead from Harvard, to say nothing of the larger number who fought and survived."
stanforddaily_opinion_2020_result_359,human,"Fighting for this dream entails fighting for secular democracy, fighting against discrimination and violence, and fighting for a radical concept of equality unlike anything the world has ever seen. In the sheer scale and ambition of the project that was envisioned in 1947, independent India was among the greatest gambles in human history. Here was a nation determined to be secular in the aftermath of a religion-based partition, a nation that had chosen to go forward with universal adult franchise at a time when many disputed racial equality, and that chose unity despite being constituted of at least 2,000 different ethnic groups. In the summer of 1947, the sovereign, socialist, secular, Democratic Republic of India had the conviction to simultaneously and definitively rebuff both the monarchists of yore and the homogenous nation-state paradigm of Europe. As a country, India courageously chose to sidestep millennia-old fault lines of religion, caste, ethnicity, and race, and instead, endeavored to build a just society, based on the simple premise of human dignity for all."

Aside from the confusing mixture of shame and excitement this brings me, I hope to vote with intent and thoughtfulness. Cliches abound about the importance of voting this year, including claims from both parties that this is the most consequential election in our country's history. With this added pressure, it seems critically important to deeply understand the issues at hand more so than who supports them. As a graduate student, the only thing I have (somewhat) mastered in life is taking exams, so I use an old trick of the trade as I open my ballot envelope: start with the easy questions."

CAPS undeniably bears part of the blame: Counselors are often “under-trained,” and CAPS's Telehealth service has been overwhelmed during the pandemic. Yet, as Gabriel and Thompson's article notes, these are also indications of deeper problems that arise from systematic underfunding. Though CAPS's approach to student mental health crises is not without its issues ᅳ the current 5150 process, for instance,discourages many studentsfrom seeking help ᅳ many also stem from a lack of institutional support."

rice_thresher_opinion_2021_result_22,human,"This week, we transition to (mostly) in person instruction after one and a half years of largely doing classes online. Half of the undergraduate population at Rice has never experienced traditional in-person classes here, and for the other half, that experience is a distant memory. The same can be said for instructors who had to adopt a completely new method of teaching and now are trying to mix the two. Just as we had to adjust to online classes, we must adjust to in-person instruction after such a long time without it. Students and professors alike must be understanding of the challenges each face in this new chapter and continue to be flexible with one another. In-person classes at Rice are unfamiliar for some students and distant for others, but can be daunting for all this semester. Freshmen have varied experiences in terms of the delivery method of classes in their senior year of high school, and all went throughtwo weeks of online classesat Rice and may have many large classes still online."

rice_thresher_opinion_2021_result_34,human,"According toPresident Leebron's announcement on fall planning, most classes are expected to be in person, most university housing is expected to be fully occupied and COVID-19 policies regarding gathering restrictions are expected to be relaxed. The road forward for many Rice students is clear: Sign up for a vaccine appointment as soon as possible and wait for more than 80% of the Rice community to be fully vaccinated so that COVID-19 policies can be relaxed. For the administration, the road forward is less clear, as they face obstacles planning fall semester until a larger portion of the student body reports their status to Crisis Management via aVeoci form. However, as next semester slowly approaches, we ask the administration to account for international students in their plans, and keep in mind how different areas of the world are adapting to the pandemic. International students may not have the same access to the vaccines ᅳ87% of vaccineshave gone to wealthy countries, and even then, only14% of the EU populationhas received their first dose compared to36% of the U.S. ᅳand travel back to Rice may be restricted for them next semester. For an international student in China, where FDA-approved vaccines are not available, it might make sense for them to wait to receive their shot until they are in the U.S. But if they choose to do that, they will likely be forced to quarantine upon arrival in Houston. Even after they receive their shot, they still won't befully vaccinated, at least according to the CDC, until two weeks after their second dose (or first if it's Johnson & Johnson)."

The University of California currently rests on the periphery of a massive decision: to make massive cuts to our students and workers, or to use a tiny portion of their endowment and capital reserves to prevent all austerity measures and maintain the integrity of education at UC. According toresearchdone by AFSCME 3299, which is UC's largest employee union, the UC has upwards of $10 billion it can use in the short term to cover all COVID-19 related costs and to maintain a safe environment for its students and workers. However, our experience as students at UCI has shown that administration cares far more for profit and for order than it does for the students and workers who create our campus community.

rice_thresher_opinion_2020_result_23,human,"When the movement to take down Willy's statue started this summer, administration pointed to the incomplete work of the task force on Slavery, Segregation and Racial Injustice and delayed any concrete commitments to take down the statue. Although academic studies of Rice's history with slavery are valuable, conversations surrounding Willy's statue cannot and should not be visited solely through an academic lens. While conducting investigative research on Rice's legacy of racial injustice is incredibly important for an informed reckoning with our history, the voices of our present community should receive equal attention to those of the past. Students are protesting now and thus deserve acknowledgement now, not in a year when the research is released. We understand the purpose of the task force's research is to produce comprehensive recommendations, but by waiting for the end result, the administration fails to address the situation in real time. It would only make sense for the task force to comment on one of the most pressing issues of racial justice and reckoning on campus today, even without an official document."

state_press_opinion_2020_result_7,human,"Since then, we've had hours of conversations throughout our newsroom to decide how we want to move forward and improve as an organization and begin repairing relationships with communities that were damaged by this. We understand that the first step is being transparent and clearly explaining the reasoning behind the initial decision. Despite widespread narratives, Isais was not removed from her position because of anti-police views, her personal or political views. She was removed because her tweets violated oursocial media guidelinesandjournalistic ethics, and ultimately endangered our staff as well as our organization's reputation. When someone represents a news organization and celebrates or endorses harm publicly, they draw the same level, or even more, harm to the rest of the staff. As leaders of this organization, our priority is the safety and well being of our staff, especially those from marginalized communities. We know our initial actions were not perfect and we have been working to address mistakes made in haste. We started addressing these mistakes by deleting our first statement ᅳ the Twitter thread regarding its deletion canbe found here. We have also provided Isais with copies of her unpublished columns to give her an opportunity to publish them elsewhere. Additionally, we extended the opportunity for her to write a piece explaining the sentiment behind her tweets because we understand her views come from a place of pain and lived experiences and these views are largely unrepresented in mainstream media. In recent years, our organization has been addressing its faults, and we are committed to being more diverse and inclusive in the work we do, the staff we hire and the journalism standards that we abide by. We want to explicitly note that not all of the decisions made about how to address Isais' demands were made unanimously."

rice_thresher_opinion_2020_result_81,human,"Last Sunday, Ashley Fitzpatrick began a write-in campaign against the previously uncontested internal vice president candidate Kendall Vining. While the Thresher's editorial board normally endorses candidates in contested races, we were unable to reach a consensus on endorsement for the IVP role of either Vining, a Martel College sophomore and former new student representative, or Fitzpatrick, a Martel sophomore and current senator. Vining's platform rests largely on her ability to bring an “outsider” perspective to the SA's executive team due to her lack of involvement in any official SA role this year. We recognize the value of Vining's vantage point as non-establishment ᅳ her plans to introduce ideas rooted in the non-SA student experience could certainly help foster stronger connections between the SA and student body. Fitzpatrick, on the other hand, is decidedly an “establishment” candidate.Being steeped in the establishment in this way could make it harder for her to understand and mitigate students' frustrations with the SA Senate that develop on the outside. However, we also recognize the pragmatic advantages of Fitzpatrick's previous experience as a senator: More so than Vining, she demonstrated a detailed knowledge of the inner workings of SA procedures, referencing the ongoing internal audit, for example. We recognize that these internal experiences place Fitzpatrick in a better position to fix internal issues, but she lacks a concrete plan to encourage unity and cooperation in the SA."

The median, of course, does not represent these racial demographics in their entirety, but the intersection of race and wealth certainly seems to impact test results.

rice_thresher_opinion_2020_result_54,human,"This Thursday, the Faculty Senate will meet to finalize theirApril 22 agenda.As an editorial board, we endorse the measures they plan to vote on. As students, we are suggesting they take a step further to consider more accommodations such as making finals optional for all students. We also ask that professors take proactive steps now to adjust their classes, regardless of what the Faculty Senate eventually decides. We endorse all of the measures already in consideration, and urge the Faculty Senate to vote in favor of them on April 22. The extension of the drop deadline for courses until after grades are made available will essentially allow students to have a pass/no credit option. An extension of the pass/fail deadline will allow students to pass/fail a class if their letter grade turns out lower than expected. Removal of academic punishment, like probation and suspension, relieves significant burden especially for graduate students, who have yet to receive sweeping accommodations. We believe that all of these measures should be discussed and approved given the changing circumstances caused by COVID-19. However, additional measures should be considered ᅳ not just by the Faculty Senate, but by administrators and professors themselves."

stanforddaily_opinion_2020_result_8,human,"As a Stanford undergraduate with left-wing economic and political views, I am conflicted about the current iteration of controversy regarding Stanford's relationship with the Hoover. On the one hand, I have certainly benefited intellectually and politically from the work of fellows at the Hoover by having my views consistently challenged by the positions expressed in their work, such as through the essays, discussions and videos created as part of the Human Prosperity Project. On the other hand, it is precisely knowing that the positions taken in the Hoover fellows' research will be of a fixed disposition that concerns me, as this stands in contrast with Hanson's observation that universities should, “encourage inductive reasoning to investigate challenging issues, not to dismiss them when they don't fit political agendas.” As a think tank producing research of an ideological bent, the Hoover fulfills an important niche in the political landscape by proliferating discussions on political topics. However, this is markedly different from the role of the university to provide the groundwork for these discussions by dispassionately uncovering new information. To illustrate this point, I think it will be useful to examine Hanson's paper that was published by the Hoover Institution as part of their Human Prosperity Project. Additionally, Hanson states in hisrecent op-ed, “Scholarship, and its dissemination among the broader public, are the major criteria by which all Hoover senior fellows are annually reviewed.”  Thus, analyzing an example of the scholarship published by the Hoover can also give an indication of the standard used by the institution to determine what it publishes. In “Our Socialist Future?” Hanson rejects “a socialist theme: those who had more should not have had more and were obligated to give much of it back to those from whom it was taken.” To build his case, Hanson walks the reader through an array of historical, political and cultural examples of the socialist theme he rejects, and I similarly invite you to walk with me through Hanson's arguments."

Over the years, Fossil Free Stanfordhas continuedto call on the university to live into its values and embody its commitment to future generations. While Stanford diddivest from coalin 2014, it still lags behind other institutionslike Harvard,DartmouthandPrincetonby continuing to hold other fossil fuel assets and associate with fossil fuel companies. The science is clear: Fossil fuel use is causing an unprecedented increase in the atmosphere's concentration of greenhouse gases. The resulting climate and environmental impacts are undeniable and painful, particularly for frontline communities around the world ᅳ communities that many Stanford students and alumni hail from. Stanford's continued investment in and association with fossil fuel companies also stand in stark contrast to the mission of the new Doerr School of Sustainability to “create a future where humans and nature thrive in concert and in perpetuity.” Stanford's decision to continue acceptingresearch funding from fossil fuel companies through 14 industry affiliate programsmakes a mockery of the School's mission and hampers the University's ability to support real climate solutions. By continuing to accept fossil fuel funding, Stanford is aiding and abetting fossil fuel exploration and extraction and pushing research towards false climate “solutions” that benefit fossil fuel companies instead of  communities. The continued investment in fossil fuels sacrifices Stanford's credibility and integrity in the eyes of its students, faculty, alumni, policymakers and the public."

The Community of Care Coalition'stown hall, hosted on Sept. 11, made it clear that ASU has not extended its “care” to all workers. The University community should not only be asking, but demanding to know how workers have been affected by their rushed return to campus and ASU's less than thoughtful implementation of COVID-19 policies. The Multicultural Solidarity Coalition was correct when it stated thatASU terming itself a “community of care” was an act of violence. The return to campus already putmarginalized communities at greater riskand was further compounded by the exploitation of working people. While ASU claimed to be prepared to care for and house returning undergraduate students, the experiences of our undergraduate community assistants, who assist in coordinating resident hall activities, demonstrate that this was not the case. CAs have submitted these stories in solidarity with the Community of Care Coalition to shed light on the conditions undergraduate student workers were forced to live and work in, as well as ASU's failure to treat workers with dignity, care and respect.

While I agree with all of these arguments and am disappointed by the Senate's actions, I will ignore those in this piece. What I am presenting today is simple: There were unacceptable conflicts of interest, or at least the appearance of them, which went unaddressed. To maintain confidence in our governance system, the results must be nullified, and the resolution should be brought back for a vote where conflicts of interest are addressed. There are three distinct areas of conflicts of interest that I will discuss: program and research funding, research partnerships and personal finances.

To the three of us, this is a slap in the face to everything the MOB, and indeed Rice, stand for. According to Rice Athletics, our removal and replacement is an improvement as Rice moves toa better conference, and they say a conventional band will attract and animate crowds to improve the home advantage our basketball teams enjoy at Tudor Fieldhouse. To us, this means the MOB, and the quirky side of Rice that we represent better than anything else, is unwelcome in Rice's cold, corporate public image as it seems to reject the “unconventional wisdom” it uses as a selling point. For decades, the MOB's incarnation as the Basketball Owl Band has performed at dozens of basketball games each season, lead crowd chants, and put on comedic half-time shows. If waving our cutouts of memes while wearing Aloha shirts can't attract the crowds Athletics is looking for, then a run-of-the-mill pep band, with no energy to give outside of their stand tunes, will fail. String and miscellaneous instruments obviously don't fit that insipid sameness of nearly every other basketball band that Athletics wants to copy. Violins are hardly even audible over percussion and wind instruments, so Athletics must think the mere sight of unexpected instruments risks frightening off attendees. But James, the MOB's accordionist, can readily affirm the opposite: He and fellow members of the Stringatronics section, like our cellist and ukulelist, bring a wow factor that nothing can come close to replicating."

rice_thresher_opinion_2022_result_54,human,"Based on her abundance of concrete ideas and willingness to learn about the SA, we, the Thresher Editorial Board, believe Crystal Unegbu to be the better candidate for Student Association internal vice president. Unegbu has many tangible ideas for how to improve Standing Committees and the New Student Representative program, the main responsibilities of the internal vice president. While both candidates want to increase NSR involvement within their home colleges, Trisha Gupta's main focus was to advocate for proving some voting capacity in the position. Unegbu also supported this change to an extent, but she had many more ideas for improving the capacity of the role. Namely, Unegbu wants to get NSRs more involved with their residential college governments with stronger mentorship from college presidents and senators, be more involved in senate debriefs and provide more support from committees for the NSRs as they navigate the role. One of the biggest issues with the SA that persists each election season is low engagement with the student body. While Gupta had a few ideas on how to further utilize existing channels for engagement such as social media and listservs, Unegbu took on a critical view of the issue and emphasized the need to plan more events where students can learn about SA committees, have one-on-one conversations with senators from across campus and encourage general student attendance in retreats. That being said, we are wary of Unegbu's limited experience not just with the SA but the campus in general, being only a freshman. Having been on campus for barely six months, we believe that more time in the SA could benefit Unegbu in achieving her platform. It is important that the IVP understands the issues that concern all of the campus, and Unegbu has mostly had exposure to the concerns of new students through her position as Hanszen College NSR. Although Gupta has more years of experience in the SA, currently serving as chief of staff, her ideas were not as thought out and novel as Unegbu's. There is much that could be changed within the SA, and we believe that Unegbu is most poised to recognize these issues and seek out innovative solutions to persisting problems."

The recent history of the modern state of Israel has, irrespective of its government, been inextricably linked with the oppression of the Palestinian people. Though this is not necessarily inherent to the abstract notion of the state itself, such subjugation has characterized the Israeli state in reality. Since 1967, the West Bank has been under military occupation, a legal status that grants Israel functional control over the area while circumventing the obligation to grant Palestinians Israeli citizenship and the rights and privileges this designation would afford."

Student RAs are on the front lines, serving their peers in some of their most extreme moments of crisis, as well as providing everyday support that should not be overlooked. They do their best despite training that is inadequate for the mental health crises that they must handle, struggles to be heard and supported by the administration, low pay and more, all on top of leading their own lives. Currently, student RAs bear the brunt when formal institutional resources for student well-being lack the funds to meet student demand. In terms of these formal institutional resources, I see two major areas in which increased funding would greatly benefit students: Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) and wellness-oriented curricula (spanning Wellness Education, Health and Human Performance, LifeWorks, Institute for Diversity in the Arts, the Office for Religious and Spiritual Life, the Leland Scholars Program and more)."

I told myself I'd also major in history because I loved the subject, but more importantly because history could provide my imaginary start-up with an “ethical framework” for solving contemporary social problems. Though I was not aware of it at the time, this early self-conception of my Stanford education emerged out of my family history. My parents both arrived in the United States in the winter of 1989, a few months after participating in the pro-democracy protests of Tiananmen Square that June. In China, they were part of a burgeoning group of pro-Western university students who hoped to fashion a new political future for their country. But when that dream evaporated after the government clamped down on political protests across the country, they arrived in the United States as immigrants. Their histories became intertwined with the American Dream as they joined an influx of college-educated and highly-skilled immigrants who came from Asia in the 1970s and 1980s to the United States, hoping to achieve financial success in the West. Like so many of my friends from similar backgrounds, I felt that my responsibility as a second-generation immigrant was to complete this family history of economic progress, through a career as an engineer, doctor or lawyer (in that order of desirability), in the hope of fulfilling what is now so pervasively enshrined as the “myth of the model minority.” My understanding of my family's history, then, influenced the way I thought of my own life trajectory, and where a Stanford education would fit within it."

Vaca talks about “The Memory Index” like it is a beloved family heirloom passed down from generation to generation ᅳ and for him, it likely is a culmination of many different pasts and presents. “For me, as a first-generation Mexican-American,” he said, “I have a really interesting story in that I didn't learn Spanish growing up. In a lot of ways, my mother's memories, my father's memories, their memory keeping of their own stories and their own childhoods really helped bridge the gap between my present [and my past].” A nice touch in the novel, Vaca told me, is that one of the protagonists, the determined and whip-smart Freya, shares her last name with Vaca's mother. Izquierdo was his mother's maiden name, and so having a piece of her in this story is something that makes his words glow with pride."

While at first appearing to just be an off-hand comment about the size of the class, the professor used it to observe that there seemed to be a dwindling number of undergraduate students who are interested in studying Europe, both historically and contemporarily. His observation initially didn't strike me as odd at all; there seems to be some sort of disclaimer about how there are less and less students who are interested in studying history, and then there is the omnipresent issue of the dwindling number of students studying the humanities in general. But, putting aside the existential crisis about the humanities for a little, I am interested in exploring why Europe in particular might be fading from the limelight of historical studies in the United States. One factor that I believe contributes to this is the belief that Europe is slowly falling off the pedestal it has been sitting on for several decades. For a region once considered exotic, new and uncharted by a large number of Americans, and by extension students, studying the continent no longer contains the allure that it did in the past, and thus attracts less and less attention from students. While students would take classes about European history to learn about European cities, the history that they contain and dream about what cities like Paris, Madrid and Berlin were like, it is now more likely for someone to have traveled to them on a family vacation or through study abroad and had that experience first-hand. After all, why take a class on the history of Europe when you can just go to the cities and look at them yourself?

We thought that fossil fuel companies representeda not entirely dissimilar rogue capitalism, willing to break the planet in the name of their business model. By the end of that year, there were hundreds of divestment campaigns underway at American colleges, including, of course, one at Harvard. And Harvard's then-University President Drew G. Faust was among the first leaders in higher education to respond, with a 2013 letter explaining why the University would never divest. It was a farrago of defensive nonsense: Among other things, she argued that, “given our pervasive dependence on these companies for the energy to heat and light our buildings, to fuel our transportation, and to run our computers and appliances, it is hard for me to reconcile that reliance with a refusal to countenance any relationship with these companies through our investments.” Her argument, in short, was that Harvard couldn't divest from fossil fuels until fossil fuels were no longer important ᅳ which makes, if you think about it, no sense at all. One isn't surprised that the fossil fuel industrylovedHarvard's stand, but I confess it saddened me enormously that The Crimson Editorial Board in those days loved it too,scoldingthose who stood up to the fossil fuel industry.

While I don't normally care about grades and believe they threaten the important role of intellectual curiosity in the classroom, I feel compelled to write this piece because so much of the dialogue I've heard surrounding grades and the FGLI community has not originated from the FGLI community itself. In addition, I'm concerned that a very small group of students connected to the Undergraduate Council appears to be advocating on behalf of the majority of students in favor of universal grading, whereas the majority of students I've talked to are perfectly content with the status quo and feel upset about this misrepresentation. In fact, I've heard that the UC's internal processes were not totally transparent about the “Double A” advocacy campaign, and the subsequent UC survey sent out to the entire student body about grading preferences for the spring semester seemed to assume that students wanted some sort of advocacy on their behalf for a change to the current regulations. And during the final edit of this piece, the UC called an “Emergency Meeting” to endorse a grading policy for the College, yet the only two proposals up for discussion were both in favor of universal systems despite the fact that in the survey that they themselves conducted, more students expressed preference for an opt-in pass-fail policy than a mandatory pass-fail policy. Building flexibility into a grading structure in a time of global crisis and mandating universality are two very different things. For example, flexibility might look like a small relaxation of the policies that restrict students' ability to count pass-fail courses toward concentration requirements in an “Opt-in system” asUniversity of Pennsylvania,Cornell,Duke, and so many other schools have instituted."

Without any clear details on how this transition would work or what would happen to the staff, other than the requirement to transition the 129-year old publication to online only, the administration's overuse of power here is a blatant attack on free press. By Friday afternoon, the president had walked the decision back to “allow” the paper to continue print editions through the remainder of the semester. However, this concession does nothing to address the core issue: university administration using their positions to lord their power over student media, undermining the editorial independence of college journalism. We are fortunate at the Thresher to have an administration that respects us as a newspaper, even when we criticize or question them, often on this page. But at a private institution like Rice, we technically havefewer baseline rightsthan student journalists at public institutions; a fact that allowed President Leebron to unilaterallysell KTRU's station and tower in 2010without warning or explanation.

The proposed changes to the pass/fail policy do not serve to ameliorate students' academic integrity or academic performance, but rather unnecessarily limit flexibility and discourage intellectual curiosity and exploration.

Though one thing is clear, the enforcement is driven by complaints as West St. Paul's city council stated that the removal of the sign was not because of its content and that the removal was due to the fence simply violating the rules set forth. Enforcement by complaint, however, creates inconsistent enforcement as the code is not enforced uniformly and creates a space for harassment. This is made clear by Weyandt's past experiences with messages on his fence, as the city had never gotten involved before the current complaints were received. The supposed neutrality taken by the city council is also a problem as their fear of allowing public art in the case of hateful messages to spread across the city is not a common reality.

Trust in institutions is the sine qua non of democratic stability; in a public sphere marked byrising polarization,increasingly inexperiencedleaders, andpartisan fracturing, continual distrust threatens total upheaval.

stanforddaily_opinion_2021_result_55,human,"Recently, former Provost John Etchemendy sent aletterto the editor in which he made several false and misleading claims criticizing Abolish Stanford and defending the Stanford University Department of Public Safety (SUDPS). Throughout the letter, Etchemendy demonstrated an ignorance of both student demands and abolitionist principles, arguing for a misleading position of “community safety” that relies fundamentally on carceral solutions. The former Provost's comments ᅳ which argue that we should “promulgate the standards and style of SUDPS nationwide” ᅳ are alarming in the context of SUDPS's violent history. Etchemendy consistently positions SUDPS as an exception to the long history of police violence, but it was during histenureas Provost that an SUDPS Deputy was involved in themurderof East Palo Alto resident Pedro Calderon at the base of Stanford foothills. No reparations were ever made to Calderon's family, and Stanford ᅳ as Etchemendy's own comments indicate ᅳ seldom acknowledges that the event occurred. Etchemendy's letter is part of a larger pattern to which we've grown accustomed: Administrators pay lip service to ideas of “equality” and “justice” while actively refusing to take any concrete steps to realize these ideals. Last week, on the one-year anniversary of the murder of George Floyd by theracistMinneapolis Police Department, students received an email from four Vice Provosts that “thank[ed] our community centers, student leaders and student organizations for continuing a legacy of activism focused on the most vulnerable,” citing theBlack Lives Matter memorialAbolish Stanfordhelped constructon the Oval last June, and recognizing “those creating change after so much unconscionable loss.” Conveniently, their email omitted the fact that when the BLM memorial was actually up on the Oval, we were repeatedly informed that we had to take it down,or the administration would take it down for us. Acknowledging the importance of scrutinizing University messaging and uplifting the truth, we at Abolish Stanford would like to take the opportunity to respond to some of the wildy deceptive claims advanced in Etchemendy's May 20 letter to the editor.

Released in May, the change increased the burden of proof and barriers to reporting sexual violence at the federal level, and Harvard seized this opportunity to seem committed to survivors in comparison. However, Harvard students, especially survivors of sexual violence, know there are major cracks in Harvard's prevention and response to sexual violence. We see these cracks in the allegations of sexual harassment in theAnthropologyandGovernmentdepartments that were overlooked for years, in the severe understaffing of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, and in Harvard's continued refusal to implement an affirmative consent policy, under which only a clear and continual “yes,” communicated verbally or physically, would count as consent. As organizers with Our Harvard Can Do Better, an undergraduate group of survivors and allies working to dismantle rape culture at Harvard, we are all too familiar with these gaps."
Crimson_2021_extracted_articles_result_144,human,"Harvard's newly formed Committee to Articulate Principles on Renaming explicitly instructs its members “to ensure that renaming won't result in erasing history.” But the recent rebranding at the Radcliffe Institute has clearly put an important piece of that history at risk. Slapping “Harvard” in front of what is now to be called the “Harvard Radcliffe Institute” is a retrograde step, conveying the same devaluation and loss of sovereignty once marked by a woman's change of name upon marriage. With Radcliffe College, once Harvard's sister school, gone, the institute remains the sole institutional flag-bearer of a name that still represents, for a great many, the long and continuing struggle for parity. The rebranding is particularly baffling ᅳ and galling ᅳ because the wound has been self-inflicted, imposed by the institute itself. At a stroke, it diminishes the legacy of women's history at Harvard, hard-fought since the late 19th century. In officially joining the University in 1893, the new college took its name from Ann Radcliffe, an English Puritan, and Harvard's first female benefactor. She endowed an annual scholarship with a gift of £100 in 1643, not long after Harvard was founded."

The message was insensitive to students applying for gender-inclusive housing, and shocking after ASU's claims of providing a respectful and safe space in the gender-inclusive housing process, but students are continually misidentified. Chao said even though their situation was resolved, the University never reached out with an apology or update on the housing process as a whole. Previous students have had similar problems with the University continuously deadnaming and misgendering them, leading some to believe that ASU is not actively doing anything substantial to prevent this insensitivity. ""We were all kind of taken aback, really frustrated because they hadn't mentioned anything about (the insensitive message) that we'd seen before … it just came as a shock and none of us were happy about it,"" Chao said of their experience with the application process.

There is much I have loved during my time at Stanford, and it would not be difficult to fill an article recounting all of those things that have brought me joy. All the same, I realized that I could only honestly characterize my opinion of Stanford as one of ambivalence. Informally, saying, “I'm ambivalent” is akin to saying, “I don't care,” but this is not the sense in which I am using the word. I am actually trying to say the opposite: that I have intensely mixed and contradictory feelings toward Stanford. I have nurtured some of the greatest friendships of my life at Stanford, and if I can claim that I have something called an “identity,” I owe it in large part to the people I have met here. That being said, I constantly fret that my networks at Stanford have closed me off from people outside the Stanford bubble, and I worry that I have embedded myself in undeniably elite circles. In seminars and lectures, I have grappled with ideas that have put into question everything else I thought I knew. In these settings, I contended with the violent consequences of classical liberal tenets which I had been unquestioningly reverent of in high school; I questioned my received need to ground all novels and artworks in historical fact; I considered for the first time what it meant to live with an awareness of death."

Israel, on the other hand, wants to kill Hamas' fighters, and the killing of soldiers in an enemy army is expected and permitted in war. Israel is not trying to kill everyone in Gaza but to free its hostages and remove Hamas from power. Protesters at Stanford deny Israel's right to exist within any borders at all, calling its creation “settler-colonialism.” This concept may properly describe the English landing at Plymouth Rock. However, when applied to Israel, it is a loaded term that sweeps aside 3,200 years of Jewish history in which an indigenous people have re-established their ancient homeland after the invasions of successive empires, including one 1,400 years ago that brought Arabic and Islam from the Arabian Peninsula.

In thearticle“'All out for Palestine' protest sees 2,000 at Houston City Hall” from Oct. 17, Associate Vice Provost Catherine Clack discusses the Rice Students for Justice in Palestine sign-making event at the Multicultural Center in the wake of the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks in Israel. She states “... how is this something that we should oppose when it's an exercise of free speech?” I respect the complexity of issues related to the Middle East and recognize the importance of representing a spectrum of views. But while free speech is a cornerstone of academic discourse, it is imperative that we distinguish between fostering open dialogue and supporting dangerous rhetoric. The slogan “From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will Be Free,” prominently displayed in the group's signage, was popularized in the 1960s by the Palestinian Liberation Organization. It helped the PLO ᅳ recognized at the time as aterrorist organization by the U.S. State Departmentᅳ amplify its calls for the dismantling of the state of Israel. As thePalestinian National Charterof 1968 said, “Palestine, with the boundaries it had during the British Mandate [i.e., from the river to the sea], is an indivisible territorial unit … Claims of historical or religious ties of Jews with Palestine are incompatible with the facts of history.” The official policy of Hamas, aU.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizationwhich conducted the Oct. 7 attacks, includes the slogan almost verbatim. Hamas' 2017Document of General Principles and Policiesstates, “Hamas rejects any alternative to the full and complete liberation of Palestine, from the river to the sea.” Other signs read “Resistance is not Terrorism,” and “Resistance is Justified.” They seem to cast the Oct. 7 Hamas attack as legitimate resistance."

DEItracesback to the 1960s when a series of legislative victories pushed schools, workplaces and other institutions to prevent discrimination against protected classes, such as race, gender and age. DEI initiatives include “addressing discriminatory hiring practices, pay inequity or rectifying issues that cause poor employee retention rates among marginalized groups.” While DEI can look different across organizations, what remains constant is its efforts to go “beyond avoiding discrimination and to actively changing organizations so that they [are] more welcoming and more inclusive,” according to NYU professor Erica Foldy."

The 2012 story gained traction in local media, but those outlets failed to account for the fact that the transports “occurred nearly universally out of anabundance of caution,” evidenced in part by the fact that all 10 who were hospitalizedwere released early in the morning. While I am not certain if that abundance of caution was the case at this year's iteration, the reason given in Dean Bridget Gorman's message to undergraduates implies a similar strain on caregiving resources caused by the quantity of intoxicated students, not the severity of individual cases. “NOD-gate” in 2012 sparked the imposition of a new round of alcohol restrictions the following spring, but of a much less drastic nature than those imposed this year with the cancelation of several publics.

Now, nearly three weeks after Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine's encampment in Harvard Yard began, Harvard has placed at least 20 students on involuntary leave, with others facing disciplinary proceedings.

Those of us arrested in the fossil fuel campaign were able to return to our schooling and lives essentially untarnished, to continue our studies, commune with friends, and ultimately brush off our encounters with the law (we received no criminal convictions). The shift from empty displays of public reprimand to the substantive punishment of involuntary leave is alarming, denying students procedural protections and the right of appeal in an attempt to silence peaceful student protest. Disciplinary action against student activists is a choice ᅳ and the University's choice of when to discipline student activists is telling.

These are essential questions that we will be pursuing, but the focus of this essay is more basic. On one level, the EHLI taps into an age-old question: what is the relation between speech and a social contract?

rice_thresher_opinion_2023_result_57,human,"During the Student Association senate meeting on Monday, Feb. 27, student leaders shot down a proposed resolution calling for the Faculty Senate to prohibit midterm exams or major assignments being scheduled during both the week of and after Beer Bike. Though we agree with the SA that this proposal is far too unrealistic to ever get through Faculty Senate, there is some merit in the intentions behind it. As part of the Rice community, faculty should understand the cultural significance of Beer Bike as the ultimate Rice tradition ᅳ for all of campus ᅳ and consider avoiding scheduling exams or major deadlines immediately after it. To be clear, we don't believe the university can or should force faculty to change their syllabi around Beer Bike. However, we believe it's in the best interest of students and faculty alike to consider the effect of student participation in Beer Bike. It is unreasonable to expect that this cultural event, that by its very nature includes large amounts of socializing and a disastrously little amount of sleep, won't impair academic performances the following Monday. If the faculty's ultimate goal is to help students learn, they should recognize that students likely won't do their best work during this time, and having exams or important assignments due at the start of the following week sets students up for failure. We don't see why professors cannot work around Beer Bike in their syllabi the same way they would (or are supposed to) work around a midterm recess. With that in mind, we also strongly encourage Rice Program Council to decide on Beer Bike timing as early as possible, so that all of campus can prepare in the way we are asking them to. We know that the idea of academics being second to drinking and partying is unfathomable at an institution like Rice. But Beer Bike cannot be equated to deciding to grab a drink at Pub the night before an exam. The latter is pure irresponsibility on the students' part, while the former is a campus event and tradition that not only enriches the Rice culture, but also expects the participation of all students. The possibility that any student might decide to miss out on this annual experience to not fail an exam or bomb a presentation is a shame that should be avoided at all costs."

Crimson_2023_extracted_articles_result_58,human,"The Harvard Law Review is one of the oldest and most widely cited legal journals in the country. I participated in the grueling endeavor of the six-day writing competition to join the Law Review, like many other first-year law students, because of the chance to engage with emerging literature by leading legal scholars. As a student interested in human rights and humanitarian law, I knew there would be few opportunities to publish international scholarship within the journal due to its generalist nature. And yet, I never could have imagined that during my tenure as an editor of the Law Review, I would have to argue that international law is real, that atrocities are occurring in Palestine ᅳ as they had occurred in Israel ᅳ and that truly “reviewing” the law requires engaging scholars from diverse backgrounds with uncomfortable perspectives. All of this came to a head last month when the Harvard Law Review solicited and subsequently voted to reject publication of “The Ongoing Nakba” by Rabea Eghbariah. The decision to silence Eghbariah has called into question our commitment to academic freedom, and has made us complicit in thecontinued silencingof Palestinian activists and scholars across the country. The Harvard Law Review must correct this harm, or forever bear the legacy of silence in the face of grave injustice. Thedecision to quash“The Ongoing Nakba” came in the form of a collective revocation vote, a deviation from the standard procedure for blog posts. Though the piece was solicited, edited, and approved through the usual process, its publication was delayed and eventually rescinded by a nearly six-hour emergency meeting of the full editorial body ᅳ a practice that to manycurrent editors' knowledge, had never occurred for a solicited piece. In considering publication, editors' concerns ranged from fear of public backlash to more disconcerting criticism of the substantive claims of the piece. During our lengthy deliberations, I couldn't help but wonder, were objections to the article genuinely based on worries about factual mischaracterization? Or rather, were they grounded in fear of what the piece argues: that when it comes to Palestine, no number of citations are enough to prove violations of international law. In the days after we reversed course, it became obvious to me that the Harvard Law Review had joined many other students, academics, and journalists across the United States, acquiescing to thePalestine exceptionto free speech."

In the 1920s, George Foot Moore published “Christian Writers on Judaism” in the Harvard Theological Review ᅳ still among the most scathing rebukes of academia's entrenched habits of Christian anti-Judaism. Moore was also among the few Christians at the time to emphasize the need for a view of “Judaism on its own terms.” Many followed in Moore's footsteps: Krister O. Stendahl, an expert in the New Testament who was Dean of Harvard Divinity School from 1968 to 1979, was among those on the forefront of Christianity's grappling with its legacy of antisemitism after the Holocaust. And among Moore's students was Harry Austryn Wolfson, Class of 1911, the first professor in the United States to serve as a chair devoted singularly to Jewish studies, who advocated for the central importance of the history of Jewish thought ᅳ not just for Jews, but for all students. These are hardly obscure figures: They are giants in the field who shaped the academic study of religion at Harvard. They are often cited as exemplars of the Divinity School's vision of academic excellence, historical rigor, and multireligious inclusion. They ensured the study of religion at Harvard must include difficult conversations about the past roots and present shoots of hatred.

It is a funny form of shared governance where the elected representatives of the postdoctoral community (SURPAS) did not get the opportunity to choose who will fill the important role of helping select a new Provost.

One does not become a postdoc at Stanford unless they are brilliant, driven, thoughtful, and deeply knowledgeable about academia. Further, the issues facing the postdoctoral community are cross-cutting and deeply felt as demonstrated in the recentSURPAS Long Range Planning Report.

A program prioritizing the study of Russian is unlikely to pay thoroughly rigorous attention to the complexities of the Russo-Georgian relationship, nor the moral pitfalls associated with utilizing Georgia as a safe haven for studying the tongue of its irredentist neighbor. And considering that Georgia's list of official languages notably snubs Russian, a language its citizens actively decry, the endeavor borders on disingenuous. The program ᅳ surely benign in intention ᅳ should find a home where the imperial Russian threat is less salient. In 2008, Russia invaded Georgia from its northern border, killing 228 civilians and occupying 20% of Georgia's territory. The West's response, which rejected Georgian arms requests and limited itself to shoddy geopolitical compromises, sent a message: Georgia stands largely alone. So, no matter one's perspective on theimmutability of identity, the Georgian population's broad hostility toward the recent influx of Russian migrants might be expected. Georgian legislation stipulates that all business signs and advertisements must display the Georgian script and offer services in one of its two state languages (Georgian or Abkhazian).

Trump also welcomed other vigilantes into his circle, giving a prime speaking slot at the Republican convention to Patricia and Mark McCloskey, the St. Louis couple facing charges (to which they pleaded not guilty) for brandishing guns at protesters who walked down the private street in front of their house.The embrace of these armed suspects might seem to contradict the right's ""law and order"" message."

CNN_Clean_2020_result_4,human,"(CNN) -- In a broken, angry, dysfunctional Middle East, most matters associated with Arab-Israeli peace rarely turn out well. In fact, for a Trump administration that has demonstrated an uncanny clumsiness and obtuseness, this has been a region where American ideas go to die. The formal statement today announcing normalization of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) may prove to be something of an exception.For three parties -- Israel, the UAE and the US -- it's a rare coincidence of interests and a clear win. For another, the Palestinians, it's a stunning loss and a clear reflection of how much the region has changed at their expense. Indeed, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas quickly called it ""aggression on the Palestinian people"" and ""a betrayal of Jerusalem. ""Israel's plans to annex parts of the West Bank may have been temporarily suspended, but anyone who believes we are any closer to a negotiation -- let alone an agreement to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- ought to lie down and wait quietly until the feeling passes.In a way, today's headline of normalization of relations between Israel and the UAE is part and parcel of a trend line that has been building for some time now: a surprise warming of relations between Israel and Arab states in the Gulf, during the Trump presidency.Three significant factors have driven it.The rise of Iran, and of Sunni jihadists spewing terror across the region, has created a narrow but important coincidence of interests between Israel and the Gulf states. Increasing exhaustion and frustration with the longstanding Palestinian cause has led Arab states to feel a bit more freedom to pursue their own interests, in spite of it.But behind it all lay a White House enamored of Arab money for arms sales and investment in the US and eager to marshal the Arabs in the service of its anti-Iranian and pro-Israeli agenda. Indeed, in an effort to court the Gulf Arabs, Trump and his Middle East envoy son-in-law Jared Kushner have established close personal relations with senior officials in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and its ambassador here in Washington. And Arab nations, sensing opportunities with an autocrat-friendly US president, have been only too happy to follow.It was no coincidence that last month, two marked Emirati aircraft landed at Ben-Gurion airport carrying Covid-19 supplies for the Palestinian Authority, which rejected them, asserting this was a cover for normalizing relations between the UAE and Israel, as The Times of Israel reported.For Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this announcement couldn't have come at a better time.

I also found it in multiple nationally syndicated comic strips, whose Black characters' exaggerated features and stereotyped language came straight out of the Jim Crow playbook.Society news, of course, was all white, as were nearly all people in advertising and in news photographs, except for a very few sports figures.I'm so glad to see Mr. Staples shine a light on this brazen racist influence, which reached into millions of homes every day and for generations stealthily fortified systems of racial oppression.Mary BishopRoanoke, Va.To the Editor:Brent Staples's essay is an important reminder of how the Fourth Estate has sought to dehumanize Black America for much of the country's history. His article highlights the importance of teaching critical race theory in schools.Indeed, racism is not just the consequence of individual bias or prejudice, but it's also enshrined in systems and core institutions like the press.The press not only failed to be an unbiased arbiter of truth, but it also used its power to promote racist ideas, false narratives about Black America, and, perhaps most important, failed to cover stories that would have shined a bright light on the many injustices and horrors directed at African Americans.Historians, educators and the public at large depend on newspapers for an accurate, unbiased lens into our country's past and present."

When he got to Irving, Chappelle expressed real surprise that the NBA All-Star had gotten in trouble for endorsing ""some movie"" that had ""apparently, I don't know, some antisemitic tropes or something.

Six million innocent Jewish men, women and children were tortured and murdered in cold blood -- along with an untold number of Black victims -- but Irving publicly promoted (and then defended) a ""documentary"" that claims the Holocaust never happened, and that Jews made it up ""to conceal their nature and protect their status and power.""

As a result, Grant ordered the Treasury to temporarily suspend the sale of gold.Gould and Fisk also persuaded Daniel Butterfield, the assistant treasurer of the United States, to warn them if the government began to sell gold again.Seizing their opportunity, Gould and Fisk bought up as much gold as they could, effectively raising the price of the precious metal and, in turn, the value of their own gold supply.

Courts have routinely pointed to minor factual differences ᅳ for example,whether the victimwas lying down or sitting upright ᅳ in holding that a prior case was too dissimilar to put the officers on notice that they were acting unconstitutionally.But after last week's rulings, without noted dissents, the bar to relief may be so high that virtually no one can clear it. The unsigned opinion inRivas-Vellegas v. Corteslunasuggests that law enforcement officers will get a free ride until the Supreme Court itself weighs in to say which precise conduct is out of bounds.Not once but twice the justices wrote that, “even assuming” that an appeals court case “can clearly establish law” for civil rights violations, the court failed to identify such a case. The clear implication is that an appellate court case on point may no longer suffice to hold officers responsible. To drive their position home, the justices concluded: “Neither Cortesluna nor the Court of Appeals identified any Supreme Court case that addresses facts like the ones at issue here.”This is a sharp departure from the widely held assumption and practice that an analogous lower court case would be sufficient to alert officers that they were acting unlawfully.It's crazy enough to think that policing can be regulated by judicial decisions that,studies have shown, police officers rarely read or learn about anyway.

Wade must be overturned, Justice Alito reasoned, because the Constitution says nothing about a right to abortion and because such a right “was entirely unknown in American law” until the latter part of the 20th century.The draft opinion has the support of at least four of his colleagues,according to Politico: Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Barrett, the only woman in the majority. It brims with the swaggering confidence of a bloc that knows it has the votes to do whatever it wants.“Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,” the draft says. “It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives.”Of course the original Constitution says nothing about abortion, or about women at all."

The movement cametogetherin the 1970s not solely around abortion politics, as later mythmakers would have it, but around the outrage of the I.R.S. threatening to take away the tax-exempt status of church-led “segregation academies.” In 1979, Jerry Falwell said he hoped to see the day when there wouldn't be “any public schools ᅳ the churches will have taken them over again and Christians will be running them.”Today, movement leaders have their eye on the approximately $700 billion that federal, state, and local governments spend yearly on education."

Russo turns out to have been quite an understatement. It turns out that the door, with the chief justice holding it, opened wide enough to drive an entire federal appeals court through.Last week, the famously anti-abortion United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit invoked the chief justice's separate opinionto justify reinstatingfour Arkansas anti-abortion laws that a federal district judge hadinvalidatedmore than three years ago.The judge, Kristine Baker, had evaluated the four laws in light of two relevant Supreme Court precedents. One wasPlanned Parenthood v. Casey, the 1992 decision that established the “undue burden” standard that the court has applied to abortion regulations ever since. The court in Casey defined as an undue burden a regulation with “the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion.”The other, much more recent, precedent wasWhole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, a 2016 decision that struck down a Texas law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at local hospitals. While the law was clearly intended to force abortion providers out of business, Texas claimed to be protecting women's health. In his majority opinion, Justice Stephen Breyer weighed the claimed health benefit, which he found insubstantial, against the law's burden on access to abortion, which was demonstrable: While it was briefly in effect, the requirement had already forced half the state's abortion clinics to close. The comparison of benefit and burden showed, Justice Breyer concluded, that the burden met Casey's definition of “undue.”Justice Breyer also wrote the controlling opinion in the June Medical case this summer, striking down an identical admitting-privileges requirement in Louisiana."

TheFirst Amendmentsays, “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.”This is why virtually every official attempt to bar speech or news reporting in advance, known as a prior restraint, gets struck down. “Any system of prior restraints of expression comes to this court bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity,” the Supreme Court saidin a 1963 case. Such restraints are “the very prototype of the greatest threat to First Amendment values,” Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a generation later.On Friday, however, a New York trial court judge broke from that precedent when heissued an order blocking The Timesfrom publishing or even reporting further on information it had obtained related to Project Veritas, the conservative sting group that traffics in hidden cameras and fake identities to target liberal politicians and interest groups, as well as traditional news outlets.The order, a highly unusual and astonishingly broad injunction against a news organization, was issued by Justice Charles D.

You cansign up hereto receive it every weekday.My colleagues and I have been talking a lot lately about how distorted the American conversation about freedom has become ᅳ and even the American idea of freedom itself.Take the debate about achieving both economic vitality and public health. Surely everyone wants as much of both as possible.Yet a small but passionate and attention-snatching minority (with an assist from the White House) has managed to hijack what should be a conversation about figuring out the right balance. They've turned it into a cartoon, an either/or proposition in which even the suggestion that people should wear masks in public becomes a jack-booted assault on individual liberty, as my colleague Charlie Warzel wrote this week, drawinga compelling parallel to the warped debate over gun safety.This raises a deeper question: What does it really mean to be free?Before our office shut down and we all dispersed, one of the last editorial board meetings we held in person was with the prime minister of Finland, Sanna Marin. At 34, she's the youngest female prime minister in the world.She spoke about Finland's challenges in coping with climate change, immigration and a movement of people to cities that is hollowing out rural communities. Again and again, as she talked about sustaining political consensus to confront these challenges, she returned to the importance of the sense of security Finns feel because of their strong social safety net, including free health care and university.“It gives people freedom when you have a very strong welfare state,” she told us.That formulation stands the American politics of freedom on its head. Franklin Roosevelt may haveenvisionedfreedom from want, but in recent decades freedom here has come to mean freedom from taxes, freedom from regulation, freedom from having to wear a mask in public. The American left has largely conceded the rhetoric and even the idea of freedom to the right.Told that some Americans look at Finland and fear socialism, the prime minister smiled. As neighbors of the Soviet Union, Finns had seen a socialist experiment up close and wanted no part of it. “We are an open-market society,” she said proudly.Our columnist Nicholas Kristof, in adeeply reported explorationof the Nordic model, had the brilliant idea to look at what it's like to work for McDonald's in Denmark."

As Conservatism Inc. became more of a world unto itself, it sealed out bad news for conservative governance, contributing to debacles that doomed Republican presidents ᅳ Iraq for George W. Bush, Covid for Donald Trump. These debacles helped make conservatism less popular, closer to a 45 percent than a 55 percent proposition in presidential races, a blocking coalition but not a governing one. And this in turn made the right's passionate core feel more culturally besieged, more desperate for “safe spaces” where liberal perfidy was taken for granted and the most important reasons for conservative defeats were never entertained.Such a system, predictably, was terrible at generating the kind of outward-facing, evangelistic conservatives who had made the Reagan revolution possible. There are threads linking Reagan to Donald Trump or William F. Buckley Jr. to Sean Hannity, as the right's liberal critics often note. But to go back and watch Reagan and Buckley is to see an entirely different approach to politics ᅳ missionary and confident, with a gentlemanly comportment that has altogether vanished.In its place today is a fantasy politics, a dreampolitik, that's fed by a deep feeling of grievance and dispossession.

NYTimes_Clean_2021_result_82,human,"After Thursday's rulings, there are fewer and fewer tools with which to fight voter suppression.In two disturbing rulings closing out the Supreme Court's term, the court's six-justice conservative majority, over the loud protests of its three-liberal minority, has shown itself hostile to American democracy.In one case,Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, the court has weakened the last remaining legal tool for protecting minority voters in federal courts from a new wave of legislation seeking to suppress the vote that is emanating from Republican-controlled states. In the other,Americans for Prosperity v. Bonta, the court has laid the groundwork for lower courts to strike down campaign finance disclosure laws and laws that limit campaign contributions to federal, state and local candidates.The court is putting our democratic form of government at risk not only in these two decisions but in its overall course over the past few decades.Let's begin with voting rights. In Brnovich, the court, in an opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito, held that two Arizona rules ᅳ one that does not count votes for any office cast by a voter in the wrong precinct and another that prevents third-party collection of absentee ballots (sometimes pejoratively referred to by Donald Trump and his allies as ballot harvesting) ᅳ do not violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.Section 2 is supposed to guarantee that minority voters have the same opportunity as other voters to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice. The evidence presented to the court showed that minority voters were much more likely to have their votes thrown out than white voters for out-of-precinct voting and that Native Americans ᅳ because many live on large reservations ᅳ were less likely to vote in the absence of help with ballot collection.That the conservative majority of justices on the Supreme Court found that these rules did not violate Section 2 is unsurprising. Compared to other laws making it harder to register and to vote, such as strict voter identification provisions, these were relatively tame. In fact, some voting rights lawyers wereunhappythat the Democratic National Committee pushed this case aggressively; minority voters have had some success using Section 2 in the lower courts, even getting the very conservative U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to strike down Texas' voter ID law, one of the strictest in the nation."

NYTimes_Clean_2021_result_171,human,"Justices have revealed another problem with the court's “shadow docket.”The Supreme Court has come under increasing scrutiny for its so-called shadow docket: rulings issued on an expedited basis without the full briefing, argumentation and written opinions that cases on its main docket receive. These rulings are often divided along partisan lines, as seen in a recent, and controversial, example: the conservative majority's rejection of a request in September to pause a Texas abortion law until it could be more fully reviewed.But an even more problematic aspect of the court's shadow docket has received scant attention. These are opinions being issued by justices when the Supreme Court rejects an appeal of a case from a lower court ᅳ what are called “cert denials,” or denial of petitions for certiorari.Since Congress gave the court discretion in the early 1900s over which appeals to review, cert petitions have multiplied to the point where roughly 1 percent are granted (it takes the vote of at least four justices to grant a petition). And since the denial of cert leaves the law in place as decided by the lower courts, it is not an exaggeration to say that most federal constitutional and statutory law is made by those courts.Perhaps this is why, off and on since the mid-20th century, certain justices have taken to issuing individual opinions in connection with cert denials (what I'll call “cert-denial opinions”). Typically the justice will object to the way the lower court applied the law or complain about how earlier Supreme Court decisions themselves created bad law and should be revised.Cert-denial opinions offer insights into the thinking of individual justices, but the practice of issuing them is rife with problems and should be largely abandoned.First, they have no legal effect and are mainly issued by justices today to promote their personal ideological agendas. Conservative justices frequently issue them to complain about how the law was applied in hot-button cases to either disfavor free speech, free religion or gun rights or to improperly favor abortion or L.G.B.T.Q."

Fish tend to reject the first 37 percent of possible partners no matter what, and then the first possible partner that comes along, who is better than all those that the fish rejected, is the partner the fish chooses. Fry relates that to patterns we see in human nature, namely, we play the field into our late 20's and then we choose a partner and settle down.So, for example, if you believe you are most likely going to have 10 love partners in your future, you should reject the first 4, and marry the next love partner that comes along who is better than the first four. Or if you believe you are going to have 20 love partners, you should reject the first 8 and marry the ninth person.As Fry so aptly puts, it is a fine balance between having the patience to wait for the right person and the foresight to cash in before all the good ones are taken."

But it's not exactly a departure.Harvey Weinstein, the universally accepted villain of the #MeToo movement, is a sinner, not a rapist, his defense attorney Donna Rotunno told Gayle King in atelevised interviewlast September. Asked about her strategy in his criminal trial on charges of sexual assault and rape, set to begin on Monday, Ms. Rotunno offered an advance peek. There are always “blurred lines” and “an area of gray” between men and women in sexual circumstances, she said. And memory can be faulty “years later.” But she's confident the evidence will exonerate her client.Over 80 women have made public accusations against Mr. Weinstein; on Monday, he was charged in Los Angeles with four counts of sexual assault. In the post-#MeToo court of public opinion there are many for whom a charge sheet this extensive demands an automatic guilty verdict. In the courts of New York State, however, where due process prevails and there are only two official accusers, the outcome is less certain.Here's what we know so far: One accuser alleges that Mr. Weinstein overpowered and raped her in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013; the other that he forced oral sex on her in 2006. It appears that three additional women will be allowed to testify as “prior bad acts” witnesses to bolster the prosecution's case. So will the actress Annabella Sciorra, who claims that Mr. Weinstein overpowered and raped her in the 1990s.All indications are that this trial will raise a lot of messy questions about the nature of sexual consent.Dozens of emailsfrom one of the accusers to Mr. Weinstein ᅳ affectionate in tone and extending for years after her alleged rape ᅳ have already been made public. Be prepared for testimony about physical force to be countered by attacks on all the accusers' credibility.“You had a choice, and you made a choice”: That's how Ms. Rotunno put it in the September interview, as if previewing her cross-examination tactics. She seemed to be addressing the entire #MeToo movement as well, at least those who, she says, blame men for their choices."

Wade majority was discussing how best to structure the opinion Justice Blackmun was working on. The chief justice was trying to delegitimize the place of fetal viability in the court's abortion jurisprudence, where for nearly 50 years, viability has been the unbreached firewall protecting the right of a woman to choose to terminate a pregnancy.“It's an unfortunate source, but it's there,” he said, referring to Justice Blackmun's papers, on file and open to the public at the Library of Congress. “In his papers, Justice Blackmun said that the viability line was ᅳ actually was dicta.”“Dicta” is a dismissive word that refers to asides in an opinion that are not actually part of the court's holding. The entry in the Blackmun papers to which the chief justice was most likely referring was a memo of Nov. 21, 1972 that the author of Roe v. Wade sent along with a new draft opinion to the other justices, noting: “In its present form it contains dictum but I suspect that in this area some dictum is indicated and not to be avoided.”In that memo, of course referring to what was still a work in progress, Justice Blackmun proposed that the right to abortion be fully protected only until the end of the first trimester of pregnancy."

CNN_Clean_2020_result_11,human,"(CNN) -- As if Donald Trump's irresponsibility was not already a national tragedy, the White House seems now to favor a controversial approach to Covid-19 that threatens to bring nothing less than mass suffering.More than 216,000 Americans have already died. Yet on Tuesday, senior Trump administration officials said that they were receptive to pursuing ""herd immunity,"" an approach touted by a group of scientists who have put out what they call the ""Great Barrington Declaration."" The idea is that the federal government should let the pandemic run its course until most of the population is infected and has ostensibly developed antibodies to ward off future infections. Typical estimates hold that 70% or more of the population would thereby become infected.According to this idea, vulnerable groups would be targeted for ""focused protection,"" for example, introducing extra precautions such as frequent Covid-19 testing to avoid infections of the elderly living in nursing homes. The rest of the population ""should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal,"" according to the declaration.This approach runs strongly against the overwhelming consensus of public health specialists, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The new Covid-19 approach would undoubtedly add massively to the suffering in the US in a very short period of time.The idea that we should not try to control infections other than of vulnerable groups is based on a complete misunderstanding of the real choices facing the US -- or facing any country for that matter. The core mistake is the belief that the only alternative to an economic shutdown is to let the virus spread widely in the population. Instead, a set of basic public health measures is enough, as many other countries have shown, to control the spread of the virus."

foxnews_opinion_foxnews_opinion_2020_result_244,human,"Senators question Amy Coney Barrett on her stance on the Affordable Care Act.Senate Democrats want the Supreme Court confirmation hearings ofJudge Amy Coney Barrettto be all about ObamaCare and, more specifically, its protections for those with preexisting health care conditions.Senate Judiciary CommitteeRanking Member Dianne Feinstein said as much in the hearings Tuesday.That's because in a few weeks, theSupreme Courtwill hear arguments in California v. Texas, a lawsuit about the constitutionality of ObamaCare. Democrats argue, therefore, that a vote for Barrett is a vote to get rid of the law.But, asJudge Barrett correctly noted, ObamaCare's preexisting condition protections aren't at issue before the Supreme Court in the case. Nor are the law's limits on the lifetime maximum benefits that people may receive through health plans, as Senator Feinstein tried to suggest in her questioning.JEREMY DYS: AMY CONEY BARRETT'S NOMINATION WON'T BE DERAILED BY DEMOCRATS' POLITICAL THEATERDemocrats are trying to mislead Americans into believing that the most politically popular elements of ObamaCare are at risk while at the same time using some faulty assumptions to make their arguments.The key issue on which the Court's decision in California v. Texas will hinge is whether, if ObamaCare's individual mandate is deemed unconstitutional, it can be cut away from the rest of the ACA, leaving the rest of the law to stand. Put another way, the Court can deem the mandate unconstitutional but still allow the remainder of the ACA to remain.Why is the Supreme Court even hearing this case? Because in 2012, it upheldᅳin a decision written by Chief Justice John Robertsᅳthe constitutionality of ObamaCare's individual mandate as a permissible exercise of Congress' taxing authority. But in 2017, Congress passed a tax reform law that zeroed out the tax penalty associated with violating ObamaCare's individual mandate.A coalition of states led by Texas then challenged the law, arguing that because there was no longer a tax penalty associated with the mandate, ObamaCare no longer passed constitutional muster. And, because the individual mandate is integral to how ObamaCare works, if it is struck down, so too must the entire law.Judge Barrett has indeed been critical of the rationale the Supreme Court used to uphold the law in 2012.She argued in a recent law review piece that Roberts' decision “pushed [ObamaCare] beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.” But the constitutionality of the individual mandate isn't even the key legal issue at play in the current case before the Supreme Court. And this issue alone will not determine whether the rest of ObamaCare is allowed to stand.The key issue on which the law's future will hinge is whether, if the individual mandate is indeed deemed unconstitutional, it can be cut away from the rest of ObamaCare, leaving it to stand.In some cases, Congress directly states its intention for a law to remain, even when one of its parts is found unconstitutional. But, in others, Congress does not speak on this issue or is otherwise unclear.As Judge Barrett noted in her confirmation hearing Monday, a legal doctrine known as ""severability"" holds the key to understanding what the Supreme Court does under these circumstances.Severability has come to mean that courts do what they can to save statutes, not invalidate them. In fact, the Court considers settled the idea that, in the words of a decision that goes back to the late nineteenth century, “one section of a statute may be repugnant to the Constitution without rendering the whole act void.”The solution, as noted in a 2010 decision, is to “limit the solution to the problem, severing any problematic portions while leaving the remainder intact.” Thus, even if a future Justice Barrett were to rule the individual mandate unconstitutional, the weight of past precedent would make it difficult for her to find the rest of the ACA invalid.What's more, there is no evidence that Barrett would abandon this traditional viewᅳneither in her decisions during her brief time on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, nor in her scholarly writings before that.In fact, Barrett actually considered the issues at play in the California v. Texas case last month, when she participated as a judge at a mock court hearing of the case at William & Mary Law School. While the mock hearing was explicitly branded as a “role-playing activity” and nothing more, Barrett voted against the states that are arguing the entire law should be struck down."

CNN_Clean_2021_result_87,human,"() -- At first glance, President Joe Biden's executive order revoking the 1,200-mile Keystone XL pipeline cross-border permit may seem to be a symbolic bone throw to the environmental community. After all, the once cause célèbre pipeline project is much less economically viable now than when it launched 12 years ago and oil was at $100 per barrel. But quashing Keystone XL matters in two underappreciated and important ways.First, Biden's reversal of the cross-border permits for the pipeline kicks off a regulatory onslaught on the petroleum industry's value chain, with unprecedented breadth, assertiveness and tangible investment impacts. Though this reversal won't damage the oil industry much, and it isn't absolutely essential to American oil right now, there are long-term consequences to this decision.When oil prices next boom (and trust me, they will), investors will resume interest in pipeline projects and whoever is in the White House may regret Keystone XL's cancellation because the United States will have to rely more on less stable trading partners for oil.The aggressive and broad regulatory onslaught kicked off by Biden's Keystone XL cancellation will prove that he is not kidding around when it comes to climate policy. The President is recruiting an extensive, experienced and motivated team of environmental policy officials adept at wielding the executive branch's regulatory power. The well-planned campaign will feature conventional steps like federal leasing and permitting bans, including the temporary moratorium placed on oil and gas leasing in the Arctic, more stringent methane regulations and more expensive and time-consuming environmental reviews. Since nearly all require federal permits, pipelines especially are in the crosshairs, with the Dakota Access Pipeline being the next potential target if the courts don't shut it down first.The Biden administration will also open other new fronts against the petroleum sector. It will deploy environmental justice policies to give disadvantaged communities or indigenous groups located near energy projects a virtual veto power over projects near their lands, such as the Standing Rock Sioux's opposition to the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline."

It may not seem a lot, but per month it is worth about £10 to a worker taking home £1,000 on top of their current £40 pension contribution. This is great for the low paid but anyone paying higher rate tax needs to notify HMRC to get the extra tax relief by eg an adjustment to their tax code. Crucially an employer has to operate the same rule for all employees.It will come as no surprise to the cynical that most employers choose the first option."

That this was not the case at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust is manifestly a deep regret, but equally should not be an unexpected finding.Alistair VincentBarnet, LondonLow caesarian section (CS) rates are not a sign of good maternity care. The idea that vaginal delivery is superior to CS has been abandoned by the World Health Organisation (WHO), which does not recommend an ideal CS rate. Since 2015, WHO policy has been that, “every effort should be made to provide caesarean sections to women in need, rather than striving to achieve a specific rate”.There is no empirical evidence for an optimum rate of CS. Some of the increase in CS rates is attributable to women's choice - a welcome manifestation of female empowerment.Individual care, not artificial targets, should be the aim in pregnancy.Dr John DohertyStratford-upon-AvonBluster blows the house downMore than 20 years ago, Boris Johnson was telling lies and half truths about the EU."

You may be uncomfortable with the programme, but these are gratuitous insults, not borne out by the facts. On what basis does Mr Alston assert that ""no one is in charge"" at the ABC?I would like to lay down some markers in this debate.Critics of the ABC from the centre right do themselves and their cause a disservice when they diminish the role the broadcaster plays in Australia's civil discourse and when they fail to recognise important change already under way.While Nick Cater describes the ABC's five-year plan as ""ominously named"", it specifically calls for the decentralisation and diversification of many of the ABC's functions. These broad goals are consistent with Buttrose's acknowledgment early in her term of the potential for unconscious bias. Much work is being done to address it.It is not true there are no conservative voices at the ABC (although there could be more) and the assertion there are no conservative producers is without evidence.It would be helpful if columnists in some of the News Limited publications would deal with their own ideological concerns rather than prosecuting their publisher's commercial agenda. The suggestion the ABC should keep out of the business of news has no constituency in the Parliament and was decisively rejected by the inquiry into competitive neutrality. That such a suggestion can be made by the Menzies Centre is breathtaking.The ABC is part of the ""settlement"", a broad consensus across all major parties as to the type of Australia we all want.

He anchored his banter with a steady stream of invective, by turns promoting xenophobia, racism, homophobia and misogyny, teeing up a ready-made audience for the cruelty politics of Donald Trump.But perhaps one of Mr. Limbaugh's most significant and longest-lasting impacts, and one that will persist even if the party returns to a post-Trump “normal,” stemmed from his loud opposition to women's rights: He was the right wing's misogynist id.His belligerent chauvinism was key in making the Republican Party the party of anti-feminism. Cracking open his slobbering hatred of women allows insight into his success, as well as the perversion of the party he championed.Mr. Limbaugh burst on the national scene in the late 1980s during a national anti-feminist backlash and as the Republican Party was completing its turn away from libertarianism and toward the religious right. While he often gave rhetorical nods to the “pro-family” traditional values of the Moral Majority, he didn't adopt its veneer of propriety ᅳ he was positively lascivious in his rhetoric, using ugliness and shock to promote embittered and unvarnished sexism, and he saw a world of opportunity in the party."

After a decade of intrusive leak probes,including threeat the end of the Trump administration that swept inBarbara Starr's records at CNNas well as those of journalists at The New York Times and The Washington Post, Attorney General Merrick Garlandissued a new ruleprohibiting subpoenas and other types of legal processes against the press in all but narrow circumstances.For the first time, the new policy defines a lane of total protection for journalism -- where the department has almost entirely relinquished its discretion to use investigative tools against the press despite the power to do so handed to it by the courts. That's historic.Under the previous policy, whichdates back to 1970, federal prosecutors could ask the attorney general for permission to obtain records from a journalist if theyasserted that the investigative need was strong enough. It was a so-called balancing test, pitting First Amendment protections against the interests of prosecutors.Now, when journalists receive, possess and publish government secrets, prosecutors may not use subpoenas, court orders or search warrants to obtain their records or compel their testimony. Theonly exceptionsare when not doing so presents an imminent threat to life or limb or other bona fide emergencies (with an attorney general approval requirement), and when journalists are asked to verify publicly reported information."

Such perception leaves many African women on the fringes of the financial sector---unable to save, borrow, or build capital.Worldwide, women's access to finance is disproportionately low. Despite substantial overall progress---in 2017, the World Bank reported, 1.2 billion more people had bank accounts than in 2011---there is still a 9% gap between women's and men's access. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 37% of women have a bank account, compared with 48% of men, a gap that has only widened over the past several years. The figures are even worse in North Africa, where about two-thirds of the adult population remains unbanked and the gender gap for access to finance is 18%, the largest in the world.These striking figures raise urgent questions for decision makers in Africa."

But, as usual, the conventional wisdom skims the surface, focusing on the obvious: his steering of the court toward a center comfortablyaligned with public opinion, and protecting it from an institutionally destructive alliance with a president who assumed the court would do his bidding.I'm among those who celebrate these outcomes, and I don't in any way mean to diminish them. Rather, I want to suggest that the 2019-20 Supreme Court term looks even more consequential, for the country and the chief justice, when his triumph is seen in full, in its multiple dimensions.To do that requires looking closely at the three religion cases decided at the end of the term.InEspinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue,the court held that a state that offers a subsidy to private schools can't exclude religious schools from the benefit. InOur Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru, the court ruled that the federal laws that protect workers from discrimination don't apply to the lay employees of religious schools who have a role in “educating and forming students in the faith.” And inLittle Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania, the court excused employers, including corporations, with a “sincerely held” religious or “moral” objection to birth control from having to take even a modest arm's-length step that results in an employee receiving coverage for contraception, to which the Affordable Care Act entitles her.Chief Justice Roberts wrote the majority opinion in only the first of these cases; he assigned the opinion in the second to Justice Samuel Alito and the third to Justice Clarence Thomas. While the first two involve the First Amendment's guarantee of the “free exercise” of religion, the third, concerning a rule put in place by the Trump administration, is not based on the Constitution but rather on administrative law and a federal statute.But the decisions' commonalities are more important than their differences."

NYTimes_Clean_2021_result_90,human,"A clash among justices over what constitutes the right to vote mirrors the partisan divide on the question.The Voting Rights Act decision that concluded the Supreme Court term this month offered two mutually exclusive visions of what the right to vote means today.Justice Samuel Alito's opinion for the six-justice majority insisted that the law should pay little mind to the occasional “inconvenience” of casting a ballot. Justice Elena Kagan's dissenting opinion, joined by two other justices, accused the majority of taking the “grand and obvious” right to an “equal opportunity to vote” and reducing it to nothing more than “equality-lite.”The competing visions in theBrnovich v. Democratic National Committeedecision reflected profoundly different understandings of what law needs to do to keep the basic mechanics of democracy functioning. In that, it offered an almost perfect mirror of the partisan divide over the seemingly simple concept of the right to vote.All nine justices were working from the same text, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits any voting practice or procedure “which results in a denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color” and instructs courts to consider “the totality of circumstances” in deciding whether a challenged practice has such an effect.Even so, Justice Alito called Justice Kagan's interpretation of that language “radical”; Justice Kagan called his “tragic.” What could lead the two wings of the court to diverge so completely in interpreting that language?The case concerned two Arizona voting regulations, which the court upheld. But that wasn't what the dispute among the justices was really about or why the decision matters so much. The basic question was the meaning of the Voting Rights Act itself: what purpose it serves, what interests it protects.That this question could even arise 56 years after the law's enactment and 39 years after Section 2 was significantly amended reflects the fact that for most of its existence, Section 2 was almost exclusively used in cases about the racial impact of redistricting, often referred to as “vote dilution” cases. A different part of the law, Section 5, was used for “vote denial” cases challenging regulations governing access to the polls.But the Supreme Court'sShelby County decisioneight years ago rendered Section 5 inoperative, leaving lower courts to fit vote-denial cases into the Section 2 framework without guidance from the Supreme Court."

United States, the Supreme Court will hear arguments from lawyers for the super-rich who contend that all forms of wealth taxation are unconstitutional. The case involves a narrow provision in the Republicans' 2017 tax overhaul, requiring payment on certain forms of wealth held abroad. When right-wing groups brought their case before the lower federal courts, they used this provision as a platform for a challenge to the very legitimacy of wealth taxation. In response, the 9th Circuit summarily dismissed their sweeping attack and upheld the constitutionality of the 2017 provision.Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has decided to take the case, leading thoughtful commentators to worry that it would try to block any future Congress from passing a statute requiring multimillionaires to pay a progressive wealth tax.If the Trump appointees join a conservative majority to blow up the existing constitutional consensus, however, they will be turning their backs on the passionate defenses of originalism they made before the Senate Judiciary Committee. They will also be raising fundamental questions about their commitment to democratic principles: What gives nine unelected justices the authority to protect the rich when a democratically elected president and Congress decide that progressive taxation is in the public interest?When it comes to adhering to originalist principles, the history is clear - as long as it's not cherry-picked.Quite simply, the Founders were not opposed to wealth taxes."

First, as the authors note, pulling all U.S. troops and intelligence assets from fragile conflict zones is a boon to globalized terror movements. Despite political promises, the full U.S. withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 and Afghanistan in 2021 did not “end” those wars; it transformed them into more complex and potentially more deadly challenges.Second, we must reckon with the underlying grievances that make violent anti-Western ideologies, including militant jihadism, attractive to so many in the first place. These include the ill effects of globalization, and a “rules-based” world order increasingly insensitive to the needs of developing countries and regions.Simply maintaining a military or intelligence presence in terror hot spots does nothing to reduce the sticky recruiting power of militant movements. Unless the United States and its allies and partners begin offering tangible policies that counter jihadi ideology and propaganda, we will just continue attacking the symptoms, not the causes.Stuart GottliebNew YorkThe writer teaches American foreign policy and international security at Columbia University.To the Editor:The Islamic State's territorial caliphate in Iraq and Syria may have been eliminated years ago, but as Christopher P.

ISIS-K, its branch in Afghanistan, has conducted two large-scale external attacks over the last two months ᅳ one in Iran that killed more than 80 people and another near Moscow that took the lives of more than 130.If the United States and its allies haven't found a way to defeat ISIS-K in its entirety, it's because terrorism itself is an enemy that can't be defeated in the traditional sense of the term. This is why the war on terror framework, initiated under the George W. Bush administration immediately after the 9/11 attacks, was such poor terminology.

In doing so, it is imperative that Israel not lose sight of long-term strategic national security objectives but instead seek to wipe out Hamas within a broader military and diplomatic strategy.For the long-term security of Israel,Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's governmentmust recognize that the extremism that fueled Hamas is part of a broader constellation of issues that are interconnected and that must be addressed for there to be a lasting peace in the region.Israel should avoid acting in isolation but rather develop a strategy that serves its larger regional and international objectives. These include securing the safe release ofmore than 230 hostages, protecting nearby alliances, building partnerships with additional nations (most notablySaudi Arabia) and working cooperatively and collaboratively with the United States and other countries as it seeks to eradicate Hamas.Netanyahu's creation ofa war Cabinetwas widely celebrated as a prudent step from a military point of view, but this entity, by design laser-focused on a military objective, risks being blind to the regional security imperatives vital to Israel's near and long-term survival. The Israeli people must demand that Netanyahu create a mechanism that ensures the government adequately weighs other regional cross currents.Specifically, the Israeli government must seek ways to eliminate Hamas without undermining its relationships with its Arab neighbors. Over several decades, these efforts have created vital relationships between Israel andJordan,Egypt,Bahrain,Morocco, theUnited Arab Emirates,QatarandSudan.And at least until October 7, significant diplomatic headway was being made toward anormalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia."

House Republicans cheered Johnson's victory, surely applauding as much from relief that the process was over as celebration of the man who won.The raft of would-be speakers came from across the country. They spanned the party's admittedly limited ideological range, and included both those who voted to overturn the 2020 presidential election and those who affirmed the legitimate winner (Johnson is in the former camp).But one thing united the dozen or so Republicans vying to lead the House: they were all men. The highest-ranking woman in the GOP, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, who currently serves as conference chair, spent the past three weekstweeting out her congratulationsto each of the four successive speaker-designates.Stefanik may have her own reasons for avoiding the speaker's chair, which has recently become more of a career-killer than a career highlight. But her absence, and the absence of any of the other Republican women in the House from the roster of potential speakers, calls attention to the party's overall woman problem. Over the last 15 years, women have been strategically visible in the party, but have received very little power in return.Consider the case of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, plucked from near-obscurity to join the Republican presidential ticket as a vice presidential candidate in 2008.

Yet she remained a favorite of the party's right-flank, emerging as a leader of the Tea Party movement after Barack Obama's election.Within a few years, however, she had faded into irrelevance.

Almost a year and a half into the war, it is critical to maintain our steadfast support for Ukraine, while working towards a just and lasting peace. One aspect of peace building will be holding Russian leadership accountable for its criminal aggression through a special international tribunal. Another aspect - the focus of this article - will be addressing Russia's internal repression, which is deeply intertwined with its external aggression.To support Russian democracy and peace, Canadians should stand up for courageous Russian citizens - activists, opposition politicians and jailed dissidents. One example of these brave critics is Moscow city councillor Alexei Gorinov, who is currently serving a seven-year sentence in one of Russia's most notorious prison camps, infamous for torture and inhumane treatment.Gorinov's ""crime""?

But the amount of spending and energy around this proposition, known as Issue 1, showed that both sides of the abortion question knewwhat was at stake.

At the same time, he outrageously proposes that what set the stage for the horrific displays of Hamas savagery was the failure of the international community over the years to support Palestinian nonviolent resistance, such as the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.This conveniently whitewashes the fact that many supporters of B.D.S. and other forms of Palestinian resistance reject Israel's very legitimacy and recognition of the Jewish right to nationhood. These activists see resistance as a means toward Israel's complete elimination, and call for a refusal to engage with Israel ᅳ all of which provide the backdrop to the bloody massacre of more than 1,400 Israelis, most of them civilians, on Oct. 7.What is needed now is a true commitment to nonviolence, one that speaks to viable peace, a recognition of Israel's right to exist and ultimately two peoples living side by side with security.Jonathan A. GreenblattNew YorkThe writer is C.E.O. and national director of the Anti-Defamation League.To the Editor:Peter Beinart's essay is an exemplary reflection of the appeals for compassion for the Palestinians that are coming from all sides, now that Israel is going after Hamas.Therefore it would be good to remind ourselves of what those who actually care about the Palestinians, and aren't just progressive poseurs, could do to help them in practical ways.First, they should put pressure on Arab states to allow the descendants of Palestinian refugees from 1948 to assimilate and be granted citizenship in their countries. Second, they should exert whatever influence they have on the Palestinian Authority finally to begin negotiating seriously to accept part of Palestine as an independent state and to live in peace with Israel. It may well be too late after the recent catastrophe, but better to try late than never.What happened just over a week ago clarifies who in fact cares about the well-being of the Palestinian people and who just uses the pose of compassion to denigrate Israel.Fred BaumannGambier, OhioThe writer is a professor of political science at Kenyon College.To the Editor:Peter Beinart presents a false dichotomy of Palestinian options for pursuing a state of their own ᅳ political pressure or terrorism ᅳ arguing that failing to gain traction in the former has led to the latter.But there's another avenue the Palestinians can try: accepting the legitimacy of the Jewish state and renouncing violence, two things the Palestinian leadership has failed to do time and time again during peace negotiations over the decades.Israelis want peace more than anything, and the recent events are a horrid reminder of its necessity, but they will never pursue it with a literal or political gun to their heads.Noam SafierTeaneck, N.J.To the Editor:Re “The U.S. Should Think Twice About Israel's Plans for Gaza,” by Rashid Khalidi (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, Oct. 15):In Professor Khalidi's telling, the Palestinians are always blameless victims without agency over their own behavior.

The Supreme Court's 6-3 decision, split along ideological lines, weakens the rights of the LGBTQ community and potentially opens the door to broader discrimination.Although Smith had not begun creating her bespoke webpages, she planned to offer her services to the general public. Even thoughColorado law bans discriminationon the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, Smith made clear that she would not create webpages for same-sex marriages.The majority of the court, in an opinion authored by Justice Neil Gorsuch, concluded that because her webpage designs were expressive, Smith was protected by the First Amendment and thus exempt from Colorado's anti-discrimination law. The non-discrimination protections, in the majority's view, would compel speech from Smith that contradicted her opposition to same-sex marriage. Colorado's interest in creating a non-discriminatory commercial marketplace was insufficient to trump Smith's free speech rights.The majority gestured to the importance of non-discrimination in places of public accommodation, noting that there is a compelling interest in eliminating discrimination in these contexts. The court nevertheless concluded that public accommodations laws are not exempt from the limits of the First Amendment, and Smith's free speech rights trumped the state's non-discrimination interests.Although many view 303 Creative LLC v.

Israel and the US are being circumspect, because if they do find a smoking gun, if they make the accusation, that could amount to a casus belli, a justification for war, and they don't want another head-on confrontation at this moment. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei praised Hamas for the operation but, perhaps betraying some anxiety,publicly deniedinvolvement in the attacks.And yet, this war could end up turning into a triumph for Tehran, a fervently fundamentalist, anti-Western dictatorship that has threatened to destroy Israel and has workedto encircle itwith a ring of militant organizations in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria, all the whiledepriving its own peopleof many basic rights.The goals of Hamas, whose founding charter commits it to thedestruction of Israel,align neatly with those of Iran'stheocracy."

He points to legal sources expressing this protection that range from the Federalist Papers to the seminal Supreme Court case of Nixon v. Fitzgerald. It established an extremely deferential rule of immunity, holding that a president is immune for any actions arguably falling within the scope of his official duties, so long as they are not outside the ""outer perimeter"" of those job responsibilities as president.Trump hasalso claimedthat the federal executive branch has the responsibility to make sure federal elections are lawful. Accordingly, as the head of that branch, he was overseeing an unquestioned federal power in his conduct surrounding the 2020 election and therefore may not be prosecuted under the principles of presidential immunity. Or so theargumentgoes.Not so fast, prosecutors have argued in theirbrief, supported by an excellentamicus submissionfrom former judges and other legal experts. They point out that the Fitzgerald case was a civil matter, where the stakes are much less and the rules are different. Criminal cases are reserved for the most serious misconduct in our judicial system, and neither Fitzgerald nor any other has ever created the kind of blanket presidential criminal immunity Trump seeks.In our view, the government has the better argument.

Shortly after the Republicans lost their U.S. Senate majority in the 1986 election, Democrats redoubled their efforts to terminate Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.It was a destabilizing waste of money, they claimed. They argued on one hand that it cost too much, and it wouldn't work anyway, and on the other hand, if it did work, it would increase the likelihood of a life-ending nuclear war.But with Israel's advances in defense technology, combined with its location in a dangerous neighborhood, a bipartisan argument could be made that Israel would benefit from the development of anti-missile technology while America would benefit from Israel's testing data and lessons learned. Thus was born Israel's Arrow anti-ballistic missile system.It's important to note at the time that Arrow had its critics in both America and Israel. Aside from Biden and the largely anti-defense left, the Israeli Air Force was skeptical, fearing a diversion of resources from its ability to deter attacks on Israel through what was euphemistically called ""preemptive diplomacy"" ᅳ the threat of first strikes to destroy emerging dangers.But Israel's Ministry of Defense believed that an effective anti-missile defense would blunt the destruction of an enemy surprise attack, allowing Israel the luxury of not having to conduct diplomatically costly preemptive strikes.

For as carefully as investigators scrutinized every court employee who had access to the draft opinion, the report is silent about whether nine specific individuals who had the means to leak the opinion were questioned: the Supreme Court justices.That silence is significant. In releasing the report, the justices may have hoped to move beyond the ugly finger pointing andloss of trustthat the leak incited.

He lied to then-Vice PresidentMike Penceabout a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador before the Trump administration had assumed office, and he was defenestrated from the White House within three and half weeks, earning him the distinction of being theshortest-serving US national security adviser ever.Flynn also lied to FBI officials about those discussions with the Russian ambassador and later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, but Trumppardoned himas he left office in late 2020.Around this time, Flynn became part of a cabal of advisers to Trump who were trying to overturn the 2020 election during his final days in office. In an interview Flynn gave toNewsmax TV, he advocated seizing voting machines from around the US and deploying the military in swing states that had voted for Joe Biden.At awild meetingat the White House with Trump on December 18, 2020, Flynn again called for the seizure of voting machines. For a decoratedthree-stargeneral who had once sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution, it seemed that Flynn had gone over the edge.Today, Flynn has also reinvented himself as a star of the Christian nationalist right and regularly tours the country as a headliner with the ""ReAwaken America Tour.

It's also impossible not to wonder how this latest serious health issue affects his ability to serve in the Senate.Perhaps the best way to tackle those questions is to look back a half century, to another moment when the politics of mental health loomed over a major political figure. It's a story that provides encouragement - and uncertainty - to those who want to see the freshman Democrat remain at his post.On July 25, 1972, Missouri Sen. Thomas Eagleton - newly chosen as George McGovern's running mate - disclosed that he had been treated three times for ""exhaustion"" and ""depression"" and had received psychiatric care and electric shock treatment. McGovern, the Democratic presidential nominee, expressed full support for his running mate - ""1,000 percent"" in an ill-chosen phrase - but a week later dropped him from the ticket.

We have since learned, from novelist William Styron and from CBS Correspondent Mike Wallace, among others, that depression can stalk the successful, the high achievers, the famous.

Why there is more, or even worse, police violence against rebellious - but usually defenseless - young men of Arab or non-Western descent.But the stunning disorder that's plagued France in recent days is coming from a different place from what we've seen before. There is now a sense of humiliation and dispossession that crisscrosses French society, that transcends the banlieues, and transforms today's riots into a display of shared and paroxysmic frustration. That should be deeply worrying, not just for President Emmanuel Macron, but for democratic leaders across the West.Let's return to 2005. Those riots were sparked after two young men were chased to their death by police, and the conversation quickly focused on the fate of the banlieues. Mathieu Kassovitz's film La Haine had come out a decade before, and in many ways still set the conversational parameters around such events. It is through the lens of Kassovitz's rendition of race relations and the alienation of youth in the banlieues, in combination with then-Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy's rhetoric around ""cleaning up the riffraff"" in those very neighborhoods that the three-week rampage was interpreted.This time, the riots followed the point-blank police shooting of 17-year-old Nahel Merzouk after a car chase. The cost of the riots in a mere week - over $1 billion in damages to businesses - towers above that of 2005, but perhaps more notable is that the discussion of the banlieues has receded, or is mediated through, the lens of the police. (In fact, this echoes a different French film, Ladj Ly's 2019 crime thriller Les Miserables; the last prophetic image is of a young boy beside himself with trauma and anger brandishing a Molotov cocktail in the face of a cop with a gun.)"

These include securing the safe release ofmore than 230 hostages, protecting nearby alliances, building partnerships with additional nations (most notablySaudi Arabia) and working cooperatively and collaboratively with the United States and other countries as it seeks to eradicate Hamas.Netanyahu's creation ofa war Cabinetwas widely celebrated as a prudent step from a military point of view, but this entity, by design laser-focused on a military objective, risks being blind to the regional security imperatives vital to Israel's near and long-term survival. The Israeli people must demand that Netanyahu create a mechanism that ensures the government adequately weighs other regional cross currents.Specifically, the Israeli government must seek ways to eliminate Hamas without undermining its relationships with its Arab neighbors. Over several decades, these efforts have created vital relationships between Israel andJordan,Egypt,Bahrain,Morocco, theUnited Arab Emirates,QatarandSudan.And at least until October 7, significant diplomatic headway was being made toward anormalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia."

Valuing fetal life over the lives of women and girls was no doubt a feature, not a bug, in the majority's view; that was, after all, the point of Dobbs.And Justice Alito himself was well aware of the pair of flag-salute cases. He invoked West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette in an effort to show that overruling precedent has a noble lineage. He fudged the point, however, in his bland description of what had impelled the court's reversal in 1943, saying only that “Barnette stands out because nothing had changed during the intervening period other than the court's belated recognition that its earlier decision had been seriously wrong.”For Barnette to be useful to Justice Alito, he had to make it stand for “nothing had changed” because during the 50 years between Roe v. Wade and Dobbs, nothing really did change. Nothing, that is, except the steady accumulation of justices put on the court by presidents who had pledged, in the Republican Party platform that all the party's presidential candidates ran on from 1980 to 2020, to appoint judges and justices who would overturn Roe. Finally, on last June 24, there were enough of them.Another difference between Barnette and Dobbs is that the three justices who changed their minds after the first flag-salute case were motivated by facts, not by ideology or by passing a nomination litmus test. Justices Hugo Black, William O. Douglas and Frank Murphy were appointees of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who it's safe to assume during the early 1940s had other concerns than how his appointees might vote on whether children could be compelled to salute the flag. Donald Trump, by contrast, announced during his presidential campaign that his Supreme Court appointees would overturn Roe v. Wade “automatically.” All three of his nominees, Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett, did just that when the moment arrived.So no, I don't think the Dobbs justices are sorry."

Not because Thomas has secretly become a liberal squish, but because the case only got to the Supreme Court because of a truly preposterous ruling by the Fifth Circuit - the court that hears all federal appeals from Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.Instead, the real headline from Thursday is not that the Supreme Court is more ""moderate"" than its critics often claim; it's that there's a court of appeals that is even more extreme - not just in this case, but in10 other casesthe Supreme Court will decide this term.The specific question in Thursday's case involved the scope of Congress' power to appropriate funds for the operation of federal executive branch agencies. As opposed to a direct, annual appropriation (for example, ""the Food and Drug Administration is appropriated the sum of $100 million for 2025""), Congress funds some agencies, including the CFPB, by authorizing them to draw funds from the Federal Reserve in whatever amount the agency deems ""reasonably necessary to carry out"" its duties, subject only to an annual cap.So instead of yearly statutes that appropriate X dollars to an agency, Congress has provided agencies like the CFPB with open-ended authority to spend up to Y dollars.The stakes of this case were enormous.

They understood the importance of fostering a continent-wide economy as diversified across industries as it was across regions. And so they kept our banks focused onMain Street production, notWall Street speculation.This began changing during the 1980s and 1990s, when Congress repealed all previousinterstate banking and branching restrictions, as well as the oldGlass-Steagall prohibitionson mixing productive lending in the real economy with financial speculation on Wall Street. We were left with a banking system ever more nationally concentrated.To end, and perhaps even partly reverse, this ongoing process of concentration, which recent bank failures since March have accelerated, Congress must pass legislation that lifts deposit insurance caps.Regional, community and sector-specific industrial banks like Silicon Valley Bank lent ""patient capital"" to startups and small businesses - the incubators of future industrial renewal. In other words, the banks were willing to wait years before expecting their startup borrowers to turn profits - essential in industries that require time to scale up before they can become profitable.They stood ready to fuel the new growth where it was needed, knowing as they did both the special needs of their clients in particular sectors - like tech, for example - and economic conditions in the locales where their clients did business.Capped deposit insurance is now destroying these banks.Federal deposit insurance coverage is currently limited to $250,000. That would be plenty for you and me, but the startups and other small businesses on which our industrial recovery depends have large payrolls and weekly operating expenses.

Facing close to $600 million in legal judgments, Trump, who has spent decades bragging about his wealth, is facing a financial crisis.To his critics, the thinking is thatany obstacle in Trump's path puts him further from the presidency and so, makes the country safer. In this case, however, the opposite may be true.The former, and perhaps future, president looks like he is on the financial ropes, and that makes him potentially even more dangerous. He urgently needs cash - lest he be forced to give up some of his trophy properties to satisfy the courts. That pressing need could make him vulnerable to anyone offering to help him out of his troubles, including America's enemies and rivals.It was Trump himself who highlighted the governing conflicts that could emanate from depending on other people's money. Boasting, as he always has, of being fabulously rich, he told the 2016 voters that his campaign, unlike that of his rival, wascompletely self-funded."

This was also the case when my children applied to college in the late 1970s and early 1980s.But this past year, my grandchildren could apply to up to 20 colleges via the Common Application (although on average students apply to around six colleges).

According to March polling from Ipsos, immigration attitudes are now a litmus test for both parties.Opposition is the sine qua non of Trumpism, which has singularly devoted itself to turning back the onward march of demographic and social change. And while openness to immigration is certainly a prerequisite for Democratic politics, because of the issue's intractability and its capacity to mobilize conservatives, many center-left leaders avoid it altogether. Democrats made barely any effort to alter the nearly four-decade policy status quo when they had full control of Congress and the White House the previous two years, and zero prospects for action are on the horizon.It's time for immigration reform advocates to start over.It won't be easy, but new research shows that breaking the stalemate is possible. Doing so will require a fundamentally different approach for activists and their allies - one focused on addressing the concerns of the white, often working-class, skeptics while disarming the forces of nativism.The polarization of immigration policy along party lines is the greatest barrier to compromise and progress in Washington.When comprehensive immigration reforms were passed in 1986, immigration was a third-tier - not third-rail - issue, with truly bipartisan support and relatively little public interest."

It's not just the top-line finding that the president is trailing in key battleground states including Nevada, Arizona and even Michigan, where Biden is down by 5 percentage points to Trump in a state he won bynearly 3 pointsin 2020.According to the Times, the multiracial coalition that powered Biden to victory is ""fraying,"" with support falling among Black and Hispanic voters. Biden also is seeing a drop in support among voters under 30.And on the economy - an issue that is often the key metric in determining a president's reelection prospects - the polling finds ""the largest gap of any issue,"" with 59% of voters to 37% saying they trust Trump over Biden to handle economic matters.You might be asking then: Why not panic?"

""The Cathedral only knew that family and friends were requesting a funeral Mass for a Catholic and had no idea our welcome and prayer would be degraded in such a sacrilegious and deceptive way.

With roughly 15 million pigs sold each year, Minnesota is the second largest pork producing state in the nation.As of Jan. 1, new animal welfare legislation known as Proposition 12 took full effect in California, impacting thousands of Minnesota hog farmers. Approved by California voters in 2018 and upheld by the Supreme Court in 2023, Prop 12 establishes minimum space allowances for egg-laying hens, breeding pigs and calves raised for veal. The law also prohibits the sale of meat and eggs from producers that do not comply with these requirements.As some Minnesota hog farmers adapt to Prop 12, we have an opportunity to reconsider conventional agricultural practices and raise the ethical standard for animal farming in our state.Many Minnesota hog farmers use gestation crates, which prevent breeding pigs from comfortably turning around or lying down for most of their lives. Under the new law, Minnesota hog farmers who choose to sell their pork products to California must provide each animal with a minimum of 24 square feet of floor space. According to recent reporting in the Star Tribune, Minnesota pork producers state that the costs to upgrade their facilities to comply with Prop 12 are significant.The extreme confinement of breeding pigs is just one of the many horrors of hog farming in Minnesota. Hogs are highly intelligent and emotional animals, but roughly 98% of pigs in the U.S. spend their lives confined to factory farms."

That's what Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville has been doing for months now, by blocking hundreds of senior military promotions in protest of the Pentagon's abortion access policy.But there were promising signs last week that that dam is near the breaking point, with several of Tuberville's frustrated fellow Republicans publicly demanding that he end it for the sake of military readiness. Some Democrats are now floating the idea of a temporary rule change that would effectively remove Tuberville's power to block the promotions.For passage, it would require a handful of Republicans to sign on. If they do, that would not only solve the dangerous problem at hand, but would demonstrate to the nation that, when it comes to national security, something resembling bipartisanship is still possible in Washington.Because the senior military promotions in question number more than 350, it's not feasible for the Senate to debate and vote upon them one by one, especially because there is virtually no opposition from either party to any of them.So such rounds of promotion are generally passed all at once, by what is called unanimous consent. Simply put, they all win passage automatically, unless some senator objects.For nine months now, Tuberville has been using that objection power to block unanimous consent of the promotions ᅳ not for any particular concerns about the military officials themselves, but over the unrelated issue of the Pentagon's abortion access policy.Following the U.S. Supreme Court's overturn last year of Roe v. Wade, numerous red states have outlawed abortion within their borders. This presents a dilemma for military personnel, who don't always have a choice as to where they are stationed. A female soldier posted in, say, Missouri, where abortion has been outlawed, would be effectively denied the same biological rights as soldiers stationed next door in Illinois, where abortion remains legal.The Pentagon has addressed that dilemma with a new policy that gives female soldiers leaves of absence and transportation reimbursement if they need to travel out of the state where they are stationed in order to legally obtain abortion services.Tuberville argues that this amounts to illegal government funding of abortion."

Under this test, gun control measures were constitutional only if the government could demonstrate those restrictions were “consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.” That was the most significant element of the Bruen case. Before Bruen, lower courts had struggled to establish a uniform legal test for evaluating gun restrictions, and the Supreme Court hadn't provided any clarity.Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion in a 6-3 decision split along ideological lines. He applied the text, history and tradition test by walking through the very complex, often contradictory, history of American gun laws to determine whether New York's restrictions had analogies with the colonial period or the periods after ratification of the Second Amendment and the 14th Amendment, which applied the Second Amendment to the states.

Both are systems of deeply held beliefs but one connects us to others in a way that is flesh and bone instead of words on paper and praxis. Ideology lives in theory and operation, whereas morality often exists in the flesh and experience of the human being. Morality and morals are closely linked, but what we often call “morals” is ideology in practice.All of these concepts are mutable and can change as societies and thoughts of humankind shift.What we once allowed as ideological people and under the morality we were brought up with before we learned to be critical and to examine more deeply seems to be undergoing a drastic shift in today's political climate."

The question at issue was whether the courts or government agencies should determine the meaning of ambiguous laws. The new ruling unsettles a 40-year-old understanding by shifting some of the power over these choices away from the executive branch. Many regulatory actions may now face a torrent of litigation.Chevron deference matters more than it should because Congress insists on passing so many ambiguous statutes. Lawmakers do this partly by accident, failing to think through how new regulations will work in practice, and partly by design, settling on muddled directives as a way to build coalitions and satisfy rival constituencies. In either case, their failure leaves the other branches of government to work out what the laws in question actually mean. Under the now-discarded Chevron doctrine, courts usually deferred to the wisdom of regulatory agencies ᅳ and, on the face of it, with good reason. Officials at the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, know a lot more about how to regulate pollution than do lawyers and judges. The problem is that the relevant statutes give the agencies such wide leeway that they can sometimes act as de facto lawmakers. Under Chevron deference, the agencies weren't required to show that their interpretation of the law was correct, or the best or most plausible interpretation ᅳ only that it was “reasonable.” Over time, agencies have become increasingly adept at widening this discretion and expanding what conservatives often deride as the administrative state.So it's no surprise that the court's conservative majority has overthrown the Chevron understanding ᅳ or that the liberal minority objected in such strident terms. In a dissent, Justice Elena Kagan wrote, “A longstanding precedent at the crux of administrative governance thus falls victim to a bald assertion of judicial authority.

The Sahan Journal recently covered the opioid crisis in Minnesota, validating the concerns we've received from our constituents. This crisis isn't unique to any state, district, city or neighborhood ᅳ and it is certainly far too prevalent in mine.As we search for potential legislative solutions in the coming session, I've kept my eye on a piece of federal legislation that could be a lifeline for seniors. The Alternatives to Prevent Addiction in the Nation (PAIN) Act is a bipartisan bill that would increase access for seniors to non-opioid pain management options in Medicare Part D. Not only would this bill create access to non-addictive opioid alternatives, it would also ensure that non-opioids would be the same price as a traditional opioid prescription.In everyday conversation, the term opioids is used to describe both illicitly manufactured drugs and prescribed pain relievers like hydrocodone. While opioids can be useful in treating persistent or severe pain, prescription opioids have proven to be a devastating plague on our nation because they are highly addictive. According to the American Medical Association, an estimated 3% to 19% of people who take prescription pain medications develop an addiction to them.While seniors aren't often associated with the opioid crisis, the group has been significantly impacted. In 2021, over one million seniors were diagnosed with an opioid use disorder and 50,000 seniors suffered an opioid overdose from prescription opioids, illicit opioids or both. Furthermore, overdose deaths among seniors have soared by more than 60% in the last decade.One of the features of the Alternatives to PAIN Act is that a concept known as step therapy would not apply to pain treatments. Step therapy mandates that before your plan will cover a certain drug, you must first try a different or less expensive drug that treats your condition. Given how cheap and accessible opioids are, it is necessary to ensure that they aren't the default or cheaper option for pain treatment when safer options are available.It's not just seniors who would benefit from the proposed law. On July 1, the Moran Company released a report suggesting that the treatment of Medicare beneficiaries with opioid use disorder costs $33 billion."

But in doing so it must stay true to its values by doing everything possible to minimize the suffering of innocent Palestinian residents of Gaza.That seemed to be President Joe Biden's message for Israelis when he spoke Wednesday in Tel Aviv, reminding his hosts that “the vast majority of Palestinians are not Hamas. Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people.”Biden expressed solidarity with the Israeli people and promised that he would ask Congress for “an unprecedented support package for Israel's defense.” He adroitly combined that statement of support with a gentle but unmistakable plea for Israel to achieve “clarity about the objectives and an honest assessment about whether the path you're on will achieve those objectives.” This is the appropriate role for the U.S. to play at this stage.The president recalled that after 9/11: “We were enraged in the United States. While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.”Israel should take that wise counsel to heart as it continues its campaign to destroy Hamas, which might soon involve an invasion of Gaza. Israeli air bombardment of the congested territory has killed at least 3,400 people, according to Gaza health authorities. That Israel does not target civilians is small comfort for the families of those killed or wounded.Nor can civilians be sure that relocating will spare them from harm. The New York Times reported this week that Palestinians who heeded an Israeli order to evacuate portions of the Gaza Strip and head south are enduring airstrikes even after they have moved.Biden also announced that Israel had agreed to allow humanitarian assistance to enter Gaza from Egypt. It's appalling that trucks laden with food and supplies have been stalled in Egypt near the Gaza border. He also promised an additional $100 million in humanitarian assistance for Gaza and the West Bank.The president had hoped on this visit to the Middle East to meet in Jordan with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Sisi.

Rightly, it uses a comprehensive definition of subsidy, combining outright support (spending that offsets production costs) and implicit support (underpricing for environmental harms and forgone tax revenue).Explicit subsidies have more than doubled since the previous assessment for 2020, to more than $1 trillion, thanks partly to efforts to soften the blow of higher energy prices after Russia attacked Ukraine. Implicit subsidies, some 80% of the total, surged as well ᅳ and unlike the explicit kind, they're on track to rise further, both in dollar terms and as a share of global output, by the end of the decade.One result of these enormous supports is that policies are often at cross-purposes. Keeping fossil fuels cheap offsets the other taxes, subsidies, and regulations governments use to reduce emissions and promote clean energy. In effect, with some of their policies, governments push fossil-fuel demand in the right direction; then, with generous subsidies for pollution and climate change, they push it back.The gap between efficient prices and actual prices is especially egregious in the case of coal ᅳ which is both a potent driver of global climate change and in many countries a main cause of local air pollution."

As the years have passed, I have watched many medical professionals come and go from my hometown, often only staying for one or two years before moving on. This is not only disheartening as a prospective employee, but discouraging and disruptive to all those patients within that health system. In a time when patients are more complex and comorbid than ever, continuity of care is beyond important. We know that rural America is no exception to this and, in fact, is more of the rule.So, what can we do to keep good doctors in small towns? The answer is complex, but the mission is not impossible.First of all, focusing attention on the bright, young, aspiring medical professionals early on should be at the top of the list. We know that practitioners who grew up in rural areas are much more likely to return to these areas and, most importantly, stay. Rural health systems should be using this to their full advantage, working with local high schools, community colleges, and even middle schools to foster connections early. Helping them achieve their goals will only increase their desire to pay it forward and work for the place that helped them become who they are.Secondly, rural health care institutions should not just focus on hiring the provider but must consider the provider and their entire family, as well."

Although the official start of spring is not until March 20, it is refreshing to experience longer periods of sunlight with Daylight Savings Time.Sights and sounds of nature present at spring remind me of encouraging Scripture that centers around the blessing of God's provision, the beauty of His creation and the assuredness of His sovereignty.
